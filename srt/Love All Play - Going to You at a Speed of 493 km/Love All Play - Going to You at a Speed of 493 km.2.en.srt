1
00:00:37,912 --> 00:00:40,915
GOING TO YOU AT A SPEED OF 493KM

2
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,586
THE PLACES, PEOPLE, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTIONAL

3
00:00:51,092 --> 00:00:52,260
Nice to meet you.

4
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:54,679
EPISODE 2

5
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:05,065
Did I come at a bad time?

6
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:06,816
Should I go?

7
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,193
What? No.

8
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:11,488
No, I'll go. I was about to anyway.

9
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:20,330
So… are we now on the same team?

10
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:23,583
What you're saying is that
we're on the same team, right?

11
00:01:25,668 --> 00:01:28,880
I'll be on the same team
as an athlete I've discovered.

12
00:01:28,963 --> 00:01:30,298
That feels a bit weird.

13
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:32,592
You said you quit.

14
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:34,844
You told me it wouldn't be easy
to leave the court.

15
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:36,554
You were right.

16
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,101
Then I'll see you later.

17
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:45,396
We'll see each other later
since we're on the same team. Right?

18
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:49,692
Bye.

19
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:53,988
Taeyang.

20
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:56,199
Who me?

21
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:01,913
Take your bag.

22
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:08,378
Right, that's mine.

23
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:10,380
I thought it was yours.

24
00:02:12,423 --> 00:02:13,800
So what I meant was…

25
00:02:13,883 --> 00:02:15,093
I'm looking forward to it.

26
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:19,139
Yeah, same here.

27
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,767
That's right. Here's General.

28
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:24,269
Take back your racket.

29
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:26,229
I promised to give it back
when you return.

30
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,731
Did you just call it General?

31
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:32,777
You can have it. I'm not taking it back.

32
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:37,407
All right.

33
00:02:44,205 --> 00:02:45,582
I should go.

34
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:54,549
Gosh.

35
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:04,475
Sunsoo!

36
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:06,686
Let me do it.

37
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,355
Do you do all the chores
as the youngest member?

38
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:12,734
Yes, I'm not the youngest, but I still do.

39
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:16,404
You can let me take the reins.
You know I'm an outcast.

40
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:20,283
I should do my fair share of work
so I can stand up for myself.

41
00:03:20,783 --> 00:03:21,868
Let's do it together, then.

42
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,120
I'm the loser on this team.

43
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:29,167
I guess a loser outranks an outcast.

44
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:45,683
Hurry up.

45
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:49,646
I told you to take turns,
but you get them to do everything.

46
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:54,484
All right. He's one of us from now on.

47
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:58,321
You know each other already, but…

48
00:03:58,404 --> 00:03:59,697
Still, it's your first day.

49
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:01,532
Introduce yourself.

50
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:07,956
I love you!

51
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,960
Yunis is the best! We rock!

52
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:15,421
-I'm done.
-Why don't you keep going?

53
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:17,548
That was amusing.
I'm curious what else you got.

54
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:19,175
-I'll cut it here.
-All right, then.

55
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:23,638
-Fall in.
-Yes, sir.

56
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:25,765
Wait.

57
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:28,601
We have unfinished business to settle.

58
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:31,145
You said you'd pay for all the drinks
but left without--

59
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:32,939
He paid me back.

60
00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:34,524
What?

61
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:37,110
Precisely calculated
because credibility matters.

62
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:39,070
It has been handled flawlessly.

63
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:41,281
What is this? Are you two close?

64
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:47,996
-Hey…
-Tell me, are you two close?

65
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:51,040
Hey, eyes to the front!
How dare you while your coach is speaking.

66
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:57,755
Park Taeyang, Park Taejun…
Your names are alike.

67
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:00,842
Your both Parks.

68
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:04,429
Like twins. We have the Park twins.

69
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:07,015
Twins…

70
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:10,560
Now that we have the Park twins,

71
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:13,438
I want to reorganize
the mixed doubles teams.

72
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:17,483
Split up into a women's team
and men's team.

73
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,068
Taeyang and Taejun can--

74
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:21,070
Do you have
no consideration for our lives?

75
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:23,281
Do I need to go that far?

76
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:27,744
Seriously, I've tried…

77
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:30,246
to keep this to myself, Coach.

78
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,456
Then let's keep it that way.

79
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:35,335
Did she sigh twice?

80
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:37,837
All hell will break loose
if she sighs one more time.

81
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,005
She will go berserk.

82
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:42,759
Who would want to be
on the same team as Taeyang?

83
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:46,220
She took three years off
and isn't even close to being an athlete.

84
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:48,306
What about the effect
that will have on her partner?

85
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:49,307
You only play singles,

86
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:52,268
so this isn't any of your business.
We can sort this out within our team.

87
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:53,895
Why do you keep on sighing?

88
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:56,939
Because she is losing it.

89
00:05:57,273 --> 00:06:00,151
You shouldn't force us

90
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:02,570
to make sacrifices.

91
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:05,948
Does anyone here
want to play with Taeyang?

92
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,743
How dare you raise your voice!

93
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:10,745
There's no one.

94
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:12,372
I'm the coach.

95
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:14,874
Mind your manners, will you?

96
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:16,459
You'd better not reorganize the teams.

97
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:19,212
I said, manners! Why you…

98
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:22,590
We have newcomers today, for God's sake.
Go easy on me.

99
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:24,801
But Coach,

100
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:28,930
does Taeyang have the skills
to join our team?

101
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:31,933
Coach? On what grounds?

102
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:32,975
I'm the issue here, so--

103
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:35,228
No, Taeyang.
You're risking your neck here.

104
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:36,270
I can handle this.

105
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:39,273
Hey, Taeyang.
Do you have something to say?

106
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:43,986
Let's talk outside… quickly!

107
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,488
Hey! Where do you think you're going?

108
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:48,074
Youngsim, calm down. Coach is here.

109
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:49,367
-Get off me.
-Oh, jeez.

110
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:52,036
-Youngsim, please. Calm down.
-Let me go!

111
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,081
-Hey! What's with you?
-Come here. Quickly.

112
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:57,458
-Please stop!
-Youngsim's gone nuts.

113
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:59,001
-Hey!
-Let go!

114
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:00,420
Somebody stop her!

115
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:01,796
-Come here, damn it!
-Hold on to her!

116
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:13,558
Does she still go berserk like that?

117
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:16,727
I guess some things don't change with age.

118
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:24,902
It's 19 million won.

119
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:25,945
What is?

120
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,905
My annual salary.

121
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:31,951
They insisted on shaving off a million,
because even 20 million was too much.

122
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,120
How did I get in?

123
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:35,413
Because I'm not worth a lot.

124
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:37,415
I'm here because I don't cost much.

125
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:41,043
That really is cheap. A total bargain.

126
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:50,178
All the national players
stay at the National Training Center.

127
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:52,346
Those who don't care
to represent the country are here.

128
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,557
Did you know
our dorm curfew is at 10 p.m.?

129
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,810
You can't get in once the doors close
and lose points if you stay out overnight.

130
00:07:57,894 --> 00:08:00,229
-That means your salary gets cut.
-I hadn't heard that.

131
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:03,191
You should've looked into it.
The rules are tough.

132
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:05,651
No drinking or smoking in the dorm.

133
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,404
Most of all, no dating teammates.

134
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:11,532
If caught, one will be kicked out.

135
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:13,868
That I really didn't know.

136
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:15,369
Are you here to work part-time?

137
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:16,954
What made you join the team?

138
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:20,166
Even if you can't take your eyes off her,
you must keep your feelings to yourself.

139
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,585
Even if you have feelings for her,
you can't let it show.

140
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,629
You can't click with someone

141
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:27,465
and get attached to them
as you train and play together here.

142
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:30,343
You're not the type to quit
because of a girl, right?

143
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:33,930
Then why are you with her?

144
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:36,974
-Sorry?
-You can't take your eyes off her.

145
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:38,601
I see you also have feelings for her.

146
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:42,855
What? Me?
What nonsense on your first day here!

147
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:46,150
That's totally ridiculous.
You've got it all wrong.

148
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,652
Well, I don't care.

149
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:50,029
Do you guys also act childish
and ostracize people?

150
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:52,114
-Who…
-I noticed earlier today.

151
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:53,533
Oh, you mean Taeyang?

152
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:55,826
I understand she's not as fit
due to her long break.

153
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:59,205
Still, that sort of thing is uncommon
in professional sports teams.

154
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:02,416
I guess you have no idea
what kind of person she is.

155
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:05,920
I don't want to be the one to tell.

156
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:08,422
You'll soon find out
what the real reason is.

157
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:13,719
Continue. Good.

158
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:15,304
Hey, Taejun.

159
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:18,224
Now that you're with us,
you need to take a fitness test.

160
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:19,934
Let me introduce you to our trainer.

161
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:21,978
I'm Kim Sibong.
You can call me Mr. Sibong.

162
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:24,522
I'm Park Taejun. Nice to meet you.

163
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:12,403
Hello!

164
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:30,546
I should be training…

165
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:37,386
I can't stop
with you staring at me like that.

166
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,597
Gosh, I'm exhausted.

167
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:53,736
Where are you going?

168
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:56,781
I was just…

169
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:09,585
-Take it easy.
-You too.

170
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:18,094
Walk at level six for ten minutes,
run at level ten for ten,

171
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:19,720
then sprint at twelve for two minutes.

172
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:23,307
Repeat this routine on the treadmill
until you're as fit as an athlete.

173
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:25,184
Forget about holding a racket.

174
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:26,352
You have such puny arms.

175
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:29,271
-Then when will I train--
-No.

176
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:31,190
All you will do is run 7 km a day.

177
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:32,775
But what about basic training like--

178
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:35,653
No. From now on,
I know what's best for your body.

179
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:36,987
I'm in charge, not you.

180
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,574
Sprint at twelve for two minutes.

181
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:44,662
Yes, sir.

182
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:54,630
Three, four, five, six, seven, eight…

183
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:57,675
JINCHEON NATIONAL TRAINING CENTER

184
00:11:57,758 --> 00:11:59,677
-Thank you, sir.
-Thank you, sir.

185
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:03,764
Hey.

186
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:07,393
Watch where you're going.
Have you picked up studying now?

187
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:08,894
Hey, Junghwan.

188
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:11,063
-What is it?
-This?

189
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:14,608
It's a list of athletes
for the world championships.

190
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,987
So another overseas trip? That's tiring.

191
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:20,030
Your name isn't on the list.

192
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:23,409
It's not?

193
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:25,745
That's great. I wanted a break anyway.

194
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:28,205
Really? Congratulations, then.

195
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:31,208
-I'm so jealous.
-Hey, you should just get going.

196
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:33,002
That's right. You're also not going.

197
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:34,253
-What?
-This time.

198
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:37,006
That's not true. Hey!

199
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:40,134
Gosh, he's such a jerk.

200
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:45,931
Doesn't he remind you of you
when you were young?

201
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:51,687
Sorry. It's my fault you're not going.

202
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:54,023
You should've gotten a better partner.

203
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:56,901
That's not what I meant. Hey!

204
00:12:57,985 --> 00:12:59,236
Where are you going?

205
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:20,424
Why am I not playing
at the world championships?

206
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:22,009
You should take a break.

207
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:24,053
It's been decided that way for a reason.

208
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:25,095
I didn't compete

209
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:27,348
in any national matches for this,
so what do you mean--

210
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:28,516
That's why

211
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,435
you should do as you're told.

212
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,854
Is this how you tame your athletes?

213
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:35,689
What did you say?

214
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:37,566
Because of me, Hyukbong can't go either!

215
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:46,742
I'm not going to beg you. But Coach,

216
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,287
how are you going to cope with this?

217
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:54,959
Don't you think people will ask
why I'm not participating?

218
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:58,754
That's why I need you
to do an interview for the team.

219
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:01,257
"I wanted to give
the junior members a chance."

220
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,259
"I'll be here rooting for them."

221
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:06,887
Go say that
during the team press conference.

222
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:08,973
You really think I'll say that?

223
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:10,558
Don't you want to go to the Olympics?

224
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:15,980
What about Hyukbong, who counts on you
and has been training for it?

225
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:17,731
You should think about that.

226
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:34,164
There's not much

227
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:38,127
to being a coach, is there?

228
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:39,503
No.

229
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:44,675
It's true.

230
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,761
It's not like
any of you listen to a word I say.

231
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:51,515
You'll have to find

232
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:54,852
your own doubles partner.

233
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:58,314
When it comes to finding a partner,
the athlete's opinion matters the most.

234
00:14:58,397 --> 00:14:59,899
I've got this.

235
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:03,152
Do you have someone in mind
who would be willing?

236
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:07,406
I think so.

237
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:17,666
Gosh, you're good at this.

238
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:20,252
Oh, my gosh!

239
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:21,503
Just kidding.

240
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:24,965
-Gosh, you scared me!
-That really hurt.

241
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:27,885
-It's fine.
-What else can I help with?

242
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:29,303
Why are you so adorable?

243
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:38,270
Hey, babe.

244
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:52,785
Why are you in such a good mood?

245
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:55,496
Isn't it annoying having to cook
a late-night snack for everyone?

246
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:57,665
It's not like
the seniors chipped in or anything.

247
00:15:57,748 --> 00:16:00,125
Cooking is how I relieve my stress.

248
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:01,710
I just love eating.

249
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:05,172
When I was younger,
I was this big from eating too much.

250
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:07,216
So I started playing badminton
to lose weight.

251
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:10,427
Babe, I'm sure you'd be totally cute
even if you put on weight.

252
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:14,556
Chubby cheeks, check. Belly, check.

253
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,225
You're such a teddy bear.

254
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:17,685
You're much cuter than I am.

255
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:19,478
Nice!

256
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:26,360
"Chubby cheeks, check. Belly, check."

257
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:28,404
I could have gotten
a great shot of that too.

258
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:31,907
What is this? What were you doing there?

259
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,159
Going undercover?

260
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:35,577
I heard you two were cooking,

261
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,246
so I figured you'd be here acting mushy.

262
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:40,374
Proof secured.

263
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,627
Gosh, what a meaningful day it has been.

264
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:47,172
So were you hiding in there
just to take that picture?

265
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,174
For how long?

266
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:51,719
For an hour or two?

267
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:54,263
I thought I was going to die.

268
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:55,347
Why?

269
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,851
Why would you do this?
Don't you have better things to do?

270
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:00,144
Because it's fun.

271
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:03,480
You two should be nice to me.

272
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:05,149
I have a really big mouth.

273
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:11,697
Is Jiho's restaurant open for business?

274
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:14,199
I'm starving.

275
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:16,702
Gosh, look how messy this place is.

276
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:18,996
Tidy up, will you?

277
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:20,956
As if your dorm is any cleaner.

278
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,499
What are we having today?

279
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,752
Sir, please have a seat here.

280
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:29,214
You have no idea how grateful
we are to have you on our team.

281
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:31,216
You're our hope.

282
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,843
Can I get water with ice?

283
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,511
I'm thirsty from doing hard work.

284
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:36,013
Water with ice. Got it.

285
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:38,015
Hurry up.

286
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:39,683
Hurry up. Got it.

287
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,063
Let's dig in.

288
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:45,856
-Thanks for the food!
-Thanks for the food!

289
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:48,275
-Please enjoy.
-Great job.

290
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:50,527
-Thanks for the food.
-Enjoy.

291
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:53,572
I think we're missing a person, though.

292
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:56,617
Can you get Taeyang?

293
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:58,118
Sure.

294
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:00,329
Let's just eat.

295
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:02,664
Come on, don't be like that with food.
Get her to join us.

296
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:06,877
Hey.

297
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:10,631
Just eat your food. If not, then leave.
Don't make me lose my appetite.

298
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:15,427
-Captain.
-Yes?

299
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:17,513
There's zero teamwork here.

300
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:22,768
I've never seen this in my entire career.

301
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:33,070
-That bastard… Hey!
-Youngsim!

302
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:39,993
Jeez. His net play is incredible.

303
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:44,540
His reaction time is relatively fast too.

304
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:47,000
SEOUL CITY HALL PARK TAEJUN

305
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:50,712
That's pretty cool.

306
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:52,172
-Go for it!
-Go for it!

307
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:54,800
Park Taejun.

308
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:56,552
Park Taejun.

309
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:02,307
This guy…
I hope he agrees to be my partner.

310
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:08,147
PARK TAEJUN

311
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,773
Oh, my gosh!

312
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:12,484
My hand has gone crazy.
It drew a heart on its own.

313
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:14,945
Taeyang, are you there?

314
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:24,872
Boys aren't allowed in here.

315
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:27,332
The girls are over at the boys' dorm now.

316
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:30,335
Let's eat together.

317
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,505
-Is that your room?
-Where do you think you're going?

318
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:34,590
Let me take a look.

319
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:37,467
Come on, there's nothing to… No!

320
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:39,511
Hey, wait!

321
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:49,521
Why do you get a room to yourself?
I'm jealous.

322
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:54,318
Because no one wanted to be my roommate.

323
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:55,903
Are you still jealous?

324
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:02,618
Actually, I wanted to
talk to you in person.

325
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:07,456
What are you looking at?

326
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:10,667
I was looking at you in this photo.

327
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:13,003
When did you take this?
Back in high school?

328
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:15,422
Wow, you look very determined.

329
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:17,090
Why are you looking?

330
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,637
All right. You said
you wanted to talk in person. Go on.

331
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:22,971
Right.

332
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:25,599
Let's be partners.

333
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:30,854
For the mixed doubles?

334
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:32,064
Yes.

335
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:35,108
As you can see,
no one even wants to share a room with me.

336
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:37,069
Who would partner up with me?

337
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:40,530
If I could play in mixed doubles
until I find a female partner,

338
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:43,158
then I could get to practice
and compete in matches.

339
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:45,869
You see, I don't have much time.

340
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:52,834
Hey, Taejun, wait up!

341
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:58,840
I'm now going to try to persuade you.

342
00:20:59,132 --> 00:21:00,592
So listen with an open heart.

343
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:03,011
I'm going to share a very sad story.

344
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:07,849
I had to make an effort
to be part of a family.

345
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:10,811
When I was a kid, I thought
I'd get disowned if I was bad at sports.

346
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:13,730
So I trained like crazy.

347
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:16,024
Everyone else is born into a family,

348
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:17,985
but I didn't have a thing to me.

349
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:19,903
I had to work for everything I got.

350
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:24,241
Gosh, you can't bring that up now.
It's not fair.

351
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:26,910
I know. I'm not going to be fair.

352
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:30,831
If there's anything in my life
I can take for granted

353
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:35,294
without putting in so much effort,
I would really like to have it.

354
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:37,713
Are you saying that's me?

355
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:40,590
Yes. I want to have you easily.

356
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:46,972
To me, being an athlete is just a job.

357
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:49,141
I don't like taking a single step
without getting paid.

358
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:50,767
No one likes to work overtime.

359
00:21:57,065 --> 00:21:59,234
But you were
looking forward to training with me.

360
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:05,782
Go back inside.

361
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,286
Hey, wait a minute.

362
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:16,293
Help me out this once.

363
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:19,588
Sorry. You're too much
of a burden for me to handle.

364
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:23,133
You're a hot potato.

365
00:22:24,926 --> 00:22:26,595
-What?
-Thanks for the meal.

366
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:29,306
-The food was really good.
-It was tasty.

367
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:31,850
-I'll leave you to do the dishes.
-Thanks.

368
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:33,810
Did you enjoy it too?

369
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:35,479
Gosh, you startled me.

370
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:40,192
What's with him? He didn't even say bye.

371
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:48,700
PARK TAEJUN

372
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:51,745
What's this?

373
00:22:57,751 --> 00:22:58,919
Let's see…

374
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:05,634
Coach!

375
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:09,554
Coach, did you see
Taejun's fitness test results?

376
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:11,723
His scores are
off the charts for every section.

377
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:13,225
He's a total monster.

378
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:14,893
I did see it.

379
00:23:14,976 --> 00:23:16,520
Here, take a look.

380
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:18,563
Sure. What is it?

381
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,357
I was also shocked by his results,

382
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,942
so I went through his documents.

383
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:23,235
Turn the page.

384
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:25,570
See who his older sister is.

385
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:30,325
She's not that athlete
that we know of, is she?

386
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:33,120
That is precisely who she is.

387
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:39,751
He has lived his entire life
in the shadow of his great sister.

388
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:41,253
I bet he never got the spotlight.

389
00:23:43,713 --> 00:23:46,133
So he just decided to throw in the towel.

390
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:48,093
Please enter your PIN.

391
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:54,141
Check your account balance
and select your desired transaction.

392
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:56,852
Sixty million won! I love you, Yunis!

393
00:23:58,311 --> 00:23:59,396
Sixty million won…

394
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:04,234
Hi, Mom.

395
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:08,780
You should check your bank account.
I sent you something.

396
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:10,615
It's quite a lot.

397
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:14,119
Come on, you know how much I love you.

398
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,291
I have to go train now. Bye.

399
00:24:28,508 --> 00:24:29,342
Do you have it?

400
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:40,729
Exquisite…

401
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:42,606
I'm sure you know
how difficult it was to find.

402
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:47,027
Things must be going well.
It's been ages since your last purchase.

403
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:49,196
Listen. I can afford even more than this,

404
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:50,530
so find me that pair.

405
00:24:51,114 --> 00:24:53,366
What? Do you mean Flex Royal?

406
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:56,161
Yes. I keep seeing them in my dreams.

407
00:24:56,369 --> 00:24:58,205
I don't need
the Korean flag or a gold medal.

408
00:24:58,288 --> 00:25:00,373
Those sneakers are all I need
to make my life complete.

409
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:02,584
I want to be buried with them.

410
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:04,127
That I can't do.

411
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:06,796
There are only 500 pairs in the world.

412
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,883
In Korea,
I think there are only about five pairs.

413
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:13,470
Gosh, I would love to see them.

414
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:20,435
You're precious too.

415
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,989
Hey, Taejun. Wait up!

416
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:39,037
I've given it some thought,
and I think I'm your responsibility.

417
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,040
-What?
-I started badminton because of you!

418
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:45,335
You said so yourself
that you discovered me.

419
00:25:45,418 --> 00:25:47,504
So that makes me your "perdona"?

420
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:51,591
Doesn't that sound like
a mix of "persona" and "Maradona"?

421
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:53,760
Weren't you ashamed
when that just slipped out?

422
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:56,429
Don't play innocent.

423
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:01,476
You're really not going to play with me?

424
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,979
You're the reason why
I'm going through this hell!

425
00:26:05,146 --> 00:26:06,940
-Don't play innocent.
-No, I'm running away.

426
00:26:07,023 --> 00:26:08,525
-That's irresponsible.
-I know.

427
00:26:09,192 --> 00:26:11,486
You're not manning up! You know that?

428
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:15,782
Hey, Taejun.

429
00:26:18,451 --> 00:26:19,661
MEN'S LOCKER ROOM

430
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:22,289
Now that you've showered,
how about taking me under your wing?

431
00:26:23,164 --> 00:26:24,541
No?

432
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,216
I don't know what giving up means.

433
00:26:36,219 --> 00:26:37,470
I'm your responsibility!

434
00:26:38,054 --> 00:26:39,598
Gosh, you startled me.

435
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:41,266
Stop saying that.

436
00:26:41,474 --> 00:26:42,934
What would the others think?

437
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:45,312
I don't care about the others.
All I want is you.

438
00:26:45,395 --> 00:26:47,564
Please stop.
You're putting too much pressure on me.

439
00:26:48,523 --> 00:26:50,150
I'm doing it on purpose.

440
00:26:50,233 --> 00:26:51,151
I know.

441
00:26:51,484 --> 00:26:53,361
Yes, that's what I'm doing.

442
00:27:04,247 --> 00:27:05,165
Did I startle you?

443
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:07,876
-Then will you be my partner?
-Go away!

444
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:09,085
I must have frightened you.

445
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:12,047
Then I can take you under my wing.
I'm a responsible person.

446
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:26,811
Since we've run into each other,
take me under your wing.

447
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:31,024
Just this once.

448
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:45,914
Do you know the key reason
why we can't be partners?

449
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:47,707
Because you lack empathy and you're cold?

450
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:53,463
What do you think is the most meaningful
and vital thing in a mixed doubles match?

451
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:56,716
Doing a high five after scoring a point.

452
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,176
That's what motivates you to play.

453
00:27:58,259 --> 00:28:00,387
But can you reach this high?

454
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:05,225
So my height is the issue?

455
00:28:05,308 --> 00:28:06,142
Show me if you can.

456
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:10,689
I'll put up with you making me feel small
and give it a go.

457
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:12,941
I'm going to try now.

458
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:36,923
It's perfect to rest my hands on.

459
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:25,889
You're like a real senior today.

460
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:30,185
I mean, you've agreed to do an interview
paving the way for us juniors.

461
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:34,272
Gosh, you really do know
how to control your temper now.

462
00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:36,232
Shut your trap.

463
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:43,406
Since the juniors also need to experience
playing in international games,

464
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:47,118
I felt it would be the right thing to do
for me to not take part this time.

465
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:49,913
I'll be cheering for them
to do their best.

466
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:51,706
Mr. Yuk.

467
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:55,418
We hear you have issues with self-care,
and that's why you weren't selected

468
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:56,544
for this competition.

469
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:57,879
Can you tell us about that?

470
00:29:57,962 --> 00:29:59,714
I'm taking good care of myself.

471
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:03,843
You've been posting photos
of yourself in clubs,

472
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:06,262
driving luxury cars,
and drinking on social media.

473
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:08,848
There's a debate about
whether you're qualified to be an athlete.

474
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:10,266
What are your thoughts on this?

475
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:12,185
Why the hell does that matter?

476
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:17,690
-What are you doing?
-I'm offended and quitting.

477
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:25,532
Hey, Yuk Junghwan!

478
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:42,632
All right, make it long.

479
00:30:43,132 --> 00:30:44,843
Let's try that again, starting from here.

480
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:47,470
Hey, Sunsoo.

481
00:30:47,595 --> 00:30:50,473
You have to pull your chest back
and angle it down.

482
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:52,809
-Make your swing sharper.
-Okay.

483
00:30:53,476 --> 00:30:57,105
Like… Gosh. Is that so hard to change?

484
00:30:59,607 --> 00:31:00,900
Sorry, sir!

485
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:04,445
Sunsoo, is everything okay at home?

486
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,364
You seem down today.

487
00:31:06,447 --> 00:31:08,491
He's always down like that.

488
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:14,747
All right, let's wrap up for today.
It's almost time to clock out.

489
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:16,249
Everyone, gather around!

490
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:18,960
-Are you sure you're okay?
-I'm fine.

491
00:31:21,462 --> 00:31:22,797
What should we do today?

492
00:31:23,756 --> 00:31:25,174
Jeez.

493
00:31:25,258 --> 00:31:27,218
Coach, I didn't know you were here.

494
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:30,013
-That's okay. I got it.
-Want to play soccer outside?

495
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:32,640
Sports should be played indoors.

496
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:35,393
It's uncivilized
to play sports out in the sun.

497
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:36,519
We should keep our dignity.

498
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:38,062
Agreed! Wise words.

499
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:39,689
It deserves a hand.

500
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:41,941
Then how about we play four on four?

501
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:43,735
Hey, Taeyang.

502
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:46,279
Let's have a match.

503
00:31:47,113 --> 00:31:50,325
The rest of you… can watch.

504
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:53,953
Let's see if you're worth
19 million won a year.

505
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:56,664
I think you might deserve less.

506
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:23,149
Shouldn't we stop them?

507
00:32:24,817 --> 00:32:28,112
Let's watch and find out
how much Taeyang can still do.

508
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:32,659
Whether she has hit rock bottom or not.

509
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:42,043
You know that Youngsim is
an Asian Games gold medalist, right?

510
00:32:42,543 --> 00:32:45,713
She retired from the national team
and is here to complete a Grand Slam.

511
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:48,800
Taeyang is going to get crushed.

512
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:16,369
LEE YOUNGSIM

513
00:33:25,586 --> 00:33:27,839
-That was slow.
-Yes.

514
00:33:57,744 --> 00:33:59,287
What is she doing?

515
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:01,456
She's completely distracted.

516
00:34:20,349 --> 00:34:21,726
She hit a smash!

517
00:34:42,371 --> 00:34:43,498
Not even close…

518
00:34:44,123 --> 00:34:46,542
She was once famous
for her signature smash shot.

519
00:34:47,001 --> 00:34:48,044
Now she's lost it.

520
00:34:49,712 --> 00:34:50,880
She's doomed.

521
00:35:05,394 --> 00:35:06,395
Match is over.

522
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:08,523
Let's go home.

523
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:09,982
Dismissed!

524
00:35:11,734 --> 00:35:12,985
Let's go.

525
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:42,140
Look at that.
You got in just before the curfew.

526
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:43,099
Are you going outside?

527
00:35:43,182 --> 00:35:44,517
Yes, to lock up the entrance.

528
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,853
What for? We're all adults.

529
00:35:46,936 --> 00:35:48,312
I have to.

530
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:50,439
My gosh. Why are you here?

531
00:35:51,023 --> 00:35:52,942
You don't belong
in a shabby place like this.

532
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:57,155
I wasn't that much of a big shot.

533
00:35:57,238 --> 00:35:58,281
Flex Royal…

534
00:35:59,782 --> 00:36:01,284
Who owns these?

535
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:02,827
Whose sneakers are these?

536
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:04,245
What about them?

537
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:05,997
Those are mine.

538
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:07,832
But who are you?

539
00:36:07,915 --> 00:36:09,417
He recently joined our team.

540
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,960
You two are the same age.

541
00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:12,670
How did you get…

542
00:36:12,962 --> 00:36:15,173
I mean, there are
only 500 pairs in the world.

543
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:17,133
That makes me one in five hundred.

544
00:36:17,216 --> 00:36:18,759
Because I'm Yuk Junghwan.

545
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:23,055
Are you wearing rubber shoes?

546
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:25,141
You should get a new pair.

547
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:27,685
Rubber shoes?

548
00:36:39,822 --> 00:36:41,699
Hey, that's my room!

549
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:53,252
The thing is, he used to stay in this room
when he was here from time to time.

550
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:59,008
I see. Did you get kicked out
of the national training center?

551
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:02,261
I read about the trouble you caused.

552
00:37:02,845 --> 00:37:04,096
Did you get suspended?

553
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:05,556
For a month? Forever?

554
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,557
For a month!

555
00:37:08,976 --> 00:37:10,436
Gosh.

556
00:37:12,813 --> 00:37:14,023
Hey, Rubber Shoes.

557
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:15,983
Can you leave? I'm tired.

558
00:37:16,984 --> 00:37:19,445
Excuse me…

559
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:22,907
How about going to Seungwoo's room?

560
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:24,200
-Me?
-Me?

561
00:37:24,283 --> 00:37:27,036
No, I'll go. You two can share this room.

562
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:28,704
-Why?
-Just stay put.

563
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:35,586
It would be wrong to kick you out again
when you have nowhere to go.

564
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:38,464
You can use the bed.

565
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:53,104
The blanket is mine though.

566
00:38:01,862 --> 00:38:03,197
The pillow's also yours, right?

567
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:11,455
It belongs to the dorm.

568
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:42,236
What? Are you going to Seungwoo's room?

569
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:53,205
I'm going to the bathroom.

570
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:56,959
I'll be going every ten minutes,
so curl up, Rubber Shoes.

571
00:38:58,044 --> 00:38:59,503
Stop calling me like that.

572
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:06,761
Yuk Junghwan wins.

573
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:28,532
I don't see her.

574
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:29,909
Who are you looking for?

575
00:39:32,286 --> 00:39:34,330
Hey, Junghwan. Come have a seat here.

576
00:39:35,581 --> 00:39:36,457
I don't see Taeyang.

577
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:39,794
Right. She'll be gone the whole day.

578
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:42,046
I pulled a prank on her.

579
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:45,216
-What kind of prank?
-Curious?

580
00:39:48,844 --> 00:39:50,513
Where is Taeyang?

581
00:39:51,263 --> 00:39:52,431
She didn't come?

582
00:39:53,015 --> 00:39:54,225
I don't know.

583
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:56,185
Maybe she's in the training room.

584
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:58,312
Taeyang!

585
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:01,565
So she's not here either?

586
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:04,485
What? She's not in the training room?

587
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:06,612
-No.
-She isn't here either.

588
00:40:08,447 --> 00:40:10,616
Does anyone know where Taeyang is?

589
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:20,418
What? A Han River marathon?

590
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:24,922
So, is Taeyang there right now
running all by herself?

591
00:40:25,005 --> 00:40:28,592
Come on. She'll realize it was a joke
when none of us show up and come back.

592
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:29,635
A joke?

593
00:40:30,636 --> 00:40:33,264
Is it fun to put someone
through hell and call it a joke?

594
00:40:33,347 --> 00:40:35,599
Don't get mad at me.
Yuri is the one who did it.

595
00:40:45,317 --> 00:40:47,403
Hello? Hey, where are you?

596
00:40:47,903 --> 00:40:49,822
Come quick. No one's here yet though.

597
00:40:49,905 --> 00:40:52,074
You should've known it was a prank
when no one showed up.

598
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:54,034
-Why are you so clueless?
-A prank?

599
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:56,579
There's a marathon today
to Dongjak Bridge--

600
00:40:56,662 --> 00:40:58,747
There's no marathon.
Catch a taxi back. Hurry.

601
00:40:59,748 --> 00:41:01,917
Hello? Hey, Taejun!

602
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:11,218
Why do you all take it so far?

603
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:13,304
I just don't understand.

604
00:41:13,387 --> 00:41:15,389
Are the rest of you that great?

605
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:18,976
Is it that hard
to accept her as part of the team?

606
00:41:19,351 --> 00:41:21,145
This is completely ridiculous.

607
00:41:21,228 --> 00:41:23,022
I guess you still don't know.

608
00:41:23,689 --> 00:41:25,483
She once committed bribery.

609
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:26,609
What?

610
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:29,111
Who told you that? That's a false--

611
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:30,821
She admitted it herself.

612
00:41:37,411 --> 00:41:39,955
All right. I'll run then.

613
00:41:40,873 --> 00:41:43,292
I'll run as you say,
and be fooled if that's what you want.

614
00:41:43,542 --> 00:41:45,044
I'll do whatever you want.

615
00:42:05,314 --> 00:42:06,148
Fine.

616
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:09,276
I'm a piece of trash that bribes people.

617
00:42:12,613 --> 00:42:14,990
I wish I had the money to bribe people…

618
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:18,077
I'm a rich girl? What a nice image.

619
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,788
Then I'll act the part.

620
00:42:25,793 --> 00:42:28,087
Why did you admit
to doing something you didn't do?

621
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:30,673
For what reason?

622
00:43:31,734 --> 00:43:35,404
Why do I have to be the third wheel?
I feel wretched.

623
00:43:41,243 --> 00:43:43,704
The fencing team is up ahead,
15 degrees to your left.

624
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:48,250
I didn't join the national team for this.

625
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:52,296
The coast is clear…

626
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:56,091
My eyes!

627
00:43:57,885 --> 00:44:00,429
If you two want to be like that,
make your relationship public.

628
00:44:00,512 --> 00:44:01,639
Why do you put me…

629
00:44:02,181 --> 00:44:04,266
Why me? You two can just…

630
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:07,394
Come on. Taeyang, you're adorable.

631
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:09,063
Taeyang, you're so kind.

632
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:12,483
Then, how about we all live together?

633
00:44:12,566 --> 00:44:13,734
-No.
-Are you crazy?

634
00:44:17,529 --> 00:44:20,616
Then… Junyoung,
you should come live with me.

635
00:44:20,699 --> 00:44:22,034
No thanks.

636
00:44:22,117 --> 00:44:24,244
Why not? Let's share a place.

637
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:25,412
Should we?

638
00:44:25,704 --> 00:44:27,706
-That's a promise.
-All right.

639
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:50,396
I made it.

640
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:58,862
PARK TAEJUN

641
00:45:00,572 --> 00:45:02,449
Taeyang isn't back yet.

642
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,160
Should I tell her to call you
when she gets back?

643
00:45:23,262 --> 00:45:24,263
Hello, sir.

644
00:45:27,766 --> 00:45:28,767
Nice to see you again.

645
00:45:28,851 --> 00:45:30,686
I'm also with Yunis.

646
00:45:30,811 --> 00:45:31,895
Really?

647
00:45:32,312 --> 00:45:35,649
Gosh. Then it's
a good thing I didn't hire you.

648
00:45:36,108 --> 00:45:39,361
Anyway, I heard it's pretty tough
to get on this team.

649
00:45:39,445 --> 00:45:40,988
I'm pretty tough too.

650
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:43,699
You're going to regret not hiring me.

651
00:45:44,324 --> 00:45:45,367
Okay.

652
00:45:46,368 --> 00:45:48,871
Anyway, can you get Taeyang for me?

653
00:45:48,954 --> 00:45:50,581
-Taeyang?
-Yes.

654
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:54,334
She's training right now.

655
00:45:55,335 --> 00:45:56,295
At this hour?

656
00:45:56,879 --> 00:46:00,799
Yes, it's sort of like
a special nighttime training session.

657
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:03,343
Is she getting special treatment?

658
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:07,055
-Yes.
-Well, she's not just any athlete.

659
00:46:07,139 --> 00:46:09,641
Did you know
she was once called the Smash Queen?

660
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:12,269
-Of course, I do.
-That's right.

661
00:46:12,853 --> 00:46:16,190
She might be sluggish for a while,
but she just has to set her mind to it.

662
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:19,276
She has never once let me down.

663
00:46:23,489 --> 00:46:25,032
I'm sure she tried her very best…

664
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:28,494
not to let you down.

665
00:46:37,336 --> 00:46:39,630
How could you go AWOL
when you just joined the team?

666
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:43,759
Aren't you going to tell me why?
What's the reason?

667
00:46:45,052 --> 00:46:48,347
I had a moment of self-pity
at the Han River.

668
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:50,849
I was reminiscing about the past.

669
00:46:54,394 --> 00:46:55,521
Are you kidding yourself?

670
00:46:57,231 --> 00:46:59,608
Are you the big shot like you used to be?

671
00:47:01,735 --> 00:47:02,611
No, sir.

672
00:47:02,694 --> 00:47:05,155
Your heyday has come to an end.
You know that, right?

673
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:08,158
Yes, sir.

674
00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:09,743
Your voice is quivering.

675
00:47:10,536 --> 00:47:12,788
Why? Are you going to cry?

676
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:14,581
No, sir.

677
00:47:15,207 --> 00:47:17,417
I'm aware that
I can't go back to how I used to be.

678
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:19,878
Then why can't you let go of your past?

679
00:47:24,299 --> 00:47:27,594
Run a few laps around the track
before curfew starts. Okay?

680
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:29,179
Yes, sir.

681
00:48:27,988 --> 00:48:29,573
Did you run by yourself at the Han River?

682
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:33,118
This can't be from running a few laps.

683
00:48:34,536 --> 00:48:35,954
How did you know I ran laps?

684
00:48:37,414 --> 00:48:38,540
I just happened to see you.

685
00:48:40,667 --> 00:48:41,752
That's strange.

686
00:48:41,835 --> 00:48:43,462
Did you tell Coach what happened today?

687
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:47,215
Why are you taking all the blame?

688
00:48:47,549 --> 00:48:49,468
Is that the only thing you're good at?

689
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:51,678
I'm very tired, so I don't have--

690
00:48:51,762 --> 00:48:53,180
No one told you to run.

691
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:54,848
Why do you knowingly do this to yourself?

692
00:48:57,976 --> 00:49:00,520
And what's this about you offering bribes?
I know it isn't true.

693
00:49:02,105 --> 00:49:03,148
What do you know?

694
00:49:04,983 --> 00:49:06,652
I guess you heard the rumor.

695
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:10,572
That's all true.

696
00:49:11,031 --> 00:49:12,532
I overheard you talking to yourself.

697
00:49:13,617 --> 00:49:15,994
I know you didn't do it.

698
00:49:16,495 --> 00:49:18,288
Does someone have something on you?

699
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:20,457
What? Did you commit murder?

700
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:23,794
Why on earth do you have to
keep your mouth shut and take the fall?

701
00:49:24,836 --> 00:49:25,963
You can tell me, at least.

702
00:49:27,923 --> 00:49:29,466
Who do you think you are to me?

703
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:32,761
What?

704
00:49:32,928 --> 00:49:34,638
Thank you for being nice to me.

705
00:49:35,555 --> 00:49:38,100
I'm grateful for everything,
but let's not overdo it.

706
00:49:44,731 --> 00:49:45,816
Give that to me.

707
00:49:45,899 --> 00:49:47,484
I can carry it myself.

708
00:49:47,567 --> 00:49:49,695
Stop being so stubborn.
You can't even walk properly.

709
00:49:49,945 --> 00:49:51,113
Hey, Taejun!

710
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:03,041
I don't want to be your partner.

711
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:06,795
Why bring that up all of a sudden?

712
00:50:07,879 --> 00:50:10,590
And it's not as if I asked you to.

713
00:50:10,674 --> 00:50:11,508
I know.

714
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:14,011
I won't be waiting around anymore.

715
00:50:19,558 --> 00:50:21,977
I didn't ask you because I was in a hurry
and anyone would do.

716
00:50:22,894 --> 00:50:25,230
I watched your matches over and over.

717
00:50:27,357 --> 00:50:29,317
And I could see how talented you were.

718
00:50:30,068 --> 00:50:31,695
The talent you've been looking down on.

719
00:50:34,114 --> 00:50:38,076
I thought I could show you
how much better you can be.

720
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:39,745
Then it would be a win-win.

721
00:50:40,328 --> 00:50:42,122
I didn't have
any reason to be that desperate.

722
00:50:42,622 --> 00:50:45,542
So it was embarrassing
and I felt small, but I begged you.

723
00:50:46,835 --> 00:50:48,253
But not anymore.

724
00:50:51,548 --> 00:50:52,799
You find me annoying, don't you?

725
00:50:58,346 --> 00:50:59,639
Well, same here.

726
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:23,914
Looks tasty.

727
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:33,131
You're late.

728
00:51:34,966 --> 00:51:37,344
I got some fresh air while I was out.

729
00:51:38,428 --> 00:51:39,471
You must've had fun.

730
00:51:44,101 --> 00:51:45,018
Taeyang.

731
00:51:46,978 --> 00:51:48,688
You brought this on yourself.

732
00:51:50,398 --> 00:51:52,317
Yes, I know.

733
00:51:58,031 --> 00:52:00,742
She took advantage of it to hang out.

734
00:52:01,243 --> 00:52:02,577
I knew she would.

735
00:52:09,543 --> 00:52:10,794
Are you not going to eat?

736
00:52:14,172 --> 00:52:15,173
Why isn't she eating?

737
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:27,686
I should put on some pain relief patches.

738
00:52:30,355 --> 00:52:32,524
I should also stretch before going to bed.

739
00:52:54,462 --> 00:52:56,423
-Good morning!
-Good morning!

740
00:52:56,923 --> 00:52:59,467
Coach will be here later today.

741
00:52:59,551 --> 00:53:01,219
I bet he had too much to drink last night.

742
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:05,015
Did you drink with him?

743
00:53:05,098 --> 00:53:07,851
No, we're not… I didn't drink.

744
00:53:09,603 --> 00:53:13,690
All right. Taeyang isn't feeling well,
so she won't join us today.

745
00:53:13,773 --> 00:53:16,443
This morning, let's do your favorite.
Interval training.

746
00:53:23,491 --> 00:53:25,118
Too slow. Move faster.

747
00:53:29,497 --> 00:53:31,208
Look at you, Dongwan.

748
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:32,834
That's good.

749
00:53:43,011 --> 00:53:44,095
This is really bugging me.

750
00:53:46,556 --> 00:53:48,099
Hey, Park Taejun!

751
00:53:48,850 --> 00:53:50,393
Taejun, where are you going?

752
00:54:24,761 --> 00:54:27,138
I didn't ask you because I was in a hurry
and anyone would do.

753
00:54:27,889 --> 00:54:30,183
I watched your matches over and over.

754
00:54:32,227 --> 00:54:34,229
And I could see how talented you were.

755
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:36,773
The talent you've been looking down on.

756
00:54:40,443 --> 00:54:44,155
I thought I could show you
how much better you can be.

757
00:54:52,205 --> 00:54:53,290
Congratulations, Taejun!

758
00:54:53,373 --> 00:54:55,333
-Hurray!
-Hurray!

759
00:54:55,583 --> 00:54:57,836
Look at this!

760
00:55:00,213 --> 00:55:01,298
One, two, three!

761
00:55:01,923 --> 00:55:03,008
One, two, three!

762
00:55:03,091 --> 00:55:05,844
THE 5TH CHUNCHEON
JUNIOR BADMINTON CHAMPIONSHIPS

763
00:55:05,927 --> 00:55:09,514
CHUNCHEON SPORTING GOODS

764
00:55:09,597 --> 00:55:10,974
Mom. I'm back.

765
00:55:11,057 --> 00:55:14,519
Oh, you're here.
Taejun, your sister won a gold medal!

766
00:55:15,437 --> 00:55:17,939
Selling badminton rackets
to raise your kid has really paid off!

767
00:55:18,023 --> 00:55:19,607
What was the name of the competition?

768
00:55:19,691 --> 00:55:22,193
Let me get you a banner for the store.

769
00:55:22,277 --> 00:55:23,945
There's no need for that.

770
00:55:24,029 --> 00:55:26,990
The World Junior Badminton Championships.

771
00:55:27,073 --> 00:55:29,159
"The World."

772
00:55:29,242 --> 00:55:30,535
Honey, stop.

773
00:55:31,745 --> 00:55:33,288
She's a proud daughter of Chuncheon.

774
00:55:33,413 --> 00:55:35,498
No, a proud daughter of Korea.

775
00:55:35,582 --> 00:55:37,042
That's right!

776
00:55:37,125 --> 00:55:39,711
-She's the best!
-So are we having a celebratory meal?

777
00:55:40,712 --> 00:55:42,505
Of course, my treat!

778
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:26,383
Can you give me
the location of the funeral home?

779
00:56:28,968 --> 00:56:29,928
Okay.

780
00:56:39,354 --> 00:56:41,272
You're all sluggish today.

781
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:43,108
Don't fall behind!

782
00:56:43,191 --> 00:56:44,526
OH SUNSOO
YUNIS

783
00:56:44,609 --> 00:56:46,152
Good.

784
00:56:46,486 --> 00:56:47,987
Dongwan, your footwork is slow.

785
00:56:48,279 --> 00:56:50,949
Stay focused, there isn't much time left.

786
00:56:51,032 --> 00:56:52,492
Excuse me, Coach.

787
00:56:53,993 --> 00:56:55,578
I have to leave early…

788
00:56:56,287 --> 00:56:57,205
Why?

789
00:56:57,288 --> 00:57:00,291
My high school coach passed away.

790
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:03,128
I'm sorry.

791
00:57:03,211 --> 00:57:06,005
Don't be. You should get ready and go.

792
00:57:13,888 --> 00:57:15,181
Mr. Oh Sunsoo.

793
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:20,979
Yes?

794
00:57:21,479 --> 00:57:24,649
You're from Jeju Island.
Do you have a suit here?

795
00:57:29,404 --> 00:57:31,823
I'm at Dad's training center
to give him some side dishes.

796
00:57:32,574 --> 00:57:33,533
Yes.

797
00:57:34,659 --> 00:57:36,661
All right. Bye.

798
00:57:45,211 --> 00:57:46,880
Isn't that Yuk Junghwan?

799
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:11,154
I keep this in my car since I often have
to attend ceremonies. You can wear it.

800
00:58:14,449 --> 00:58:16,075
The person who passed away…

801
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:18,161
Is he the one that believed in you?

802
00:58:19,621 --> 00:58:22,165
You told us
at the first get-together we had.

803
00:58:22,749 --> 00:58:23,791
You…

804
00:58:24,792 --> 00:58:26,377
remember that?

805
00:58:29,964 --> 00:58:31,883
No one cares about me here.

806
00:58:31,966 --> 00:58:35,011
He's only seen you in gym clothes
looking scruffy, right?

807
00:58:35,094 --> 00:58:37,347
You should dress up
to see him for the last time.

808
00:58:37,931 --> 00:58:39,891
What's your shoe size?
Do you have dress shoes?

809
00:58:41,434 --> 00:58:44,854
That's okay.
I have a pair of black sneakers.

810
00:58:47,273 --> 00:58:48,483
And…

811
00:58:51,027 --> 00:58:55,156
I'm sure he'd prefer to see me
in my sneakers.

812
00:59:02,330 --> 00:59:05,500
He's passed away, but that doesn't mean
his faith in you is gone.

813
00:59:05,917 --> 00:59:09,128
That is now yours to keep forever.

814
00:59:13,174 --> 00:59:14,968
Go and say your last goodbye to him.

815
00:59:39,158 --> 00:59:40,743
How long have I been sleeping?

816
00:59:55,675 --> 00:59:57,302
What? Why didn't she wake me up?

817
01:00:04,642 --> 01:00:06,728
Why didn't you wake me up
when I was right there?

818
01:00:06,811 --> 01:00:08,229
Do you have no sense of loyalty?

819
01:00:08,646 --> 01:00:10,023
But you were only pretending.

820
01:00:10,982 --> 01:00:13,860
I saw how quickly you closed your eyes.

821
01:00:16,487 --> 01:00:18,281
Training hours are over.
Where are you going?

822
01:00:19,824 --> 01:00:21,367
I'm going to work out a bit.

823
01:00:21,451 --> 01:00:23,953
If I don't,
I'll have an even harder time tomorrow.

824
01:00:24,245 --> 01:00:26,998
You should leave that
for tomorrow's you to deal with.

825
01:00:27,498 --> 01:00:28,541
Let's have dinner together…

826
01:00:30,209 --> 01:00:31,461
I told you not to go overboard.

827
01:00:32,837 --> 01:00:33,921
Bye.

828
01:00:35,173 --> 01:00:36,591
That's impressive.

829
01:00:37,967 --> 01:00:40,887
Fine. I don't care whether
your body breaks down or you get injured.

830
01:00:40,970 --> 01:00:42,680
Go ahead and have it your way!

831
01:00:44,557 --> 01:00:47,268
Are you going to win gold
in the next Olympics or something?

832
01:00:47,352 --> 01:00:50,104
Let me congratulate you in advance then!
You should go for it!

833
01:01:21,344 --> 01:01:22,220
Are you crying?

834
01:01:25,431 --> 01:01:26,683
How am I supposed to go for it?

835
01:01:27,642 --> 01:01:29,185
There's nothing I can do.

836
01:01:30,478 --> 01:01:32,730
My body aches just because I ran a bit.

837
01:01:32,814 --> 01:01:34,982
And no one expects me to do well anymore.

838
01:01:35,441 --> 01:01:38,653
I'm a goner who's worth 19 million won
a year, so how can I do well?

839
01:01:38,945 --> 01:01:41,030
That's never going to happen!

840
01:01:41,531 --> 01:01:45,159
Once an athlete is past their prime,
it never returns.

841
01:01:45,243 --> 01:01:46,869
It's over for me!

842
01:01:49,747 --> 01:01:51,082
I know that.

843
01:02:00,425 --> 01:02:02,176
You're finally crying.

844
01:02:06,222 --> 01:02:07,265
What?

845
01:02:08,349 --> 01:02:09,767
You've held back long enough.

846
01:02:11,686 --> 01:02:13,354
It's about time you cry.

847
01:02:14,439 --> 01:02:16,023
What are you doing?

848
01:02:19,944 --> 01:02:20,778
Keep on crying.

849
01:02:25,074 --> 01:02:27,201
Taeyang is crying! Who wants to see?

850
01:02:27,285 --> 01:02:28,202
-Didn't you want to see?
-Hey!

851
01:02:28,286 --> 01:02:29,871
Over here! Taeyang's crying!

852
01:02:29,954 --> 01:02:31,038
Why you little…

853
01:02:31,122 --> 01:02:32,665
She's sobbing and has a runny nose!

854
01:02:33,249 --> 01:02:35,084
-Come over here.
-I don't think I should.

855
01:02:35,168 --> 01:02:36,961
Come here, you jerk.

856
01:02:37,545 --> 01:02:38,880
You're dead meat!

857
01:02:41,674 --> 01:02:43,718
What's going on? What was that she said?

858
01:02:44,635 --> 01:02:45,845
Hey, what happened?

859
01:02:45,928 --> 01:02:47,638
Taejun, get yourself over here!

860
01:02:47,722 --> 01:02:48,848
Have you stopped crying now?

861
01:02:49,807 --> 01:02:52,643
-You're such a freak!
-I can see you're full of energy.

862
01:02:52,727 --> 01:02:56,105
Right. That's why I'm ready to kill you.

863
01:02:56,189 --> 01:02:58,441
You're so simple-minded.

864
01:02:58,649 --> 01:02:59,609
You were about to quit,

865
01:02:59,692 --> 01:03:01,402
but you came back to life
with a little push.

866
01:03:01,486 --> 01:03:02,779
You're seriously my type.

867
01:03:02,862 --> 01:03:04,030
Come here.

868
01:03:04,113 --> 01:03:05,406
Be my partner.

869
01:03:10,077 --> 01:03:11,120
What?

870
01:03:12,288 --> 01:03:14,415
I know now isn't
the right time to say this,

871
01:03:16,083 --> 01:03:17,418
but let's be partners.

872
01:03:20,296 --> 01:03:21,881
You're playing me for a fool.

873
01:03:21,964 --> 01:03:24,050
No, let's play together.

874
01:03:26,052 --> 01:03:28,513
If I get persuaded now,
it means I have no self-respect.

875
01:03:30,765 --> 01:03:33,810
I really want what's best for you.

876
01:03:34,685 --> 01:03:37,063
I thought you would be
better off with another partner.

877
01:03:37,146 --> 01:03:38,606
That's why I kept saying no.

878
01:03:38,773 --> 01:03:41,317
I see. That's very thoughtful of you.

879
01:03:41,609 --> 01:03:44,153
Why? Do you take pity on me?

880
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:45,321
You're…

881
01:03:49,575 --> 01:03:51,327
my "Perdona."

882
01:04:00,336 --> 01:04:02,046
I'll be there…

883
01:04:02,922 --> 01:04:04,632
for as long as you want me.

884
01:04:08,970 --> 01:04:11,305
We won't get to high five though.

885
01:04:13,766 --> 01:04:15,184
I'll be standing behind you.

886
01:04:22,775 --> 01:04:25,528
Where are these Park twins?

887
01:04:26,279 --> 01:04:28,114
I have a hunch they got into a big fight.

888
01:04:28,781 --> 01:04:30,324
I'm dying of curiosity.

889
01:04:30,408 --> 01:04:31,826
Why are you curious?

890
01:04:32,952 --> 01:04:34,036
Let's go inside.

891
01:04:35,371 --> 01:04:36,414
Here they come.

892
01:04:43,588 --> 01:04:45,590
-It doesn't look good.
-Right.

893
01:04:45,673 --> 01:04:47,550
-You should ask them.
-Why me?

894
01:04:47,758 --> 01:04:49,969
-Ask about what happened.
-Gosh. Let go.

895
01:04:52,555 --> 01:04:55,349
So, what happened between you two?

896
01:04:57,977 --> 01:05:00,563
I don't know.
She hasn't given me her answer yet.

897
01:05:01,272 --> 01:05:02,440
Answer to what?

898
01:05:11,741 --> 01:05:13,492
Two, three, four…

899
01:05:22,835 --> 01:05:23,836
Darn it.

900
01:05:26,422 --> 01:05:27,256
What's going on?

901
01:05:27,924 --> 01:05:29,091
Why is she going that way?

902
01:05:30,593 --> 01:05:31,844
Why does she torment me?

903
01:05:36,974 --> 01:05:39,018
What did he say? Spill it.

904
01:05:39,101 --> 01:05:40,978
-She hasn't answered something.
-Not answer what?

905
01:05:41,062 --> 01:05:43,356
-I don't know.
-I want to find out.

906
01:05:48,653 --> 01:05:52,156
Taeyang, let's play together.

907
01:05:53,491 --> 01:05:54,492
Come on.

908
01:06:00,039 --> 01:06:00,957
You.

909
01:06:01,958 --> 01:06:02,875
Yes?

910
01:06:08,673 --> 01:06:12,009
You'd better make sure
to stand right behind me on the court.

911
01:06:23,521 --> 01:06:26,107
And I can do it.

912
01:06:26,899 --> 01:06:27,900
Do what?

913
01:06:28,442 --> 01:06:29,819
Put your hand up like this.

914
01:06:31,654 --> 01:06:32,947
Higher.

915
01:06:33,030 --> 01:06:35,866
Raise your arm as high as you can.

916
01:06:39,870 --> 01:06:41,205
Here I go.

917
01:07:46,103 --> 01:07:48,147
GOING TO YOU AT A SPEED OF 493KM

918
01:07:48,230 --> 01:07:50,399
It's a little late,
but you should try playing soccer.

919
01:07:50,941 --> 01:07:53,444
-Sorry.
-We're on the same team.

920
01:07:53,527 --> 01:07:55,821
What if they split up
shortly after becoming partners?

921
01:07:55,905 --> 01:07:57,698
What am I looking at here?

922
01:07:57,823 --> 01:08:00,326
"Yuk Junghwan,
national badminton tournament"?

923
01:08:00,409 --> 01:08:02,661
Can you send two of our teams
to the competition?

924
01:08:02,745 --> 01:08:05,581
Taejun, do you know what happens
when it rains in the desert?

925
01:08:06,082 --> 01:08:08,667
Flowers bloom. Amazing ones.

926
01:08:09,168 --> 01:08:10,586
You're like the desert.

927
01:08:10,669 --> 01:08:11,879
It just hasn't rained yet.

928
01:08:23,015 --> 01:08:24,141
GOING TO YOU AT A SPEED OF 493KM

929
01:08:24,225 --> 01:08:26,227
