1
00:00:37,787 --> 00:00:40,749
GOING TO YOU AT A SPEED OF 493KM

2
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,586
THE PLACES, PEOPLE, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTIONAL

3
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:49,841
Did I really get hurt
while I went hiking alone?

4
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:52,886
Did you forget that it was a lie?

5
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:56,848
It happened because I got drunk
and sneaked out to go snowboarding…

6
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,726
A person found pleasure
in someone else's pain.

7
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:01,061
I hate you.

8
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:04,814
What the heck? Dang it.

9
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:06,024
Screw this.

10
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:15,325
And he received a small punishment for it.

11
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:20,538
He lost his precious cell phone.

12
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:26,127
It happened because I got drunk
and sneaked out to go snowboarding.

13
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:27,921
Look at this.

14
00:01:28,004 --> 00:01:30,924
-And you know what happened…
-This time, more people are enjoying it.

15
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:32,175
…so I don't want to see you.

16
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:33,635
Are you crying?

17
00:01:33,718 --> 00:01:35,887
-Seriously…
-It wasn't a training injury?

18
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:37,222
Then, more people.

19
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,018
You're just so mean.

20
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:43,645
And even more people.

21
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:46,314
All right.

22
00:01:57,742 --> 00:02:00,954
Tell me! Stop being so frustrating!

23
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:04,374
Hey. Are you okay?

24
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:09,212
Were you fired?
Did they tell you not to come back?

25
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:14,425
What was bound to get out,
finally got out.

26
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:24,185
EPISODE 11

27
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:25,145
That wicked brat.

28
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:28,648
How could she lie to her parents
and humiliate us like this?

29
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:32,986
What is your problem, woman?

30
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:35,029
Your baby is dangling off a cliff.

31
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:37,824
How could a parent complain
about being humiliated?

32
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:40,368
How could you worry about yourself
in this situation?

33
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:43,288
You make me sick.

34
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:44,581
I'm upset, that's why.

35
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:46,499
How is she going to get married now?

36
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:49,169
-She'll probably end up better than me!
-What?

37
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:51,588
Imagine how she must feel.
She couldn't even tell us,

38
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:55,383
but this happened
as soon as she returned to Korea!

39
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:58,803
You don't care at all about how she feels.

40
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,528
How do I face Mom?

41
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:19,449
I was finally

42
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:22,285
getting myself together.

43
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:28,541
I gave a lot of interviews about my return

44
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:31,461
and things were going well.

45
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:35,256
A long time ago,

46
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:38,760
Mom gave you a black chicken
or something behind my back.

47
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:42,013
Did you know that?

48
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:43,973
A black chicken?

49
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:45,892
Did she burn it?

50
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:49,020
Silkie chicken soup?

51
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:53,107
I knew what she was up to,

52
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:56,152
and asked her why she was giving it
only to you. Know what she said?

53
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:00,448
That it was crow meat.

54
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:05,119
That it may make me stupid. Jeez.

55
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:08,039
Mom's so funny.

56
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:11,459
So? Did you really believe
it was crow meat?

57
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:12,377
Yeah.

58
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:15,129
All the way
until I was in the eighth grade.

59
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:17,131
I was so hurt.

60
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:21,177
Only you got to eat
things like goat meat and ostrich meat.

61
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:22,553
Don't act all weak.

62
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:25,640
Hey. I want to throw it all up, okay?

63
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:28,351
But to be honest, I was pretty awesome.

64
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:30,353
That was because
you ate it all by yourself.

65
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:33,898
She gave me more
because I was so successful.

66
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:35,942
Fine, good for you.

67
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:41,614
When you were flying high,
all these people were saying

68
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:46,244
that you wouldn't last long
and waited for you to fail.

69
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:49,455
They said you couldn't do any better,

70
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:52,500
that you wouldn't climb any higher.

71
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:54,502
But you didn't bat an eye.

72
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:56,713
You crushed them and silenced them.

73
00:04:57,463 --> 00:05:00,091
That was why she gave
the black chicken only to me.

74
00:05:02,176 --> 00:05:03,219
But…

75
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:05,680
You know…

76
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:09,767
The match isn't over.

77
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:12,979
In reality,

78
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:15,815
the real match happens off the court.

79
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:17,317
Does it?

80
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:20,695
Then should I pull a Park Junyoung
and sock it to them?

81
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:25,325
Give Taeyang a chance to settle things.

82
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:28,619
Let her come clean about the past--

83
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:30,496
Later.

84
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,666
After I go to the restroom.

85
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,168
Sis.

86
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,128
Regardless,

87
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:40,631
I was the one who had the accident,

88
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:44,218
and I was the one who spewed out that lie.

89
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:45,178
Fine!

90
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:48,473
I didn't get hurt while training!

91
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:51,851
It was because I got drunk!
Let them mock me.

92
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:07,575
My reputation is completely ruined now.

93
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:11,621
Training players is probably
out of the question.

94
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:17,960
My life is ruined.

95
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:22,882
I've gone back to my life
from three years ago.

96
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:36,104
Contact me if you need comforting.

97
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,107
I don't care

98
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:42,485
if I'm just a friend or not even a friend.

99
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:45,738
You can use me any time.

100
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:54,956
Bull.

101
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:10,388
Did you read my emails?

102
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:13,057
I sent one every week…

103
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:16,561
for three years.

104
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:23,234
He won't be happy with her anyway.

105
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,279
I'd treat him better.

106
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:31,117
Don't get hurt during a match.

107
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:36,956
Coach. Did you catch him? Who was it?

108
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,459
Unfortunately, there were no CCTVs there.

109
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,044
They're checking
all the CCTVs in the area,

110
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,171
so let's wait a few days.

111
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:45,715
Okay.

112
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:58,269
Everyone's talking about Junyoung.

113
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:01,898
It's not easy for a badminton player
to get this famous.

114
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:03,191
Let me see.

115
00:08:04,358 --> 00:08:07,153
Junyoung must feel like dying right now.

116
00:08:07,236 --> 00:08:09,071
What a disgrace.

117
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:12,450
You realize at times like these
that fame isn't always a good thing.

118
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:14,202
Who cares about a player who retired?

119
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:15,995
I'm worried about Junghwan.

120
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:20,708
I'm taking a screenshot
of all the malicious comments.

121
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:21,876
Hey.

122
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:25,171
Use that time to train.

123
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:28,966
You're so pathetic,
I can't stand even sitting with you.

124
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:35,306
I'm leaving.

125
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:39,018
He's leaving because of you.

126
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:40,186
Who?

127
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:42,146
-You need a beat down.
-What?

128
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:47,610
Are you going to see Taeyang?

129
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:49,070
No.

130
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:52,740
Does she not plan to come back?

131
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:54,825
How would I know?

132
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:58,162
I'm sure Coach wants to make up with her.

133
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:00,456
Tell her to swallow her pride just once
and come back.

134
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,458
It's her loss to miss training.

135
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:04,669
You tell her yourself.

136
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:09,632
She doesn't listen to me,
but I'm sure she'll listen to you.

137
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:13,636
I know you two have a thing going.

138
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:20,893
Just kidding. I'm just kidding.

139
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:22,979
You think that's funny?

140
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:24,146
It is to me.

141
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:28,651
You're surprisingly really immature,
you know that?

142
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:36,158
Hello, Father.

143
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:38,661
Oh. Hi.

144
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:42,456
Okay. Go about your business.

145
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:45,418
"Father"?

146
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,183
Oh, my gosh!

147
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:03,769
What are you doing here?

148
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,022
Are you cooking? I'll take that.

149
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,357
You bought so much stuff.

150
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:10,359
Let's go. What should we eat?

151
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,862
What? To my place?

152
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:15,615
In other words,

153
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:18,868
my daughter Taeyang

154
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:22,038
is skipping training to rebel against you?

155
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:24,457
She's refusing to train, is that it?

156
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:28,669
Is it?

157
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:33,466
Gosh. All kids go through that phase
once in a while.

158
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:37,303
So… Don't scold her too much.

159
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:40,306
Help us out so that she'll come around.

160
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:41,766
Give her good advice--

161
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:45,144
I've raised my child all wrong.

162
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:47,772
Gosh.

163
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:52,109
-I'm sorry.
-Gosh.

164
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:53,069
What a dad.

165
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:55,363
My child has a nasty temper, doesn't she?

166
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:59,617
No, sir. She doesn't.
Taeyang has a pretty good disposition.

167
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,786
She has a great personality. Right?

168
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:03,537
Don't make assumptions.

169
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:04,705
No, no.

170
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:07,583
I've raised her wrong.

171
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:10,711
Even if people are nasty and despicable,

172
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:14,924
she should suck it up and deal with it.
That's what I should've taught her.

173
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:17,802
What's wrong with being dehumanized?

174
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:19,845
She'd regret it on her deathbed,
that's all.

175
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:24,016
-Hot!
-Darn it, Sibong…

176
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:28,521
Look, sir.

177
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:32,066
If you have a complaint towards me,
just be honest--

178
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:34,985
Excuse me! Replace the grill, please--

179
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:43,411
-Have a lettuce wrap.
-Yes, sir. I'll feed myself.

180
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:44,787
Okay. Let's eat.

181
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:48,332
Taeyang

182
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:52,128
becomes more and more tenacious
the more she's trampled on.

183
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:54,004
You know what I mean.

184
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:55,631
Driven by rage and tenacity.

185
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:58,134
Goodness, this isn't the Marines.

186
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:03,389
How cruelly has she been trampled on
that she couldn't even scream?

187
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:07,184
-Hot!
-Stop grilling.

188
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:09,103
Stop it, will you?

189
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:10,855
The meat was burning.

190
00:12:10,938 --> 00:12:12,273
Excuse me!

191
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:16,736
He said to replace the grill!
Will you do it, please!

192
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:19,905
-Sir, why are you yelling--
-The meat's burning!

193
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:22,950
-We can replace the grill!
-We need a new grill now!

194
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:24,827
-A new grill!
-Coming.

195
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:31,375
This feels strange.

196
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:34,462
Come and sit.

197
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:39,508
Let's go out. I'm so nervous
that my dad will come home…

198
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:51,020
-Hey.
-Are you okay?

199
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:53,189
Sorry I couldn't tend to you.

200
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:55,524
Sorry.

201
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,779
I was the one who turned off my phone.

202
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:06,243
It's fine since I saw you.
You should go now.

203
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:08,829
Were you hurt that I didn't call?

204
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:10,414
No.

205
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:12,041
It's the opposite.

206
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:16,962
Junyoung is hurting because of me.

207
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:20,549
She's being condemned by everyone

208
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:23,844
although I'm the one who deserves it.

209
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:25,387
But Taejun,

210
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:28,557
I'm happy to see you.

211
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:31,644
What's wrong with me?

212
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:38,234
I hate myself for that.

213
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,611
I feel guilty.

214
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:45,991
It's too hard to handle.

215
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,084
Let's go out.

216
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:57,795
Taking a walk is okay, right?

217
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:07,847
How long do you plan to skip training?

218
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:11,809
I need to settle things first.

219
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:15,563
Then I'll have to go and beg.

220
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:18,315
Settle things? How?

221
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:21,902
I need to go public
that it was all my fault.

222
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:23,863
Can you handle it?

223
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:28,158
People will tear you apart.

224
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:30,411
I deserve it.

225
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:34,123
That doesn't scare me.

226
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:39,169
I guess

227
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:42,256
I wanted to be honest.

228
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:48,012
It's not like I can stand tall

229
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:51,348
just because I come clean now, but still.

230
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,228
You have no idea

231
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:59,440
what it feels like
to walk with a bomb in your pocket.

232
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,736
Worrying about when it'll explode

233
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:06,739
and whether or not
I can handle it when it does.

234
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:10,451
Always stressing about it.

235
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:12,786
I do know.

236
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:18,250
I'm also carrying a bomb.

237
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,086
You have a secret?

238
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,004
Yes.

239
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:24,548
A mega huge one.

240
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:27,968
I'm too scared to let it explode

241
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:31,513
and clutching onto it.

242
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,099
What's the secret?

243
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:35,517
I'll tell you later.

244
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:37,978
Listen.

245
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:42,024
You can't run away
after you find out my secret, okay?

246
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:44,276
What the heck? You're scaring me.

247
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:47,571
Do you have a chronic illness?

248
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:50,532
Or are you not who you say you are?

249
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,117
Or…

250
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:55,037
Do you have another girl?

251
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:58,415
Your imagination is so limited.

252
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,668
Do you have a secret baby?

253
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:02,544
Did you knock someone up in high school--

254
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:04,296
I'm going to have a baby with you.

255
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:10,928
When should we get married?

256
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:14,139
I'd like to get married before I turn 30.

257
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:18,394
Are you saying
let's just get married first?

258
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,937
What is your secret?

259
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:23,232
Should we? Should we get married tomorrow?

260
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:26,193
Taeyang! Marry me!

261
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:27,403
Let's do it tomorrow!

262
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:29,029
Are you nuts?

263
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:30,781
We'll start in a rental apartment.

264
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:32,700
Since we don't have much,

265
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:35,911
we should combine forces
when times are tough!

266
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:39,331
Keep it down. What if we run into my dad?

267
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:42,042
Who cares? I'll buy a house in ten years!

268
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:43,627
Five years. One?

269
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:45,796
-Trust me.
-Be quiet. For someone who's broke,

270
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:47,464
-you talk a big game.
-So what?

271
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:49,383
Where should we live?
Where do you want to live?

272
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:52,678
-Say the word. I'll let you live anywhere!
-Quiet!

273
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:57,141
We should…

274
00:16:58,142 --> 00:16:59,727
bring these next time, right?

275
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:00,894
Yes.

276
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:06,191
Why are you so shocked?
You had suspected it too.

277
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:09,695
-I'm jealous.
-Of what?

278
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:11,155
They're going out.

279
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,700
Was there someone
you wanted to go out with?

280
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:16,994
There was.

281
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:20,622
Who?

282
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:23,459
Who do you think?

283
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:27,212
I'm so lonely. So very lonely.

284
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:29,131
Who was it?

285
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:31,800
Hey!

286
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:52,696
Dad.

287
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:57,951
Where were you at this hour?

288
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:00,829
I went for a walk.

289
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:02,956
I heard you went to the training center.

290
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:04,750
You should've talked to me.

291
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:08,545
They said they'll fire you
if you keep this up.

292
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:11,423
If you had a fight with a coach,

293
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:14,718
you should fight until you win.
If you avoid it--

294
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:16,386
Give me a few days.

295
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:19,181
I'll settle things and go back.

296
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:20,808
Settle what?

297
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:24,478
I just have a lot on my mind.

298
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:26,438
Good night.

299
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:29,858
If anything were to happen to you…

300
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:32,111
You're all I live for!

301
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:35,447
That brat.

302
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:39,535
Sorry.

303
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:51,755
Here you go.

304
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:07,479
JINCHEON NATIONAL TRAINING CENTER

305
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:09,982
Hey, Yideun.

306
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:12,609
Yideun!

307
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:16,321
Didn't you hear me?
Coach wants to see you.

308
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:18,115
Get moving.

309
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:19,741
Okay.

310
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:29,835
-Don't you have something to say to me?
-Like what?

311
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:32,004
Coach said he was going
to the security office.

312
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:33,297
Why does he want to see you?

313
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:36,508
How would I know?

314
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:41,388
Don't roll your eyes at me.
Look me in the eye.

315
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:45,809
You…

316
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:48,520
Junghwan! What's wrong with you?

317
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:53,859
Want me to repeat that?

318
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:56,778
Keep your mouth shut. Don't tell anyone.

319
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:59,323
No, Coach. Let me explain again.

320
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:00,782
I understood!

321
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:02,784
Junyoung's accident was your fault!

322
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:05,537
She took the blame to cover for you!

323
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:07,789
She couldn't tell the truth
because of you!

324
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,751
You should've told me back then.

325
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:12,461
I'm sorry, sir.

326
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:17,299
I'll explain that she's the victim
and that it was all my fault.

327
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:22,721
"Zealous Junyoung Park
was injured while training."

328
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:24,932
"The tragic player.
A loss to the badminton world."

329
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:27,476
I said that what,
like 100 times in my interviews?

330
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:29,978
Should I tell everyone I was an idiot

331
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:33,607
who couldn't keep my athletes in check
or figure out the truth

332
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:35,859
when the great and mighty
Park Junyoung was retiring?

333
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:39,738
"That's right. I didn't know.
They fooled me too."

334
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:42,032
Should I say that in front of the cameras?

335
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:43,951
I, the coach of the national team?

336
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,036
I'm…

337
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:48,622
very sorry, Coach.

338
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:50,666
But…

339
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:53,460
if we bury it like this, Junyoung--

340
00:20:53,543 --> 00:20:56,505
Hey. You completely fooled everyone.

341
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:58,840
Why are you acting nice now?

342
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:02,052
Aren't you the one who did this to her?

343
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:08,600
Keep quiet till things settle down.

344
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:11,019
It's not like she's some super celebrity.

345
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:12,813
Things will quiet down in a week.

346
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:16,650
Don't give people things to gossip about.

347
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:18,026
Coach.

348
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:22,322
It's another reporter.

349
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:27,828
Hi, Coach Choi.

350
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:31,123
What? Who hit whom?

351
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:36,128
Seriously!

352
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:37,421
That's right, I filmed it.

353
00:21:37,504 --> 00:21:39,965
-I did it as a joke--
-A joke?

354
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:43,260
-You…
-But I lost my phone.

355
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:46,346
I'm not stupid. I wouldn't post that.

356
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:49,641
It was obvious I'd be caught
if I posted it.

357
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:51,643
I really didn't post it.

358
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:52,561
Hey.

359
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:55,147
-Get up.
-May I?

360
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:56,189
Get up!

361
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:57,858
Thanks.

362
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:01,069
Hey. Do you expect me
to believe what you said?

363
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:02,612
Seriously.

364
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:06,116
Then trace the IP address or something.

365
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:09,703
Look. My career as an athlete
is on the line because of this too.

366
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:12,372
I'm also really a victim.

367
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:15,751
All I did was film it
because it was funny--

368
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:17,627
So, it was funny to you.

369
00:22:19,212 --> 00:22:20,964
You need to watch your mouth.

370
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:24,343
Look. I'm sincerely sorry
that your relationship

371
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:26,178
became public knowledge.

372
00:22:26,261 --> 00:22:27,637
I told you!

373
00:22:28,221 --> 00:22:29,514
Watch your mouth.

374
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:31,099
To be honest,

375
00:22:31,808 --> 00:22:33,769
Junyoung scammed the entire country.

376
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:36,688
-She deserved--
-Watch your mouth, bastard!

377
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:39,816
Watch what you say.

378
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,694
It was a joke? It was funny?

379
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:44,488
What do you think you're doing?

380
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:59,628
Coach. Do you mean it?

381
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:04,466
Will you really cut Taeyang
if she doesn't come back soon?

382
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:07,386
I mean it.

383
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:12,557
You should only be considerate to someone
when they meet their basic obligations.

384
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:15,685
Stick to protocol.

385
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:18,480
Okay.

386
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:26,530
Are you very disappointed in Taeyang?

387
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:32,786
-Mix some rice in that.
-Okay.

388
00:23:34,996 --> 00:23:38,708
Excuse me. May we get a large bowl?
We want to mix some rice with this.

389
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:41,837
Sesame oil.

390
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,089
Excuse me, can you put
some sesame oil over it?

391
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:45,215
To mix some rice.

392
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:48,760
She's really being skimpy
with that sesame oil.

393
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:51,930
They're going to cut Taeyang?

394
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:54,558
Yes. That was what Coach said.

395
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:59,604
But… Weren't you going to the doctor,
and you to take a nap?

396
00:23:59,896 --> 00:24:01,148
Why were you at the restaurant?

397
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:05,610
Who cares about that right now?
They're going to cut Taeyang.

398
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:07,404
I care. That matters more.

399
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:10,407
Since when did we care about Taeyang?

400
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:12,826
It's true we didn't care.

401
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:14,953
We were

402
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:17,539
really mean to her.

403
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:28,925
It's fine normally,
but it hurts whenever it rains.

404
00:24:30,051 --> 00:24:31,470
Will it be like this forever?

405
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:35,891
Pain is one thing, but it's annoying.
I mean, it's every time it rains.

406
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:37,851
It's a long-term effect.
You can't avoid it.

407
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:43,148
Long-term effects…

408
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:44,816
These annoying long-term effects.

409
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:51,114
These annoying reporters.

410
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:54,075
So you're getting a lot of calls?

411
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:57,287
I don't like that look. Put it away.

412
00:25:05,712 --> 00:25:06,546
What the heck?

413
00:25:10,091 --> 00:25:11,218
Hello.

414
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:14,513
I'm a badminton player.

415
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:15,972
Hi.

416
00:25:16,556 --> 00:25:17,557
Wait.

417
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:20,644
Want to get some coffee?

418
00:25:20,727 --> 00:25:23,021
-No.
-How about dinner?

419
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:25,315
This is uncomfortable.

420
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:28,568
Then do you want to watch a movie?

421
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:32,781
What did I just say?

422
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:35,325
Fine.

423
00:25:35,408 --> 00:25:37,244
-What?
-Let's watch a movie.

424
00:25:39,454 --> 00:25:40,455
What?

425
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:50,674
Hey. What are you doing here?

426
00:25:51,132 --> 00:25:53,718
This is my room too. Did you forget?

427
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:56,846
It's the room you come to
whenever you cause trouble.

428
00:25:58,515 --> 00:25:59,474
What is it this time?

429
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:01,101
Assaulting an athlete.

430
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:03,353
Congrats.

431
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:06,982
But you're not going to ask me
to let you sleep here, are you?

432
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:09,568
Please leave
before I get out of the shower.

433
00:26:20,036 --> 00:26:21,204
What is it? What happened?

434
00:26:21,788 --> 00:26:24,040
The jerk who filmed Junyoung and me.

435
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:27,377
We caught him.

436
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:30,171
What? Who was it?

437
00:26:34,884 --> 00:26:37,178
What was that?
You badmouthed my mom again, didn't you?

438
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:39,472
No. She said
she wouldn't come for a while.

439
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:42,267
-What?
-I'm so happy!

440
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:44,144
I'm so happy!

441
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:52,569
Excuse me.

442
00:26:53,528 --> 00:26:54,821
Your phone's going off.

443
00:26:55,196 --> 00:26:56,197
Sorry.

444
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:58,742
KIM KYUNG SIK - REPORTER

445
00:27:13,214 --> 00:27:16,009
Junyoung, it's hard, isn't it?

446
00:27:16,092 --> 00:27:17,260
PARK TAEYANG

447
00:27:17,927 --> 00:27:20,096
If I could turn back time,

448
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:23,308
I'd go back to that day three years ago.

449
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:29,731
All I did was regret
and accomplished nothing.

450
00:27:30,565 --> 00:27:32,859
Regrets are powerless.

451
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:38,365
I won't make the same mistake this time.

452
00:27:39,115 --> 00:27:40,950
I won't hide behind your back.

453
00:27:42,118 --> 00:27:44,287
Trust me and wait a little.

454
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,970
Thanks for the movie. Bye.

455
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:44,556
Wait a second.

456
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:47,350
I like Yook Junghwan.

457
00:28:47,934 --> 00:28:49,894
No. I liked him.

458
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,564
That's why I'm your hater.

459
00:28:53,189 --> 00:28:56,568
"Bring Park Junyoung down."
That's my goal right now.

460
00:28:57,277 --> 00:28:58,111
And?

461
00:28:58,194 --> 00:29:02,115
I mean,
I should be the one to cry, not you.

462
00:29:02,198 --> 00:29:03,867
I'm the one who wants to cry.

463
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:08,538
But it's not like
I can ignore a person who was crying.

464
00:29:09,205 --> 00:29:12,876
Must I cheer you up
and say things to encourage you?

465
00:29:14,335 --> 00:29:17,088
That makes zero sense. Don't you agree?

466
00:29:18,548 --> 00:29:21,176
So? What is your point?

467
00:29:22,552 --> 00:29:24,763
Can't you just be cool and annoying?

468
00:29:26,389 --> 00:29:29,601
So that I can hate you freely
and be rude to you?

469
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:33,104
So that I can actively try
to bring you down?

470
00:29:35,565 --> 00:29:37,942
Why am I such a busybody?

471
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:40,445
I take it back.

472
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,114
Why do I care?

473
00:29:45,241 --> 00:29:46,117
Bye.

474
00:29:49,662 --> 00:29:51,122
What's your name?

475
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:52,957
Forget it!

476
00:29:57,879 --> 00:30:00,048
Somang Bank's Lee Yumin.

477
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:03,051
She's cute.

478
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:19,108
If you bring that up
and make me a laughing stock,

479
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:22,153
I'll make sure
you never hold a racket again.

480
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:26,241
You won't even be able to get a job
as a coach at an elementary school.

481
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:43,925
Who is it?

482
00:30:47,595 --> 00:30:49,222
-Who--
-Hi, Taeyang.

483
00:30:49,305 --> 00:30:50,431
Hi.

484
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:52,934
What are you two doing here?

485
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:56,271
Taeyang, do you prefer flowers or cake?

486
00:30:57,772 --> 00:31:01,234
I kept saying let's bring you flowers,
but he insisted on bringing cake.

487
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:03,194
So we made a bet.

488
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:04,821
Food's the best, right?

489
00:31:04,904 --> 00:31:07,323
Whatever. Girls like flowers the most.

490
00:31:08,908 --> 00:31:11,035
See? She's smiling at the flower.

491
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:12,370
What? Me?

492
00:31:13,162 --> 00:31:15,456
Anyway, when are you coming back?

493
00:31:16,499 --> 00:31:18,459
Why don't you come back now?

494
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:19,752
Yes. Come back.

495
00:31:21,337 --> 00:31:23,256
Thanks, both of you.

496
00:31:38,938 --> 00:31:40,732
Come back starting tomorrow.

497
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:43,276
Because of you, the team's mood--

498
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:45,236
To be honest, it's not that bad.

499
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:48,907
Come back.

500
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:52,660
Hey. You won't have a place
to come back to if you keep this up.

501
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:56,331
Are you worrying about me right now?

502
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:57,498
Gosh.

503
00:31:58,666 --> 00:32:01,044
Please come back.
We have a connection, don't we?

504
00:32:08,801 --> 00:32:09,761
Youngsim.

505
00:32:10,678 --> 00:32:13,306
You look fine.
You're not injured, are you?

506
00:32:13,389 --> 00:32:15,683
No. Do you want to come in and…

507
00:32:17,393 --> 00:32:20,396
My dad should be home soon.
Want to go out--

508
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,315
You look fine, so it's all good.

509
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:28,905
Later.

510
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:36,079
Anyway, is there a problem?

511
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:38,122
Feel free to tell me about it.

512
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:45,546
Thank you.

513
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:49,008
Taeyang. You're so frustrating.

514
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:50,176
Youngsim.

515
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:53,846
I know you've been looking out for me.

516
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:56,015
Ever since we were on the national team.

517
00:32:57,767 --> 00:33:01,312
But do you know something?
I was never afraid of you.

518
00:33:03,564 --> 00:33:04,732
Because

519
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:07,068
you're a kind person.

520
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:13,199
Taeyang.

521
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:18,121
You should say these things

522
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:21,249
the moment before you croak.

523
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:23,418
You're grossing me out.

524
00:33:24,877 --> 00:33:25,962
Later.

525
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:53,990
Do you think anyone would support
Taeyang and my relationship?

526
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:57,076
No, right?

527
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,995
Once everyone finds out what happened

528
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:01,414
between her and my sister…

529
00:34:01,497 --> 00:34:04,417
Everyone will criticize you.

530
00:34:05,793 --> 00:34:08,212
How could you go out with someone
who did that to your sister?

531
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:11,549
How could Taeyang go out
with Junyoung's brother?

532
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:14,761
Isn't it only natural?

533
00:34:14,844 --> 00:34:16,554
You make it sound like

534
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:20,141
we really don't have a conscience.

535
00:34:20,683 --> 00:34:22,977
Both Taeyang and me.

536
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:26,522
You can ignore everyone else.

537
00:34:28,983 --> 00:34:30,443
But what about your family?

538
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,531
This isn't a game you can win.

539
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:38,743
It's not about winning or losing.

540
00:34:43,831 --> 00:34:44,999
You know…

541
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:49,045
That once-in-a-lifetime match.

542
00:34:52,006 --> 00:34:54,050
When you feel like a miracle won't happen,

543
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:57,345
you feel like your lungs will give in,

544
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:01,766
and you want to just drop to the floor.

545
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:05,061
However,

546
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:11,526
you're so excited and it's so much fun,

547
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:17,198
that you want to keep playing.

548
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:23,371
You hope it will never end.

549
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:28,543
A match that's worth dying for.

550
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:31,337
Have you ever played in one?

551
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:06,497
This is a video of my final training
of 5,000 hits.

552
00:36:07,206 --> 00:36:08,291
I'll begin now.

553
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,134
General.

554
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:20,261
Let's do this.

555
00:36:34,775 --> 00:36:37,987
Are you really giving this to me? Why?

556
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:40,907
Because I've rooted for you
since I was 12.

557
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:46,787
I'll be there…

558
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:49,582
for as long as you want me.

559
00:36:58,299 --> 00:37:00,468
We'll have a moment
like that someday, right?

560
00:37:01,677 --> 00:37:04,889
The moment we become our strongest selves.

561
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:13,856
This is a video of my final training
of 5,000 hits.

562
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:16,275
-Final training?
-I'll begin now.

563
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:19,654
That's 4,996.

564
00:37:20,696 --> 00:37:22,615
That's 4,997.

565
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:25,743
That's 4,998.

566
00:37:26,702 --> 00:37:28,454
That's 4,999.

567
00:37:52,144 --> 00:37:53,604
Five thousand hits, done.

568
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:55,856
Training's over.

569
00:38:05,074 --> 00:38:06,784
If she got hurt after drinking,

570
00:38:06,867 --> 00:38:09,829
does that make her gold medal
that she killed herself to win worthless?

571
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:12,957
What does it matter if it was alcohol
or a car accident?

572
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:16,419
Goodness. I've never seen her
get this angry before.

573
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:19,714
Gosh. You can't control your kids.

574
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:22,466
Why are you trying to save face
between us?

575
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:23,467
She's right.

576
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:26,387
I'm thankful to Junyoung.

577
00:38:27,054 --> 00:38:29,390
She was always too good for me.

578
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:33,978
If you're going to gossip about my child,
I'll never talk to you again.

579
00:38:34,061 --> 00:38:36,731
-I didn't say anything.
-I was just…

580
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:39,233
-Why are you getting mad?
-Hi, Junyoung.

581
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:41,485
-Hello.
-We'll just go.

582
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:42,987
-Okay. Let's go.
-Let's go.

583
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:44,697
-Hi.
-Bye.

584
00:38:49,618 --> 00:38:50,953
Hey.

585
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:52,913
What is it?

586
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:54,874
You rock.

587
00:38:56,208 --> 00:38:58,044
My mom's the best.

588
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:03,299
Did you hear? Don't mind them.

589
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:06,469
Those crazy old broads.

590
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:08,888
Is there anything I can do?

591
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:11,474
Put these there, right?

592
00:39:20,149 --> 00:39:21,108
Sorry.

593
00:39:22,735 --> 00:39:24,737
Your parents are useless.

594
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,365
What do you mean?

595
00:39:27,948 --> 00:39:29,241
In times like these,

596
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:32,661
it would be nice to give you money
and tell you to just start a business

597
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:35,247
rather than put up with that garbage.

598
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:39,126
But we can't help you
when you're hurting the most.

599
00:39:40,419 --> 00:39:42,213
I'm so sorry.

600
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:44,965
Mom.

601
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:48,469
Why don't you ask

602
00:39:50,596 --> 00:39:54,433
what happened and whether or not
those articles are true?

603
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:11,992
I believe

604
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:14,537
only what you tell me.

605
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:19,125
Whom else would I believe
other than my child?

606
00:40:36,183 --> 00:40:38,477
I was trying to cover for a junior player.

607
00:40:38,727 --> 00:40:40,312
That was why I couldn't tell you.

608
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:43,858
What?

609
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:45,317
Sorry.

610
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:48,279
I was wrong.

611
00:40:48,904 --> 00:40:50,698
A junior player… What?

612
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:56,787
Who?

613
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:41,707
Hi, Mom.

614
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:46,795
I'm going to your dorm,
so step out for a bit.

615
00:42:03,562 --> 00:42:04,772
What is it?

616
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:06,732
Let's talk indoors.

617
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:09,151
This looks good.

618
00:42:10,277 --> 00:42:11,570
What is it?

619
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:22,206
Get me a cold cola.

620
00:42:38,305 --> 00:42:39,431
Hey, Junyoung.

621
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:42,059
Is something going on at home?

622
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:43,978
Mom's here.

623
00:42:51,318 --> 00:42:52,403
Here.

624
00:42:53,612 --> 00:42:55,948
It's the best burger they have here.

625
00:42:56,615 --> 00:42:58,701
I said a cola was good enough.

626
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:02,162
Did you not have dinner yet?

627
00:43:02,454 --> 00:43:05,416
Gosh. You should eat something better.

628
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:08,002
You were the one
who brought me here, okay?

629
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:09,420
Right.

630
00:43:10,629 --> 00:43:11,672
That's true.

631
00:43:14,883 --> 00:43:18,429
We should've gone to a real restaurant.
I wasn't thinking straight.

632
00:43:23,809 --> 00:43:24,893
Why are you here?

633
00:43:29,064 --> 00:43:30,691
I wanted to see you.

634
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:33,986
Really? You're not lying?

635
00:43:35,321 --> 00:43:37,281
Why would I lie?

636
00:43:54,256 --> 00:43:56,342
What's wrong? Did you bite your cheek?

637
00:43:56,425 --> 00:43:59,386
Seriously. Why can't you ask me?

638
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:02,222
Junyoung told me.

639
00:44:02,514 --> 00:44:03,682
Didn't you come from Chuncheon

640
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:07,436
to ask about what happened to her?

641
00:44:08,604 --> 00:44:09,605
Yes.

642
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:12,650
I did.

643
00:44:16,028 --> 00:44:17,446
But I don't want to.

644
00:44:19,531 --> 00:44:20,616
Why not?

645
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:24,286
At first, I was so angry

646
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:26,205
that I rushed over without thinking.

647
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:31,085
But once I got here,

648
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:33,796
I came to.

649
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:38,842
There must be a reason why
Junyoung won't tell me everything.

650
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:42,846
If I go to that junior player,
cause a scene,

651
00:44:43,806 --> 00:44:45,766
and end up upsetting my daughter,

652
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:47,935
what's the point?

653
00:44:49,812 --> 00:44:51,897
She'll tell me when the time is right.

654
00:44:52,648 --> 00:44:53,732
I'll…

655
00:44:57,277 --> 00:44:58,987
just wait.

656
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,744
How are you like that?

657
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:08,622
All moms are like that.

658
00:45:10,332 --> 00:45:11,291
I'm just

659
00:45:12,459 --> 00:45:14,461
sorry to the two of you.

660
00:45:15,045 --> 00:45:16,880
You two are the ones who are hurt.

661
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:21,510
I'm just sorry for everything.

662
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:26,974
If you're sorry, then eat your burger.

663
00:45:29,643 --> 00:45:30,853
It's not good eating alone.

664
00:45:32,479 --> 00:45:35,399
That's not good. I'll eat too.

665
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:46,034
Don't I look ugly?

666
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:50,581
You look pretty.

667
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:55,461
The prettiest ever.

668
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:01,383
Drink your soda.

669
00:46:01,467 --> 00:46:02,509
Okay.

670
00:46:15,564 --> 00:46:16,732
Taejun.

671
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:19,276
Yes?

672
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:24,823
The snow is really pretty outside.

673
00:46:57,147 --> 00:46:58,649
You looked good.

674
00:46:58,732 --> 00:47:01,193
Come in tomorrow. Let's chat.

675
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:14,665
PARK TAEJUN

676
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,134
Taejun!

677
00:47:28,387 --> 00:47:29,304
Where is he?

678
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:32,808
Is he not here yet?

679
00:47:45,487 --> 00:47:46,572
What are you doing?

680
00:47:47,114 --> 00:47:49,116
-You startled me.
-Did I get you?

681
00:47:50,284 --> 00:47:51,451
My heart's racing.

682
00:47:53,245 --> 00:47:54,496
It's saying,

683
00:47:54,872 --> 00:47:57,374
"What's wrong with her? I almost burst."

684
00:47:58,083 --> 00:48:00,085
Is your heart a girl?

685
00:48:00,669 --> 00:48:02,045
Oh. Guess not.

686
00:48:03,297 --> 00:48:05,090
I'm kind of annoyed.

687
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:08,385
-Tell her to come out.
-No.

688
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:10,429
It'll go crazy if you touch it.

689
00:48:10,846 --> 00:48:11,930
It'll explode.

690
00:48:12,014 --> 00:48:15,017
Exactly. I want to see how it goes crazy.

691
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:16,476
Tell it to come out.

692
00:48:16,685 --> 00:48:18,937
-Come out.
-What are you doing?

693
00:48:19,021 --> 00:48:22,190
-Get over here.
-Stop that. No.

694
00:48:22,774 --> 00:48:24,151
Come here. What do you mean, no?

695
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:45,088
It really is racing.

696
00:48:47,633 --> 00:48:48,634
It is.

697
00:48:49,217 --> 00:48:51,345
It's beating like crazy.

698
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:54,097
I know. I can feel it.

699
00:48:56,725 --> 00:49:00,103
I have to tell you something,

700
00:49:01,438 --> 00:49:02,773
so I'm super nervous.

701
00:49:06,902 --> 00:49:08,028
Tell me what?

702
00:49:09,905 --> 00:49:11,531
But first, I have something for you.

703
00:49:21,333 --> 00:49:22,918
I bought it on my way here.

704
00:49:25,003 --> 00:49:26,380
It's a bribe.

705
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:30,467
Why? What is it?

706
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:46,733
Park Junyoung

707
00:49:48,443 --> 00:49:49,611
is my sister.

708
00:49:57,285 --> 00:49:58,328
She's

709
00:49:59,371 --> 00:50:00,455
my sister.

710
00:50:12,634 --> 00:50:13,760
So…

711
00:50:15,512 --> 00:50:16,763
Junyoung…

712
00:50:19,266 --> 00:50:20,308
is your…

713
00:50:21,435 --> 00:50:24,521
Sorry for not telling you sooner.

714
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:32,404
I know it'll be hard,

715
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:34,823
but let's stand firm.

716
00:50:39,411 --> 00:50:40,495
Okay.

717
00:50:42,622 --> 00:50:43,707
Taeyang.

718
00:50:44,291 --> 00:50:45,375
It…

719
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:48,295
must've been hard for you.

720
00:50:53,508 --> 00:50:55,469
You couldn't tell me…

721
00:50:59,097 --> 00:51:01,141
It must've been really hard by yourself.

722
00:51:05,062 --> 00:51:08,023
It must've eaten away at you inside.

723
00:51:15,238 --> 00:51:16,406
Don't worry about me.

724
00:51:17,991 --> 00:51:19,034
You know,

725
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:24,206
just looking at the light on
in your room makes me happy.

726
00:51:26,792 --> 00:51:28,877
It just does. It makes me happy.

727
00:51:31,713 --> 00:51:33,006
So I was happy about everything.

728
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:56,321
I admit I was out of line
by resorting to violence.

729
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:00,826
Regardless of the reason,
I was wrong and regret my actions.

730
00:52:05,997 --> 00:52:09,209
Per Article 25, Section 1, Paragraph 3

731
00:52:09,292 --> 00:52:12,170
of the rules of
the Badminton Korea Association,

732
00:52:12,254 --> 00:52:15,090
upon considering the facts
of the assault incident,

733
00:52:15,215 --> 00:52:18,635
in accordance with Article 27,
Section 2, Paragraph 1,

734
00:52:19,219 --> 00:52:21,972
The one in regard, Yook Junghwan,

735
00:52:22,055 --> 00:52:24,808
will be expelled from the national team.

736
00:52:34,734 --> 00:52:35,861
Taeyang?

737
00:52:36,945 --> 00:52:40,115
Yes. She said it was her final training.

738
00:52:40,949 --> 00:52:42,159
It was strange.

739
00:52:45,287 --> 00:52:47,122
Talk to her and bring her back.

740
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:49,082
Taejun!

741
00:52:50,667 --> 00:52:53,128
Hello, Coach.
I didn't know you were here too.

742
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:54,296
What is it?

743
00:52:55,255 --> 00:52:56,673
How do I…

744
00:52:57,799 --> 00:52:59,968
You'll all find out eventually.

745
00:53:00,051 --> 00:53:01,511
What is it?

746
00:53:01,595 --> 00:53:03,889
You need to look at this.

747
00:53:03,972 --> 00:53:05,307
You haven't seen it either, right?

748
00:53:07,225 --> 00:53:08,852
Taeyang posted something.

749
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:17,861
Park Junyoung was trying to protect me

750
00:53:18,778 --> 00:53:22,240
and had to lie that she was injured
while training alone.

751
00:53:23,158 --> 00:53:24,201
And I…

752
00:53:25,076 --> 00:53:27,370
I was relieved.

753
00:53:28,246 --> 00:53:31,082
I was cowardly and selfish.

754
00:53:32,292 --> 00:53:34,961
I ruined Park Junyoung's career

755
00:53:35,212 --> 00:53:38,465
and hid behind her
and avoided taking responsibility.

756
00:53:39,216 --> 00:53:41,426
It was all my fault.

757
00:53:42,677 --> 00:53:44,012
I'm sorry.

758
00:53:51,269 --> 00:53:52,771
Have some juice.

759
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:57,192
Our coffee tastes bad.

760
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:01,738
I'm hungry. Give me something to eat.

761
00:54:02,322 --> 00:54:03,156
Food?

762
00:54:04,741 --> 00:54:08,536
I don't have access to a stove here.

763
00:54:09,162 --> 00:54:12,666
Hold on. I'll go to a restaurant--

764
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:14,584
Give me anything.

765
00:54:15,669 --> 00:54:17,837
I haven't had anything to eat all day.

766
00:54:31,601 --> 00:54:34,187
It's just a simple lunchbox.

767
00:54:36,189 --> 00:54:37,732
Let's order delivery.

768
00:54:39,609 --> 00:54:42,779
You never cared what I ate
my entire life anyway.

769
00:55:19,441 --> 00:55:20,817
Why did you abandon me?

770
00:55:23,695 --> 00:55:24,863
No.

771
00:55:27,949 --> 00:55:29,534
Why did you give birth to me?

772
00:55:36,708 --> 00:55:38,460
Are you here
to vent your resentment at me?

773
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:44,007
Leave then.

774
00:55:44,924 --> 00:55:46,426
I hate things like this.

775
00:55:47,552 --> 00:55:49,304
So do I,

776
00:55:49,971 --> 00:55:51,514
but I came to torment you.

777
00:55:54,934 --> 00:55:58,313
You left to live your own life. Fine.

778
00:56:01,316 --> 00:56:02,942
But when Grandma died

779
00:56:03,026 --> 00:56:05,695
and I was all alone,
why didn't you take me?

780
00:56:06,488 --> 00:56:07,530
Why did you

781
00:56:08,823 --> 00:56:10,575
let me be adopted?

782
00:56:12,702 --> 00:56:14,037
So that you could play badminton.

783
00:56:18,625 --> 00:56:20,293
If you had lived with me,

784
00:56:21,002 --> 00:56:23,171
I would've only gotten in your way.

785
00:56:24,547 --> 00:56:25,590
Wow.

786
00:56:27,884 --> 00:56:29,594
You say it was for me.

787
00:56:31,388 --> 00:56:32,555
Do you know

788
00:56:34,182 --> 00:56:36,267
how I felt as I played badminton?

789
00:56:40,563 --> 00:56:42,107
"What if Dad leaves me too

790
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:45,568
because I don't do well at badminton?"

791
00:56:48,071 --> 00:56:49,531
"What if my adoption is canceled

792
00:56:50,532 --> 00:56:52,450
because I don't do well at badminton?"

793
00:56:55,078 --> 00:56:56,955
Do you know how pathetically…

794
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:02,168
how pathetically…

795
00:57:04,129 --> 00:57:05,880
I clung on to badminton?

796
00:57:06,297 --> 00:57:08,216
What could I do?

797
00:57:10,677 --> 00:57:12,095
I was young.

798
00:57:13,805 --> 00:57:15,765
I wasn't even legally married
and had you--

799
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:18,309
That was your problem.

800
00:57:18,768 --> 00:57:20,478
You should've raised your child

801
00:57:20,562 --> 00:57:23,064
and fed her
even if this was all you could provide.

802
00:57:23,857 --> 00:57:24,899
Does love cost money?

803
00:57:30,155 --> 00:57:32,740
Of course, love costs money.

804
00:57:34,868 --> 00:57:36,744
Everything costs money.

805
00:57:45,170 --> 00:57:46,337
Don't make excuses.

806
00:57:48,923 --> 00:57:49,757
You…

807
00:57:50,592 --> 00:57:52,385
simply didn't love me.

808
00:57:54,262 --> 00:57:57,223
Why didn't you love me?

809
00:57:59,601 --> 00:58:00,435
Was I

810
00:58:01,561 --> 00:58:02,562
too ugly?

811
00:58:04,689 --> 00:58:06,441
Was I not even cute?

812
00:58:08,818 --> 00:58:09,819
Why…

813
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:13,031
Why didn't you love me?

814
00:58:15,408 --> 00:58:18,870
Why did you abandon me?
Why did you make me

815
00:58:18,953 --> 00:58:22,790
so desperate for the love
that everyone else received?

816
00:58:23,208 --> 00:58:25,001
Why did you…

817
00:58:32,383 --> 00:58:33,760
Why did you…

818
00:58:36,971 --> 00:58:39,390
make me want love above all else?

819
00:58:46,814 --> 00:58:48,066
I will…

820
00:58:51,903 --> 00:58:53,446
never come here again.

821
00:59:04,082 --> 00:59:05,959
How can I break up with him?

822
00:59:08,461 --> 00:59:12,006
He gave me something
even my parents didn't give me.

823
00:59:15,343 --> 00:59:17,136
How can I break up with him?

824
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:36,781
Let's go.

825
00:59:38,366 --> 00:59:39,826
I'll see you again, ma'am.

826
00:59:41,369 --> 00:59:42,203
Let's go.

827
01:00:06,436 --> 01:00:07,562
Let go of me.

828
01:00:11,733 --> 01:00:12,734
Taejun!

829
01:00:13,651 --> 01:00:14,569
Look…

830
01:00:17,697 --> 01:00:19,616
You need to let me go.

831
01:00:22,118 --> 01:00:24,746
Why don't you hate me
for what I did to your sister?

832
01:00:25,246 --> 01:00:27,540
Shouldn't you curse me out?

833
01:00:27,707 --> 01:00:28,875
How could you know it all and…

834
01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:35,923
Did you feel sorry for me?

835
01:00:36,341 --> 01:00:38,468
-Did you pity me?
-That's enough.

836
01:00:39,677 --> 01:00:41,095
I'm about to get mad.

837
01:00:41,179 --> 01:00:42,513
Snap out of it.

838
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:45,433
We can never be.

839
01:00:46,726 --> 01:00:48,144
Snap out of it.

840
01:00:48,227 --> 01:00:50,605
-Let's snap out of it!
-I can't!

841
01:00:52,190 --> 01:00:53,900
I can't make it without you.

842
01:00:57,862 --> 01:00:59,489
Why don't you think about me at all?

843
01:01:00,907 --> 01:01:01,866
What about my feelings?

844
01:01:03,034 --> 01:01:05,244
Do I feel sorry for you? No.

845
01:01:06,537 --> 01:01:08,081
I simply love you.

846
01:01:08,665 --> 01:01:10,458
I simply love you, that's all!

847
01:01:28,851 --> 01:01:30,728
THANKS TO PARK MIHYUN
FOR HER SPECIAL APPEARANCE.

848
01:02:08,641 --> 01:02:09,767
GOING TO YOU AT A SPEED OF 493KM

849
01:02:09,851 --> 01:02:11,853
