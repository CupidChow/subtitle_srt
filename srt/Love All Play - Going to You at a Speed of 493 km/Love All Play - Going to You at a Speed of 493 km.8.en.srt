1
00:00:37,787 --> 00:00:40,790
GOING TO YOU AT A SPEED OF 493KM

2
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,586
THE PLACES, PEOPLE, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTIONAL

3
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:48,048
-Sorry we're late!
-Sorry for being late!

4
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:49,424
I'm very sorry.

5
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:51,217
Sir.

6
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:52,594
What happened?

7
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:56,014
Answer me.

8
00:00:56,097 --> 00:00:58,558
We had sashimi somewhere
a little far away.

9
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:00,643
Sashimi?

10
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:03,396
Together? All night?

11
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:05,482
The thing is…

12
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:08,860
I didn't get selected
to play in the team match

13
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,862
and wanted to kill myself for it.

14
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:13,490
And I knew I'd want to live
if I ate something alive,

15
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:14,866
so I talked Taejun into coming.

16
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:16,618
What do you mean?

17
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:19,287
So you wanted to live

18
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:21,581
and talked him into… sashimi…

19
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:23,958
Right.

20
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:28,046
You stayed out together last night.

21
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:31,174
Staying out together--

22
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:32,217
Taejun!

23
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,761
Hey, Taejun. A word?

24
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:37,180
I'll get going.

25
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:38,932
What's going on here?

26
00:01:39,015 --> 00:01:40,809
-Put on a smile. Okay?
-Coach, I…

27
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:42,018
Taeyang.

28
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:44,020
Get over there.

29
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,360
-What?
-I mean,

30
00:01:50,985 --> 00:01:53,947
you'll play with Jiho
in the individual match.

31
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:57,033
But what if you pair up with Junghwan
for the team match?

32
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:59,452
I want to hear your thoughts.

33
00:02:00,036 --> 00:02:01,496
You want me to be Yook Junghwan's…

34
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:02,664
partner?

35
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:04,457
Yes, part… partner.

36
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,626
What's wrong? Can't do it?

37
00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:16,427
-Here's your coffee.
-Just…

38
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:18,763
give them penalty points and end it there.

39
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:22,600
Let's not kill morale
before the tournament.

40
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:25,395
But a man and woman
stayed out all night without permission.

41
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:27,939
For the sake of our time,
we can't let this slide.

42
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:29,065
-Coffee's ready.
-Wait.

43
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:32,318
Are the two going out or something?

44
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:33,987
Here's what I think.

45
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:36,156
Take your coffee first.

46
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,824
-Right.
-Thank you.

47
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:39,826
Dating a teammate? Taeyang?

48
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:42,328
She would never do anything
that would hinder her game.

49
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:44,539
Agreed.

50
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:48,751
And Taejun is doing us a favor,

51
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:50,128
so let's stop here.

52
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:51,963
There should be give-and-take.

53
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:53,089
What favor?

54
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:55,425
To be Junghwan's partner
for the team match.

55
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:57,886
What do you think? Wouldn't that be fun?

56
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:04,392
Anyone got a light?

57
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:06,436
You agreed to it?

58
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:08,062
Why would I partner with--

59
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:13,776
Gosh, you're ambitious.

60
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,486
Did you want to play with me?

61
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:16,738
Hey, Taejun.

62
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:18,990
If I'm a jet, you're a scooter.

63
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:20,700
You're no match for me.

64
00:03:20,783 --> 00:03:22,952
I'm the sky, you're the ground.

65
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:24,412
Is that the same level?

66
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:27,123
How dare you try to be
on the same court as me?

67
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,209
I like that attitude.

68
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:30,710
So,

69
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:33,838
make sure you say no to Coach.

70
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:35,965
What?

71
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:40,428
Wait a minute. So you get to be
the one that listens well,

72
00:03:40,511 --> 00:03:42,222
while I have to be the one
who makes a scene?

73
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:43,890
Exactly.

74
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:46,017
You're sly.

75
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:47,435
Why would I do that?

76
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:49,854
Do you think I'm in a position
to go up against Coach?

77
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:51,731
Just do it.

78
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:54,525
Forget about minding your manners.

79
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:59,113
Just do what you always do.
It should be easy.

80
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:03,326
Hey. Hello? Taejun?

81
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:05,745
He hung up on me?

82
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:21,427
She didn't get injured
while playing badminton.

83
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:26,432
She didn't want to go,

84
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:28,893
but I dragged her there.

85
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:32,397
I made her drink

86
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:36,025
and I caused the accident.

87
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:39,070
I knew she was hurt,
but I didn't take her to the hospital.

88
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:43,116
Because I was afraid of being disciplined
during the stupid winter training.

89
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:46,494
I thought it was nothing serious.

90
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:54,210
It's Park Junyoung,

91
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:56,671
isn't it?

92
00:04:58,673 --> 00:04:59,674
Yes.

93
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:17,650
When I see you now,

94
00:05:18,609 --> 00:05:20,611
what look should I have on my face?

95
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:36,502
CHUNCHEON HOTEL

96
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:39,630
Gosh.

97
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:40,840
-We're here.
-Let's go.

98
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:41,924
WELCOME, BADMINTON PLAYERS

99
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:42,925
-Hello.
-Hello.

100
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:46,054
How have you been?

101
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:53,227
I guess all the athletes are staying here.

102
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:55,897
Has it been a while
since you've been to a match like this?

103
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:59,150
Jeez. I can feel the tension in the air.

104
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,319
I like it.

105
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:02,403
It feels like home.

106
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:07,658
Taeyang, you're in the team match, right?

107
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:10,620
No, Sungsil will play in the team match.

108
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:11,537
But why?

109
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:15,375
Oh, that's right.

110
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:17,710
Don't take it personally.

111
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:22,548
Still, you're Park Taeyang.
Coach is harsh.

112
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:25,134
Why did I think it was obvious you'd play?

113
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:30,598
Darn it. Why, that little…

114
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:32,558
Did she just insult us both?

115
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:35,978
Two birds with one stone.
She's something else.

116
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,271
She's going to go far.

117
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:40,274
Taeyang, shouldn't we
have a word with her?

118
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:43,486
Didn't you know that I'm a coward?

119
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:46,739
But still, we should nip
that attitude in the bud!

120
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,117
Bye.

121
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:54,080
Did you sort it out?

122
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:57,375
What's your plan?

123
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,293
Are we playing together or not?

124
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:01,712
It seems like
a part of you wants to play with me.

125
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:04,841
And that's what's keeping you
from saying no yourself.

126
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:06,342
What are you babbling about?

127
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:10,096
Did you think I'd let you have your way?
I'm Yook Junghwan.

128
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:12,306
You just love your name, don't you?

129
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:16,144
Wait.

130
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:19,564
It's my fault he lost his girlfriend.

131
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:22,400
It's also my fault
his girlfriend quit being an athlete.

132
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:24,777
I was going to,
but I was just so disgusted.

133
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:26,446
Who are you to order me around?

134
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:28,030
-Darn it!
-Jesus…

135
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:31,826
Gosh, darn it!

136
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,287
-How dare you!
-"How dare you"?

137
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:36,706
How dare you say that to me?

138
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,666
What's with the fist? Gonna hit me?

139
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:39,876
Hey.

140
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:43,087
Go ahead. Hit me.

141
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:45,798
God, I'm so pissed! Damn it!

142
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:47,049
Taejun!

143
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:49,343
You're being over-the-top.

144
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:51,512
He's a complete psycho.

145
00:07:53,097 --> 00:07:54,432
Let's not discuss this anymore.

146
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:57,977
Please let's not be partners. Please.

147
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:02,940
Put this away.
And don't let me catch sight of you.

148
00:08:03,774 --> 00:08:06,444
Did he just hit me or push me?

149
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:10,281
Hey, Park Taejun!

150
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:12,033
Hey!

151
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:19,582
Coach.

152
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:24,003
Coach! It's Junghwan.

153
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:26,923
Coach!

154
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:33,804
Isn't this our coach's room?

155
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:35,431
Yes, it is.

156
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:37,683
What are you doing here?

157
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:41,521
Where's Coach?

158
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:42,939
I'm his daughter.

159
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:45,525
What were you thinking?

160
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:48,277
I was just, you know…

161
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,738
Sorry. I keep forgetting.

162
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:52,573
You don't remind me of Coach.

163
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:55,409
Do you take after your mom?

164
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:59,997
Come in.
Yumin, you can go back to your room.

165
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:03,793
Are you here to say
you don't want to partner with Taejun?

166
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:05,253
Yes.

167
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:10,967
If you're rude to my dad,
I'm cutting ties with you.

168
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:16,806
Truth be told, I'm a great daughter.

169
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:20,685
You should do as my dad says
if you don't want me to ghost you.

170
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:37,243
Tell me.

171
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:40,288
Would it kill you to do what I asked?

172
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:43,291
Well…

173
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:46,127
The thing is…

174
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,509
Gosh.

175
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:03,144
Darn it. I shouldn't have said that.

176
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:19,744
How did it go?

177
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:22,747
Do we have to cut ties?

178
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:26,542
Or can we keep in touch?

179
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:31,797
We can keep in touch.

180
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:36,844
Gosh, you're adorable.

181
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,804
You're such a good boy.

182
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:40,931
-You're so nice.
-Stop it.

183
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:45,353
Did you now?

184
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:54,945
2021 NATIONAL BUSINESS
BADMINTON FEDERATION TOURNAMENT

185
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:06,040
All right. We can use the court
until 9 o'clock,

186
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:07,750
so plan your time wisely.

187
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,543
And don't overdo it. Okay?

188
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:10,670
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

189
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:13,422
Don't overstress yourself
with last-minute training.

190
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:15,633
Don't even think about
getting hurt overdoing it.

191
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:20,221
Hey, just warm up. Don't use up your ene--

192
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:25,601
You're flying high.

193
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:28,229
Are you thrilled about getting
a higher salary thanks to me?

194
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,942
You'll perform better
by playing with me and get paid more.

195
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:34,819
You don't know how to be grateful.

196
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:38,823
I didn't know you liked me this much.

197
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:40,408
Cut it out.

198
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:43,786
And don't you hold me back.

199
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:49,250
-Are you all talk when you play?
-Stop it!

200
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:53,129
Did you not hear what I said?

201
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:56,090
Continue practice.

202
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:58,092
You punks.

203
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:07,560
-What?
-Move.

204
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:10,646
Do you want to play against me?

205
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:13,482
We'll play one set to warm up.

206
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:14,483
Hey, Junghwan.

207
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,402
He's being so ridiculous that
I can't focus.

208
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:18,404
Do you have trouble staying focused?

209
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,491
Let's settle this once and for all.

210
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:24,493
The first to score three points wins.

211
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:26,996
The loser will stay low-key
throughout the tournament.

212
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,790
-Deal?
-Deal.

213
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:34,378
You little punks.
I can't put up with this anymore.

214
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:38,841
Do you guys have
the ticket to enter the team match?

215
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:41,010
I don't recall handing it out to you.

216
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:45,264
Don't you know that we submit
the team sheet right before the game?

217
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:48,517
Why you little… And hey!

218
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:50,519
Are you the only ones training here?

219
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:55,649
Taejun.

220
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:58,861
Provide support to Junghwan.

221
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:00,696
That's your role.

222
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:05,701
-Coach Joo.
-Yes, sir.

223
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:07,995
Taejun!

224
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:13,125
You've got less than 15 minutes left.

225
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,961
Why are you still here?

226
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:17,588
Go.

227
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:24,804
Here it comes.

228
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:32,186
2021 NATIONAL BUSINESS
BADMINTON FEDERATION TOURNAMENT

229
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:02,508
What? Hey!

230
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:05,219
What's with Taejun today?

231
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:08,180
Hey Taejun, you punk! Stop poaching!

232
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:11,141
-Hit what's yours! You--
-Coach, you'll get a warning.

233
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:14,228
Seriously. Why's he being
so stubborn today?

234
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:17,106
Taejun is trying to do everything
by himself. He's too worked up.

235
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:19,984
Hey! Gosh, this is driving me nuts.

236
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:35,541
Hey. Hit what's intended for you
or just stand back in the corner.

237
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:37,293
Support you? Not a chance.

238
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:41,213
Are you saying you'll compete against me?

239
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:46,218
-You idiot.
-What was that, you bastard?

240
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:47,803
You started this.

241
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:20,669
What is this, American football?

242
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,407
Junghwan's racket broke.

243
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:53,953
He's playing like that
with a broken racket.

244
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,788
-Nice!
-Seriously, those punks.

245
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:41,333
-Great job!
-Well done, Junghwan!

246
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:42,418
That was good!

247
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:45,921
Gosh. What was that just now?

248
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,132
Did he take Taejun's racket?

249
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:50,676
Basically, that means "get lost."

250
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:54,096
Taejun… This must be humiliating for him.

251
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,642
It must be embarrassing.

252
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:09,236
Stop messing with me
if you don't want to get crushed again.

253
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:19,204
All right.

254
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:21,582
That was great!

255
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,712
Do you think Taejun will be okay?

256
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:28,630
Maybe they shouldn't have been partners.

257
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:30,424
That should knock some sense into him.

258
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:33,385
It probably provoked him more.

259
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:37,222
Taejun shouldn't be handled like that.

260
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:41,643
Hey!

261
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:43,854
Why, that…

262
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:56,158
What if you had lost?

263
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:00,704
Since this is a team match,

264
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:03,999
do you think it's okay to lose
as long as the others win?

265
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:07,211
-No, sir.
-You're a professional athlete,

266
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:10,297
yet you fail to control your emotions
and make a total mess!

267
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:17,930
Did I put my faith in you for nothing?

268
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:23,685
-Should I have expected nothing from you?
-I don't want to support him.

269
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:24,978
What did you say?

270
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:28,607
Nothing, sir.

271
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:31,527
Speak up. What is it?

272
00:18:32,402 --> 00:18:35,781
Coach, my blood is boiling.

273
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:40,327
I'm dying to win against anyone

274
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,664
so that I won't suffocate.

275
00:18:43,747 --> 00:18:45,082
So what?

276
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:47,042
Are you going to continue with this rage?

277
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:48,877
Why you…

278
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:52,756
Taejun.

279
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:56,301
I want to know why you're so angry.

280
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:58,345
What is it?

281
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:01,807
Is something wrong at home?

282
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:06,436
I want to fight my own battles.

283
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:14,361
Hey, will a racket do?

284
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:17,614
Why don't you get a bat
and smash everything?

285
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:19,366
Darn you!

286
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:20,617
Saving today's game

287
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:23,912
was only possible because of Junghwan.

288
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,251
Support Junghwan.

289
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:32,629
Aren't you going to answer?

290
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:34,548
Is that a no?

291
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,594
Fine then. I don't need you.

292
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,388
-Give me a chance!
-Get out of here, punk!

293
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:49,646
Please, Coach.

294
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,113
Why you little… I could just smash you!

295
00:19:58,405 --> 00:20:01,950
Coach, just fire this jerk.

296
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:04,912
He doesn't even listen to you.
Why do you keep giving him chances?

297
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:07,956
Darn it.

298
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:15,756
Taejun, that was a quiet exit.

299
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:33,315
It's his pride that's making him stubborn.

300
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:35,817
Honestly, when it comes to Taejun,

301
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:39,988
I don't want to waste his potential,
but he's got a terrible attitude.

302
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:41,490
But you know what?

303
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:44,034
He didn't say he would give up.

304
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:47,371
-Pardon?
-You know him.

305
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:49,873
If he doesn't want to do something,
he just lets it go.

306
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:53,794
But he didn't say, "I don't want to play,"

307
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:56,213
or "Get someone else to play in my spot."

308
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:59,800
He didn't say anything like that.
That Park Taejun.

309
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:10,644
HANWOONG ELECTRONICS

310
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:22,489
Don't mind them and just eat your food.

311
00:21:22,572 --> 00:21:24,366
I don't care

312
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,410
if they look at me or not.

313
00:21:27,744 --> 00:21:29,079
Hey, Taejun.

314
00:21:29,162 --> 00:21:32,207
Do you really think
they're all looking at you?

315
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,919
Gosh, you're totally mistaken.

316
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:38,880
They're all looking at me.

317
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:42,259
Yeah, right. I know I put on
a great show for them today.

318
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:44,386
I admit it.

319
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:46,430
They can gossip all they want.

320
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:54,563
Hi, Minsoo. You look great!

321
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:56,940
Taeyang, you remember me.

322
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:58,483
Of course, I do.

323
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:01,695
By the way,
who were you guys talking about?

324
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,489
Was it about me or him?

325
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:06,533
Me, right?

326
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:08,994
Yes, because it's been a while.

327
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:12,289
Right. Enjoy your meal.

328
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:15,667
Did you see that?

329
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:18,337
You and I have
a different level of presence.

330
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:19,963
A prodigy is back in the arena

331
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:22,007
after a three-year hiatus.
You can't beat that.

332
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:23,842
You've got a long way to catch up to me.

333
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:28,055
Maybe they didn't see me play.

334
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:34,102
How about you try wrestling
in the middle of a game?

335
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:35,812
Mixed martial arts sounds good.

336
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:38,440
When Junghwan is about to smash,
you can kick him!

337
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:41,401
That will instantly make you
more famous than me.

338
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:42,652
You'll become a total legend.

339
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:44,571
Are you teasing me?

340
00:22:45,238 --> 00:22:47,199
"It's okay. You'll do
better tomorrow. Go for it!"

341
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:49,618
Isn't it common sense
to say something this cliché?

342
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:50,911
You're funny.

343
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:55,207
You at least got to play in a team match,
but I didn't even get selected,

344
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:56,917
so here I am, running all the errands.

345
00:22:57,334 --> 00:23:01,088
Everyone here is gossiping away
about me while they eat.

346
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,590
Who am I to comfort anyone?

347
00:23:06,009 --> 00:23:08,261
Are you okay with that?
Being falsely accused of bribery?

348
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:15,644
-I'm going to go.
-Are you upset?

349
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:17,687
-Because I teased you a little?
-Yes.

350
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:20,524
I got teased with no consolation at all.
Now I've lost my appetite.

351
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:24,111
Darn it.

352
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:25,487
Ow.

353
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:33,120
Was I too harsh?

354
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:40,252
Was that a lovers' quarrel?

355
00:23:41,294 --> 00:23:44,381
I bet there's something going on
between the two of them.

356
00:23:45,632 --> 00:23:47,759
I can tell by just looking
that he left after eating.

357
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:49,094
Dating in secret?

358
00:23:49,469 --> 00:23:52,139
You can't do that unless
you're desperately in love like us.

359
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:54,015
But Taejun is also desperate.

360
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:56,351
He didn't throw a fit today
during the match for nothing.

361
00:23:57,727 --> 00:23:59,938
Do you know how he's been acting lately?

362
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:04,901
To begin with, he has trouble sleeping.

363
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:09,364
He suddenly wakes up
in the middle of the night and sighs.

364
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:17,330
-Taejun.
-Yes?

365
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:18,874
Oh, no.

366
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:21,835
His mind is somewhere else all day long.

367
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:27,174
Darn it! What's wrong with this thing?

368
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:29,301
He loses his temper over small things.

369
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:33,054
He's always been
a little like that, though.

370
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:34,556
What?

371
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,769
The other day, he sat gazing out
the window for like three hours.

372
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:46,693
It has to be love.

373
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:52,491
But that love isn't working out
the way he thought it would.

374
00:24:56,203 --> 00:25:00,123
Taejun. You can open up to me
if there's something going on.

375
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:03,668
I know how to keep a secret.

376
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:06,421
Damn it, I'm going to kill you! Get lost!

377
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:08,048
You're so dead.

378
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:18,183
Taeyang is acting weird
in front of your room.

379
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:33,448
Gosh, my body feels stiff.

380
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:40,372
Why is Taeyang exercising
in front of our room?

381
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:52,300
Coming.

382
00:25:53,593 --> 00:25:56,638
My gosh. This isn't our room.

383
00:25:57,305 --> 00:25:58,890
Taejun is playing video games.

384
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:00,392
Do you want to play too?

385
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:04,771
No. I got the rooms mixed up.

386
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:14,739
Taejun, you can do it!

387
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:38,054
What do you want?

388
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:50,191
You could've called if you wanted to talk.

389
00:26:52,068 --> 00:26:55,238
But then I'd have to walk on eggshells
around my roommate.

390
00:26:58,325 --> 00:27:01,202
Was this a bad idea? Why the long face?

391
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:05,373
All the couples that are hiding out here!

392
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:08,835
Can we stop dating on hotel rooftops?

393
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:11,171
You've been doing this since your teens.

394
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:17,469
Do your coaches know you're dating
in such old school fashion?

395
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:22,474
So… this was the hotbed of dating.

396
00:27:24,517 --> 00:27:25,602
How did you know about this?

397
00:27:27,687 --> 00:27:28,730
I used to be one of them.

398
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:32,442
Hey, over there.

399
00:27:33,568 --> 00:27:35,654
I can see you behind the bushes.

400
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:43,286
Come on.

401
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:45,080
It's okay. Let's go. He saw us.

402
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:47,248
You go first. Just go.

403
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:48,750
You should just go first.

404
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:49,959
Come here.

405
00:27:52,128 --> 00:27:54,631
Oh, my gosh! Are you two dating?

406
00:27:54,714 --> 00:27:55,715
What about you two?

407
00:27:56,466 --> 00:27:58,176
Let's just mind our own business.

408
00:27:58,259 --> 00:27:59,969
How can I…

409
00:28:00,053 --> 00:28:03,640
when my crappy partner
can't think straight and goes on dates?

410
00:28:04,724 --> 00:28:06,476
You're even dating amid all this?

411
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:08,770
Didn't you learn anything today?

412
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:13,817
Stop fighting, you two.
Aren't you guys getting tired of this?

413
00:28:14,317 --> 00:28:16,736
You should stop. He's your partner.

414
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:21,241
Hey, Taeyang.
Do you feel comfortable around me now?

415
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:23,993
Things must be going great for you.

416
00:28:24,577 --> 00:28:26,705
Is that why you can't tell
when to step in or not?

417
00:28:27,288 --> 00:28:30,667
Can't you see I'm taking it out on him
because I don't want to talk to you?

418
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:32,252
Is this about the past again?

419
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:35,755
If you want to whine about
what happened in the past,

420
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:37,632
go whine to your girlfriend.

421
00:28:48,351 --> 00:28:49,561
You go downstairs first.

422
00:28:49,644 --> 00:28:51,688
-Let's go together.
-You go first.

423
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,877
Stop, both of you.
You have a game to play tomorrow.

424
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:22,635
Do you feel guilty?

425
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:27,640
Is it because you couldn't protect
the person you liked?

426
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:30,769
Or are you bothered
that you're getting over your first love

427
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:32,729
when you never thought you would?

428
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:36,357
Are you shocked that your love isn't
as deep as you thought?

429
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:38,777
Is that why you take it out on Taeyang?

430
00:29:39,819 --> 00:29:41,237
Because it makes you feel loyal

431
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:43,364
and less sorry to your first love?

432
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:44,491
Why, you…

433
00:29:46,701 --> 00:29:47,994
Are you okay?

434
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:55,168
You're such a loser.

435
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:58,463
I can see why she broke up with you.

436
00:29:58,546 --> 00:29:59,631
Do you have a death wish?

437
00:29:59,714 --> 00:30:02,091
It's been three years,
but you still don't know what to do.

438
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:03,676
You're still making a big fuss over it.

439
00:30:04,427 --> 00:30:05,845
Of course, she couldn't lean on you.

440
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:08,264
It was tough and a burden for you.

441
00:30:10,016 --> 00:30:12,185
Don't you talk about Junyoung.

442
00:30:12,268 --> 00:30:14,646
Is she yours? You two broke up.

443
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:17,941
You're also a third party then,
since you two are just strangers now.

444
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:20,860
Then whether Taeyang is moving on
or not is none of your concern.

445
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:23,321
It's an issue
between Junyoung and Taeyang,

446
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:26,491
and you don't get any say in it.

447
00:30:26,574 --> 00:30:27,617
Why you…

448
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:05,697
I really wonder who she is.

449
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:08,074
I'm jealous of her.

450
00:31:19,168 --> 00:31:21,045
How long are you two going to fight?

451
00:31:23,756 --> 00:31:26,050
I feel like this is all my fault.

452
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:30,054
No, it definitely is because of me.

453
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:32,765
Am I the source of trouble?

454
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:37,562
Are things not working out
between Junghwan and you because of me?

455
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:39,397
You have to fight to put an end to it.

456
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:44,068
You're having a hard time
because of that incident.

457
00:31:44,777 --> 00:31:46,237
I don't want to see that anymore.

458
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:52,452
I'm sorry,

459
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:55,121
but my life is great these days.

460
00:31:56,789 --> 00:31:59,042
Do you know how happy I've been
since we started dating?

461
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:03,671
Even when I'm sleeping, I wonder to myself

462
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:08,217
if I deserve to be this happy
after all I've done wrong.

463
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:16,684
Do you really like me?

464
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:23,524
No one has ever liked me this much before.

465
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,445
No one, Taejun.

466
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:35,703
I know.

467
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:38,623
Why do you only have me?

468
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:45,380
Am I a burden to you? Be honest.

469
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:46,756
Yes.

470
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:52,261
Gosh, I picked a high-maintenance woman.

471
00:33:20,289 --> 00:33:22,083
Sorry!

472
00:33:24,794 --> 00:33:25,878
Passing through.

473
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:35,680
It looks like you hit someone.

474
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:37,473
I got hurt while fooling around.

475
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,311
You look like you got hit by someone.

476
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:44,480
I got hurt while fooling around.

477
00:33:48,067 --> 00:33:49,944
-Coach.
-Yes?

478
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:51,738
I got the team sheet.

479
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:59,120
Hey. Give me your hand.

480
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:01,372
-Hold on to this while it's still cold.
-No need.

481
00:34:01,956 --> 00:34:03,332
Just take it.

482
00:34:07,628 --> 00:34:09,088
This is for you to drink.

483
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:11,257
You can have it. I have to go play.

484
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:14,135
All right.

485
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:22,310
You seem somewhat determined today.

486
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:25,813
I think you're going to crush it today.

487
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:27,774
Should I record your game?

488
00:34:28,524 --> 00:34:30,485
-Yeon Seungwoo.
-Yes, sir?

489
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:33,196
-Can you play with Junghwan?
-Pardon?

490
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:40,286
Yes, I can.

491
00:34:40,369 --> 00:34:42,330
-Get ready.
-Yes, sir.

492
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:02,767
How about this one?

493
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:06,312
Gosh. You don't need something
that good when you're a beginner.

494
00:35:06,395 --> 00:35:07,688
Just a second.

495
00:35:08,731 --> 00:35:10,608
This is the one for you.

496
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:14,028
It's light and affordable.
Good for beginners.

497
00:35:14,153 --> 00:35:16,697
Have him get the expensive one.
It's better for us.

498
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:19,951
Right. You're here working hard
instead of being at your son's game.

499
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:23,788
I'll get the good one for your sake.

500
00:35:23,996 --> 00:35:25,206
Game?

501
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:27,917
There's a federation match
going on in Chuncheon.

502
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:54,652
That's it!

503
00:35:55,444 --> 00:35:56,904
-Doing great!
-Good work!

504
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:59,532
-Go for it!
-You can do it!

505
00:35:59,615 --> 00:36:00,825
-Let's go!
-Good luck!

506
00:36:00,908 --> 00:36:02,660
-Let's do this!
-Go, Yeon Seungwoo!

507
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:54,712
-Go, Junghwan!
-Seungwoo's so cool too!

508
00:36:54,795 --> 00:36:55,963
You're awesome!

509
00:37:06,849 --> 00:37:09,060
Hey. Let's go.

510
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:13,022
Coach, Taejun isn't on the bus yet.

511
00:37:13,105 --> 00:37:14,565
That jerk isn't getting on today.

512
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:15,483
What?

513
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:17,944
He's running back to the hotel.

514
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:20,071
Voluntarily?

515
00:37:21,155 --> 00:37:23,699
It's not like he's staging a protest.

516
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:25,326
He said his blood is boiling.

517
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:27,411
Let him be so he can blow off some steam.

518
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:44,637
Wow, Taejun's a good runner.

519
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:49,850
-You can do it!
-Tell him to get on the bus.

520
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:51,686
Hey, Jiho says you should get on the bus.

521
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:53,145
-He's really doing that?
-Seriously?

522
00:37:54,563 --> 00:37:55,731
-Hey!
-You're so cool!

523
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:57,483
Just get on the bus!

524
00:38:00,027 --> 00:38:01,862
-Gosh.
-See you!

525
00:38:16,168 --> 00:38:19,005
What's going on with Taejun?
You know what's up, right?

526
00:38:19,588 --> 00:38:21,757
It's probably because he couldn't play
in the team match.

527
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,344
Not because things aren't working out
between the two of you?

528
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:30,057
Be honest. Are you two dating?

529
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:33,894
I told you, I'm a desert.

530
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:38,899
All right. I'll come clean too.

531
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:42,862
I'm going out with Jiho.

532
00:38:42,945 --> 00:38:43,946
What?

533
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:47,616
Taejun already knows.

534
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:50,870
-Really?
-Gosh, seriously.

535
00:38:51,912 --> 00:38:53,956
I can't believe I told you.

536
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:57,001
I've put my card on the table,
so now it's your turn.

537
00:38:58,085 --> 00:38:59,045
Are you two dating?

538
00:38:59,628 --> 00:39:02,006
No. I'm seriously not.

539
00:39:02,089 --> 00:39:05,968
Gosh, what? I can see
how worried sick you are about Taejun.

540
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:07,928
You've been organizing clothes
for the past hour.

541
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:10,931
That's so unfair. I told you everything!

542
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:13,267
Why do you keep saying that?

543
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:16,354
What is there to worry about?

544
00:39:16,562 --> 00:39:18,439
This isn't a big deal
for a grown-up athlete.

545
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:21,609
We all have to take care of ourselves.

546
00:39:27,656 --> 00:39:30,618
But I'm really shocked
that you and Jiho are secretly dating.

547
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:34,163
Seriously, are you really going
to be like that with me?

548
00:39:34,246 --> 00:39:35,915
You're such a Seoul slicker.

549
00:39:35,998 --> 00:39:37,291
Where are you going?

550
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:39,710
I have somewhere important to be.

551
00:39:40,586 --> 00:39:43,589
And for your information,
I'm from Chuncheon.

552
00:39:47,593 --> 00:39:48,969
Gosh, this is annoying.

553
00:40:02,149 --> 00:40:03,192
Hey, Mom.

554
00:40:03,776 --> 00:40:05,861
I'm almost home.
I'm in front of our house.

555
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:11,283
I'll hang up now.

556
00:40:20,292 --> 00:40:22,002
What do I see here?

557
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:37,184
PARK NAMGU

558
00:40:40,062 --> 00:40:42,982
So this is it. Junyoung's house.

559
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:41,248
Look, there's even a melon.

560
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:45,252
This must be from the one who sent us
strawberries last time. Junyoung's fan.

561
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:48,631
Gosh. It would be nice
if there were a name somewhere.

562
00:41:48,964 --> 00:41:51,675
Do you mean the one who sent you
meat and vitamins?

563
00:41:52,259 --> 00:41:55,221
Yes. That person sends us something
every month.

564
00:41:55,304 --> 00:41:57,389
If it's not Jungyoung's fan,
who else could it be?

565
00:41:57,473 --> 00:42:00,142
By the way, when is your match?
We want to go and watch.

566
00:42:00,726 --> 00:42:03,354
It's okay. It's not like
you've ever come to watch me play.

567
00:42:04,897 --> 00:42:06,106
Up until now,

568
00:42:06,732 --> 00:42:09,360
We couldn't go
because it reminded us of Junyoung.

569
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:12,738
But this time, we'll be there.

570
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:21,330
-He's upset.
-Very.

571
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:50,317
Is this a sign that I should exercise?

572
00:42:53,821 --> 00:42:55,739
Can you leave if you're not going to?

573
00:42:58,284 --> 00:42:59,910
Do you train here?

574
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:02,454
Don't tell anyone.
It was hard to find this spot.

575
00:43:07,209 --> 00:43:09,670
I see you still practice hard
behind the scenes.

576
00:43:13,507 --> 00:43:14,758
You're distracting me.

577
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:26,812
Junghwan.

578
00:43:29,231 --> 00:43:31,191
Junyoung is my first love too.

579
00:43:35,571 --> 00:43:37,990
You have no idea how much I liked her.

580
00:43:42,828 --> 00:43:45,205
Just like how you can't forget about her

581
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:47,541
even if you meet someone new
and fall in love,

582
00:43:49,126 --> 00:43:50,377
it's the same for me.

583
00:43:51,587 --> 00:43:52,838
I can't forget her either.

584
00:43:55,549 --> 00:43:57,468
She will be in my heart forever.

585
00:44:13,609 --> 00:44:16,695
Try this. It's as sweet as honey.

586
00:44:18,072 --> 00:44:19,156
I don't want any.

587
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:22,493
-You should have some fruit. Come here.
-I said I don't want it.

588
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:28,999
I'm full.

589
00:44:29,583 --> 00:44:31,502
Even during dinner, you forced me to eat.

590
00:44:31,585 --> 00:44:33,462
You gave me three bowls of rice,
for God's sake.

591
00:44:34,046 --> 00:44:35,506
I thought my stomach would burst.

592
00:44:36,131 --> 00:44:37,633
An athlete should eat that much.

593
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:40,177
Hey, you always used to eat three bowls--

594
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:41,720
That was in the past.

595
00:44:44,098 --> 00:44:45,766
Are you still living in the past?

596
00:44:48,602 --> 00:44:50,229
When Junyoung and I were at our peak.

597
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:54,149
That's the only time you remember.

598
00:44:59,154 --> 00:45:00,531
Can't I…

599
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:02,991
do that?

600
00:45:08,789 --> 00:45:09,873
No.

601
00:45:11,625 --> 00:45:12,918
Just…

602
00:45:15,504 --> 00:45:19,091
I only forced myself to eat
because it made you happy.

603
00:45:23,262 --> 00:45:24,930
I'm not doing that anymore.

604
00:45:37,818 --> 00:45:38,902
Yes, Youngsim?

605
00:45:38,986 --> 00:45:41,989
Hey, do you deserve to be a senior?
Did you know today was Sunsoo's birthday?

606
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:42,948
What?

607
00:45:43,532 --> 00:45:46,160
Gosh. How could we not know
a teammate's birthday?

608
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:49,329
Same here. Anyway I just found out,
so hurry back to the hotel.

609
00:45:50,873 --> 00:45:52,291
What aren't you making calls?

610
00:45:52,374 --> 00:45:54,168
How can I run and call at the same time?

611
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:56,128
Hey, is that all the lung capacity
you've got?

612
00:45:56,503 --> 00:45:57,588
No.

613
00:45:57,796 --> 00:45:59,006
Hey, do you want to die?

614
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:02,926
Hey, how can a junior forget to check
when a senior's birthday is!

615
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:05,846
Where am I supposed to get a cake
at this hour?

616
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:10,100
Yes, I'll make it happen no matter what.

617
00:46:10,517 --> 00:46:11,351
Darn it.

618
00:46:17,024 --> 00:46:19,026
Excuse me, do you have any cakes?

619
00:46:19,568 --> 00:46:20,986
Do you have a cake--

620
00:46:24,406 --> 00:46:26,784
We just sold the last one.

621
00:46:44,176 --> 00:46:47,846
So, is there anything we could talk about?

622
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:50,098
-We could play the word chain--
-Let's not.

623
00:46:50,182 --> 00:46:51,266
My thoughts exactly.

624
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:55,604
Why do you walk so slow?

625
00:46:57,105 --> 00:46:58,148
I'll head over there first.

626
00:47:01,693 --> 00:47:03,695
Doesn't he look awkward when he runs?

627
00:47:11,203 --> 00:47:13,038
That must be embarrassing.

628
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:15,374
I hope you're not badly injured.

629
00:47:31,181 --> 00:47:35,811
Happy birthday to you

630
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:39,439
-Happy birthday to you
-Look how happy he is.

631
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:43,360
-You're awesome.
-Great job, Junghwan! You're so handsome!

632
00:47:44,278 --> 00:47:47,114
-How old are you now?
-Why would he wish for that?

633
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,993
He wanted to be congratulated
while his idol gave him a piggyback ride.

634
00:47:51,076 --> 00:47:54,454
-Dear Oh Sunsoo
-Dear Oh Sunsoo

635
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:56,665
-Let's take a video for him.
-That's pretty.

636
00:47:56,748 --> 00:47:58,375
-They're having fun.
-They look cute.

637
00:47:58,458 --> 00:48:00,377
-Happy birthday.
-He's getting his wish.

638
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:02,629
-He's so happy.
-What the heck are they doing?

639
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:04,715
-That's his wish?
-He's just too cute.

640
00:48:04,798 --> 00:48:06,800
-Sorry.
-Congratulations.

641
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:08,051
Doing great.

642
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:09,553
-Excuse us.
-Happy birthday.

643
00:48:09,636 --> 00:48:11,179
That's cute. You two look good together!

644
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:13,390
-Please understand. Sorry.
-Sorry.

645
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:24,818
-Hi, Taeyang.
-I'm here to see Taejun.

646
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:29,364
-He's asleep.
-Taejun, wake up!

647
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:32,784
What are you still doing in bed?

648
00:48:33,368 --> 00:48:34,202
What is this?

649
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:36,705
Get up right now.

650
00:48:36,788 --> 00:48:38,498
What are you doing?

651
00:48:38,582 --> 00:48:41,209
The weather's fantastic.
Let's go for a morning training session.

652
00:48:41,293 --> 00:48:42,252
I don't want to.

653
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:44,212
No? Then I'll carry you out on my back.

654
00:48:44,296 --> 00:48:46,423
If that doesn't work,
I'll drag you outside.

655
00:48:46,924 --> 00:48:48,133
Hey, Taeyang!

656
00:48:49,176 --> 00:48:50,761
I don't know what's gotten into her.

657
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:53,889
Right foot. Come here.

658
00:48:53,972 --> 00:48:55,682
Did you eat something strange
for breakfast?

659
00:48:56,016 --> 00:48:58,143
Hey, wait.

660
00:48:58,226 --> 00:48:59,436
Okay. Let's go outside first.

661
00:49:01,313 --> 00:49:02,773
You should've cooperated sooner.

662
00:49:04,066 --> 00:49:06,902
And you. I know you're dating Sungsil.

663
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:09,821
-It wasn't me.
-We're dating too!

664
00:49:10,822 --> 00:49:12,074
As you can see.

665
00:49:13,283 --> 00:49:15,410
So let's all keep our mouths shut.

666
00:49:16,912 --> 00:49:18,080
Let's go outside!

667
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:19,665
What?

668
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:39,977
I think

669
00:49:40,852 --> 00:49:42,938
I'm not so good at consoling others.

670
00:49:45,315 --> 00:49:47,818
You're obviously having a hard time,

671
00:49:48,568 --> 00:49:50,779
but I felt too sorry to say, "Cheer up."

672
00:49:50,862 --> 00:49:54,116
"You can do better next time"
sounded too cliché.

673
00:49:54,783 --> 00:49:56,493
"Just wing it."

674
00:49:56,576 --> 00:49:58,203
That sounded totally insincere.

675
00:49:58,578 --> 00:50:00,122
I've thought long and hard about it,

676
00:50:00,706 --> 00:50:03,000
but I don't know what to say to you.

677
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:07,587
Did I look like
I was going through a rough time? I'm not.

678
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:09,589
Whatever.

679
00:50:10,215 --> 00:50:11,383
I don't know.

680
00:50:11,466 --> 00:50:14,302
Nothing beats exercising
when things are complicated.

681
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:16,888
When my heart races from running,

682
00:50:17,389 --> 00:50:18,974
I can forget about it all.

683
00:50:23,186 --> 00:50:25,147
There's even a place like this,

684
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:28,567
so when you feel down,
you should come out here to exercise.

685
00:50:32,404 --> 00:50:34,406
"Get your act together and try your best."

686
00:50:36,408 --> 00:50:37,868
Isn't that what you wanted to say?

687
00:50:38,368 --> 00:50:40,912
With me, you can do and say as you please.

688
00:50:41,329 --> 00:50:42,664
Why do you find that so difficult?

689
00:50:45,459 --> 00:50:47,044
Because you're precious to me.

690
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:54,426
You're way too precious to me,
so I can't just do as I please.

691
00:50:54,509 --> 00:50:55,802
I'm afraid of what would happen.

692
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:04,853
I'm sorry.

693
00:51:05,854 --> 00:51:06,688
About what?

694
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:08,857
I don't know.

695
00:51:10,025 --> 00:51:13,570
It's weird how I just
want to keep apologizing.

696
00:51:16,406 --> 00:51:18,784
Whenever I see you having a hard time,

697
00:51:19,618 --> 00:51:21,912
I can't help but feel sorry.

698
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:27,959
Taeyang.

699
00:51:31,254 --> 00:51:32,756
You're good at consoling people.

700
00:51:41,848 --> 00:51:43,058
By the way,

701
00:51:44,059 --> 00:51:47,145
remember how Coach asked you
to support Junghwan?

702
00:51:47,354 --> 00:51:50,315
Why are you bringing that up now?
It's demotivating.

703
00:51:51,817 --> 00:51:53,693
Do you think that's all there is to it?

704
00:51:54,736 --> 00:51:57,656
Then why did Coach have his eyes
glued on you throughout the game?

705
00:51:58,073 --> 00:52:00,742
He didn't even glance at Junghwan.
He was only watching you.

706
00:52:01,201 --> 00:52:02,744
That means he's paying attention to you.

707
00:52:02,828 --> 00:52:05,497
Forget it.
You're making me feel even smaller.

708
00:52:06,998 --> 00:52:08,875
I take back that you're good
at consoling others.

709
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:13,672
No, I mean it. There's something going on.

710
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:16,091
No. There's nothing to it.

711
00:52:16,174 --> 00:52:18,969
-Let's take a picture!
-Take a picture with me!

712
00:52:19,052 --> 00:52:21,721
-Here, please. Me first.
-Oh, come on.

713
00:52:21,805 --> 00:52:23,098
But I came first.

714
00:52:23,682 --> 00:52:27,018
-Oh, my gosh!
-Please take a picture with me too.

715
00:52:27,102 --> 00:52:28,812
-Here too.
-Can you sign here?

716
00:52:28,895 --> 00:52:30,814
I've been your fan for a long time.

717
00:52:30,897 --> 00:52:32,858
Can you smile for us just one time?

718
00:52:33,275 --> 00:52:35,777
-Can you sign here too?
-Please?

719
00:52:35,861 --> 00:52:37,154
-This is awesome!
-Thank you!

720
00:52:37,237 --> 00:52:39,364
-Let's get on the bus.
-All right.

721
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:43,243
Hey.

722
00:52:43,326 --> 00:52:46,371
-Let's sit here.
-I'm not awake.

723
00:52:48,874 --> 00:52:50,000
That's Yook Junghwan.

724
00:52:51,334 --> 00:52:52,544
-That's him?
-Why is he here?

725
00:52:57,257 --> 00:52:59,176
Why did you go without even saying hello?

726
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:02,554
Do I have to?

727
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:08,226
Win your match today.
If you win, you can buy me a meal,

728
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:10,770
and if you lose, I'll buy you beer.
How does that sound?

729
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:12,522
And,

730
00:53:16,526 --> 00:53:17,694
we should at least say hello.

731
00:53:18,945 --> 00:53:20,780
-See you tonight.
-What was that?

732
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:22,032
Oh, right.

733
00:53:23,325 --> 00:53:25,911
Let's try to have a meal.
We're in the midst of a tournament.

734
00:53:25,994 --> 00:53:27,954
-What is going on?
-You have to tell us!

735
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:29,998
-Tell us!
-What was that for?

736
00:53:30,081 --> 00:53:32,792
-What was that about?
-What's with you and Junghwan?

737
00:53:32,876 --> 00:53:34,419
He's crazy.

738
00:53:35,003 --> 00:53:37,297
How am I supposed to concentrate
on my game?

739
00:53:39,549 --> 00:53:41,092
This is so annoying.

740
00:53:42,385 --> 00:53:43,553
Yes, here we are.

741
00:53:43,637 --> 00:53:45,639
-Can you check up on the candidates?
-Okay.

742
00:53:45,764 --> 00:53:49,184
All right. So is everyone doing okay?

743
00:53:49,267 --> 00:53:50,644
-Yes, sir.
-Good, sir.

744
00:53:50,727 --> 00:53:52,687
Today's starters are…

745
00:53:54,064 --> 00:53:56,274
-Hey, Sunsoo.
-Yes?

746
00:53:57,317 --> 00:53:58,610
Where's Junghwan?

747
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:05,242
We'll go out if you win this match

748
00:54:05,325 --> 00:54:06,993
and cut ties if you lose.
What do you think?

749
00:54:07,577 --> 00:54:10,372
Actually, I don't need your opinion.
That's what I'm going to do.

750
00:54:11,665 --> 00:54:13,041
You're extreme.

751
00:54:14,626 --> 00:54:15,961
Do you happen to gamble?

752
00:54:18,338 --> 00:54:19,214
Also…

753
00:54:20,006 --> 00:54:22,133
I would win anyway, regardless of you.

754
00:54:22,217 --> 00:54:25,637
If you win, you get a pretty girlfriend
as a bonus. Isn't that the best?

755
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:27,430
You have to fight to win the damsel.

756
00:54:28,014 --> 00:54:29,307
Am I speaking to a wall?

757
00:54:29,391 --> 00:54:32,602
Yes, me. I've put up a wall around me
to keep out all the guys. Give it a try.

758
00:54:33,603 --> 00:54:37,065
If you win, we can have some beer
and agree to start dating.

759
00:54:37,148 --> 00:54:40,944
If you lose, we can each have
a bottle of soju

760
00:54:41,695 --> 00:54:43,071
and bid each other farewell.

761
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:56,543
Hey.

762
00:55:03,508 --> 00:55:04,759
I'm playing again.

763
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:07,637
Coach is such a softy.

764
00:55:10,181 --> 00:55:11,099
Looking forward to it…

765
00:55:14,978 --> 00:55:16,604
is not what I'm going to say.

766
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:19,190
You know what?

767
00:55:20,066 --> 00:55:21,609
Our coach can't take his eyes off me.

768
00:55:22,610 --> 00:55:23,570
What do you mean?

769
00:55:24,779 --> 00:55:28,199
I won't make mistakes like last time.
So don't worry.

770
00:55:30,869 --> 00:55:31,703
We'll see.

771
00:55:33,079 --> 00:55:34,247
You'd better do well.

772
00:55:35,123 --> 00:55:36,666
I have to win today.

773
00:55:38,543 --> 00:55:39,794
Same here.

774
00:55:41,463 --> 00:55:42,547
From now on,

775
00:55:43,631 --> 00:55:45,008
I'm not going to lose anymore.

776
00:56:30,887 --> 00:56:32,472
Even if it seems unreachable

777
00:56:33,598 --> 00:56:35,850
and days of self-doubt continue,

778
00:56:37,685 --> 00:56:40,188
I'm not giving up

779
00:56:40,688 --> 00:56:41,815
on my dreams

780
00:56:42,524 --> 00:56:43,775
or you.

781
00:57:07,841 --> 00:57:10,760
Jungwhan, you're awesome! Well done!

782
00:57:24,774 --> 00:57:26,401
Hey, Taejun.

783
00:57:32,157 --> 00:57:34,159
At the end of the hallway
on the third floor.

784
00:57:44,961 --> 00:57:46,296
Aren't you afraid?

785
00:57:46,921 --> 00:57:48,298
To go out with me, I mean.

786
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:50,341
You know.

787
00:57:51,217 --> 00:57:52,594
Being in a relationship can be

788
00:57:53,178 --> 00:57:56,014
a bit… scary.

789
00:57:57,474 --> 00:58:00,810
And we're not allowed to
since we're teammates.

790
00:58:03,897 --> 00:58:06,191
I'm just going to do my best.

791
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:10,111
After all, that's the only thing
I know how to do.

792
00:58:10,195 --> 00:58:11,946
So, me being me,

793
00:58:13,114 --> 00:58:14,782
I'm going to do my best with you.

794
00:58:16,326 --> 00:58:18,036
Whatever the result may be,

795
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:21,289
I'm going to do my best till the end.

796
00:58:27,295 --> 00:58:29,631
Let's do it together. We'll do our best.

797
00:58:29,714 --> 00:58:31,925
We'll be on the same side
when we have to fight

798
00:58:32,926 --> 00:58:34,969
and go through the hard times together.

799
00:58:36,971 --> 00:58:39,682
We'll get rained on together
if we have to.

800
00:58:41,726 --> 00:58:43,144
By all means.

801
00:59:34,237 --> 00:59:35,280
Junyoung.

802
00:59:45,039 --> 00:59:46,291
Junyoung.

803
00:59:51,671 --> 00:59:53,006
Have you been doing well?

804
01:00:04,142 --> 01:00:06,185
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

805
01:00:11,149 --> 01:00:12,984
Why is seeing you tearing me up?

806
01:01:29,977 --> 01:01:31,896
GOING TO YOU AT A SPEED OF 493KM

807
01:01:31,979 --> 01:01:33,523
Let's not run into each other again.

808
01:01:33,606 --> 01:01:37,193
Still, Junyoung. I know you hate me,
but let's see each other.

809
01:01:37,276 --> 01:01:39,445
Don't get close to Park Taeyang.

810
01:01:39,529 --> 01:01:41,197
She must not know I'm your sister.

811
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:43,366
Junyoung? You're Junyoung, right?

812
01:01:43,449 --> 01:01:45,743
Did you hear the rumor
that Junyoung is back?

813
01:01:45,827 --> 01:01:47,954
I know you two have a long history.

814
01:01:48,496 --> 01:01:50,873
Can't you forgive her? Park Taeyang.

815
01:01:50,957 --> 01:01:53,543
Where are we headed?

816
01:01:54,210 --> 01:01:55,420
Taeyang.

817
01:01:56,087 --> 01:01:57,255
I really hate you.

818
01:02:08,891 --> 01:02:09,726
GOING TO YOU AT A SPEED OF 493KM

819
01:02:09,809 --> 01:02:11,728
