1
00:00:37,787 --> 00:00:40,790
GOING TO YOU AT A SPEED OF 493KM

2
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,586
THE PLACES, PEOPLE, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTIONAL

3
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:48,214
EPISODE 7

4
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:04,731
What a great color and scent.

5
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:09,444
Taejun! The porridge is ready!

6
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,578
I'm done too!

7
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:26,127
It looks good.

8
00:01:27,128 --> 00:01:28,588
Smells good.

9
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:30,882
Of course. I made it.

10
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,304
Hey.

11
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:44,813
-What?
-This.

12
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:01,538
You were discharged
sooner than I expected.

13
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,624
What? Did you want me to rot
in the hospital?

14
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:13,466
The national team members
are staying another day.

15
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:14,551
They have to be sure.

16
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:18,680
In other words,
they don't have to be thorough with us.

17
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:22,142
Do you want some porridge?

18
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:24,060
No, I'm good.

19
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:29,732
It tastes good though.

20
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:42,078
What are you doing?

21
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:50,670
Hey.

22
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:57,427
-Hey.
-You cooked it, so I had to finish it.

23
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:13,443
Bye.

24
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:14,944
Okay.

25
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:23,244
Here.

26
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:27,040
Gosh. Why did you come?

27
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:28,499
What about training?

28
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:31,044
The federation match is coming up.

29
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:33,463
And your competition is coming up.

30
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:35,548
Seriously.
Why do you like your dad so much?

31
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:37,342
It's too much now.

32
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,386
You're impossible.

33
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:58,279
Coach, are you all right?

34
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:01,908
Why are you…

35
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:06,829
That's right. You're the coach's daughter.

36
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:09,290
"That's right"? As if.

37
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:11,209
Drop the act.

38
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:12,627
Wait. Stop.

39
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:17,173
I've been meaning to ask you.
Are you two close?

40
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,425
How close? Why?

41
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:20,426
We're not close.

42
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,844
We're not not close.

43
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:24,347
What was that?

44
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:27,892
Well, so… Yumin won the gold medal

45
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:31,104
at the Yook Junghwan Badminton Tournament.

46
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:35,191
Coach, how do you feel? I'm worried sick.

47
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,110
Why are you worried about me? Don't be.

48
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:38,945
How could I not be? You're our coach.

49
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:42,573
Well…

50
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,660
The team can't last a day without you.

51
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:49,872
-Hang in there.
-Oh, my gosh.

52
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:55,295
Wait outside.

53
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:56,879
I'll see you outside.

54
00:05:13,187 --> 00:05:14,355
Where is he?

55
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:19,569
"I'll slit your throat."
That was what she said.

56
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:22,572
Who said that?

57
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:26,075
A girl who said we weren't close at all.

58
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,410
A girl?

59
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:29,954
Dang it.

60
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:32,957
If she hates me, fine.
How could she say she'll slit my throat?

61
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:36,085
At least call
if you don't want to come out.

62
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:49,349
Hey. The most shocking thing for me

63
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:50,975
was our coach.

64
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:54,062
How could he discriminate us like that?

65
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:57,940
I agree. How could he discriminate
between athletes?

66
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:00,818
We're forgetting something right now.

67
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:03,654
Coach is an Olympic gold medalist.

68
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:05,239
He was on the national team.

69
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:07,200
We weren't. That's his point.

70
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:09,118
-You're right.
-He's immature, lacks passion,

71
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:10,995
and is a schmuck at times,

72
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:13,748
but I thought he was nice on the inside.

73
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:16,793
I thought there would be
a puny bit of kindness in him.

74
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:18,961
I didn't know he'd be like this.

75
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:22,632
I know you kids are hurt,

76
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:25,593
but Coach has his reasons.

77
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:28,221
I see you've been discharged.

78
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:31,391
Don't say that. I'm hurting too.

79
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:35,019
I don't know if it's okay
for me to say this,

80
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:38,064
but I've never seen a leader

81
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:41,734
who cares about his players
as much as our coach.

82
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:44,695
-I see. Sure.
-I see. Sure.

83
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:49,200
He wasn't messed up like that
from the get-go.

84
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:51,536
The world ruined him.

85
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:53,746
Something happened, that's why.

86
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:55,998
Seriously.

87
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:59,377
Want me to tell you
what Coach used to be like?

88
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:13,391
If anyone falls behind,

89
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:15,601
everyone will redo it!

90
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:18,146
A long time ago,

91
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,190
when he was the coach at Taereung,

92
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:23,025
he was extremely intense.

93
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:24,777
That's right.

94
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:27,238
He nickname was Moses.

95
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:31,409
And Bucket.

96
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:01,522
SOJU

97
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:04,442
Even injured players weren't excluded.

98
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,569
I quit.

99
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:10,573
I'm quitting badminton.

100
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:12,742
I won't play anymore!

101
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:16,954
Mother. Why did I have to play badminton

102
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:19,624
and make you suffer like this?

103
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:22,668
If I had golfed instead, I'd be--

104
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:26,839
Snap out of it!

105
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:28,132
Dang it.

106
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:33,888
Coach.

107
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:37,058
However, Coach was the only one
who didn't give up

108
00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:38,809
on that tragic player.

109
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:40,436
If you give up now,

110
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:44,065
I'll kill you and then myself.

111
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:55,368
Coach.

112
00:08:56,994 --> 00:09:02,208
Why do you care about someone like me?

113
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:05,753
Although it was heartbreaking
that the tragic player was the only one

114
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,964
who respected him.

115
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:09,382
You'll make yourself sick.

116
00:09:11,175 --> 00:09:12,385
Sanghyun.

117
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:19,600
The players…

118
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:23,271
They all hate me.

119
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:34,240
You're not the only ones with scars.

120
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:36,617
Coach has plenty of his own.

121
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:38,911
He was heartless from the start.

122
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:42,123
A bucket? Isn't that abuse?

123
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:44,834
No wonder the players hated him.

124
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:48,296
He's better now in comparison.

125
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:50,965
-Maybe he got a wake-up call.
-Right?

126
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:56,554
Maybe it wasn't a bucket. Hold on.

127
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:13,195
Anyone who can smile
after that humiliation

128
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,323
should just kill themselves, no?

129
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,870
No one was smiling-- Ouch. Sorry.

130
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:22,830
When I was in the ER,

131
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,418
I thought I was having a baby.

132
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:31,047
While I was suffering pain
comparable to labor,

133
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:34,675
Coach's words were, I repeat,

134
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:40,139
"National team members first!"

135
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:47,521
As many of us better make it
to the roster for the team match.

136
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:50,191
Does Yunis take any random schmoe?

137
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:51,400
-No!
-No!

138
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,653
We used to be great athletes too!

139
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:55,071
-That's right!
-That's right!

140
00:10:55,696 --> 00:10:58,282
All right! Let's chant! It's been a while.

141
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:01,202
-Okay!
-Let's do it!

142
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:05,665
Get ready!

143
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:08,876
Yunis!

144
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:10,086
-Yunis!
-Yunis!

145
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:13,047
-Let's…
-Let's…

146
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,590
-smash!
-smash!

147
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,884
-Let's do this!
-Yeah!

148
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:24,058
Up high!

149
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:30,272
When you walk down this path,

150
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:32,775
you meet people who scratch you.

151
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:36,654
That's when you grow.

152
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:46,455
Because we don't take abuse from anyone.

153
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:51,043
Okay.

154
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:53,087
Wait and see

155
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:57,258
what I do to those jerks who scratch me.

156
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:05,391
Keep it up.

157
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:07,893
You're too intense.

158
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:09,729
Here.

159
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:31,667
Yes. Let's smile like that.

160
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,006
It's fun.

161
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,767
I envy how relaxed you are.

162
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:53,981
I envy how passionate you are.

163
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:07,328
What?

164
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:09,038
I want to be your partner.

165
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:10,122
What?

166
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:11,499
You can say no.

167
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:14,710
What do you mean? Oh, my gosh.

168
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:18,798
I totally fell for you when you helped me
snap out of it and get back in the game.

169
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:20,716
Once a fan, always a fan!

170
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:22,843
A fan?

171
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:25,471
Actually, I was your fan
when I was in high school.

172
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,057
I folded 1,000 paper cranes
and sent them to you too.

173
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:30,684
Oh, my gosh.

174
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:34,522
It's true my fandom faded slightly,

175
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:38,150
but I was happy when I heard
you'd be joining our team.

176
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:40,110
You followed the majority.

177
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:43,739
-Sorry.
-Don't be.

178
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:45,991
Hey.

179
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:48,035
-Sungsil.
-Yes.

180
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:49,745
You're my lover now. Okay?

181
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:51,872
What?

182
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:55,084
-You're my girl!
-Wait!

183
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:57,253
-Just trust me!
-Hold on!

184
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,261
MULTI BALM

185
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:06,887
A gift to commemorate becoming partners.

186
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:09,181
Even athletes
should care about their appearance.

187
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:11,392
This is my gift to you
to commemorate becoming partners.

188
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:18,941
I'm not used to things like this.

189
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:24,321
I should do things I'm not used to.
I even have a boyfriend now.

190
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:35,624
I'm playing better,

191
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:39,128
I got myself a guy, and now a girl.

192
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:42,298
Why are things going so well?
It's making me nervous.

193
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:45,009
What if I crash and burn?

194
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:50,264
Nice. It's moisturizing.

195
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:54,685
Moist.

196
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:57,396
Muah.

197
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,318
No. No bad thoughts.

198
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:07,740
It's okay. It's totally okay.

199
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:23,088
Where is he?

200
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:27,843
There's no one here.

201
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:30,554
It's just us.

202
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:40,064
Did you wait long?

203
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:43,400
Do you feel sick?

204
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,321
No.

205
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:49,031
Your skin looks dry like you're tired.

206
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:50,574
Should I not have called you out?

207
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:53,160
He doesn't even notice I put it on.

208
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:56,121
Are you blind? Can't you see this shine?

209
00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:58,332
Put what on?

210
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:07,091
Makeup? To look pretty for me?

211
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:10,719
To look girly?

212
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:14,932
No. Sungsil gave it to me.

213
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:16,934
I only used it because I had it--

214
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:20,562
Were you hoping for this?

215
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:26,151
What's wrong?

216
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:33,409
This side was hoping for something too.

217
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:40,332
Are you hooked?

218
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:47,006
You acted all innocent,
but you come out and ask for it.

219
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:48,674
You're so forward.

220
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:50,259
You need a good kick, don't you?

221
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:52,052
Get over here!

222
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:54,471
I'll kill you. Get back here.

223
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:55,723
Get over here.

224
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:57,641
You're really strange.

225
00:16:57,725 --> 00:16:59,977
I'm not strange. Get over here.

226
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:02,271
Why you…

227
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:14,783
Why are they telling us to come
just for this tiny competition?

228
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:17,202
Can't you do this much
given how much they pay you?

229
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:21,123
Whoever loses
only eats burgers for a week.

230
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:26,587
Don't be nervous. Stand tall. Chest out.

231
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:28,839
-Be bold and confident.
-Yes, sir!

232
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:30,591
Watch out for counterattacks.

233
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:32,176
We'll counterattack.

234
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:34,303
Let them intimidate you, and you'll lose.

235
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:37,514
Hey. Glare at them.
Make sure to glare at them!

236
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:38,432
Let's go!

237
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:46,148
We're about to begin.
Get ready and come out.

238
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:47,483
Okay.

239
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:49,359
-Hi.
-Hi.

240
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:52,529
Hello. I'm sorry. Sorry.

241
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:53,655
That punk.

242
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:55,741
Hey.

243
00:17:57,534 --> 00:17:58,619
Hello.

244
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:11,715
Let's have a good match.

245
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,570
We'll win this today. Let's do this.

246
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:35,072
-Let's do this!
-Let's do this!

247
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,038
Let's begin, everyone.

248
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,084
-Are you ready?
-Yes, sir!

249
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:50,087
Let's begin.

250
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:14,319
Yes!

251
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,204
Dang it!

252
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:29,585
Does he think he's Sharapova?
What's his problem?

253
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:53,775
The non-national team kids
are putting up a fight today.

254
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:55,819
They must be angry
from the food poisoning.

255
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:01,575
Coach. The men finished a set.

256
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:03,785
Keep going.

257
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:06,830
There's no end or breaks.

258
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:14,546
Why aren't they blowing the whistle?

259
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:15,672
Hey.

260
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,556
Use your energy wisely.

261
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:27,142
Looks like the last one standing wins.

262
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:28,644
Okay.

263
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,400
Watch every player carefully from now on.

264
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:38,737
Once they get tired,
their weaknesses are bound to show.

265
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:43,951
Okay! If you can't play anymore,
you can leave voluntarily!

266
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,375
Get off me!

267
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:54,253
They're not blowing the whistle.

268
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:55,921
I'm about to barf.

269
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:06,807
Are you all right? Hey.

270
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:10,602
Gosh. You can see
how hard they practice regularly.

271
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:22,572
Are you okay?

272
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:43,468
Is it the final stretch?

273
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:45,846
They'll die at this rate.

274
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:57,774
-Are you okay?
-I'm okay.

275
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:07,117
Darn it. I don't think I can continue.

276
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:11,288
You did well. You should go.

277
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:14,624
Dang it.

278
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:17,044
I wanted to stay until the very end.

279
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:22,341
You did great. You really did.

280
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:24,551
Let's go.

281
00:22:29,639 --> 00:22:30,474
Darn.

282
00:22:36,104 --> 00:22:37,439
Got one.

283
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:46,782
Hey.

284
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:47,991
Are you okay?

285
00:22:57,959 --> 00:23:01,922
Hey. We'll finish up here.

286
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:06,843
Will you?

287
00:23:08,678 --> 00:23:10,138
Thanks, guys.

288
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:16,186
Okay!

289
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:19,356
We'll proceed as doubles now.

290
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:21,274
Get moving.

291
00:23:29,157 --> 00:23:31,076
Let's play for real now.

292
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:37,082
What the heck?

293
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:41,878
Hey. You can't even take me on--

294
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:43,171
-Hey.
-What?

295
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:47,134
Why you…

296
00:23:47,217 --> 00:23:48,802
You take this ignoramus.

297
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:51,763
I'll take down that muscled pig.

298
00:23:53,348 --> 00:23:54,182
Seriously.

299
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:58,019
I'm the ace. How dare you look down on--

300
00:23:58,103 --> 00:23:59,146
Let's win this.

301
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:06,486
Try me. Go on.

302
00:24:28,216 --> 00:24:30,552
Taejun is actually flying.

303
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:32,637
He used to be weak.

304
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:37,434
It may have been his will that was weak.

305
00:24:51,072 --> 00:24:54,201
Do you think you can attack
without going through me?

306
00:24:54,951 --> 00:24:56,828
Get out of my way. You're annoying.

307
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:11,343
It's my chance.

308
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:52,342
What did Taejun just hit?

309
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:56,054
What was that?

310
00:25:56,805 --> 00:26:00,058
If we had measured it,
it would be close to Junghwan's record.

311
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:11,069
Coach. Should we wrap up?

312
00:26:11,152 --> 00:26:12,988
-Yes, wrap up.
-Okay.

313
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:18,159
Okay, that's enough!

314
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:19,578
Good work, everyone!

315
00:26:52,193 --> 00:26:53,862
You're thinking about Taejun, right?

316
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:57,657
He's a fun kid.

317
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:01,244
He's a funny punk.

318
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:04,372
I touched it.

319
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:06,791
What?

320
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:24,726
I skimmed it slightly.

321
00:27:25,685 --> 00:27:27,020
We almost lost.

322
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:30,315
No wonder.

323
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:33,234
Its trajectory wasn't toward me.

324
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:34,861
That means we cheated.

325
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:38,031
It's not cheating
if the ref didn't see it.

326
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:40,492
That's true.

327
00:27:58,134 --> 00:27:59,552
Taejun, you sleeping?

328
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:02,430
No.

329
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:04,683
That was a nice smash earlier.

330
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:15,068
You were good.

331
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:21,408
Was I good?

332
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:42,220
You lasted until the end,

333
00:28:42,303 --> 00:28:44,097
so you'll make it to the team match.

334
00:28:45,014 --> 00:28:48,393
You almost made it to the end too.
I'm sure you'll make it too.

335
00:28:48,476 --> 00:28:50,437
Having hope is torture.

336
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:55,608
Being benched during the team match
really stinks.

337
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:59,195
Because it means I'm useless to the team.

338
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:06,369
Congrats in advance, though.

339
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:18,715
You were awesome earlier.

340
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:21,468
It was almost 493 kph.

341
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:23,470
You saw that?

342
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:24,929
Yeah.

343
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:27,682
That was nothing.

344
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:30,643
Taeyang. Congrats on making it as starter.

345
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:32,687
It hasn't been announced yet.

346
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:35,356
You survived,
so you'll be chosen for sure.

347
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:38,651
Right? I should make it, right?

348
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:42,489
I don't care to hear
how it feels to have survived.

349
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:47,452
This is the best.

350
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:52,749
It was hard, wasn't it?

351
00:29:53,833 --> 00:29:54,667
Yes.

352
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:57,253
I thought I was going to die.

353
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:01,216
But it's nice coming back
after almost dying.

354
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:05,220
I really wanted to make it as starter.

355
00:30:06,429 --> 00:30:08,890
"Park Taeyang isn't done for yet.

356
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:11,893
She's useful to the team."

357
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:15,230
I needed that confidence boost.

358
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:18,733
You got your confidence now.

359
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:22,070
How long will we stay like this?

360
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:23,613
A little longer.

361
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:25,990
It's melting away the fatigue.

362
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:29,577
So this is how it feels
to hug your girlfriend after a match.

363
00:30:30,411 --> 00:30:32,413
I want to compete every day.

364
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:50,765
Okay, then. I'll announce the team.

365
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:53,476
Step to the side if I call your name.

366
00:30:58,731 --> 00:30:59,941
Yook Junghwan.

367
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:04,028
-Koo Hyukbong.
-Yes, sir.

368
00:31:04,612 --> 00:31:06,573
-Hwang Sieun.
-Yes, sir.

369
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:10,326
-Lee Youngsim.
-Yes, sir.

370
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:14,539
-Lee Jinseok.
-Yes, sir.

371
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,834
-Kim Seyeon.
-Yes, sir.

372
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:21,170
-Jung Jisoo.
-Yes, sir.

373
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:24,841
Park Taejun.

374
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:26,718
Yes, sir.

375
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:36,019
And the final male player is…

376
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:43,443
-Lee Jiho.
-Yes! I did it.

377
00:31:46,195 --> 00:31:48,114
-It was worth the effort, right?
-Yes.

378
00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:49,157
Hey.

379
00:31:54,787 --> 00:31:57,081
Okay, that's it for the men.

380
00:31:57,665 --> 00:32:01,252
There's one woman doubles player left.

381
00:32:12,388 --> 00:32:16,351
Taeyang, congrats in advance.
You're the only one who can make the cut.

382
00:32:17,143 --> 00:32:18,227
Thank you.

383
00:32:19,562 --> 00:32:22,065
The last member to participate
in the women's team match is…

384
00:32:25,568 --> 00:32:26,402
Yang Sungsil.

385
00:32:30,698 --> 00:32:32,367
It's been a while.

386
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:44,170
Taeyang.

387
00:32:46,589 --> 00:32:47,674
Congrats.

388
00:32:58,226 --> 00:33:02,730
Okay, then. Don't be too happy
just because you're a starter,

389
00:33:03,356 --> 00:33:05,942
and don't be disappointed
because you're not.

390
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:09,320
Train harder with the mentality
that this is just the beginning. Okay?

391
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:10,697
Yes, sir!

392
00:33:20,581 --> 00:33:22,750
I can't take it.

393
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:25,503
I'm going to call Coach.

394
00:33:25,586 --> 00:33:27,547
-No.
-Is this an endurance sport?

395
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:30,174
Are we marathon runners?

396
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:33,720
Me? I'm fine not being a starter.

397
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:37,140
But I can't accept the results.

398
00:33:38,057 --> 00:33:39,434
I'm going to call Coach…

399
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:42,770
No. I'm going to call Taesang.

400
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:46,274
Come on. Don't do that.

401
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:48,443
You're being too forceful.

402
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:49,527
Get off me.

403
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:54,407
A player should tell the coach
how he feels.

404
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:57,744
-Don't stop me.
-Yes, do it.

405
00:33:57,827 --> 00:33:59,203
Do it!

406
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:02,957
Wait a second. Hold on. Dang it.
Who does he take us for?

407
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:04,667
Hey. Who are you calling?

408
00:34:05,793 --> 00:34:09,338
Coach! Can you talk?

409
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:11,049
Hold on.

410
00:34:12,508 --> 00:34:15,428
It's Coach. You can do it!

411
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:19,015
You can do it! You…

412
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:21,517
Hold on. Dongwan wants to talk to you.

413
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:23,936
-He needs to tell you something.
-Wait, I…

414
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:26,814
-I have to go to the bathroom.
-Hey, wait…

415
00:34:27,857 --> 00:34:29,317
-Hey.
-But…

416
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,903
Hang up. Now. Hang up.

417
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:34,363
I didn't call him for real.

418
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:36,032
I only pretended to.

419
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:39,410
I knew that rat would cop out.

420
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,205
-Nice.
-Sunsoo.

421
00:34:42,288 --> 00:34:45,541
Hey! What if that moron
had actually taken the call?

422
00:34:46,709 --> 00:34:48,878
I was confident he wouldn't.

423
00:34:48,961 --> 00:34:52,215
-Nice!
-Nice, Sunsoo!

424
00:34:53,966 --> 00:34:55,384
That's kind of frightening.

425
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:56,803
Right?

426
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:00,681
That's right…

427
00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:03,643
Here we go.

428
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:06,771
We're way too successful.

429
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:09,774
You get to start again, Sungsil.

430
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:12,819
Congrats.

431
00:35:12,902 --> 00:35:14,028
It's been so hard.

432
00:35:14,987 --> 00:35:17,281
But it doesn't sit right with me.

433
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:18,533
What?

434
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:22,745
I can't understand why I made it
instead of Taeyang.

435
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:25,623
It's because you're good.
Because you're qualified.

436
00:35:25,706 --> 00:35:27,667
Coach isn't stupid.

437
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:29,669
He decided after considering everything.

438
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:33,548
Still, I really can't get used to this,

439
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:35,299
competing among ourselves.

440
00:35:35,883 --> 00:35:37,677
It's win or die in sports.

441
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:41,305
Eat.

442
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:44,559
Good job.

443
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:47,186
-Peel it for me.
-Okay.

444
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:50,982
-Looks good.
-Enjoy.

445
00:35:57,321 --> 00:35:59,866
Taeyang is inconsistent in matches,

446
00:35:59,949 --> 00:36:03,703
and above all else,
she lacks precision as of now.

447
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:06,789
Sungsil is more stable,
so she's a better choice.

448
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:10,835
Gosh. I couldn't look Taeyang in the eye.

449
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:14,964
You always make me be the bad guy.

450
00:36:15,047 --> 00:36:17,675
Naturally, you should do it. Must I--

451
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:24,140
I thought she'd rush over and argue,
but she's being quiet.

452
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:26,684
It must be hard to accept.

453
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:28,895
She's just like that.

454
00:36:29,478 --> 00:36:32,064
She doesn't blame others,
bad luck, or circumstances.

455
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:35,109
She trains foolishly hard
to improve her skills.

456
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:37,361
I was like that.

457
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:41,115
Are you laughing at me?

458
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:44,619
Why you…

459
00:36:45,786 --> 00:36:47,288
You punks.

460
00:36:48,664 --> 00:36:51,542
Winning the Olympic gold…
What would you guys know?

461
00:36:53,836 --> 00:36:54,754
Gosh.

462
00:36:57,006 --> 00:36:58,466
I'm sure those who won't make it

463
00:36:58,549 --> 00:37:02,553
are whining and crying right now,
saying they're angry and that it's unfair.

464
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:07,058
But those who will make it
are probably training right now.

465
00:37:24,992 --> 00:37:26,285
At least, you…

466
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:28,871
have a future.

467
00:37:43,469 --> 00:37:45,471
I have to move into
the training center tomorrow.

468
00:37:45,554 --> 00:37:47,265
I thought I'd see you
while I was in Seoul.

469
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:50,601
Is it a habit of yours to toy with me?

470
00:37:52,478 --> 00:37:54,981
Why didn't you meet me
in front of the hospital that day?

471
00:37:55,189 --> 00:37:56,857
You should've said if you couldn't.

472
00:37:57,149 --> 00:37:58,985
You said you'd slit my throat.

473
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,237
What kind of bull is that?

474
00:38:04,991 --> 00:38:05,992
You're so annoying!

475
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:10,579
Why is she getting mad?

476
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:13,165
MYSTERIOUS TAROT

477
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:16,043
A tarot reading?

478
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:21,841
-Hello.
-Hello.

479
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:24,552
What are you doing in here?

480
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:26,637
Tell me what will happen between us.

481
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:30,725
He's mean and says he doesn't like me,
but he keeps coming back.

482
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:33,060
If I meet up with him,
he talks about his first love.

483
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:34,603
Then he comes back again.

484
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:37,356
I don't know what he's trying to pull.

485
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:41,152
If it's meant to be, I'll be patient.

486
00:38:41,235 --> 00:38:44,030
If it's not meant to be,
I'm going to kick him to the curb.

487
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:48,159
Think of a question
and pick out ten cards.

488
00:39:00,546 --> 00:39:03,424
What do we do? She says we'll get married.

489
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:05,843
Should we go see a fortune-teller?

490
00:39:05,926 --> 00:39:08,763
Or a diviner? Something traditional?

491
00:39:09,555 --> 00:39:11,098
Who knows what they'd say?

492
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:14,185
At most, they'll say we get married.

493
00:39:14,268 --> 00:39:15,269
Right.

494
00:39:20,566 --> 00:39:22,401
It's Yook Junghwan! Isn't it?

495
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:24,070
-Oh, my gosh.
-It is.

496
00:39:24,153 --> 00:39:26,655
-You're so cute.
-You're so hot.

497
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:29,658
-May I get a photo?
-He's so cute.

498
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:32,495
-Is that your girlfriend?
-Can I get a picture?

499
00:39:32,578 --> 00:39:34,455
You don't want to be photographed.

500
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:36,791
-You're so cute.
-So cute.

501
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:38,542
Passing through.

502
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:41,420
-No pictures.
-You're really cute.

503
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:44,465
-No pictures.
-Just one, please?

504
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:46,133
Who is she?

505
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:49,970
I dropped my bag.

506
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:51,764
I'll get it. Stay here.

507
00:39:51,972 --> 00:39:54,683
Excuse me. Don't step on that.

508
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:04,402
This is nuts.

509
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:32,972
Was that your hand?

510
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:34,557
My bad.

511
00:40:36,642 --> 00:40:38,853
I need to enter the destination.
Where should we go?

512
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:51,449
I was going to enter it myself.

513
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:53,075
You're driving.

514
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:58,873
Do you want some candy?

515
00:41:03,335 --> 00:41:05,296
Seriously.

516
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:08,966
I was going to get it myself.
I have hands too.

517
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:14,597
Here. Take it with your hand.

518
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:21,979
You're so dense.

519
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:25,107
Fine. Okay.

520
00:42:25,584 --> 00:42:26,669
You okay?

521
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:33,801
Let's go eat. It's on me.

522
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:40,641
I'm okay.

523
00:42:41,141 --> 00:42:43,018
So what if I'm not okay?

524
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:45,229
You have your ups and downs. That's life.

525
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:49,900
Sorry.

526
00:42:52,152 --> 00:42:53,153
For what?

527
00:42:54,446 --> 00:42:55,739
For making it alone.

528
00:42:57,825 --> 00:43:01,287
If only one of us were to do well,

529
00:43:02,621 --> 00:43:04,623
I want it to be you all the time.

530
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:08,377
Well… Not like the team match
is a big deal, but still.

531
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:19,138
Do you want to get sashimi?

532
00:43:19,221 --> 00:43:20,889
While listening to the waves?

533
00:43:21,307 --> 00:43:22,683
I know a great spot.

534
00:43:26,979 --> 00:43:28,731
It's kind of far though.

535
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:50,753
You're not going to ask where we're going?

536
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:52,504
You said we were going for sashimi.

537
00:43:52,588 --> 00:43:53,964
Exactly.

538
00:43:54,089 --> 00:43:58,218
Don't you want to know why it's so special
that we have to drive three hours for?

539
00:43:58,302 --> 00:43:59,845
What's the point in asking?

540
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:02,389
You want to go, so we're going.

541
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:37,841
Boss!

542
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:41,595
Hey! Taeyang!

543
00:44:42,096 --> 00:44:43,889
Oh, my gosh. Hey!

544
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:47,685
-Have you been well?
-Of course.

545
00:44:47,768 --> 00:44:51,563
My gosh. I was too excited to sleep
when I got your text that you were coming.

546
00:44:51,647 --> 00:44:53,023
I've missed you too.

547
00:44:54,775 --> 00:44:55,734
-Hello.
-Hello.

548
00:44:56,318 --> 00:44:58,070
Who's this? Your boyfriend?

549
00:44:58,195 --> 00:44:59,279
Yes.

550
00:44:59,363 --> 00:45:01,573
I wanted to feed him some sashimi.

551
00:45:01,657 --> 00:45:04,284
-Really?
-May I wield the knife?

552
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:06,286
I just sharpened them.

553
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:08,497
Boyfriend. What do you like?

554
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:10,582
Pick something from here.

555
00:45:10,666 --> 00:45:13,544
-Okay.
-Let's see.

556
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:41,155
"Be born as a human in your next life.

557
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:43,866
Don't live like me."

558
00:45:45,617 --> 00:45:49,621
I prayed that for the fish
every time I killed one.

559
00:45:53,542 --> 00:45:56,128
My dad said to learn a trade
instead of playing sports.

560
00:45:57,129 --> 00:45:58,839
Maybe I should've listened.

561
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:08,766
Good for you.

562
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:11,643
You have a backup plan if you retire.

563
00:46:12,352 --> 00:46:15,439
Of course. Do you know how hard it was
to learn this skill?

564
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:20,319
It took me two years
to be able to grab a knife.

565
00:46:20,819 --> 00:46:22,988
I took out the trash all the time
before then.

566
00:46:25,324 --> 00:46:28,452
My boss may not look it,
but he's super strict.

567
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:36,084
Today,

568
00:46:37,336 --> 00:46:39,421
I really wanted to come back here.

569
00:46:43,675 --> 00:46:45,302
Who's Park Taeyang?

570
00:46:47,179 --> 00:46:50,849
She endured three years
in this countryside sashimi restaurant.

571
00:46:53,393 --> 00:46:55,854
My life now is heaven
compared to back then.

572
00:46:57,439 --> 00:46:59,691
At least I'm back where I belong.

573
00:47:12,871 --> 00:47:16,333
Taeyang, you haven't lost your touch.

574
00:47:16,416 --> 00:47:18,210
I learned from the best.

575
00:47:18,293 --> 00:47:20,212
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

576
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:24,675
That's nice.

577
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:27,970
When this kid

578
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:33,517
showed up at my door crying,
begging me to let her work for me,

579
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:35,811
she was like,

580
00:47:36,728 --> 00:47:41,149
"Please just feed me and house me."

581
00:47:41,775 --> 00:47:42,818
Isn't that right?

582
00:47:43,569 --> 00:47:45,821
-I did that?
-Do you deny it?

583
00:47:45,904 --> 00:47:47,781
-I did not.
-Gosh.

584
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:49,283
You're drunk.

585
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:51,577
That's because I'm the only one drinking.

586
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:57,875
No wonder. I thought she had
the most impressive endurance.

587
00:47:58,458 --> 00:48:02,254
I never imagined
she was a badminton player.

588
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:05,132
Gosh.

589
00:48:06,508 --> 00:48:08,302
I don't know what happened,

590
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:13,724
but you have to succeed, okay?

591
00:48:13,807 --> 00:48:15,851
You've suffered enough. You deserve it.

592
00:48:16,643 --> 00:48:17,519
Don't you agree?

593
00:48:19,813 --> 00:48:21,189
Go to the Olympics.

594
00:48:21,273 --> 00:48:25,110
Gosh. You think anyone who plays a sport
goes to the Olympics, don't you?

595
00:48:25,193 --> 00:48:28,405
That's why I can't tell people
that I'm an athlete.

596
00:48:28,488 --> 00:48:31,325
You're such a scaredy-cat.

597
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:33,869
Seriously. "I can do it."

598
00:48:33,994 --> 00:48:36,830
-"Let's do this."
-Enough. I'm sick of it.

599
00:48:36,914 --> 00:48:38,290
You need to hear more nagging.

600
00:48:38,373 --> 00:48:40,125
Hey, boyfriend. Nag her a little.

601
00:48:40,709 --> 00:48:41,960
Tell her she can do it.

602
00:48:43,921 --> 00:48:46,423
-Cheers!
-Cheers.

603
00:48:47,716 --> 00:48:49,176
-Nice to meet you.
-See you next time.

604
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:50,510
-Bye.
-Good night.

605
00:48:51,011 --> 00:48:52,679
-Taeyang!
-Yes?

606
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:54,765
Teach me a little next time you come.

607
00:48:54,848 --> 00:48:56,892
You don't have any talent.

608
00:48:56,975 --> 00:49:00,103
-I enjoyed dinner.
-I'll practice until then.

609
00:49:01,021 --> 00:49:02,481
We'll see if I have talent.

610
00:49:07,527 --> 00:49:08,570
Bye.

611
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,060
What are you doing here alone?

612
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:47,521
Did you stay up all night?

613
00:51:48,438 --> 00:51:50,023
Isn't it really pretty here?

614
00:51:52,567 --> 00:51:56,822
It was depressing and suffocating
when I trapped myself here.

615
00:51:58,156 --> 00:51:59,866
I never knew how pretty it was.

616
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:07,874
There's something
I didn't get to say yesterday.

617
00:52:10,335 --> 00:52:12,587
Congrats on making the team match.

618
00:52:14,047 --> 00:52:15,715
I didn't get to congratulate you properly.

619
00:52:19,219 --> 00:52:20,929
There's something
I didn't get to say to you.

620
00:52:23,098 --> 00:52:24,182
It must've been

621
00:52:25,725 --> 00:52:27,102
really hard.

622
00:52:29,104 --> 00:52:32,232
Someone who loves the sport
as much as you, living here…

623
00:52:36,903 --> 00:52:41,700
It must've been much harder
than I had imagined.

624
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:52,961
I had no right to say it was hard.

625
00:52:54,504 --> 00:52:56,631
I ruined someone's life.

626
00:52:58,592 --> 00:53:00,677
Getting injured while playing sports

627
00:53:02,137 --> 00:53:03,972
is like destiny.

628
00:53:05,557 --> 00:53:07,350
Even if you injured them

629
00:53:07,434 --> 00:53:10,103
and ended their career.

630
00:53:17,110 --> 00:53:21,698
She didn't get injured
while playing badminton.

631
00:53:35,629 --> 00:53:39,841
Every time I felt suffocated,
I walked here.

632
00:53:40,675 --> 00:53:42,928
Do you know what pained me the most?

633
00:53:49,351 --> 00:53:50,936
I wondered…

634
00:53:57,692 --> 00:53:59,569
if I was jealous of her.

635
00:54:02,989 --> 00:54:05,784
That maybe I competed with her
deep down inside.

636
00:54:07,494 --> 00:54:10,205
That maybe I had made her feel lonely.

637
00:54:11,915 --> 00:54:13,375
Was I…

638
00:54:16,544 --> 00:54:19,172
truly a good friend?

639
00:54:20,215 --> 00:54:22,801
What friend isn't competitive?

640
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:26,721
I'm sure you were a good friend.

641
00:54:29,474 --> 00:54:31,601
She didn't want to go,

642
00:54:32,185 --> 00:54:34,229
but I dragged her there.

643
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:37,732
I made her drink

644
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:41,194
and I caused the accident.

645
00:54:41,278 --> 00:54:44,447
I knew she was hurt,
but I didn't take her to the hospital.

646
00:54:45,073 --> 00:54:48,285
Because I was afraid of being disciplined
during the stupid winter training.

647
00:54:49,452 --> 00:54:51,371
I thought it was nothing serious.

648
00:54:53,415 --> 00:54:55,166
Winter training?

649
00:54:57,377 --> 00:55:01,589
She lied to her family
that she got injured during training.

650
00:55:01,673 --> 00:55:03,425
To protect me.

651
00:55:04,509 --> 00:55:06,344
But that wasn't true.

652
00:55:06,428 --> 00:55:09,597
It wasn't. It was because of me.

653
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:12,559
But I pretended not to know.

654
00:55:20,567 --> 00:55:21,776
Taejun.

655
00:55:26,197 --> 00:55:27,949
Even if you shine brighter than I do,

656
00:55:28,908 --> 00:55:31,578
even if you have talents that I lack,

657
00:55:31,661 --> 00:55:33,830
I will never be jealous of you.

658
00:55:34,914 --> 00:55:38,293
I will never have such wicked feelings
toward someone I love again.

659
00:55:39,419 --> 00:55:40,628
I mean it.

660
00:56:04,277 --> 00:56:05,820
It's Park Junyoung,

661
00:56:07,072 --> 00:56:08,239
isn't it?

662
00:56:11,326 --> 00:56:12,327
Yes.

663
00:56:24,381 --> 00:56:25,507
Let's stay…

664
00:56:31,346 --> 00:56:32,889
like this for a moment.

665
00:57:11,803 --> 00:57:14,889
Park Taeyang swings! She scores!

666
00:57:14,973 --> 00:57:17,016
They have come from behind
and taken the win.

667
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:20,311
Korea wins! Korea has won!

668
00:57:22,814 --> 00:57:26,818
Park Taeyang is overwhelmed with emotion
and moved to tears.

669
00:57:27,861 --> 00:57:30,196
We've won the gold in women's doubles--

670
00:57:49,966 --> 00:57:53,052
I won for the first time
at an international competition,

671
00:57:54,429 --> 00:57:56,181
but I hated myself immensely.

672
00:57:57,348 --> 00:57:58,808
This is wrong.

673
00:58:00,143 --> 00:58:03,188
I don't deserve the applause.

674
00:58:04,898 --> 00:58:07,609
I was filled with remorse.

675
00:58:13,448 --> 00:58:14,449
Careful.

676
00:58:14,949 --> 00:58:16,993
Junyoung. How did this happen?

677
00:58:17,076 --> 00:58:19,537
Junyoung. Junyoung!

678
00:58:21,206 --> 00:58:24,209
-Junyoung.
-Do you know what happened to her?

679
00:58:24,292 --> 00:58:25,418
What?

680
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:27,670
Why won't you say anything?

681
00:58:31,466 --> 00:58:33,468
I went hiking alone after it was canceled.

682
00:58:35,053 --> 00:58:36,304
I fell down a hill.

683
00:58:36,387 --> 00:58:37,555
What?

684
00:58:38,306 --> 00:58:39,682
Junyoung.

685
00:58:39,766 --> 00:58:41,392
Get on my back.

686
00:58:42,268 --> 00:58:44,145
-Put her on my back.
-Oh, no.

687
00:58:44,229 --> 00:58:47,815
-I should've told the truth then at least.
-Are you okay?

688
00:58:49,150 --> 00:58:50,902
That it was my fault.

689
00:58:55,365 --> 00:58:57,617
I love you, Junyoung.

690
00:58:58,493 --> 00:59:01,287
Hey. You're too drunk.

691
00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:04,582
I don't know about this.
I've never boarded before.

692
00:59:04,666 --> 00:59:08,711
Whatever. Park Junyoung! I love you!

693
00:59:14,717 --> 00:59:16,177
-There's no one here!
-No.

694
00:59:17,011 --> 00:59:20,098
I should've listened to her and gone back.

695
00:59:23,226 --> 00:59:24,227
No.

696
00:59:25,103 --> 00:59:27,355
We never should've gone there
in the first place.

697
00:59:27,438 --> 00:59:29,941
One, two, three.

698
00:59:32,318 --> 00:59:33,236
No.

699
00:59:35,446 --> 00:59:37,699
I never should've liked you
from the start.

700
00:59:38,575 --> 00:59:42,078
Junyoung. I want to be like you.

701
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:46,249
-What was your name again?
-It's Park Taeyang.

702
01:00:01,389 --> 01:00:03,433
SPECIAL THANKS TO JIN SUN KYU

703
01:00:31,419 --> 01:00:33,338
GOING TO YOU AT A SPEED OF 493KM

704
01:00:33,421 --> 01:00:35,965
Together? All night?
You stayed out together?

705
01:00:36,049 --> 01:00:37,091
Are the two going out?

706
01:00:37,175 --> 01:00:38,926
-Are you two dating?
-I'll come clean too.

707
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:40,970
-I'm going out with Jiho.
-What?

708
01:00:41,054 --> 01:00:43,473
What if you pair up with Junghwan
for the team match?

709
01:00:43,556 --> 01:00:45,767
Provide support to Junghwan.
That's your role.

710
01:00:46,351 --> 01:00:48,436
Support you? Not a chance.

711
01:00:48,519 --> 01:00:50,688
Are you saying you'll compete against me?

712
01:00:51,022 --> 01:00:52,940
Do you really like me?

713
01:00:53,024 --> 01:00:56,444
No one has ever liked me this much before.

714
01:00:57,612 --> 01:00:59,322
No one, Taejun.

715
01:01:10,583 --> 01:01:11,709
GOING TO YOU AT A SPEED OF 493KM

716
01:01:11,793 --> 01:01:13,795
