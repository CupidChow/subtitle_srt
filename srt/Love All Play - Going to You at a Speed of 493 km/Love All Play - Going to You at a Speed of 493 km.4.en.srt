1
00:00:37,787 --> 00:00:40,790
GOING TO YOU AT A SPEED OF 493KM

2
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,586
THE PLACES, PEOPLE, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTIONAL

3
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:48,214
EPISODE 4

4
00:00:48,965 --> 00:00:51,259
My room's here. I'll see you later.

5
00:00:51,634 --> 00:00:54,345
Okay, see you tomorrow. Good night.

6
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:02,020
What's wrong with your foot?
Let me take a look.

7
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:03,688
It's okay.

8
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:11,446
Just take off your shoes.

9
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:13,948
Why is no part of you unscathed?

10
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,242
Are these new?

11
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:19,329
I'm getting used to them. It'll be okay.

12
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:26,044
For now…

13
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:31,341
You can wear these.
I'll stretch yours out for you.

14
00:01:35,553 --> 00:01:36,763
By the way,

15
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:39,682
you cry too much.

16
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:45,438
Can you stop doing that?

17
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:48,858
Why?

18
00:01:49,692 --> 00:01:52,320
Try yelling "Taeyang is crying"
and tease me again.

19
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:56,074
It's not that fun anymore… when you cry.

20
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,674
When you need to stretch out shoes,

21
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:17,470
this is the best way to do it.

22
00:02:19,347 --> 00:02:22,684
So, how do I look?
They look good on me, right?

23
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,146
You look funny.

24
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:29,983
Good.

25
00:02:43,746 --> 00:02:47,041
WANDO ARENA

26
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:49,669
-Try your best!
-Go for it!

27
00:02:49,752 --> 00:02:51,588
-Can you? It's up to you!
-Good. Let's do this!

28
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:53,173
-Gosh!
-Goodness!

29
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:56,593
Coach Lee, what are you doing here?

30
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:57,760
Are you surprised?

31
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:01,139
You all must be touched
that I came all the way here.

32
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:04,267
I couldn't sit back and let
my athletes compete without me here.

33
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:07,145
Hey, Park twins! You guys…

34
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:09,147
Gosh.

35
00:03:09,397 --> 00:03:13,026
If you can't even win a medal here,
you should quit playing badminton.

36
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:14,110
Don't worry, sir.

37
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:17,030
How can I not?
You two haven't even practiced together.

38
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:20,617
-Follow me.
-Yes, sir.

39
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:22,785
-Come with me.
-Thank you, sir.

40
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:28,374
-Have you two practiced together?
-Well, we did what we could.

41
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:29,626
Forget it, you punk.

42
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:34,255
YUK JUNGHWAN
WANDO NATIONAL BADMINTON TOURNAMENT

43
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:38,134
You stretched these out perfectly!

44
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:39,928
I feel like I could fly!

45
00:03:40,511 --> 00:03:41,471
I'm like a butterfly!

46
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:44,974
Hurry, let's go.

47
00:03:49,854 --> 00:03:51,022
Let's do this.

48
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:54,067
You better be flying
all over the court today.

49
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:56,653
Let's win this.

50
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:05,995
WANDO, HOPEFUL FOR THE FUTURE

51
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:09,082
YUK JUNGHWAN
WANDO NATIONAL BADMINTON CHAMPIONSHIPS

52
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:18,800
-Go for it! Show them what Yunis has got!
-Go for it!

53
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:21,052
WE ARE ALL LEGENDS
LET'S GO YUNIS!

54
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:24,597
Coach Joo, do you want to see Taejun
in a match that badly?

55
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:27,016
to tag along all the way here?

56
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,017
PARK TAEJUN

57
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:30,520
I just came since you were coming.

58
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:34,941
So who did you come to see?
Taejun or Taeyang?

59
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:37,443
I only came out of a sense of duty.

60
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:38,820
PARK TAEYANG

61
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:40,571
Do you think they'll even play properly?

62
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:45,034
Let's see how they do today.
If they can't make it work--

63
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:47,245
-We'll have to split them up.
-What?

64
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:49,289
I think this will be
their last day as partners.

65
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:51,165
-But--
-I'll be back.

66
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:55,295
Gosh, he's so extreme.

67
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:58,256
All right!

68
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:01,509
All right!

69
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:03,011
-Go for it!
-Good luck!

70
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:05,430
Remember. Don't worry about
what other people might think.

71
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:06,806
Don't get distracted.

72
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:09,100
Let's push ahead like how I said.

73
00:05:09,183 --> 00:05:10,560
The match will now begin.

74
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:11,978
Okay.

75
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:15,231
On my right,
Yunis's Park Taejun and Park Taeyang.

76
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:18,693
On my left, Choi Seyoon
of Onnuri Association

77
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:20,403
and Park Siyoung
of Daebak Road Corporation.

78
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:30,246
What? Why are they switching positions?

79
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:31,956
What's going on?

80
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,541
Park Taejun to service.

81
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:35,084
Can she hit it from there?

82
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:39,380
-The shorter player should be up front.
-Shouldn't they switch?

83
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:40,757
Hey, Park twins.

84
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:46,679
That's ridiculous.

85
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:48,514
You want to switch positions?

86
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:52,977
I might be better in the rear court,
but I'm not as powerful as a male player.

87
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:55,688
We'll never know until we try.

88
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:57,940
I say we play to our strengths.

89
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:00,860
Do you want to win or lose?
There are only two paths.

90
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:03,071
We're here to win,
so that's what we should do.

91
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:09,827
There's only so much we can do
by following what others do.

92
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:12,997
So if we're going to lose anyway,

93
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:15,291
let's do it even if we don't win!

94
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,501
Let's do it.

95
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:22,423
Man up front, woman in back?

96
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:25,676
Coach, have you ever seen
anything like this before?

97
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:27,345
No.

98
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:31,599
Those two. They must really want to win.

99
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:34,102
I know.

100
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:41,359
I'll play defense as much as I can,
so trust me and hit as hard as you can.

101
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:43,277
Okay.

102
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:45,321
Let's win.

103
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,573
Let's do it even if we don't win.

104
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:03,381
-Good job.
-That was good.

105
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:25,111
Taejun is making sure
the attack doesn't reach the back.

106
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:40,793
-Yes!
-That's it!

107
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:46,549
Yes!

108
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:12,343
Is this it?

109
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:15,388
Did we win?

110
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:22,895
And I think it may be fun
if it's with you.

111
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:26,023
Know what the most annoying thing
in the world is?

112
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:27,650
What?

113
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:31,779
Being slightly talented.

114
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:36,909
Is it…

115
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:40,246
okay for me to win?

116
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:45,084
Do I have the right to?

117
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,185
-They won!
-Oh, my gosh!

118
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,938
-We won!
-They did it!

119
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:07,690
Don't make a big deal out of nothing.

120
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:10,401
-They won!
-Great job!

121
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:23,831
PARK TAEJUN

122
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:29,170
What are you doing?

123
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:33,257
We just won.

124
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:56,322
Here you go.

125
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:05,122
Gosh, the Park twins are totally insane.

126
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:09,669
I thought they'd pack their bags
after a couple of games.

127
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:10,920
Like him?

128
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:15,341
Are Coach Lee
and Coach Joo staying in Wando?

129
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:17,802
I think they'll stay till the end.

130
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:21,472
As if it's a big match.

131
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:24,058
Hello. I'd like to check out, please.

132
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:27,978
I can't do this. Let's stay one more day.

133
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:29,146
Get us checked in again.

134
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:30,439
Coach! Coach--

135
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:35,277
-Which floor was it?
-I'd like to check in again.

136
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:41,909
Darn it. Seriously.
How about we stay for just one more game?

137
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:45,162
Why do they keep winning? It's annoying!

138
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:57,216
No…

139
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:04,098
Then just stop saying
you want to go back to Seoul.

140
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:07,518
How many times have I packed and unpacked?

141
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:09,854
But I'm curious.

142
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:20,990
Great! Now we'll advance
to the quarterfinals.

143
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:24,410
Hey, I can't believe I'm this excited
over the Yuk Junghwan tournament.

144
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:29,457
Good work today. Go back to your rooms
and… You're already resting.

145
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:32,251
-Look, they're resting.
-Yeah.

146
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:35,880
-Hey, get the blankets.
-Pardon?

147
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:37,840
-Get some blankets for them.
-Yes, sir.

148
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:40,843
I'll go get the pillows.

149
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:49,226
-Go for it!
-Go for it!

150
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:52,438
-Let's go!
-You can do this!

151
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:10,915
Nice! We won! The semifinals!

152
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:13,459
The semifinals! We can get the bronze!

153
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:15,586
Great job, Park twins!

154
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:17,087
-Wait, manners first.
-Park twins!

155
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:19,340
-Go shake hands with them.
-Hey, Park twins!

156
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:28,682
Yumin!

157
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:30,434
Hey, get out of my way!

158
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:32,645
Just move! Hey!

159
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:34,063
Yumin!

160
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,398
Go, Yumin!

161
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,402
Yumin!

162
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:44,281
All right! You did it!

163
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:46,951
Hey, you did great!

164
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:49,286
Yumin!

165
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:52,915
That was amazing!

166
00:13:57,753 --> 00:13:59,588
So now they'll go up against each other.

167
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:06,303
YUK JUNGHWAN
WANDO NATIONAL BADMINTON TOURNAMENT

168
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:46,760
Now isn't the time.

169
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,723
You don't rest because you're hurt.

170
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:52,808
You're hurt because you rested.

171
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:56,353
So don't even dream about it.

172
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:58,522
You have to play more.

173
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:08,532
Is something wrong?

174
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:17,875
Congratulations on winning.

175
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:20,252
We're up against each other next.

176
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:21,837
You can congratulate me when I win.

177
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:26,091
My dad won't go home.
He insists on watching you guys play.

178
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:30,304
As a daughter, the right thing to do
would be to send him back to my mom.

179
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:40,314
Let's have a good match.

180
00:15:58,499 --> 00:15:59,375
Aren't you letting go?

181
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,806
LOCKER ROOM A

182
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:17,393
Darn it. You're the one who started it.

183
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:22,481
Seriously!

184
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:25,150
She was just pretending to be nice.

185
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:38,914
You played well.

186
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:42,710
-Thanks.
-I'm fine as long as we're not teammates.

187
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:49,049
What are you getting at?

188
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:52,845
Since you're trying this hard,
I shouldn't just stay put.

189
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:55,347
Did you forget that I'm slow?

190
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:56,890
Just give it to me straight.

191
00:16:58,559 --> 00:16:59,977
Do your best.

192
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:02,896
So you'll have a place to go
once you get kicked off the team.

193
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:04,857
Whatever.

194
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:15,200
If we win tomorrow,

195
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:17,703
we'll go to the finals.

196
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:21,540
How did we end up coming such a long way?

197
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:23,709
My stomach.

198
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:28,839
I shouldn't have eaten two
of what seemed like double portions.

199
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:31,383
What am I saying?

200
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,303
What if I get sick?

201
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:37,473
Are you nervous?

202
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:39,767
Whatever.

203
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:42,770
Hey, I can see that you are.

204
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:44,605
Are you worried?

205
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:48,400
Stop it. I'm really worried.

206
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,028
In that case,

207
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:55,032
-let's go!
-Go where?

208
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,618
To exercise some self-control.

209
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:04,416
WANDO ARENA

210
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:10,130
I've never been here at night.

211
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:16,178
This place is always like a battlefield
when I'm on the court.

212
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:20,808
It feels weird
to look at it from here like this.

213
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:25,062
It doesn't matter how hard we try.

214
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:28,649
We'll still need the help
of the court fairy out there.

215
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:31,735
What? A court fairy?

216
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,821
You believe in things like that?

217
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:35,405
Watch what you say.

218
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:38,283
She's got a horrible temper.

219
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:41,578
Sorry, but I don't like things like that.

220
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:43,580
You're telling me to leave it to luck.

221
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:48,127
I haven't been that lucky
in my 25 years of life.

222
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,172
There's no such thing.
Luck itself is a skill.

223
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:54,800
Isn't that what sportsmanship is about?

224
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:58,929
If all went as planned, sports wouldn't be
called a drama without a script.

225
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,431
What do you think sportsmanship is?

226
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:04,560
You have to let it go.

227
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,147
There's a difference
between greed and passion.

228
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:12,109
I see.

229
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:13,360
Are you a monk?

230
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,195
Sir,

231
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:18,740
how do I let it go
when there are eyes everywhere

232
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:20,117
awaiting to see what I become?

233
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:23,328
You're way too full of yourself.

234
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,956
People aren't that interested in you.

235
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:30,586
Your presence matters only this much.

236
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:34,256
Gosh… You're getting on my nerves
before the match even starts.

237
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:37,801
But what's with the tone?

238
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:40,596
Oh, are you from the Joseon Dynasty?

239
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:42,055
Are you Wonhyo Daesa?

240
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:43,473
He lived during the Silla Dynasty.

241
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:46,351
Darn it.

242
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:48,937
Darn Silla.

243
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:54,193
I'm having fun. Aren't you?

244
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:01,658
I haven't had this much fun
in a really long time.

245
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:04,286
Feeling nervous,

246
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:06,413
excited,

247
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:09,541
and tired.

248
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:14,087
It's all fun when I'm playing with you.

249
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:26,433
I can cover for you
even if you collapse during the match,

250
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:27,893
so what's there to worry about?

251
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:31,730
Then all I need to do is trust you.

252
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:33,815
Yes, trust me…

253
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:35,984
as I trust you.

254
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:56,755
I wonder how tomorrow's game will go.

255
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:59,925
Whether it's Yumin or our kids who win,

256
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:02,344
wouldn't you be happy either way?

257
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:05,847
I'll feel bad for whoever loses.

258
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:08,558
-It's like that, you punk.
-Oh, I see.

259
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:13,063
Hey, don't you think Taejun's changed
a bit throughout this tournament?

260
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:17,609
Haven't you been blindsided
by the kids enough already?

261
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:19,903
I don't have any expectations.

262
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:22,281
I see. So you have high expectations.

263
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:27,744
Who is it?

264
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:32,249
-I'm here too.
-Sibong, what--

265
00:21:32,332 --> 00:21:34,376
-Mr. Sibong.
-I've missed you.

266
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:39,047
WANDO ARENA

267
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:56,815
This is the last set. Stay focused.
They have two points.

268
00:21:58,650 --> 00:21:59,735
Right. My bad.

269
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:09,619
Let's not get distracted.

270
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:11,663
I'm strong.

271
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:13,832
I'm strong.

272
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:40,650
LEE YUMIN

273
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:04,758
Yumin seems a little slow today.

274
00:23:05,592 --> 00:23:08,345
You should keep your eyes
on Taeyang instead of Yumin today.

275
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:10,347
How do you think she'll do?

276
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:11,515
What?

277
00:23:12,849 --> 00:23:14,476
She was very active in the previous set,

278
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:17,312
but she doesn't look so good now.

279
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:18,647
No, I mean in the future.

280
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:21,149
How much potential do you see in her?

281
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:48,468
All right!

282
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:14,870
Go for it!

283
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:51,781
Okay! A tie!

284
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:54,367
They caught up.

285
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:58,205
But for some reason,
Taeyang is only hitting smashes today.

286
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:01,666
She should be careful with her ankle.
Why isn't she doing that?

287
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:11,343
They keep closing in. They're so annoying.

288
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:36,201
Are you okay?

289
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,120
-Hurry, go.
-I knew this would happen.

290
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:48,255
Are you okay? Let's take a look.

291
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:51,633
You didn't have to come down here.

292
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:53,927
My muscle is just a bit overworked.

293
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:56,888
How long has it been like this?
Have you been playing in pain?

294
00:25:58,098 --> 00:26:00,767
Wait, Mr. Sibong. I'm really okay.

295
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:03,019
You can't be an athlete
if you play it safe.

296
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:05,522
This could get inflamed.

297
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:09,150
Taeyang, not getting injured
is more important than winning.

298
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:10,569
I don't root for you guys to win.

299
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:12,445
I root for you to finish
without any injuries.

300
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:14,197
You have to make the right call.

301
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:17,158
Mr. Sibong. Really, I'm fine.

302
00:26:22,455 --> 00:26:24,749
Please sit over there and enjoy the game.

303
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:30,839
Okay.

304
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,633
Tell me. How does it look?

305
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:39,264
Let's go.

306
00:26:52,902 --> 00:26:54,529
You can't endure the pain.

307
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:57,699
Let Mr. Sibong take a look at your ankle.
Why are you being so stubborn?

308
00:27:00,368 --> 00:27:02,287
We only need three more points to win.

309
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:04,497
That's nothing.

310
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:07,626
-You--
-You said you'd cover for me

311
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:09,085
even if I collapsed on the court.

312
00:27:10,545 --> 00:27:13,548
Taejun, I'll play
because I know I can count on you.

313
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:35,153
What should I do?

314
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:38,156
Let's see how her ankle looks
when she plays and--

315
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:39,157
No, sir.

316
00:27:41,284 --> 00:27:43,828
What should I do to win?

317
00:27:56,966 --> 00:27:58,343
There's no answer for that.

318
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:00,845
You just have to do your best.

319
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:09,229
Have you ever shown everything you've got?

320
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:14,025
You can try doing that today.

321
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:17,445
All right, Yunis. Go for it!

322
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:21,491
Good luck!

323
00:28:44,013 --> 00:28:45,515
Just three points.

324
00:28:48,643 --> 00:28:49,728
I'll finish this quickly.

325
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:43,990
Two more points to go.

326
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:49,579
Give it here.

327
00:29:50,413 --> 00:29:51,998
Before I lose my momentum.

328
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:34,499
Here.

329
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:35,959
It's for you.

330
00:30:43,216 --> 00:30:45,760
This feather fell out
when you hit your last drop shot today.

331
00:30:46,761 --> 00:30:48,763
You could call it
a symbol of victory, I guess.

332
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:52,225
Put it in your pocket for tomorrow's game.
Like a lucky charm.

333
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,603
Didn't you say
that you don't believe in luck?

334
00:30:56,187 --> 00:31:00,066
But this time you've made your own luck.

335
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:01,025
If you don't want it--

336
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:05,405
Thanks.

337
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:12,662
Thank you too.

338
00:31:16,457 --> 00:31:17,959
For being by my side.

339
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:30,388
The unofficial world record?

340
00:31:30,805 --> 00:31:31,639
Yes.

341
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:35,685
Four-hundred-ninety-three.

342
00:31:36,811 --> 00:31:39,814
Just hearing that number
makes my heart race,

343
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:48,031
as I think of this light shuttlecock
becoming the fastest in the world.

344
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:52,535
We'll have a moment
like that someday, right?

345
00:31:54,203 --> 00:31:57,415
The moment we become our strongest selves.

346
00:32:01,836 --> 00:32:03,671
Even if it goes unrecognized

347
00:32:04,672 --> 00:32:06,007
and is unofficial.

348
00:32:18,686 --> 00:32:19,687
All right!

349
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:43,378
One more point to go.

350
00:32:45,546 --> 00:32:47,382
You look so exhausted.

351
00:32:52,553 --> 00:32:55,473
How come he's not a national athlete?

352
00:32:57,016 --> 00:32:58,935
We have to score a point this time.

353
00:33:00,603 --> 00:33:02,313
We will win this no matter what.

354
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:36,347
I'm strong.

355
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:38,599
I'm strong.

356
00:33:42,478 --> 00:33:45,106
I'm incredibly strong.

357
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:18,139
Do you feel bummed about today's game?

358
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:20,016
Yes, sir.

359
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:24,520
But I thought deep down you'd be pleased.

360
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:29,192
Let the Park twins take some time off.
They've worked hard.

361
00:34:29,859 --> 00:34:30,818
Yes, sir.

362
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,243
Sorry about that.

363
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:50,171
Your muscles are overworked as expected,
so don't worry too much.

364
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:52,799
You know the drill. Ice. Hospital. Rest.

365
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:54,634
Yes, sir.

366
00:34:57,053 --> 00:34:59,555
No one expected you two to do this well.

367
00:35:02,558 --> 00:35:03,935
Winning bronze is still a feat.

368
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:06,312
Yes, sir.

369
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:08,481
Get some rest.

370
00:35:21,035 --> 00:35:22,245
How is Taeyang?

371
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:24,956
She can't even come out
because she feels so bad.

372
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:27,792
You know how it is. The feeling of being
too sorry to even apologize.

373
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:35,758
What are you doing? I'm starving.

374
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:42,306
Sorry!

375
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:48,479
INFIRMARY

376
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:55,945
The court fairy was crazy.

377
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:58,406
Why did she have to get your ankle then?

378
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:03,077
Is your ankle okay?

379
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:07,790
Let's talk outside.
I want to get changed first.

380
00:36:08,374 --> 00:36:09,959
You just got changed, though.

381
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:12,879
You're right.

382
00:36:13,462 --> 00:36:16,883
You burst in on me and saw everything.

383
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:18,259
I didn't see anything.

384
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:19,719
I need to go to the bathroom.

385
00:36:19,802 --> 00:36:20,845
I can help you.

386
00:36:20,928 --> 00:36:23,764
Why would you follow me to the bathroom?

387
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:26,767
-To see what?
-I told you, I didn't see anything.

388
00:36:29,395 --> 00:36:30,396
You can read this instead.

389
00:36:31,105 --> 00:36:32,899
Read it once I'm gone.

390
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:39,739
I'M SORRY
I'M REALLY SORRY

391
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:46,454
Why are you sorry?

392
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:50,791
For wearing out four pairs of shoes
from making all that effort?

393
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:53,252
It's impressive how you've made it
this far with that leg.

394
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:39,548
We lost.

395
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:54,188
YUK JUNGHWAN ASIAN CONQUEST
CELEBRATION TOURNAMENT

396
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:04,490
Why is he with our head coach?

397
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:06,993
I'll meet with Park Taeyang.

398
00:38:07,076 --> 00:38:08,536
She seemed pretty good.

399
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:10,538
It'd be better to meet with her dad.

400
00:38:12,915 --> 00:38:15,376
So her dad's got the say?

401
00:38:16,002 --> 00:38:17,211
No wonder.

402
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:21,090
But why are you so involved in
this issue with Taeyang?

403
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,301
Goodbye, sir.

404
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:38,149
Yuk Junghwan, look what you've become.

405
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:40,985
Become what?

406
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:43,696
Are you overwhelmed
now that the tournament is over?

407
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,614
How long were you standing there?

408
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:49,869
Why? Did you discuss something
in secret with my head coach?

409
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:52,330
What was it about?

410
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:55,916
About me?

411
00:38:58,002 --> 00:39:01,672
I did win a gold medal.
Can you give me a ride to Seoul?

412
00:39:04,633 --> 00:39:05,926
Cut it out.

413
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:08,637
Why are you following me around?

414
00:39:09,221 --> 00:39:10,181
I wasn't foll--

415
00:39:10,264 --> 00:39:13,684
From the excuse about the blind date
to coming here to play, and even now.

416
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:16,729
What's your deal?
Are you into me or something?

417
00:39:17,313 --> 00:39:19,982
You talk like a total jerk.

418
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:22,693
Yes, I'm a total jerk,
and I don't need a girl.

419
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:25,738
And do you think you're special?

420
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:29,075
You're not. At all.

421
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:41,212
Come on. Let's score a goal.

422
00:39:41,295 --> 00:39:42,713
-Come on!
-Okay!

423
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:44,799
-Pass! That's right!
-Run!

424
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:46,675
-Look!
-He's going for it!

425
00:39:48,969 --> 00:39:50,679
Go Korea!

426
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:54,725
-We won!
-Jung Hyunwoo.

427
00:39:56,102 --> 00:39:57,478
Go Korea!

428
00:39:57,561 --> 00:39:59,897
Why did Jung Hyunwoo have to score a goal?

429
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:01,399
We're all dead meat.

430
00:40:01,482 --> 00:40:03,776
What's the matter?
Did he score on his own goal?

431
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,737
No, it's a score for us!

432
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:09,657
Goal! Go Korea!

433
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:14,912
Hey, on top of having nothing,
you can't even take a hint.

434
00:40:15,037 --> 00:40:16,497
Who is Jung Hyunwoo?

435
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:18,791
He's Youngsim's ex-husband.

436
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:21,961
Don't you know she goes berserk
whenever he scores a goal?

437
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:23,629
Sorry.

438
00:40:23,712 --> 00:40:26,549
We're doomed. Totally.

439
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:30,302
Hi, Hana!

440
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:32,763
Did you see your dad today?

441
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:36,058
He was awesome, right?

442
00:40:36,642 --> 00:40:40,312
You're so lucky to have such a cool dad!

443
00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:44,275
Hana, when you meet Dad today,

444
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:47,236
say, "Dad, congratulations." Okay?

445
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:49,989
-Bye-bye, Mom.
-Hana!

446
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:52,324
MY HANA

447
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:03,127
What's wrong? Did something happen?

448
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:06,881
Just leave me alone.

449
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:11,135
There's a soccer game today.

450
00:41:12,178 --> 00:41:13,804
Did Hyunwoo score a goal by any chance?

451
00:41:16,515 --> 00:41:17,683
So he did.

452
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:21,604
Gosh. Things have gone so well for him
since the divorce.

453
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:25,649
Damn it. This bastard…

454
00:41:30,237 --> 00:41:32,907
Seriously, she's a lunatic.

455
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:36,243
What's this?

456
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,246
Who on earth…

457
00:42:02,144 --> 00:42:04,647
Isn't this that bastard's car?

458
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,858
Am I into you?

459
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:12,821
Yes, I am.

460
00:42:13,906 --> 00:42:17,493
That's why I came all the way here!

461
00:42:17,743 --> 00:42:21,121
And I won the gold to get your approval!

462
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:26,794
So what? Are you that great?

463
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:28,295
You're just a hick!

464
00:42:35,594 --> 00:42:36,595
What's this?

465
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:38,347
A scratch?

466
00:42:59,785 --> 00:43:01,078
Here's your strawberry milkshake.

467
00:43:05,499 --> 00:43:07,293
Your taste is so girly.

468
00:43:08,335 --> 00:43:10,045
This is my go-to at coffee shops.

469
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:12,673
Gosh. Why would you drink
something bitter?

470
00:43:12,756 --> 00:43:13,799
Me?

471
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:16,677
So that I can have the ice.

472
00:43:18,137 --> 00:43:19,513
That's very logical.

473
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:27,313
Tell me, Jaesik.

474
00:43:27,813 --> 00:43:29,231
What do you do when you lose a game?

475
00:43:29,815 --> 00:43:31,817
You tend to go AWOL
when it's your fault we lose.

476
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:34,278
Why do you ask? Did your partner go AWOL?

477
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:37,823
She's neither texting back nor picking up.

478
00:43:37,906 --> 00:43:39,491
It's obvious.

479
00:43:41,702 --> 00:43:43,787
You laugh like a crazy person by yourself.

480
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:46,040
Cry.

481
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:48,167
That's right! Just like that!

482
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:51,420
-Play some games.
-Go kill it! Hurry. Jump! Nice.

483
00:43:51,503 --> 00:43:53,213
By then, you feel like garbage.

484
00:43:54,673 --> 00:43:55,966
So you take out the garbage.

485
00:43:58,427 --> 00:44:00,346
There's nothing to do
once you're done cleaning.

486
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:05,726
So you end up exercising by yourself.

487
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:13,192
But you didn't even notice
when I went AWOL.

488
00:44:13,275 --> 00:44:15,027
Do you miss Taeyang that much?

489
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:17,237
That's "Ms. Park Taeyang" to you.

490
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:19,490
She's my partner, not your friend.

491
00:44:19,573 --> 00:44:21,825
Wow, you're stuck up.

492
00:44:31,085 --> 00:44:33,754
Gosh. Can you really

493
00:44:34,797 --> 00:44:36,507
turn Taeyang

494
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:40,052
into a great athlete?

495
00:44:40,135 --> 00:44:43,138
Breaking the contract
will be a hassle though.

496
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:46,725
But Yunis shouldn't be like that.

497
00:44:47,059 --> 00:44:50,229
They're mistreating her.
Yet if they stop her from transferring…

498
00:44:50,479 --> 00:44:53,315
I can sort things out with Yunis.

499
00:44:53,649 --> 00:44:55,776
I personally know
the head coach of that team.

500
00:44:55,859 --> 00:44:58,779
Really? Then send her to me.

501
00:44:59,405 --> 00:45:02,408
I noticed her tenacity
when she played through leg pain.

502
00:45:02,491 --> 00:45:04,201
That's how we were back in our day.

503
00:45:04,326 --> 00:45:06,161
There aren't many kids like that now.

504
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:10,082
I thought, "She's something.
I'd love to take her to the next level."

505
00:45:11,583 --> 00:45:12,668
I want to be her mentor.

506
00:45:12,751 --> 00:45:13,669
Gosh.

507
00:45:14,586 --> 00:45:16,839
We'd be so grateful for that.

508
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:19,842
But there's just one thing.

509
00:45:20,426 --> 00:45:22,177
I think she needs to work on self-care.

510
00:45:22,803 --> 00:45:25,389
Leaving a comment
on an article about herself is a bit--

511
00:45:25,472 --> 00:45:26,682
Pardon?

512
00:45:29,518 --> 00:45:31,562
Is there a news article about Taeyang?

513
00:45:32,104 --> 00:45:33,731
PRODIGY PARK TAEYANG MAKES A COMEBACK

514
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:37,943
Also, Bloomberg estimated that
the 2035 goal by China

515
00:45:38,026 --> 00:45:41,697
to add 147 gigawatts
of nuclear power would cost

516
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:46,660
between 437 trillion and 520 trillion won.

517
00:45:47,161 --> 00:45:50,122
PARK TAEYANG PLAYED A GREAT GAME
WITH HER PARTNER PARK TAEJUN…

518
00:45:51,331 --> 00:45:52,458
What's this?

519
00:45:53,459 --> 00:45:54,585
This is Park Taeyang.

520
00:45:55,043 --> 00:45:57,171
Please look forward to
my fabulous comeback!

521
00:45:58,213 --> 00:46:00,424
That's me?

522
00:46:01,133 --> 00:46:02,843
What kind of a nutjob…

523
00:46:07,639 --> 00:46:08,974
Park Taejun.

524
00:46:09,475 --> 00:46:11,435
Today there will be clear skies
nationwide,

525
00:46:11,518 --> 00:46:14,104
but we expect localized downpours
in the morning.

526
00:46:31,163 --> 00:46:33,248
-Why didn't you answer my call?
-You didn't either.

527
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:37,461
Okay, I'm sorry.

528
00:46:38,378 --> 00:46:39,838
But how did you get my home address?

529
00:46:40,422 --> 00:46:41,256
Your home?

530
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:42,925
I asked Jiho

531
00:46:43,008 --> 00:46:45,511
when I'm not that close to him.
I got Jiho's number from Coach,

532
00:46:45,594 --> 00:46:48,222
whom I'm uncomfortable with.
I didn't get to enjoy my precious leave,

533
00:46:48,305 --> 00:46:49,723
because you avoided my calls.

534
00:46:51,517 --> 00:46:52,351
Was that comment you?

535
00:46:54,853 --> 00:46:55,854
Is this funny?

536
00:46:59,775 --> 00:47:01,276
DELETE

537
00:47:01,944 --> 00:47:03,654
A hate comment would've been better.

538
00:47:04,404 --> 00:47:06,240
Did you comment on anything else?

539
00:47:06,824 --> 00:47:08,325
It's the only article there is.

540
00:47:09,618 --> 00:47:11,703
So you did that to the only news article?

541
00:47:11,787 --> 00:47:14,248
If you leave a comment like this,
what would people think?

542
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:17,417
Who reads about badminton?

543
00:47:23,924 --> 00:47:25,384
I'll let this slide

544
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:29,429
since I'm sorry
about what happened in the recent game.

545
00:47:31,056 --> 00:47:31,932
At ease!

546
00:47:33,475 --> 00:47:34,476
Okay.

547
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:54,121
It's raining.

548
00:47:55,831 --> 00:47:57,249
Do you have an umbrella?

549
00:47:57,958 --> 00:47:58,959
Yes.

550
00:48:00,627 --> 00:48:01,628
Wait a minute.

551
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:07,175
Here--

552
00:48:20,522 --> 00:48:22,941
It turns out I don't have an umbrella.

553
00:48:24,151 --> 00:48:26,153
Most of the time, I just get rained on

554
00:48:26,653 --> 00:48:28,113
like a real tough guy.

555
00:48:30,949 --> 00:48:31,950
What should I do?

556
00:48:33,785 --> 00:48:34,870
Stay until the rain stops.

557
00:48:49,968 --> 00:48:52,971
I'm out of all other beverages.
Is water okay?

558
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:54,181
Yes.

559
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:57,726
Where's my cup?

560
00:48:57,809 --> 00:49:01,480
Oh, you drink water out of a cup?

561
00:49:01,855 --> 00:49:03,357
I don't think

562
00:49:04,316 --> 00:49:05,400
I have any cups at home.

563
00:49:05,484 --> 00:49:07,653
Then I should drink this directly
from the bottle?

564
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:12,532
Fruit! Fruit sounds nice. Vitamin C!

565
00:49:12,616 --> 00:49:14,451
I always have fruit in stock.

566
00:49:16,578 --> 00:49:18,705
Here. Yellow peaches and white peaches.

567
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:20,624
Take your pick.

568
00:49:21,416 --> 00:49:23,377
Fruit that never goes bad. That's sweet.

569
00:49:23,919 --> 00:49:25,212
I prefer yellow peaches.

570
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:28,090
Can you get some forks and plates?

571
00:49:30,175 --> 00:49:31,093
You don't have them?

572
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:35,180
What do you have then?
I know you live in a dorm, but--

573
00:49:36,556 --> 00:49:37,391
Let's get delivery.

574
00:49:37,474 --> 00:49:38,809
They'll bring wooden chopsticks.

575
00:49:38,892 --> 00:49:40,560
See how smart I am?

576
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:43,063
Forget it.
I'll just drink this. I'm thirsty.

577
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:44,481
How am I supposed to drink this?

578
00:49:45,857 --> 00:49:48,068
Hey. Are you okay?

579
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:49,361
You're all wet.

580
00:49:49,444 --> 00:49:50,612
I'm okay.

581
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:52,364
But…

582
00:49:55,575 --> 00:49:57,703
Clothes! I have lots. I'll bring them.

583
00:49:57,786 --> 00:49:58,912
No, just give me a hairdryer.

584
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:00,914
But I don't have one.
I'll bring you some clothes.

585
00:50:02,749 --> 00:50:04,042
Where is he going?

586
00:50:14,511 --> 00:50:16,346
Are these all your shoes?

587
00:50:17,931 --> 00:50:19,266
It's no big deal.

588
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:21,643
No joke, right?

589
00:50:22,728 --> 00:50:25,272
Are you a centipede? Do you have 550 feet?

590
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:26,606
Why would you need all this?

591
00:50:26,898 --> 00:50:30,235
A centipede? How could it have 550 feet?

592
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:32,988
Hey, there are all
works of art and limited editions.

593
00:50:33,488 --> 00:50:34,698
Even if you have the money--

594
00:50:34,781 --> 00:50:37,325
Taejun. Stop wasting your money
on useless crap,

595
00:50:37,409 --> 00:50:39,244
and buy some cups. Also, get an umbrella.

596
00:50:39,661 --> 00:50:41,580
You'll go bald from all the rainwater.

597
00:50:41,663 --> 00:50:43,206
You're way out of line.

598
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:44,541
I pursue a cool lifestyle.

599
00:50:44,624 --> 00:50:45,834
You think I can't afford a cup

600
00:50:45,917 --> 00:50:48,128
and get rained on
because I don't have an umbrella?

601
00:50:48,211 --> 00:50:49,921
I get paid 60 million won a year!

602
00:50:51,339 --> 00:50:52,340
Sixty million?

603
00:50:52,924 --> 00:50:54,426
Sixty million? How come?

604
00:50:54,509 --> 00:50:56,219
"How come?"

605
00:50:57,637 --> 00:50:59,514
No, what I meant was…

606
00:51:00,766 --> 00:51:02,184
I'm just a little shocked.

607
00:51:02,267 --> 00:51:04,686
Jeez. You once said I had talent

608
00:51:05,187 --> 00:51:06,897
and that I'm a desert or something.

609
00:51:09,149 --> 00:51:10,442
Wait. No wonder you're in shock.

610
00:51:11,151 --> 00:51:12,944
I get 60 million. You get 19 million.

611
00:51:13,987 --> 00:51:15,947
I get paid 3 million more
than triple your pay.

612
00:51:16,031 --> 00:51:18,283
So, you see how big
the level difference is between us?

613
00:51:18,366 --> 00:51:20,035
I'm that kind of guy.

614
00:51:20,118 --> 00:51:22,412
You should be grateful I'm your partner.

615
00:51:27,375 --> 00:51:28,919
Go and hang yourself.

616
00:51:35,801 --> 00:51:38,053
You can't go outside when it's raining.

617
00:51:38,553 --> 00:51:39,930
Like you said, you could go bald.

618
00:51:40,889 --> 00:51:43,308
Then Mr. Annual Salary of 60 Million can
get me a wig.

619
00:51:43,391 --> 00:51:45,393
But it's a fact that yours is 19 mil…

620
00:51:47,604 --> 00:51:49,689
-What I meant to say was--
-You're a jerk.

621
00:51:53,652 --> 00:51:55,529
What's wrong? Are you going to cry?

622
00:51:55,612 --> 00:51:58,281
My… My self-esteem!

623
00:51:58,782 --> 00:52:00,951
Not the 19 million won! The fact is!

624
00:52:01,034 --> 00:52:03,995
The fact! The fact is…

625
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:05,163
Say it.

626
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:07,165
When I'm upset…

627
00:52:07,249 --> 00:52:08,792
You can't talk when you're upset.

628
00:52:09,543 --> 00:52:10,585
That's right!

629
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:17,050
Okay. Hey, you can hit me once.

630
00:52:18,009 --> 00:52:19,719
I've made a huge mistake.

631
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:22,889
You don't need to say another word.
You can hit me and feel better.

632
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:24,391
This is how we'll make up.

633
00:52:24,474 --> 00:52:26,935
Bring it. Go on.

634
00:52:30,105 --> 00:52:32,482
I knew it.
It's a little immature and violent, right?

635
00:52:32,566 --> 00:52:34,484
-Promise you won't get a doctor's note.
-What?

636
00:52:34,568 --> 00:52:36,236
Stand up straight.
You could hurt your back.

637
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:37,612
But kicking is a little…

638
00:52:39,573 --> 00:52:40,657
All right.

639
00:52:41,867 --> 00:52:42,951
Whoosh.

640
00:52:44,619 --> 00:52:45,537
Swoosh.

641
00:52:47,247 --> 00:52:48,915
-Are you scared?
-Hey, what are we--

642
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:50,250
Swoosh.

643
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:52,294
This doesn't seem right.

644
00:52:55,964 --> 00:52:57,132
Wow, you didn't buckle.

645
00:53:00,343 --> 00:53:04,014
I may not look like it, but I used to
get beaten up when I trained.

646
00:53:04,598 --> 00:53:05,640
Are you getting worked up?

647
00:53:05,724 --> 00:53:07,350
No, not at all.

648
00:53:07,434 --> 00:53:08,518
Then I'll hit you once more.

649
00:53:08,602 --> 00:53:10,729
-Why?
-Just one more time.

650
00:53:10,812 --> 00:53:13,732
-Don't get competitive with this.
-Just once more since it didn't hurt.

651
00:53:13,815 --> 00:53:16,401
Come and stand here for just one more hit.

652
00:53:28,663 --> 00:53:30,624
DAD

653
00:53:32,918 --> 00:53:33,960
Hello, Dad.

654
00:53:36,296 --> 00:53:38,673
I'm at a friend's house. Did you drink?

655
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:42,594
Our head coach?

656
00:53:47,682 --> 00:53:49,059
What are you talking about?

657
00:53:51,353 --> 00:53:52,604
It's not like I'm his chauffeur.

658
00:53:52,812 --> 00:53:55,607
I said no to Somang Bank.

659
00:53:57,734 --> 00:54:01,488
That scumbag.
That head coach is a total thug.

660
00:54:01,571 --> 00:54:03,406
Then why is your daughter on that team?

661
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:08,119
He's a great mentor for your daughter
but a thug to mine?

662
00:54:08,203 --> 00:54:09,537
-Our team?
-Let's be honest.

663
00:54:10,121 --> 00:54:11,831
Do you even care about Taeyang?

664
00:54:12,832 --> 00:54:16,336
She's there to fill the head count
and compete in petty games.

665
00:54:17,128 --> 00:54:21,383
I… Do you know how pitiful she is?

666
00:54:22,217 --> 00:54:24,052
I'm keeping a close eye on her.

667
00:54:24,135 --> 00:54:25,512
This is my daughter Taeyang.

668
00:54:26,846 --> 00:54:31,393
I put my life on the line to raise her.
To make her a star.

669
00:54:31,476 --> 00:54:33,311
Gosh. Seriously, you bastard.

670
00:54:33,395 --> 00:54:36,439
So why can your daughter be there
but not mine?

671
00:54:36,606 --> 00:54:39,317
Listen, you punk! Only three years ago,
she was way better than your--

672
00:54:39,401 --> 00:54:40,610
Cut the crap, damn it.

673
00:54:42,904 --> 00:54:45,031
I can sort it out!
Go if that's what you want.

674
00:54:46,157 --> 00:54:47,450
Darn it.

675
00:54:49,494 --> 00:54:50,578
Damn…

676
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:55,041
Having homeboys around is supposedly
the best as you age, but look at us!

677
00:54:55,959 --> 00:54:56,876
Darn it.

678
00:54:57,377 --> 00:54:58,628
You!

679
00:55:00,046 --> 00:55:01,506
Don't ever call me again, jerk.

680
00:55:02,507 --> 00:55:04,175
-Dad!
-God damn it.

681
00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:08,179
-Dad.
-Oh, Yumin.

682
00:55:08,263 --> 00:55:09,806
-Are you all right?
-Let's go.

683
00:55:10,515 --> 00:55:12,392
-Sure.
-Is Taeyang coming to our team?

684
00:55:12,475 --> 00:55:14,227
Then tell her to brace herself for real.

685
00:55:14,311 --> 00:55:17,147
It doesn't matter if a useless player
like Taeyang leaves or not.

686
00:55:17,731 --> 00:55:19,274
She's doing my dad a favor by leaving.

687
00:55:19,357 --> 00:55:22,819
Yumin, what are you doing?
That's no way to talk to an elder.

688
00:55:34,622 --> 00:55:36,249
He raised her right.

689
00:55:40,337 --> 00:55:41,463
An offer?

690
00:55:42,422 --> 00:55:43,715
From Somang Bank?

691
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:47,844
Yes. Dad says I should go.

692
00:55:49,262 --> 00:55:52,432
He just sent a text saying
he settled everything with the head coach.

693
00:55:54,309 --> 00:55:56,311
So, are you going to go?

694
00:55:58,730 --> 00:56:00,523
I'm not sure.

695
00:56:00,607 --> 00:56:02,734
I have no idea
what is happening around me.

696
00:56:03,318 --> 00:56:05,487
Aren't you telling me this
because you're considering it?

697
00:56:09,741 --> 00:56:13,787
Well, it's not like I'm wanted
on the team,

698
00:56:14,996 --> 00:56:16,873
and some find me uncomfortable--

699
00:56:16,956 --> 00:56:18,458
Like who?

700
00:56:18,958 --> 00:56:20,752
Do you want to go to avoid Junghwan?

701
00:56:22,295 --> 00:56:23,880
No, it's not that.

702
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:28,843
Taejun. Since we're on the topic,

703
00:56:30,345 --> 00:56:31,888
Junghwan is a good person.

704
00:56:33,556 --> 00:56:37,268
How is he a good person
when he bullies a girl? He's trash.

705
00:56:37,352 --> 00:56:38,478
He…

706
00:56:39,771 --> 00:56:42,023
It's my fault he lost his girlfriend.

707
00:56:44,192 --> 00:56:46,653
It's also my fault
his girlfriend quit being an athlete.

708
00:56:49,072 --> 00:56:50,323
I…

709
00:56:53,201 --> 00:56:55,495
-Her life--
-That's enough.

710
00:56:58,373 --> 00:56:59,457
Did you get her injured?

711
00:57:02,669 --> 00:57:04,087
It's not that simple.

712
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:06,923
I thought you got yourself
into some big trouble.

713
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:10,844
Is that why you left three years ago?

714
00:57:12,554 --> 00:57:16,266
I understand the guilt,
but it could've happened to any athlete.

715
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:21,312
And yet he still holds a grudge
against you, and you let him be.

716
00:57:21,396 --> 00:57:23,356
Don't say it like it's nothing!

717
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,316
What do you know?

718
00:57:33,074 --> 00:57:34,325
Anyway,

719
00:57:35,702 --> 00:57:38,746
if I do transfer,
there will only be one reason for it.

720
00:57:39,873 --> 00:57:41,541
Because that place is better than here.

721
00:57:42,542 --> 00:57:45,211
It could've been different
if I had won gold this time.

722
00:57:45,795 --> 00:57:48,381
All I did was barely win bronze
at a competition in the countryside.

723
00:57:49,883 --> 00:57:51,885
I should go
if they want to make me a better player.

724
00:57:51,968 --> 00:57:55,805
So this would've been a no-brainer
if I had done better.

725
00:57:55,889 --> 00:57:56,973
It's all because

726
00:57:57,056 --> 00:57:59,642
you barely won the bronze with me.

727
00:57:59,726 --> 00:58:02,061
Hey, don't take it personally.

728
00:58:02,395 --> 00:58:04,731
That's not what I meant. It's just…

729
00:58:06,858 --> 00:58:08,526
I didn't do well.

730
00:58:09,611 --> 00:58:13,156
It means I can't play
as well as I used to.

731
00:58:13,239 --> 00:58:15,492
And I failed to cover for you.

732
00:58:17,368 --> 00:58:19,245
It's up to you to decide where you go.

733
00:58:19,746 --> 00:58:21,831
You don't have to share
every detail with me.

734
00:58:23,208 --> 00:58:25,293
Hey, are you just going to
leave like that?

735
00:58:26,169 --> 00:58:28,588
How do you think that would make me feel?

736
00:58:29,255 --> 00:58:31,007
You can do whatever you want!

737
00:59:03,957 --> 00:59:07,585
Since you're trying this hard,
I shouldn't just stay put.

738
00:59:07,669 --> 00:59:09,629
Did you forget that I'm slow?

739
00:59:09,712 --> 00:59:11,005
Just give it to me straight.

740
00:59:11,965 --> 00:59:13,550
Do your best.

741
00:59:14,133 --> 00:59:16,469
So you'll have a place to go
once you get kicked off the team.

742
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:24,185
Did you happen to meet
the head coach of Somang?

743
00:59:48,001 --> 00:59:49,043
You're here.

744
01:00:00,638 --> 01:00:03,433
We have something to discuss.
What's it going to be?

745
01:00:07,145 --> 01:00:08,521
I'll let you do whatever you want.

746
01:00:10,481 --> 01:00:14,444
I'm sorry, but there's something
I have to confirm first.

747
01:00:15,153 --> 01:00:16,237
Confirm what?

748
01:00:27,707 --> 01:00:31,169
Taeyang, what brings you here?
Aren't you supposed to be running?

749
01:00:31,586 --> 01:00:33,630
Can't you see
we're in the middle of training?

750
01:00:36,633 --> 01:00:37,467
Hey.

751
01:00:40,595 --> 01:00:41,846
Let's talk.

752
01:00:43,681 --> 01:00:45,308
You didn't go to Somang?

753
01:00:54,067 --> 01:00:55,026
So it was you.

754
01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:57,987
Why would Somang recruit you
if it weren't for me?

755
01:00:59,447 --> 01:01:01,282
What are you talking about? Somang?

756
01:01:02,241 --> 01:01:03,993
Taeyang, are you transferring?

757
01:01:06,871 --> 01:01:09,374
It seems your dad has
already made a deal with Somang.

758
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:13,294
What? Were you planning
to keep your trap shut till the last day?

759
01:01:14,003 --> 01:01:16,631
Of course, that's what you would do.

760
01:01:17,215 --> 01:01:19,634
You'd never put down all your cards

761
01:01:19,967 --> 01:01:21,219
until you get kicked out.

762
01:01:44,117 --> 01:01:45,326
Come with me, bastard.

763
01:02:25,867 --> 01:02:27,785
GOING TO YOU AT A SPEED OF 493KM

764
01:02:27,869 --> 01:02:29,495
Don't you mess with me.

765
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:30,997
I will if I have to.

766
01:02:31,122 --> 01:02:32,957
You're also doing this for some girl.

767
01:02:33,541 --> 01:02:34,500
Your ex-girlfriend.

768
01:02:34,584 --> 01:02:35,877
Only those who deserve to

769
01:02:38,212 --> 01:02:40,423
can talk bad about others.

770
01:02:40,673 --> 01:02:43,301
I really don't want
to say bad things about our head coach,

771
01:02:43,384 --> 01:02:44,802
but he's a scumbag.

772
01:02:44,886 --> 01:02:46,220
They're bastards.

773
01:02:46,304 --> 01:02:48,389
I don't want
to keep feeling so small all the time.

774
01:02:48,473 --> 01:02:49,348
I'll join Somang.

775
01:02:49,932 --> 01:02:52,518
Taeyang. You can run away
if you're having a hard time.

776
01:02:53,436 --> 01:02:54,437
It's okay.

777
01:03:06,491 --> 01:03:07,617
GOING TO YOU AT A SPEED OF 493KM

778
01:03:07,700 --> 01:03:09,702
