1
00:00:37,787 --> 00:00:40,790
GOING TO YOU AT A SPEED OF 493KM

2
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:44,627
THE PLACES, PEOPLE, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTIONAL

3
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:48,214
THE FINAL EPISODE

4
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:54,554
Did you…

5
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:59,309
have to be my son's partner?

6
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:07,317
I can't even cheer for my own son
because of you.

7
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:10,320
I'm sorry.

8
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:13,948
Just because Junyoung has forgiven you

9
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:16,409
doesn't make everything go away.

10
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:21,956
I can imagine how much you must hate me

11
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:26,753
and don't want to see me.

12
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:28,963
I understand.

13
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:31,800
I also used to…

14
00:01:34,135 --> 00:01:37,430
hate myself a lot and struggle.

15
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:44,437
"I don't deserve to be happy."

16
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,359
I would think that to myself,

17
00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:51,694
and yet

18
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:54,572
I kept wanting more.

19
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:57,659
And that

20
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:00,537
made me feel guilty.

21
00:02:04,332 --> 00:02:07,877
I should've asked for your forgiveness
in person earlier,

22
00:02:09,587 --> 00:02:12,882
but I didn't,
and I'm sorry about that too.

23
00:02:14,342 --> 00:02:18,471
I know that you didn't get
Junyoung hurt on purpose.

24
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:21,432
So,

25
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:25,311
whenever I have this
sudden urge to get upset,

26
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:29,524
I tell myself to be an adult because you
must be a beloved daughter to another.

27
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,197
Taeyang.

28
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:40,952
I've taken this much of a step back.

29
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:45,540
That means you shouldn't cross the line.

30
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:50,920
Please…

31
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:56,342
can you give me a chance?

32
00:02:59,053 --> 00:03:01,890
You may not be able to forgive me,

33
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:09,022
and the best thing would be
never having to see each other again.

34
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:19,157
But if I try harder

35
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:22,869
and become a better person

36
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:27,040
to make your forgiveness meaningful…

37
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:30,335
For that to happen,

38
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:35,924
can't you give me a chance just this once?

39
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:46,017
I don't think…

40
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:48,603
I can do that.

41
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:19,050
I'll be back after seeing my dad.
You can go back to the dorm first.

42
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:46,786
You could rupture your tendon
any second now.

43
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:49,914
No matches. I prohibit it.

44
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:55,962
You're okay to play one more game, right?

45
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:06,264
Hey, you're late.

46
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:09,559
Did you meet with your dad?

47
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:11,436
What did he say
about us going to the finals?

48
00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:16,274
He's very excited for us

49
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:17,942
and wished us luck tomorrow.

50
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:20,570
What are you doing outside?

51
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:22,280
I was waiting for you.

52
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,824
I figured seeing your face
would cheer me up.

53
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:27,744
Right, Taeyang.

54
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:31,956
We're playing in the finals tomorrow.

55
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:35,835
How many times are you going to say that?

56
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:37,378
I just can't believe

57
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:40,673
that we made it together to the end.

58
00:05:56,064 --> 00:06:00,485
I'm going to do well in the match
and tell you how I feel.

59
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:04,864
About how I want to get back together.

60
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,283
About how I can't be without you.

61
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:10,119
And about how

62
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:12,914
I really love you.

63
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:44,695
Jeez. Are you running again after a match?

64
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:49,033
I've never skipped night training
unless there was a storm.

65
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:52,954
I get anxious if I don't train
and can't get to sleep.

66
00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:56,374
I see. I've never skipped using
a facial mask.

67
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:58,960
It's no wonder you're so pretty.

68
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:01,212
It's no wonder you're so talented.

69
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:05,091
Tomorrow is the finals.

70
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:12,306
Yes. I'll get you
a gold necklace tomorrow.

71
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:14,809
A gold medal?

72
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:18,563
See you tomorrow at the stadium.

73
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:35,163
Looking great. Feeling great.

74
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:37,248
Yook Junghwan is great.

75
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,344
Are you feeling sick?

76
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:58,686
Hey.

77
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,190
Hey, Taejun. Wake up.

78
00:08:03,774 --> 00:08:05,067
What?

79
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:07,153
You're breaking out in a cold sweat
and groaning.

80
00:08:08,946 --> 00:08:10,406
I am?

81
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:13,367
Why don't you go to the hospital
if you're not feeling well?

82
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:15,578
I'm fine.

83
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:30,468
Gosh. Today is the last day!

84
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:32,428
But you're not playing today.

85
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:34,472
You're acting as if you're in the finals.

86
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:36,599
You also haven't played for some time.

87
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:38,809
Come on. We both only made it
to the round of 16.

88
00:08:39,393 --> 00:08:40,478
I was in the quarterfinals.

89
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:43,439
Good for you.

90
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:46,108
Are you playing two games today?

91
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,818
Men's doubles and mixed doubles?

92
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:49,362
Yes.

93
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:52,990
Gosh. You're putting in so much work
to play in two finals.

94
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:56,410
The captain's got high hopes for you.

95
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:57,703
Let's win this!

96
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:01,958
There you are.

97
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:05,628
-You don't look so good.
-I feel great.

98
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:13,719
Hey.

99
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:17,598
Let's talk for a second.

100
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:20,977
-About what?
-Your knee.

101
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:41,622
Hey. Do you know
that you were groaning all last night?

102
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:44,709
-The way you're walking--
-I guess we've gotten pretty close.

103
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:46,127
You're even worried about me.

104
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:49,630
I don't want to compete against someone
who isn't well. It bothers me.

105
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:51,799
Be honest. It's really bad, isn't it?

106
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:55,886
I still have what it takes
to compete against you, so get ready.

107
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:57,430
Hey, tell Mr. Sibong--

108
00:09:57,513 --> 00:10:00,099
I'm fine. Do you want it to hurt?

109
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:08,357
Sorry. I know you're looking out for me.

110
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:20,453
2022 KOREA BADMINTON GRAND FINAL

111
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:27,585
Youngsim, if you win today,
you'll be the quadruple gold medal winner.

112
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:31,589
You're so close
to reaching the grand slam for singles.

113
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:33,716
-Go for it!
-Go for it!

114
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:35,801
Thank you.

115
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:39,180
But where is Taeyang?

116
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:46,562
I can't share a patient's medical records
with anyone else.

117
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:50,858
I think Taejun is hiding his symptoms.

118
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:55,946
Can you at least let me know
if it's okay for him to play today?

119
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,157
Is he playing? Did he say that?

120
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:02,703
It's bad. Right?

121
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:12,672
The person you have reached
is not available.

122
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:14,590
Where is Taeyang?

123
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:16,300
She's still not answering?

124
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:18,928
No.

125
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:21,806
Shouldn't you let the coach know?

126
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:23,849
Don't make a big deal out of it.

127
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:26,477
She must be taking her time
to get mentally prepared.

128
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:28,771
There's no way she won't show up.

129
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:32,566
Seriously, what is she doing?

130
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:35,236
The mixed doubles finals
will soon be taking place.

131
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:37,071
Park Taejun and Park Taeyang from Yunis.

132
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:39,490
Yook Junghwan from Yunis
and Lee Yumin from Somang Bank.

133
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:41,033
Please come to Court One.

134
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:43,703
Go ahead.
I'll go with Taeyang once she gets here.

135
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:46,455
-Let's go.
-Okay.

136
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,503
I've never worried about my opponents
like this before a match.

137
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,352
Where have you been?
Why didn't you answer your phone?

138
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:11,147
-The game's about to start. Let's go.
-Wait.

139
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:12,773
Let's talk.

140
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:13,733
We don't have time.

141
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:15,109
I think…

142
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:18,571
we should forfeit.

143
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:26,120
I just came from meeting with your doctor.

144
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:28,581
She said you shouldn't be playing.

145
00:12:28,664 --> 00:12:31,333
She said she's warned you already.
Why didn't you tell me?

146
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:37,965
Thank you for thinking of me,
but I'm okay to play one match.

147
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:40,259
She said you could rupture your knee.

148
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:42,052
Then you'd have to get surgery.

149
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:44,346
Taeyang. I'll be careful.

150
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,725
I'll play and forfeit
if I don't think I can do it anymore.

151
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:49,018
Are you stupid?

152
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:52,438
Withdrawing from a single tournament
won't change your life.

153
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:54,607
Don't you know how we got here?

154
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:56,484
We worked so hard to be here.

155
00:12:57,568 --> 00:12:59,445
It's okay even if we don't win. It's just…

156
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:01,989
I want to try till the end.

157
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:06,994
Please.

158
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:09,789
Let's not throw down
our lives for a sport.

159
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:14,335
I forfeit.

160
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:18,672
I know how you feel,

161
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:23,052
and I'm so glad
that you're full of passion now.

162
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:25,012
But still,

163
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:28,265
I forfeit.

164
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:35,147
They said they'll be here in a minute.
Please wait.

165
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:37,399
-That's not possible.
-Why do you keep saying that?

166
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:38,484
Taeyang's still not here?

167
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:42,071
-We can't delay this any longer.
-What do you mean? They'll be here soon.

168
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:43,280
We can't proceed like this.

169
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:46,492
What do you mean?
We just have to wait. Please.

170
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:49,537
If you really want to play,
you can do it by yourself.

171
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:50,996
Let's just play this once.

172
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:54,834
-The game's about to start.
-Yes. Good luck!

173
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:57,837
I have to protect your leg,
like what you did for your friend.

174
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,130
If an athlete were to die,
he should do so on the court.

175
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:03,342
"Please. Let's not throw down
our lives for a sport."

176
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:06,220
Have you always lacked tenacity?

177
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:08,764
Hey. Mr. Professional Team Athlete.

178
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:12,726
You should take good care of yourself
to get paid yearly and live unscathed.

179
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:15,688
Worry about securing a way
to make a living.

180
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:16,939
Let go.

181
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:20,401
Just one game.

182
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:23,112
I said no. Let go of me.

183
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:36,125
-Coach!
-What's wrong?

184
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,751
Taeyang…

185
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:41,547
What?

186
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:45,634
An injury?

187
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:55,102
I should be the one getting carried away
in an ambulance, not you.

188
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:59,481
-Does it hurt a lot?
-Yes.

189
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:05,738
So, we're forfeiting, right?

190
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:08,949
What are you talking about?

191
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,203
I saved your leg.

192
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:29,511
Isn't it a little weird
to go around wearing it?

193
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:31,096
Besides, we won by default.

194
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:35,684
Still, it's a gold medal. I can't remember
how long it's been since I won the gold.

195
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:38,437
I don't feel so good about it.

196
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,523
Didn't you say
Taeyang just sprained her ankle?

197
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:43,776
Go see her at the hospital
if you're so worried.

198
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:45,527
Taejun is the one with the issue.

199
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:47,821
Both of them are in the hospital now.

200
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:50,491
What? Why is Taejun in the hospital?

201
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:52,701
Something's wrong with his knee.

202
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:55,788
Gosh, I should've stopped him earlier.

203
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:58,290
Really? How bad is it?

204
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:01,335
Dang it.

205
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:04,463
It's not the right time
to be happy about winning.

206
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:07,841
What?

207
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:11,553
You're so kindhearted.

208
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:16,058
But something seems to be missing
from your neck.

209
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:18,394
If you have nothing to put on,

210
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:21,105
you could wear this.

211
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:23,732
What is this?

212
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:30,656
Hey.

213
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:33,409
You're giving this to me on the street?

214
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:37,329
It's so pretty. Thank you.

215
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:41,625
I really regretted
not getting her a necklace back then.

216
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:45,212
I thought a gold medal was
the best thing to wear around your neck.

217
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:48,090
Is this about Junyoung again?

218
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:50,843
It eventually boils down
to your first love.

219
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:52,469
She's in every story of yours.

220
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:55,848
Take it back. I'm not wearing it.

221
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:57,391
But…

222
00:16:57,766 --> 00:17:00,936
I mean, I'm trying not to repeat
the same mistakes--

223
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:04,148
The fact that you're hung up
on the past is a mistake.

224
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:05,983
I'm offended.

225
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:07,151
Hold on.

226
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:10,362
The necklace didn't do anything wrong.
It even has a little diamond.

227
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:11,739
It's from a luxury brand.

228
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:14,950
It's all yours.

229
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:21,999
Yumin, I'm sorry.

230
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:25,878
-No!
-Please don't do this.

231
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:31,300
Thankfully, his patellar tendon
isn't completely torn.

232
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:33,385
It's only a partial tear.

233
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:36,263
Way to go.

234
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:38,891
What are you doing? He's injured.

235
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:41,310
Gosh, Doctor.

236
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:43,979
A tear?

237
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:47,316
How long will it take to heal?

238
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:49,026
Can he continue to play badminton?

239
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:50,652
It'll probably take about six months.

240
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:55,240
It could be four months
if he can commit and follow through.

241
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:57,826
Goodness. What a relief.

242
00:17:57,993 --> 00:18:00,704
Your silly decision has cost you
four months, you stupid.

243
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:03,582
Go away. You're making it hurt even more.

244
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:06,168
Doctor. I'm not supposed
to get stressed, right?

245
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:08,295
You deserve to get hit.

246
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:12,007
Your career could've been over
if it weren't for Taeyang. You know that?

247
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:19,681
Taejun is lucky
to have such a great partner.

248
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:23,393
Normally, the partner tells a player
to hang in there since it's the finals.

249
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:26,188
But she came by to see me
a few hours before the match

250
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:28,273
to ask if it was okay for Taejun to play.

251
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:32,945
I heard Taeyang sprained her ankle
trying to stop you.

252
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:36,657
She saved you, okay?

253
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:39,868
Thank you.

254
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:49,211
Was she talking about the Taeyang we know?

255
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,088
Gosh.

256
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,173
That's tricky.

257
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:56,718
What's tricky?
Anyone else would've done the same.

258
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:59,429
But she even got hospitalized
because of me.

259
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:05,394
Gosh.

260
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,583
Mom.

261
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:37,342
Why did you come out with that leg?

262
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:41,180
Look.

263
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:43,640
I won silver.

264
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,148
I'm…

265
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:58,071
not a good enough son for you, am I?

266
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:02,576
Why would you think that?

267
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:10,083
I'm not good enough as a parent.

268
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,087
Do you want to keep it?

269
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:18,425
After all,

270
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:21,386
I tried my best.

271
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:30,562
2022 KOREA BADMINTON GRAND FINAL

272
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:39,363
Great work.

273
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:01,510
Seungwoo!

274
00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:04,263
I have great news!

275
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:05,389
What is it? A gold medal?

276
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:07,641
You seem overly excited about it.

277
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:09,059
No, I won the silver medal.

278
00:21:09,142 --> 00:21:11,561
I got destroyed by Sieun,
that little brat.

279
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:13,313
Then what are you so excited about?

280
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:19,027
I'll be living with Hana from now on.

281
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,242
What's with the long face?

282
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:27,911
Are you getting back together
with Hana's dad?

283
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:31,039
No.

284
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,750
He's going to Japan.

285
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:35,627
I'll look after her while he's away,

286
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:38,005
and we'll talk again once he gets back.

287
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:40,716
Really? That's great.

288
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,677
-Custody returns!
-Returns!

289
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:45,012
That's awesome.

290
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:48,265
You should find a place first.
A studio is too small for the two of you.

291
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:50,600
That's true.

292
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:54,813
Then, let's go see a realtor together
first thing tomorrow.

293
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:58,734
Can you live outside the dorm and commute?

294
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:02,654
Of course.
Our married seniors used to commute.

295
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:04,740
Oh, that's right.

296
00:22:05,782 --> 00:22:07,534
Want to look at furniture this weekend?

297
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:11,913
We can paint Hana's room pink.

298
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:13,957
We also need to get curtains.

299
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:17,210
I've been saving up for this moment.

300
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:19,463
I also want to get something for you two.

301
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,424
What is it?

302
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:29,348
We're finally on break,
but why am I so bored?

303
00:22:31,975 --> 00:22:33,310
Is there anything fun to do?

304
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:36,646
YUNIS GROUP CHAT

305
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:40,692
I'm having fun.

306
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:45,864
Gosh, I can feel my body itching.

307
00:22:49,826 --> 00:22:50,952
Sorry about that.

308
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:01,797
It's a gloomy break.

309
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:07,094
We want a break when we're playing,
then get bored when we're on break.

310
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:08,970
Gosh, we're so sad.

311
00:23:10,013 --> 00:23:11,765
Let's visit the Park twins
at the hospital.

312
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:17,979
Taejun!

313
00:23:19,689 --> 00:23:21,441
-Taejun!
-Hey, Taejun.

314
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,327
You were with them.

315
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:35,247
What brings all of you here?

316
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:37,374
You should've called first.

317
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:40,335
Junyoung. Why are you here?

318
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:44,047
What is the great Park Junyoung
doing here?

319
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:45,841
You can all come in.

320
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:49,845
Goodness. Let me get something to eat.

321
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:51,304
-Mom.
-Mom.

322
00:23:57,018 --> 00:23:58,395
Mom?

323
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:02,149
I'll go with you.

324
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:04,985
-Yes.
-See you soon.

325
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:11,908
Park Junyoung
is Park Taejun's older sister.

326
00:24:12,492 --> 00:24:13,452
-What?
-What?

327
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:18,331
You're Junyoung's brother?

328
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:24,171
Really, Taejun?
You're from that bloodline?

329
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:26,131
What are you talking about?

330
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:28,383
I was just born

331
00:24:31,052 --> 00:24:32,554
and she happened to be my sister.

332
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:38,560
Your DNA does seem to be special.

333
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:40,896
Can you move out of the way?
I have to go somewhere.

334
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:42,731
Where are you going?

335
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:45,859
Hey, you look a little different.

336
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:47,944
Does Taeyang know about this too?

337
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:51,156
Can you all move aside? I'll come back.

338
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:52,199
I promise to come back.

339
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:53,992
I even took a half-day off to be here.

340
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:55,452
You should hurry back to work.

341
00:24:55,535 --> 00:24:57,913
You'll be called names for doing this
at your dad's company.

342
00:24:57,996 --> 00:25:00,081
Just move out of the way.

343
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,959
-Gosh.
-Oh, my.

344
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:05,629
But aren't Taeyang and Taejun going out?

345
00:25:05,712 --> 00:25:06,671
It's questionable.

346
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:09,299
Taeyang and Junyoung are enemies.

347
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:13,553
Junyoung is Taejun's sister.
What is all this?

348
00:25:14,137 --> 00:25:15,013
Are you curious?

349
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:16,389
Yes.

350
00:25:18,725 --> 00:25:19,768
Attention.

351
00:25:20,143 --> 00:25:22,312
-First, close that door.
-Close it.

352
00:25:24,981 --> 00:25:26,024
All right.

353
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:29,611
As a person who knows
all about their relationships and history,

354
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:32,072
I'll tell you everything. Listen up.

355
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:40,080
Hey, Taeyang.

356
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:45,460
-We have to run.
-What? Why?

357
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:47,754
-You haven't seen our teammates yet?
-No.

358
00:25:48,171 --> 00:25:49,631
They did say they'd visit--

359
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:52,008
They saw me with Junyoung.

360
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:54,219
The secret I kept
about my family has been revealed.

361
00:25:54,844 --> 00:25:56,221
So what?

362
00:25:56,304 --> 00:25:58,848
Hey, this is traumatic for me.

363
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:00,100
What if they ask questions--

364
00:26:00,183 --> 00:26:03,061
I'm fine. They can all come to my room.

365
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:05,564
But I'm not ready.

366
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:07,607
I'm very nervous. I need you.

367
00:26:14,197 --> 00:26:15,448
-Gosh.
-Ouch.

368
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:17,659
Wait for me.

369
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:28,378
Pretend you didn't see them.

370
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:38,638
Mom.

371
00:26:40,056 --> 00:26:41,558
Do you still hate Taeyang?

372
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:47,355
She and I have a bad history,
but she's Taejun's savior.

373
00:26:48,898 --> 00:26:52,652
It's not like you can play both sides.
What are you going to do?

374
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:54,904
Stop it. You're complicating things.

375
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:59,367
You can stop taking my side.

376
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:02,412
You've been taking my side my whole life.

377
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:06,499
It's about time
you took Taejun's side too.

378
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:22,891
"Park Taejun and Park Taeyang

379
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:25,060
advance to the finals by surprise."

380
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:29,481
"Park Taejun, Park Taeyang's performance
draws attention, despite forfeiting."

381
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:31,399
"Park Taejun, Park Taeyang.

382
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:34,527
The rise of a new strong
mixed doubles duo."

383
00:27:37,572 --> 00:27:39,240
Are there that many articles about us?

384
00:27:40,241 --> 00:27:42,202
What's with the act?
You looked them up already.

385
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:50,085
Hey.

386
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:53,546
You're already drawing attention
as Park Taejun.

387
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:57,759
The time has come to tell everyone
that Park Junyoung is your sister.

388
00:28:00,303 --> 00:28:03,056
I used her as an excuse to see you.

389
00:28:04,557 --> 00:28:08,311
I don't care anymore
if people find out about who I am.

390
00:28:14,442 --> 00:28:16,194
I know that you're uncertain.

391
00:28:18,154 --> 00:28:20,031
After finishing the last game,

392
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:23,076
I really wanted to tell you how I felt.

393
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:26,996
But I guess I was in a rush.

394
00:28:31,334 --> 00:28:32,544
That's why

395
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:36,381
I'm going to try until I have
a 100% chance of winning.

396
00:28:39,092 --> 00:28:42,554
I'll try to wait
until you can't say no to me.

397
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:48,309
Okay.

398
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:52,147
Don't worry.

399
00:28:53,314 --> 00:28:55,692
I'm going to have a 100% win rate

400
00:28:56,609 --> 00:28:57,944
no matter what.

401
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:55,084
ONE MONTH LATER

402
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:57,295
Six. Good.

403
00:29:58,463 --> 00:29:59,547
Seven.

404
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:05,762
Eight. Make sure to keep your knees
from going inward.

405
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:08,640
Nine. There you go.

406
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:11,518
All right, ten.

407
00:30:15,438 --> 00:30:16,564
Coach!

408
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:19,776
-Why that little…
-What is it?

409
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:21,778
Are you here to give him a present again?

410
00:30:21,861 --> 00:30:24,113
He must really like Yumin.

411
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:26,199
He's so devoted to Coach Lee.

412
00:30:26,282 --> 00:30:27,826
How about you go out with him instead?

413
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:30,411
-Sibong, you…
-My goodness.

414
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:33,832
Hey, you punk.
No matter how many gifts you bring…

415
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:38,336
Even if you bring me gifts,

416
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:40,255
I'm not giving you my daughter.

417
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:43,341
It's not a gift this time.
I have big news.

418
00:30:43,424 --> 00:30:44,968
I'm sure you're going to love this.

419
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:48,555
Coach Kwon Kichul is getting fired.

420
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:52,642
-The national team coach?
-Yes.

421
00:30:52,725 --> 00:30:54,519
The news will be made public tomorrow.

422
00:30:54,602 --> 00:30:57,981
He was driving drunk when he hit a car
in a parking lot and ran off.

423
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:13,538
He was always known for
being the worst drunk.

424
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:16,958
Gosh, why does he live like that?

425
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:19,168
Now is finally your chance.

426
00:31:19,252 --> 00:31:20,879
Let's go back to the center together.

427
00:31:21,462 --> 00:31:23,089
You're already a strong candidate--

428
00:31:23,172 --> 00:31:26,718
Hey. Do you think I'm the only one
who is considered a strong candidate?

429
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:28,219
Dang it.

430
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:31,848
Cut the crap and leave, Mr. Yook.

431
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:38,354
I'm not doing it even if they ask.
I mean it.

432
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:41,816
Stop telling the athletes
to dream big and be ambitious--

433
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:44,402
Hey, have you forgotten how old I am?
You punk.

434
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:46,321
Is there an age limit to having dreams?

435
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:55,538
Gosh, he's being so annoying.

436
00:31:55,622 --> 00:31:56,915
I'm going to the bathroom.

437
00:31:57,665 --> 00:31:58,583
But Coach!

438
00:31:58,666 --> 00:32:01,252
Are you going to follow me
to the bathroom? Go away!

439
00:32:01,836 --> 00:32:03,087
Father!

440
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:11,220
PARK TAEJUN

441
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:13,640
Why is he calling me again?

442
00:32:22,565 --> 00:32:23,566
Dang it.

443
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:28,738
Just get up.

444
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:31,950
I want to go out with Taeyang.

445
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:34,369
Don't you have a knee injury?

446
00:32:36,162 --> 00:32:37,288
I said, get up.

447
00:32:37,872 --> 00:32:39,248
I can handle this much.

448
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:43,002
Your insisting won't get you anywhere.

449
00:32:44,837 --> 00:32:46,172
I disapprove.

450
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:49,133
I'll do my very best!

451
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:53,554
My Taeyang will

452
00:32:54,514 --> 00:32:57,100
have to say the same thing to your family.
That she'll do her best.

453
00:32:58,518 --> 00:33:01,104
Because she has a terrible dad like me,

454
00:33:01,562 --> 00:33:04,148
she's had to say that her entire life.

455
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:08,444
With your family, she would have to
work hard just to be loved.

456
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:12,031
What I want

457
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:15,451
is for Taeyang to be loved

458
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:18,788
even when she's just sitting there.

459
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:22,750
That's how I want her to be treated.

460
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:26,754
Even when she's just sitting,

461
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:32,635
she's lovable.

462
00:33:37,765 --> 00:33:39,142
She's lovable even when she cries

463
00:33:41,477 --> 00:33:43,021
or gets angry.

464
00:33:44,772 --> 00:33:48,192
No matter what she does, she's lovable.

465
00:33:52,321 --> 00:33:53,656
I know that Taeyang

466
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:57,577
has lived through a painful past,
but she's still lovable.

467
00:33:59,078 --> 00:34:01,080
And she'll continue to be lovable.

468
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,302
It would be great

469
00:34:15,511 --> 00:34:17,597
if at least you could give us
your blessing.

470
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:39,535
Do you want to go for a drink?

471
00:34:44,957 --> 00:34:47,210
That Yook Junghwan…

472
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:51,714
I just hate him.

473
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:56,552
I hate when my daughter holds his hand

474
00:34:56,636 --> 00:34:58,805
or smiles at him.

475
00:34:58,888 --> 00:35:02,934
She puts on a bright smile
even when he calls her.

476
00:35:03,017 --> 00:35:06,938
Hey, at least she's smiling.
That's better.

477
00:35:07,021 --> 00:35:10,316
Taeyang came home drunk
sometime last week.

478
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:15,863
She went on and on about Taejun
and cried her heart out.

479
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:18,866
Gosh. How can you stand the sight of that?

480
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:22,411
I wanted to poke my eyes out.

481
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:26,541
But at least Taejun is decent.

482
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:30,294
Isn't Junghwan a troublemaker?

483
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:31,838
That's what I mean. I--

484
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:33,965
Gosh. With being violent and all.

485
00:35:34,048 --> 00:35:36,509
He's completely worthless.

486
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:44,350
The rumors are a bit exaggerated.

487
00:35:45,726 --> 00:35:48,521
He's actually polite--

488
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:52,817
What I meant was, he's pretty okay…

489
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:57,155
Hey, he is just so nice to me.

490
00:35:57,238 --> 00:35:59,949
You have no idea.

491
00:36:00,449 --> 00:36:01,951
-Really?
-Yes.

492
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:04,120
Right, I see.

493
00:36:04,912 --> 00:36:10,501
Taejun, that punk. He keeps on calling me.

494
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:15,590
"Have you eaten?"
"Have you been to the hospital?"

495
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:18,176
He's just so annoying.

496
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:19,302
Junghwan…

497
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:25,224
Hey. Junghwan keeps getting me presents.

498
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:27,935
He gives me so many presents.

499
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:30,229
Gosh. He's well-off, you know.

500
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:33,065
Good for you.

501
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:35,484
Not at all. I hate him.

502
00:36:35,568 --> 00:36:40,448
Taejun would die at my command.

503
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:41,949
-Die?
-Yes.

504
00:36:44,952 --> 00:36:47,330
You know what? Junghwan.

505
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:51,792
He'll show up within an hour
if I call him, no matter what.

506
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:53,085
Really?

507
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:58,341
What, is he in Busan?
Why does he take an hour?

508
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:02,053
-From Busan…
-Taejun, that punk.

509
00:37:03,137 --> 00:37:07,058
He will come within 30 minutes
when I'm in the city.

510
00:37:07,141 --> 00:37:09,518
He's just so annoying.

511
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:14,398
-Call him.
-What?

512
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:17,151
-Call him!
-Dang it.

513
00:37:20,529 --> 00:37:21,572
Gosh.

514
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:28,704
-What are you doing here?
-Aren't you rehabbing your knee?

515
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:30,164
-I'm busy.
-Me too.

516
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:31,457
TAVERN HOUSE

517
00:37:42,134 --> 00:37:44,178
Hey, why are we doing this?

518
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:47,223
Father! He said, "Why are we doing this?"
He doesn't want to play.

519
00:37:47,306 --> 00:37:48,557
He doesn't want to play.

520
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:51,352
Get lost if you don't want to play.

521
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:55,273
-I don't want to not play!
-All right. There you go!

522
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:58,192
So, are you two ready?

523
00:37:58,401 --> 00:37:59,652
-Now, let's--
-Start!

524
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:04,031
I wasn't ready, you punk.

525
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:06,575
-Gosh.
-Come on.

526
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:08,744
-Oh, no.
-That's it!

527
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:11,330
-He's on our national team.
-It's going down!

528
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:13,958
All right, my dear Taejun.

529
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:16,752
"My dear Taejun"? My dear Taejun!

530
00:38:20,923 --> 00:38:22,008
Dad!

531
00:38:25,177 --> 00:38:27,763
Why is she calling me Dad?
Oh, your daughter is here.

532
00:38:29,223 --> 00:38:30,224
Hi, Taeyang.

533
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:34,020
What is she doing here?

534
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:35,938
I didn't lose, all right?

535
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:43,612
Goodness.

536
00:38:43,779 --> 00:38:46,991
Your coach started it.

537
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:50,286
How dare he compare you to Yook Junghwan?

538
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:55,708
And, if you hadn't shown up to end it,

539
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:58,419
Taejun would have won.

540
00:38:58,502 --> 00:39:01,547
Father, how about you call me
"My dear Taejun"?

541
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:10,389
Gosh.

542
00:39:12,141 --> 00:39:15,269
I'm going to
take a taxi back home and sleep.

543
00:39:16,562 --> 00:39:19,315
You guys can go eat or something.

544
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:21,609
Dad!

545
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:31,202
Have you eaten?

546
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:35,081
I'm okay.
You can go back home with Father.

547
00:39:36,165 --> 00:39:38,584
Oh, but it's been a while.

548
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:45,800
All right. It was nice seeing you.

549
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:49,345
Get back home safely.
You're coming back to the team, right?

550
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:51,347
Yes.

551
00:39:58,687 --> 00:40:00,731
-Did you call a taxi?
-Yes, sir.

552
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:02,817
Father, please get in. Here.

553
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:04,485
Okay.

554
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:09,365
I…

555
00:40:11,033 --> 00:40:12,827
now have an 80% win rate.

556
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:18,207
"My dear Taejun."

557
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:21,210
I hate to say this,

558
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:23,879
but you should get going.

559
00:40:25,464 --> 00:40:26,507
Okay.

560
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:52,450
Do you miss him that much?

561
00:40:56,745 --> 00:41:00,082
Gosh. That's why people say
it's no use raising a child.

562
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:04,503
But I want to be your daughter
in my next life.

563
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:32,740
Gosh, dang it.

564
00:41:36,118 --> 00:41:37,870
So, have you been using it a lot?

565
00:41:37,953 --> 00:41:41,707
Sir. It's very difficult to use my ankles.

566
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:44,710
Is that so?
That's why it's a part of training.

567
00:41:44,793 --> 00:41:45,836
It's playing if it's easy.

568
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:50,466
I don't think I need to rehab anymore.

569
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,302
I know your body better than you do.

570
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:02,186
Gosh. This sucks.

571
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:13,489
Everything…

572
00:42:16,575 --> 00:42:19,703
will be okay.

573
00:42:56,699 --> 00:42:58,701
PARK TAEJUN

574
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:26,020
The days when we can be
as happy as we want

575
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:28,063
will come again.

576
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:33,068
It'll be just like getting
a nice, surprising phone call.

577
00:44:11,523 --> 00:44:14,026
TAEJUN'S MOTHER

578
00:44:33,003 --> 00:44:34,171
Yes?

579
00:44:37,257 --> 00:44:40,302
When you have time,

580
00:44:42,096 --> 00:44:44,223
come over to our house for a meal.

581
00:44:53,399 --> 00:44:54,441
Okay.

582
00:44:56,735 --> 00:44:57,903
I'll hang up now.

583
00:44:58,654 --> 00:44:59,655
Wait…

584
00:45:00,572 --> 00:45:04,702
Tomorrow's Sunday. Can I come tomorrow?

585
00:45:04,785 --> 00:45:06,954
Tomorrow's a bit too…

586
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:12,000
All right.

587
00:45:13,627 --> 00:45:14,837
You can.

588
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:18,257
Okay.

589
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:22,469
-I'm really hanging up now.
-Okay.

590
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:56,628
It's about time you guys bloomed.

591
00:46:27,493 --> 00:46:29,203
Okay, let's start.

592
00:46:29,411 --> 00:46:31,079
All right. Breathe out.

593
00:46:33,749 --> 00:46:35,292
We're almost there.

594
00:46:35,501 --> 00:46:37,085
I see that you have quite an angle now.

595
00:46:38,337 --> 00:46:40,714
-Yes.
-Okay.

596
00:46:42,341 --> 00:46:44,843
All right. We'll continue
after a short break.

597
00:46:45,511 --> 00:46:46,553
Okay.

598
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:50,557
TAEYANG

599
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:04,112
-Hi, Taeyang.
-What are you doing tomorrow?

600
00:47:04,196 --> 00:47:05,823
Tomorrow? I'm not sure.

601
00:47:05,906 --> 00:47:09,201
Let's have dinner at your house tomorrow.
At your house in Chuncheon.

602
00:47:09,952 --> 00:47:10,994
What?

603
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:15,415
Taejun, now is the time
for you to have that 100% win rate.

604
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:16,792
Come at lightning speed.

605
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:13,849
Taeyang.

606
00:48:15,058 --> 00:48:16,351
Let's start over.

607
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:19,730
Right off the bat?

608
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:43,420
Do you know how much I had
to hold myself back from saying this?

609
00:48:54,556 --> 00:48:56,475
Don't forget even for a second

610
00:48:57,809 --> 00:48:59,144
that you are loved.

611
00:49:02,689 --> 00:49:06,068
Because I'll love you
without stopping for a single second.

612
00:49:21,667 --> 00:49:24,753
ONE YEAR LATER

613
00:49:28,757 --> 00:49:30,884
Are you aware
that our dorm curfew is 10 p.m.?

614
00:49:31,593 --> 00:49:33,845
-Yes.
-You can't come in once the doors close,

615
00:49:33,929 --> 00:49:35,847
and you'll lose points
if you stay out overnight.

616
00:49:35,931 --> 00:49:37,265
That means you'll get a pay cut.

617
00:49:37,849 --> 00:49:38,976
Got it.

618
00:49:39,059 --> 00:49:41,937
No drinking or smoking in the dorm.

619
00:49:42,354 --> 00:49:45,065
Most of all, no dating teammates

620
00:49:45,148 --> 00:49:46,858
used to be the rule,

621
00:49:47,317 --> 00:49:49,736
but nothing could stop love.

622
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:52,864
So everyone knows
but turns a blind eye to it.

623
00:49:54,324 --> 00:49:56,535
So you can date within the team.

624
00:49:57,995 --> 00:49:59,204
-You heard that?
-I know, right?

625
00:49:59,287 --> 00:50:00,747
-It didn't come?
-No.

626
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:01,999
What didn't?

627
00:50:04,042 --> 00:50:05,252
What are you looking at?

628
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:11,633
Why you… You've got a good eye.

629
00:50:14,636 --> 00:50:16,346
We're getting married in five years.

630
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:18,140
I see. Congratulations.

631
00:50:18,223 --> 00:50:20,976
-All right. Don't mess with her.
- I won't.

632
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:22,811
Go train.

633
00:50:31,653 --> 00:50:33,280
Thank you for helping me out.

634
00:50:34,281 --> 00:50:38,118
I promised myself not to become a senior
who takes advantage of his juniors.

635
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:40,162
I'm not going to be like our captain.

636
00:50:42,164 --> 00:50:45,542
Oh, there are three crazies on our team.

637
00:50:45,625 --> 00:50:48,336
First is the captain, Kko Dongwan.

638
00:50:49,379 --> 00:50:51,673
Leave your card behind
if you go to eat with him.

639
00:50:51,757 --> 00:50:53,884
He uses his junior's cards
as if they're his.

640
00:50:53,967 --> 00:50:55,802
He might say things like "I'll pay today."

641
00:50:55,886 --> 00:50:58,138
Don't believe him. Never.

642
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:01,641
I'm sorry. The other two crazies are

643
00:51:02,267 --> 00:51:04,644
the two coaches.

644
00:51:06,938 --> 00:51:09,149
They're like the crazy pair.

645
00:51:10,776 --> 00:51:14,029
Hey, Coach Lee. Why are the kids like this
when a tournament is coming up?

646
00:51:14,112 --> 00:51:16,198
Because their training is too tough.

647
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:21,453
That's what you asked for.

648
00:51:22,621 --> 00:51:23,747
Are you two fighting again?

649
00:51:24,956 --> 00:51:27,042
Starting to feel fatigued?

650
00:51:27,125 --> 00:51:30,128
What's important is to believe
that you can do this with ease.

651
00:51:30,629 --> 00:51:32,839
-Get it together and run. Got it?
-Yes, ma'am!

652
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:34,257
I can't hear you. Got it?

653
00:51:34,841 --> 00:51:35,801
-Yes, ma'am!
-Yes, ma'am!

654
00:51:37,594 --> 00:51:38,929
It was better in the old days.

655
00:51:39,471 --> 00:51:41,264
Anyway, I hope you hang in there.

656
00:51:42,808 --> 00:51:45,352
It's an honor for my family
that I'm playing for Yunis.

657
00:51:45,727 --> 00:51:47,979
I get to play
with Park Taejun and Park Taeyang.

658
00:51:51,316 --> 00:51:54,653
JINCHEON NATIONAL TRAINING CENTER

659
00:51:54,736 --> 00:51:56,947
Run faster. Come on!

660
00:51:57,030 --> 00:51:58,490
Hey, Park twins.

661
00:51:59,574 --> 00:52:00,867
-Coach!
-Hey!

662
00:52:03,703 --> 00:52:07,707
-Coach. Happy birthday!
-Happy birthday.

663
00:52:09,042 --> 00:52:10,293
Ta-da!

664
00:52:10,377 --> 00:52:13,588
Gosh, you didn't have to…
make me so happy.

665
00:52:14,172 --> 00:52:16,466
It's nothing much.
Just your birthday gift.

666
00:52:17,050 --> 00:52:19,511
You didn't have to take a day off
to come see me on my birthday.

667
00:52:19,678 --> 00:52:22,180
We can skip Buddha's birthday
and Christmas,

668
00:52:22,264 --> 00:52:23,807
but we're not skipping your birthday.

669
00:52:24,766 --> 00:52:28,895
Jeez. You really do look like
a national team coach.

670
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:30,730
Stop playing with me.

671
00:52:32,524 --> 00:52:34,693
When are you guys going to come here?

672
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:37,612
Are you trying out
for the national team this time?

673
00:52:38,196 --> 00:52:39,406
-Yes.
-Yes.

674
00:52:39,489 --> 00:52:41,074
Because I want to train under you.

675
00:52:41,158 --> 00:52:42,367
I want to train beside her.

676
00:52:43,869 --> 00:52:46,496
But I'm not the same Lee Taesang anymore.

677
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:48,123
You both better brace yourselves.

678
00:52:48,206 --> 00:52:49,332
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

679
00:52:51,042 --> 00:52:54,087
It's always nice to cross paths again.

680
00:52:54,671 --> 00:52:56,131
We had a good time back then.

681
00:52:59,217 --> 00:53:01,678
Hey, can you wait around for an hour?

682
00:53:01,761 --> 00:53:02,971
I'll finish up and come back.

683
00:53:03,054 --> 00:53:04,514
Sure. Take your time.

684
00:53:04,598 --> 00:53:06,433
-Okay. Let's grab a bite.
-Okay.

685
00:53:06,516 --> 00:53:07,601
I'll be back.

686
00:53:08,727 --> 00:53:09,603
Wait up.

687
00:53:10,353 --> 00:53:12,564
Gosh, he's still the same.

688
00:53:12,647 --> 00:53:13,648
I know.

689
00:53:14,149 --> 00:53:16,610
What about Junghwan?
Did you hear from him?

690
00:53:16,693 --> 00:53:17,819
Is he still not in Korea?

691
00:53:17,903 --> 00:53:20,238
I think he's still on the plane.
I can't reach him.

692
00:53:21,072 --> 00:53:22,699
It would've been nice to see him too.

693
00:53:23,617 --> 00:53:24,576
Right.

694
00:53:27,162 --> 00:53:29,164
Didn't you say
Junghwan's coming back today?

695
00:53:30,332 --> 00:53:33,585
I don't know. Maybe he's just decided
to stay permanently in Switzerland.

696
00:53:34,961 --> 00:53:37,255
Apparently, Switzerland is in love
with Yook Junghwan.

697
00:53:37,964 --> 00:53:39,174
I read that in an article.

698
00:53:39,758 --> 00:53:42,677
But only a team from Korea was invited
for the charity match.

699
00:53:43,136 --> 00:53:44,387
Isn't that amazing?

700
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:48,934
He said he can focus better on his game
because he can rely on his girlfriend.

701
00:53:49,893 --> 00:53:51,269
I read that in an article.

702
00:53:53,021 --> 00:53:54,606
Am I dating a virtual human?

703
00:53:54,898 --> 00:53:58,610
I find out everything about him
from the news, even what's on his mind.

704
00:53:58,777 --> 00:54:00,195
It's so hard to reach him by phone.

705
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:03,740
I search his name online daily to read up
on him because it's faster that way.

706
00:54:05,450 --> 00:54:07,202
I barely get to see his face once a month.

707
00:54:08,119 --> 00:54:09,913
I regret sending him back
to the national team.

708
00:54:09,996 --> 00:54:12,332
I think he just popped out from the news.

709
00:54:12,958 --> 00:54:13,792
What?

710
00:54:20,423 --> 00:54:21,466
Hey!

711
00:54:23,426 --> 00:54:24,844
Don't run. You could get hurt.

712
00:54:36,439 --> 00:54:37,857
Have you been well?

713
00:54:38,608 --> 00:54:40,151
What took you so long to come back?

714
00:54:41,403 --> 00:54:42,779
I'm sorry.

715
00:54:42,862 --> 00:54:45,323
Switzerland fell so in love with me
that it delayed the plane.

716
00:54:45,407 --> 00:54:47,492
It was clinging on.
I barely managed to get away.

717
00:54:47,575 --> 00:54:49,160
Did you come straight from the airport?

718
00:54:49,244 --> 00:54:52,247
Yes, I came straight here
because I really missed you.

719
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:17,105
2023 KOREA BADMINTON GRAND FINAL

720
00:55:38,543 --> 00:55:39,669
Junyoung.

721
00:55:39,753 --> 00:55:41,796
Seungwoo. Are you here to watch the game?

722
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:42,964
Yes.

723
00:55:44,299 --> 00:55:45,550
What do you have there?

724
00:55:46,051 --> 00:55:48,428
It's a survey.
It's part of my graduate school work.

725
00:55:49,888 --> 00:55:53,641
But it feels awkward
to ask the athletes to take it.

726
00:55:53,725 --> 00:55:55,602
Ask Taejun to give them out.

727
00:55:58,688 --> 00:55:59,606
Are you stupid?

728
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:01,441
Yes.

729
00:56:02,192 --> 00:56:05,195
I've become totally stupid
from trying to use my brain these days.

730
00:56:06,363 --> 00:56:07,405
See you later inside.

731
00:56:07,489 --> 00:56:08,573
See you.

732
00:56:12,285 --> 00:56:13,828
Hurry up.

733
00:56:14,329 --> 00:56:16,206
-Hey, Park twins.
-Hi, Junyoung.

734
00:56:16,289 --> 00:56:19,250
This survey is for the athletes to take.
You two can distribute it.

735
00:56:19,334 --> 00:56:21,753
I'm sorry, Junyoung.
We have to go play now.

736
00:56:21,836 --> 00:56:23,254
You should do your own work.

737
00:56:23,338 --> 00:56:24,464
Hurry up.

738
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:26,841
Sorry, Junyoung!

739
00:56:26,925 --> 00:56:28,635
Why those little…

740
00:56:30,428 --> 00:56:31,679
-Hello.
-Hello.

741
00:56:32,764 --> 00:56:35,100
Junyoung, can we help you?

742
00:56:37,602 --> 00:56:39,229
I'd appreciate it.

743
00:56:39,312 --> 00:56:41,564
It's our honor.
Do you need all these surveys done?

744
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:43,441
Thank you.

745
00:56:44,901 --> 00:56:46,611
What you need to do is…

746
00:56:52,283 --> 00:56:55,245
When it's not going well,
try hitting the shuttlecock up diagonally.

747
00:56:56,329 --> 00:56:57,664
I'll handle it all from the back.

748
00:56:58,456 --> 00:57:01,126
You know I'm always behind you, right?

749
00:57:02,168 --> 00:57:04,087
We're not going down
that easily this time.

750
00:57:08,049 --> 00:57:09,592
This kind of chance is hard to come by.

751
00:57:12,137 --> 00:57:13,138
Let's go.

752
00:57:35,076 --> 00:57:38,955
Go, Park twins!

753
00:57:43,835 --> 00:57:46,087
-Go for it!
-Let's go!

754
00:57:46,754 --> 00:57:49,466
You can do this, Park twins!

755
00:57:50,008 --> 00:57:53,011
-Gosh. It's a pleasure, Mr. Yeon.
-Have you been well?

756
00:57:54,387 --> 00:57:55,805
Jeez, you look good.

757
00:57:55,889 --> 00:57:57,932
Yunis, we're watching you!

758
00:57:58,016 --> 00:57:58,933
Go for it!

759
00:57:59,392 --> 00:58:00,810
Yumin! Good luck to you too!

760
00:58:00,894 --> 00:58:02,228
Let's go!

761
00:58:08,610 --> 00:58:10,153
What?

762
00:58:11,404 --> 00:58:12,864
Rooting for the Park twins?

763
00:58:12,947 --> 00:58:14,824
-We're loyal friends.
-Agreed.

764
00:58:14,908 --> 00:58:16,451
Sanghyun, I have a girlfriend now.

765
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:17,994
What?

766
00:58:18,912 --> 00:58:19,913
It's your birthday soon.

767
00:58:19,996 --> 00:58:22,624
-It's passed.
-Really?

768
00:58:28,379 --> 00:58:29,339
We will serve.

769
00:58:29,923 --> 00:58:32,050
Then we'll play on that side of the court.

770
00:58:32,133 --> 00:58:33,468
All right. Change ends.

771
00:58:33,551 --> 00:58:36,429
-Go for it!
-You can do it!

772
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:39,599
-Go for it!
-You got this!

773
00:58:41,559 --> 00:58:42,894
Loser buys dinner.

774
00:58:43,645 --> 00:58:45,313
This match should've happened a year ago.

775
00:58:46,147 --> 00:58:47,398
Let's add drinks on top of that.

776
00:58:48,566 --> 00:58:49,901
And taxi fare.

777
00:58:50,318 --> 00:58:52,779
-You'll have nothing left in your wallet.
-I didn't bring mine.

778
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:54,989
Thanks for the food.

779
00:58:56,282 --> 00:58:57,283
Let's go.

780
00:59:01,204 --> 00:59:03,248
Park Taejun and Park Taeyang from Yunis.

781
00:59:05,708 --> 00:59:08,628
Yook Junghwan from Yunis
and Lee Yumin from Somang Bank.

782
00:59:10,505 --> 00:59:14,133
We thought everything was over,
but we got another chance.

783
00:59:17,178 --> 00:59:19,472
Can we seize the opportunity this time?

784
00:59:20,765 --> 00:59:22,392
We'll only know if we try.

785
00:59:22,934 --> 00:59:24,060
But one thing is for sure.

786
01:00:04,392 --> 01:00:07,687
That now is the time
to have fun playing badminton.

787
01:00:10,690 --> 01:00:12,775
THANK YOU FOR WATCHING
GOING TO YOU AT A SPEED OF 493KM

788
01:02:02,343 --> 01:02:03,469
GOING TO YOU AT A SPEED OF 493KM

789
01:02:03,553 --> 01:02:05,555
