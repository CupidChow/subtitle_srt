1
00:00:37,787 --> 00:00:40,749
GOING TO YOU AT A SPEED OF 493KM

2
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,586
THE PLACES, PEOPLE, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTIONAL

3
00:00:46,838 --> 00:00:48,506
Long time no see, Junghwan.

4
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:51,676
Have you been well?

5
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:57,015
This is so awkward.

6
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:02,645
Who would've thought you and my brother
would get to know each other?

7
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:06,357
I'll leave you two to talk.

8
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:09,194
See you next time.

9
00:01:14,532 --> 00:01:15,867
But I came to see you.

10
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:20,246
Why don't you put that down?

11
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:22,832
I'm in front of my brother.

12
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:48,733
EPISODE 10

13
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:53,655
What about Taejun?
Did he go back to Seoul?

14
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:55,740
How would I know?

15
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:59,953
But you're back.
He should've stayed for a meal.

16
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:02,956
When will you two stop
being so indifferent toward each other?

17
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:18,346
CHUNCHEON SPORTING GOODS

18
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:22,392
Why is she your sister?

19
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:24,477
Do you think this makes sense?

20
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:28,606
I'm not very happy about it either.

21
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:34,195
Ever since I was young, I was a nobody
in the shadows of my great sister.

22
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:38,491
I thought, "Why does Junyoung
have to be my sister?"

23
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:42,036
I really wanted to escape from that.

24
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:43,621
That's why…

25
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:48,543
That's why.

26
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:52,213
That's why, what?

27
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:53,464
That's why

28
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:55,758
"Great job."

29
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:58,303
"Good work."

30
00:02:58,887 --> 00:02:59,846
"Awesome."

31
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:05,977
I've never said
anything nice like that to her.

32
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:08,688
Ever.

33
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:11,691
What are you blabbering on about? Gosh.

34
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,320
You.

35
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:17,864
You're not Junyoung's brother, are you?

36
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:22,243
When she got into that accident
three years ago,

37
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:26,289
I didn't know how

38
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:29,167
to comfort her.

39
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:31,961
It's not like I've ever done that before.

40
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:36,633
But during that time,

41
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,387
you stood beside her.

42
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:46,434
You did for her what I couldn't.

43
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:51,731
You went through the pain together.

44
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:55,985
So for that, I'm a little…

45
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:01,324
Well…

46
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:06,120
I really thank you for that.

47
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:15,004
You're seeing Taeyang
when you feel this bad for Junyoung?

48
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:16,839
Why mention that?

49
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:21,135
Does Taeyang know
that you and Junyoung are related?

50
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:22,303
If she did,

51
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:28,434
do you think she'd go out with me?

52
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:32,105
Then should I just… spill the beans?

53
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:36,150
Goodness.

54
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:39,612
Three years ago…

55
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:41,281
Right.

56
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:46,369
Like you said,
I went through everything with Junyoung.

57
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,080
Do you know how difficult that was?

58
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:51,124
Do you have any idea

59
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:54,085
what a complete disaster it was?

60
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:01,801
You're dredging up all of that.

61
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:06,472
Her one and only brother
is dating Taeyang?

62
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:09,767
Don't you think that's too harsh?

63
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:13,021
-I feel so bad for Junyoung.
-Gosh.

64
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:17,608
Where are you going, nutcase?

65
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:25,575
I'll head back first.

66
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:27,660
All right. Get some rest.

67
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:29,912
-Get home safe.
-I will.

68
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,172
After Junyoung retired,

69
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:42,300
Taeyang ran away from the training center.

70
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:45,094
Gosh, I just can't figure it out.

71
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:48,556
What's with those two?
She even knelt down.

72
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:50,850
I don't want to know.

73
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:54,896
My gut is telling me
that I'm better off not knowing.

74
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:01,486
PARK TAEJUN

75
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:03,946
Yes?

76
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,531
Are you with Taeyang?

77
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:07,784
Her phone's off.

78
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,744
We came to Seoul together,

79
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:11,412
and Taeyang just left to go home--

80
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:14,499
Hello?

81
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:16,501
Hello?

82
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,379
What's with-- Oh, my gosh.

83
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:20,963
It was Taejun, wasn't it?

84
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,757
He's totally drunk.

85
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:27,595
Why is he looking for Taeyang
when he's drunk?

86
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:32,350
No. I don't want to know
about that either.

87
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:54,622
The person you have reached
is not available.

88
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:58,126
Why isn't she picking up?

89
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:00,837
I took a taxi here
all the way from Chuncheon.

90
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:12,598
Taeyang, what are you doing?

91
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:14,892
I'm here.

92
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:19,272
If you don't come out,

93
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,191
I'm going in.

94
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,041
Taeyang.

95
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:24,170
Good night.

96
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:59,455
Hi, it's been a while.

97
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:01,749
Did you enjoy your time off?

98
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:06,963
Why you little…
How could you ghost me for a week?

99
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:08,422
I could sack you for that.

100
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:10,424
I'm sorry.

101
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:12,468
Be careful.

102
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:14,303
Yes, sir.

103
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:17,223
So, how are you feeling?

104
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:18,808
Great, sir!

105
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:22,353
Good. Make sure
to be nice to me from now on.

106
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:25,439
Yes, sir.

107
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:28,985
Okay. I'll see you during training.

108
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:39,453
Aren't you going to hurry?

109
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:41,414
I'm going!

110
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:09,191
Hey. Could you forgive what happened
if you were me?

111
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:11,944
Do you think begging on your knees
makes it forgivable?

112
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:38,012
It's so difficult with you.

113
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:41,307
You make it so difficult on others.

114
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:43,309
I really hate you.

115
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:58,991
What are you doing? Why can't you serve?

116
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:07,041
I need to take a short break, sir.

117
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:08,668
What have you done to deserve a break?

118
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:11,796
It'll just be a short break.

119
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:27,353
What the heck do you think you're doing?

120
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:32,316
What is it? So, because you've been
getting some attention lately,

121
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:35,152
do you think that's it? You're done?

122
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:39,281
That's when you can go downhill
in a second. Get a grip!

123
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:53,587
Is Coach Joo at it again?
Is he being hard on the kids?

124
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:57,883
He does it after every competition
so the players don't slack off.

125
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:01,053
But picking on one person
to get everyone on their toes isn't

126
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:03,347
-what you do nowadays--
-Are you talking behind his back?

127
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,559
I'm just worried about him.

128
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:09,478
Right. It's worrisome.

129
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:12,314
Coach Joo will never get married
if he keeps doing that.

130
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:16,152
Think about it. It's the end for us
if the athletes don't like us.

131
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,238
Who do you think would be willing
to take on a coach that athletes hate?

132
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:23,743
That's why you should give
Coach Joo some advice.

133
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:26,245
Me? Why would I do that?

134
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:29,832
Hey, all they do is talk behind my back
if I tell them the right things.

135
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:30,958
Like what you're doing now.

136
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:32,585
What did I do? He just worries me.

137
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:35,045
Okay, okay. I won't tell him.

138
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:37,173
What do you mean?
I'm just worried about him.

139
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:38,758
Is there anything else going on?

140
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:41,594
There's nothing. Gosh, stop laughing.

141
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:42,803
-What?
-All right.

142
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:45,514
Taeyang. Stay behind and hit
5,000 shuttlecocks before you leave.

143
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:48,309
Aren't you going to answer me?

144
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,230
Yes, sir.

145
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:56,275
PARK TAEJUN

146
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:00,988
What are you looking at? Get ready.

147
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:02,823
Please don't ask about the past.

148
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:06,827
However, the story about your injury will

149
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:10,539
help viewers empathize with you more.

150
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:13,959
It was such a shame that you got injured

151
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:15,628
while you were training on your own.

152
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:18,798
Ma'am.

153
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:24,386
Viewers nowadays get disgusted
when a show appeals for sympathy.

154
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:29,934
But still, you do need to do it a little

155
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:31,894
to get people to start watching.

156
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:37,024
"Park Junyoung is off to a new start.
A familiar face."

157
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:40,236
I thought that's what
this interview would be about. I'm sorry.

158
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:45,032
In that case, are you okay with filming
at the National Training Center?

159
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,008
-What's up?
-You little punk.

160
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:04,635
Are you living with a girl?

161
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:05,886
What are you talking about?

162
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:08,806
Are you at my place?

163
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:12,309
I told you my place is off-limits.

164
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:15,855
There was a reason
why you didn't want me here.

165
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:17,815
What kind of nonsense
have you been up to here?

166
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:21,944
Goodness. So you're a man.
This is quite shocking.

167
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:23,028
Junyoung.

168
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:26,282
Look at that.
A spoon and chopsticks for two.

169
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:28,534
Hey, I also noticed two toothbrushes.

170
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:30,619
One was pink.

171
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:33,747
I guess the entire place will be pink
when I come back in a month.

172
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:38,085
What is this?
You're not the type to buy cups.

173
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:39,295
Was this a wedding gift?

174
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:42,965
Is there a child hidden away somewhere?
Maybe I could find one.

175
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:45,509
It's my private life.

176
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:48,095
Let's see that girlfriend of yours.

177
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:50,639
Is she pretty? Do you have a picture?

178
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:52,057
Is she an athlete too?

179
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:55,811
Why aren't you saying anything?

180
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:05,029
Hey, I'm lying on your bed right now,

181
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:06,322
and it feels a little weird.

182
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:10,409
Shut up, will you?

183
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:14,163
Hey, when you two are on a date,

184
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:15,956
can I take a peek from far away?

185
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:18,250
I'm really curious.

186
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:19,752
Are you staying over tonight?

187
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:21,629
I have to go. I'm busy.

188
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:24,590
All right. Your bed doesn't suit me.

189
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:25,674
I'll get going.

190
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:28,761
Gosh. Where am I supposed to stay
when I'm in Seoul now?

191
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:31,013
Hey, will you just break up with her?

192
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:32,431
I'm hanging up.

193
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,099
Hey, Taejun.

194
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:36,518
I'm all for you dating.

195
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:39,188
Thanks.

196
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:49,239
Here, go!

197
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:52,409
Go faster. You're slow.

198
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:53,744
Get there first.

199
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:00,209
What are you doing?

200
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:08,425
Coach.

201
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:10,427
Something's wrong with me.

202
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:12,096
What is it?

203
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:15,265
It feels different
when I'm hitting with my racket.

204
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,643
The grip doesn't feel right.

205
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:20,396
It sounds different when I swing.

206
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:22,481
It also feels different
when I hit the shuttlecock.

207
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:24,108
I've lost my touch.

208
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:26,610
I didn't slack off after the tournament,

209
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:28,821
and I'm not elated
by getting some attention.

210
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:31,156
Is it the opposite then?

211
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:34,535
Are you upset about not getting
as much attention as you wanted?

212
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:37,037
I just…

213
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:43,168
I just hate myself.

214
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:47,381
I see myself running around with a racket,

215
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,260
and it makes me feel small.

216
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,685
Those are useless thoughts.

217
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:04,148
I think I'm in a slump.

218
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:06,108
I'm sure you know.

219
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:08,610
You can feel it the moment you're in it.

220
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:11,071
A slump.

221
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:15,034
When I was an athlete,
I often used that as an excuse.

222
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:18,412
I said I was in a slump
whenever I wanted to run away,

223
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:20,330
when I didn't feel confident enough,

224
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:22,875
or when I just wanted
to take some time off.

225
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,960
Do you think being in a slump
gives you a free pass?

226
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,629
-That's not what I--
-Drop the act.

227
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,798
From now on,
hit 5,000 shuttlecocks every weekday.

228
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:31,842
You should film it
and upload the video daily.

229
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:33,302
That's all for today.

230
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,173
You're alive.

231
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:13,634
I came to carry you out
in case you passed out.

232
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:20,641
What is this?
You're pouting as if you're about to cry.

233
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:21,809
It's actually cute.

234
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:25,437
You see, Coach Joo…

235
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:26,563
What about Coach Joo?

236
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:29,733
-He flipped--
-He flipped out on you?

237
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:32,361
Yes.

238
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:33,529
He told me to hit 5,000--

239
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:36,532
He told you
to hit 5,000 shuttlecocks every day?

240
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:39,576
Yes, except on the weekends.

241
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:41,912
But how can you understand me so well?

242
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:43,956
Seriously.

243
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,126
Should I stand up to Coach Joo?

244
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:49,169
Just say the word.

245
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:00,347
I'm in big trouble.

246
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:03,016
I know. It's not going to be easy.

247
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:05,769
How are you supposed to hit 5,000
every night?

248
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:09,439
Not that.

249
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:13,861
Whenever I'm holding a racket,

250
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:16,405
it keeps reminding me of Junyoung.

251
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:22,828
I shouldn't be thinking of anything
when I'm playing.

252
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:26,874
Where should I run to now?

253
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:32,212
Gosh.

254
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,509
I'm exhausted too.

255
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:40,679
Because of me?

256
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:45,684
Have I been a little too much
to handle these days?

257
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:47,978
Are you getting a little tired of me?

258
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:52,357
No, it was just a slip of the tongue.

259
00:19:57,613 --> 00:20:00,949
I'm sorry I keep talking
about how hard everything is.

260
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:05,370
Let's recharge.

261
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:08,248
We both need to recharge.

262
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:11,126
Tighter.

263
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:15,756
I'm sorry.

264
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:18,050
Wait, that just got us disconnected.

265
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:20,552
We have to recharge. Stop distracting me.

266
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,138
Charged up to 20%.

267
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:24,932
30%.

268
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:26,308
31%.

269
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:27,851
That's it?

270
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:29,478
32%.

271
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:34,316
Let's stay like this to charge ourselves
up to a full 1,000%.

272
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:36,860
33%.

273
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:39,196
34%.

274
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:42,241
35%.

275
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:43,825
35.1%.

276
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:45,994
Isn't decimal points a bit too much?

277
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,839
From today onward,
my rival is Park Junyoung.

278
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:01,760
I must surpass Park Junyoung at all costs.

279
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:02,970
What's with her?

280
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:07,140
This is all my fault.

281
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:09,142
I've ruined her.

282
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:15,190
I guess she's doing well, though.

283
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:21,280
-What's with Yumin?
-Is she on drugs?

284
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:22,489
Maybe she was drinking.

285
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:25,409
Good morning. It's a nice day.

286
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:26,952
Let's do this!

287
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:31,081
Now that I've embarrassed myself,
I'll get my act together and do my best.

288
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:36,420
Let's move on by playing sports.
Cheer up, Yumin!

289
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:10,954
Let's do this!

290
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:14,833
Keep it up!

291
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,205
I can't breathe.

292
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:57,542
I really can't breathe.

293
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,531
So we'll only film you saying hello

294
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:12,492
to the other athletes
and watching them practice.

295
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:13,618
Not bad, right?

296
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:16,663
-How cruel.
-Oh my.

297
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:23,795
-What?
-Who is that?

298
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:25,839
-Junyoung!
-Hey, Junyoung.

299
00:24:25,922 --> 00:24:27,215
Hey, long time no see.

300
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:28,967
-Coach, how have you been?
-She looks great.

301
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:30,677
-No way!
-It's been so long!

302
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:33,013
-How have you been?
-Junyoung, I love you.

303
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:34,806
-Gosh, you're still the same.
-Junyoung!

304
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:36,808
-I'm a huge fan.
-Thank you.

305
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:38,310
-It's been forever.
-I'll call you.

306
00:24:38,393 --> 00:24:40,770
Hello, Mr. Yook Junghwan.

307
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:43,899
Aren't you two close? Could we interview--

308
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:45,108
No.

309
00:24:46,526 --> 00:24:47,736
I have nothing to say.

310
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:51,907
You really have nothing to say?

311
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:54,576
Please do the interview.

312
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:05,253
Let's talk separately, you and me.

313
00:25:06,379 --> 00:25:07,923
Come to the back gate after you're done.

314
00:25:23,146 --> 00:25:25,565
We were just… in a tournament…

315
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:28,276
What's with the half marathon?

316
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:30,570
-Run.
-Run! Gosh.

317
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:35,784
With the special training,
you must be exhausted.

318
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:38,203
I'm okay, sir.

319
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:41,289
Tell me if you're not.
I can talk to Coach--

320
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:45,085
Stop tempting me when I'm dying here.

321
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:51,007
Mr. Sibong. Doesn't it look like
she could be talked into doing something?

322
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,843
-What?
-Okay.

323
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:04,521
Do you know how to get to
the finish line without breaking a sweat?

324
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:09,442
Run slowly and fall behind,

325
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:12,195
far enough so Coach can't see us.

326
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:15,073
Go away, you devil.

327
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:19,953
You've been hitting 5,000 shuttlecocks
every night these days.

328
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:22,455
-You should think about your body--
-Get lost.

329
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:24,666
At least run slowly then.

330
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:27,669
Or let's just walk.
Let's take a short break.

331
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,171
If you stop, you want to lie down.

332
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:32,716
If you lie down, you want to give up.

333
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:35,343
Gosh.

334
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:45,854
Did you read my emails?

335
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:50,150
I sent one every week…

336
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:53,570
for three years.

337
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:56,489
I worried a lot about you.

338
00:26:59,075 --> 00:27:00,619
You can't say you didn't know that.

339
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:06,916
I wanted to pretend not to know.

340
00:27:10,503 --> 00:27:11,504
Why?

341
00:27:12,672 --> 00:27:14,132
Because I hate you.

342
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:20,263
Did I really get hurt
while I went hiking alone?

343
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:23,099
Did you forget that it was a lie?

344
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:26,728
It happened because I got drunk
and sneaked out to go snowboarding.

345
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:29,272
I want to forget everything
that happened back then.

346
00:27:29,939 --> 00:27:33,151
And you know what happened,
so I don't want to see you.

347
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:37,489
I hate you.

348
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:40,283
I just do.

349
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:43,953
Seriously…

350
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:50,335
You're just so mean.

351
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:03,306
Why should I get heartbroken by you?

352
00:28:05,308 --> 00:28:07,102
Let's end it, Junghwan.

353
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:10,438
All right.

354
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:14,567
I'm going to end it too.

355
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:18,238
Let's end this.

356
00:28:32,627 --> 00:28:34,170
Hang in there till the end.

357
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:35,672
All right.

358
00:28:35,755 --> 00:28:36,589
Let's go.

359
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:37,966
-You can do it.
-Good work.

360
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:38,925
You did it.

361
00:28:39,008 --> 00:28:40,552
-Great work.
-All right.

362
00:28:41,302 --> 00:28:42,929
You're tired but stretch out your legs.

363
00:28:43,012 --> 00:28:44,347
You'll get muscle cramps.

364
00:28:45,598 --> 00:28:46,850
Here. Good job, Taeyang.

365
00:28:48,101 --> 00:28:50,520
-Thank you.
-Good job to you too, Taejun.

366
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:52,564
Thanks.

367
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:01,322
Don't lie down. You have to stretch.

368
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:04,451
-Just a minute.
-Get over here.

369
00:29:05,368 --> 00:29:06,369
Okay.

370
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:09,914
You can stay put.

371
00:29:11,374 --> 00:29:12,500
Do you want some water?

372
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:15,879
I feel like throwing up.

373
00:29:23,052 --> 00:29:24,262
Thank you, Youngsim.

374
00:29:26,389 --> 00:29:27,557
Sungsil, thanks.

375
00:29:29,225 --> 00:29:31,686
Why did you run till the end
and not give up in the middle?

376
00:29:32,645 --> 00:29:33,855
You're stupid.

377
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:41,446
Coach, why don't we go
and get Taeyang some meat?

378
00:29:42,572 --> 00:29:43,865
I can make a reservation.

379
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:47,827
-Good idea.
-All right, let's do that.

380
00:29:48,995 --> 00:29:51,915
You can eat, get some rest,

381
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:55,835
and hit 5,000 shuttlecocks tonight.

382
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:16,356
I don't want to.

383
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:23,446
I won't do it.

384
00:30:30,745 --> 00:30:31,746
What?

385
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:34,415
Say that again.

386
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:48,513
I'm not in good condition,

387
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:51,266
and my body isn't 100%.

388
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:55,436
I'll stop the additional training
and take a break.

389
00:30:58,606 --> 00:30:59,607
All right.

390
00:31:03,152 --> 00:31:06,281
Do it. You can be on a break for good.

391
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:11,327
Don't show up to train when you're not in
the condition to do what your coach says.

392
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:14,372
You're banned from using
the training center.

393
00:31:14,455 --> 00:31:17,250
Don't even get a drop of sweat
on your team uniform.

394
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:19,544
That is, until you can hit
5,000 shuttlecocks again.

395
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:31,014
Thank you. I'll enjoy my break.

396
00:31:41,816 --> 00:31:42,942
Taejun.

397
00:31:43,651 --> 00:31:45,862
Go with her.
She could collapse any minute.

398
00:31:45,945 --> 00:31:47,030
Okay.

399
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:00,877
"I don't want to. I won't do it."

400
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:03,755
When those words came out of your mouth,

401
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:05,673
I felt so relieved.

402
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:08,217
Good job.

403
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:12,138
Just cross the street.

404
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:24,525
Aren't you going to go?

405
00:32:25,526 --> 00:32:27,278
That green person over there.

406
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:30,281
Why can't I stand to look at him?

407
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:35,203
He's forcing us to run.

408
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:37,747
As if something bad will happen
if we don't run now.

409
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:39,374
Ten,

410
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:43,795
nine, eight, seven…

411
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:46,881
It's like he's threatening us.

412
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,051
Run because you have to.

413
00:32:51,594 --> 00:32:53,012
Run in case something bad happens.

414
00:32:54,722 --> 00:32:56,766
Simply run as a first resort.

415
00:32:58,768 --> 00:33:00,436
I'm really tired of it.

416
00:33:02,605 --> 00:33:05,566
You can take a break now
and cross next time.

417
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,318
But I end up running.

418
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:09,278
That's the way I am.

419
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:12,115
Let's run.

420
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:13,908
Hold on!

421
00:33:23,626 --> 00:33:25,420
Goodbye. See you tomorrow!

422
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:28,172
You're going? Wait.

423
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,341
See you tomorrow.

424
00:33:32,802 --> 00:33:35,513
Where are you going? Taeyang!

425
00:34:27,106 --> 00:34:28,775
My legs suddenly gave out.

426
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:32,862
Maybe being in front
of you is making me weak in the knees.

427
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:37,158
Junyoung.

428
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:41,829
I'm sorry,

429
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:46,584
but can't you forgive me?

430
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:52,632
If you can't forgive me,

431
00:34:54,675 --> 00:34:56,344
I can't forgive myself.

432
00:34:57,303 --> 00:34:58,346
But

433
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:03,726
this feeling of guilt is

434
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:08,064
making me suffocate.

435
00:35:19,992 --> 00:35:21,035
Junyoung.

436
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:23,996
Can I just say

437
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:27,542
it was me who got you injured

438
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:31,462
and that you covered for me?

439
00:35:32,713 --> 00:35:34,632
Can I just come clean?

440
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:41,097
I could get all the blame

441
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:43,224
and punishment for what I've done.

442
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:46,686
Could I do that?

443
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:49,814
Although it's late.

444
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:57,446
Why did you thank me?

445
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:03,578
You…

446
00:36:07,707 --> 00:36:09,542
Why did you thank me?

447
00:36:11,794 --> 00:36:14,547
What do you mean?

448
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:19,886
When I was in the hospital
after I got hurt,

449
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:23,222
you said that to me.

450
00:36:24,765 --> 00:36:25,892
"Thank you."

451
00:36:31,063 --> 00:36:32,273
Don't cry.

452
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:37,486
It's no use crying over spilled milk.

453
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:40,907
I'll get better after doing some rehab.

454
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:52,627
Junyoung.

455
00:36:56,923 --> 00:36:58,341
Thank you, Junyoung.

456
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:04,972
Thank you so much

457
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,185
for covering up for me.

458
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:14,190
Thank you for saving me.

459
00:37:16,525 --> 00:37:17,526
I promise

460
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:21,489
I'll do anything to help.

461
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:25,451
Let's get you all better soon,

462
00:37:25,534 --> 00:37:28,037
so we can train together.

463
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:45,596
After destroying my life,

464
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:48,516
was thank you

465
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:54,522
all you could think to say to me?

466
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,442
I…

467
00:38:00,027 --> 00:38:01,112
I…

468
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:03,489
Don't you remember?

469
00:38:05,866 --> 00:38:07,410
You thanking me was

470
00:38:08,744 --> 00:38:10,538
such a huge burden for me.

471
00:38:14,917 --> 00:38:18,004
The operation was a failure.
The rehabilitation was a failure.

472
00:38:22,341 --> 00:38:25,970
I was dying as I was going through
that phase, but I couldn't tell the truth,

473
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:27,346
even to my own family,

474
00:38:28,889 --> 00:38:31,434
about how I got hurt
or how much I was struggling.

475
00:38:35,896 --> 00:38:37,732
While I was suffering
in the hospital by myself,

476
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:40,318
what were you doing?

477
00:38:41,944 --> 00:38:45,698
Were you having fun playing badminton
while feeling thankful to me?

478
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:55,875
And now you want to come clean?

479
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:00,963
After all this time?

480
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:06,510
When everyone else thinks

481
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:09,221
I got injured while training,

482
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:12,308
you want to bring it up now?

483
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:15,269
To make yourself feel better?

484
00:39:16,812 --> 00:39:18,022
Taeyang.

485
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,026
Hey, Park Taeyang.

486
00:39:25,571 --> 00:39:27,239
Is that all you can do?

487
00:39:31,577 --> 00:39:33,412
You just can't make up your mind.

488
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:35,456
You can't stop being selfish,

489
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:38,501
but you want to be a good person.

490
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:45,466
As always, you're pathetic.

491
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:57,061
You're right.

492
00:40:01,482 --> 00:40:03,067
I really am like that.

493
00:40:07,863 --> 00:40:10,491
Taeyang, you're so pathetic.

494
00:40:37,059 --> 00:40:38,394
What should I do?

495
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:15,598
Junghwan.

496
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:18,851
Is something wrong?

497
00:41:18,934 --> 00:41:20,978
Why are you practicing so hard?

498
00:41:25,357 --> 00:41:27,818
I just wanted to practice quietly
on my own.

499
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:30,696
What? Why are you avoiding me?

500
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:34,283
Let's play one set.

501
00:41:36,118 --> 00:41:37,077
What are you up to?

502
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:39,997
I just want to play a match.

503
00:41:44,293 --> 00:41:45,920
Why do you play sports?

504
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:48,422
Sports?

505
00:41:54,637 --> 00:41:55,679
It's fun to win.

506
00:41:58,807 --> 00:41:59,808
I see.

507
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:02,311
This is fun for you.

508
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:04,396
I don't find it fun.

509
00:42:05,272 --> 00:42:06,815
I play because I hate losing.

510
00:42:08,317 --> 00:42:09,693
So for me,

511
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:12,154
I'm not that happy even when I win.

512
00:42:12,571 --> 00:42:15,241
I guess I'm just relieved
that I didn't lose.

513
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:17,660
Well, that sounds tough.

514
00:42:17,826 --> 00:42:18,911
Yes.

515
00:42:19,995 --> 00:42:21,664
That's why I'm better than you.

516
00:42:22,581 --> 00:42:24,625
"You can't beat the guy
who's enjoying himself"?

517
00:42:25,125 --> 00:42:26,418
That's all gibberish.

518
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:30,881
I want to die when I lose.

519
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:33,926
So regardless of
whether I'm enjoying myself,

520
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:35,803
I play with all that I've got.

521
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:39,557
I'm not interested in winning
or losing against someone like you.

522
00:42:40,766 --> 00:42:42,434
But the thing is, I don't lose to anyone.

523
00:42:44,937 --> 00:42:47,147
You'll never have a chance
to win against me.

524
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:51,360
Stop messing around.

525
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:53,320
Just clean this up and go.

526
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:08,460
That jerk…

527
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:13,340
He keeps getting on my nerves.

528
00:43:23,684 --> 00:43:24,685
Good morning!

529
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:26,770
-Hello, sir.
-Good morning, Coach.

530
00:43:26,854 --> 00:43:29,356
What is this? Where's Taeyang?

531
00:43:32,985 --> 00:43:34,194
She's not here yet?

532
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:38,574
She refused the additional training,
so I told her not to come.

533
00:43:38,657 --> 00:43:40,117
What are you talking about?

534
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,869
I'll tell you about it later.

535
00:43:42,369 --> 00:43:44,955
All right, let's get ready.
Everyone, to your positions.

536
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:46,665
-Coach Joo. A minute?
-Sure.

537
00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:48,167
About Taeyang.

538
00:43:49,585 --> 00:43:50,544
Let's bring her back.

539
00:43:58,218 --> 00:43:59,511
What?

540
00:43:59,595 --> 00:44:00,929
She wasn't officially penalized.

541
00:44:01,013 --> 00:44:03,724
I don't think it's right
to ban her from coming to training.

542
00:44:04,266 --> 00:44:06,101
Hey, Seungwoo. You punk!

543
00:44:06,602 --> 00:44:07,853
This is none of your business.

544
00:44:07,936 --> 00:44:09,938
When a person keeps hitting a wall,

545
00:44:10,522 --> 00:44:12,191
of course, they can lose their temper.

546
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:14,860
-Please bring Taeyang back.
-Hey!

547
00:44:15,903 --> 00:44:19,740
How dare an athlete give
unsolicited advice to a coach?

548
00:44:19,948 --> 00:44:21,700
Look at this team spirit.

549
00:44:23,285 --> 00:44:24,370
Go practice, all of you.

550
00:44:25,454 --> 00:44:27,081
-Coach Joo. A minute?
-Coach Lee.

551
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:28,832
What is it this time?

552
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:32,252
Are you going to stand up to me too?

553
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:34,922
Why you little… Let's go over there.

554
00:44:35,005 --> 00:44:36,173
But Coach--

555
00:44:36,548 --> 00:44:37,549
Stop.

556
00:44:47,017 --> 00:44:48,060
Gosh.

557
00:44:49,228 --> 00:44:51,271
Seriously, what's wrong with you?

558
00:44:52,147 --> 00:44:55,651
Why did you kick her out like that?

559
00:44:56,235 --> 00:44:57,653
Bring her back, okay?

560
00:44:57,736 --> 00:45:00,447
Until she comes to me herself
and apologizes,

561
00:45:01,323 --> 00:45:03,534
for the sake of our team,
I'm not going to give in.

562
00:45:03,617 --> 00:45:05,077
What kind of a blockhead are you?

563
00:45:05,994 --> 00:45:08,205
A blockhead… Coach?

564
00:45:08,288 --> 00:45:11,875
Listen. If you kick out an athlete
just because she doesn't follow orders,

565
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:13,794
who would trust and lean on you?

566
00:45:14,002 --> 00:45:16,463
Don't try to force the athletes
to respect you.

567
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:19,675
Act like someone who deserves respect.

568
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:23,178
Wait. Do you mean I'm in the wrong here?

569
00:45:23,262 --> 00:45:24,471
You punk!

570
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:29,059
Don't you remember why I lost my job
with the national team?

571
00:45:29,977 --> 00:45:32,563
You saw what happened,
and yet you're making the same--

572
00:45:32,646 --> 00:45:35,357
I respected you
for being such a tough coach.

573
00:45:36,191 --> 00:45:38,652
That's why I followed you here.

574
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:40,487
-My annual salary--
-Coach.

575
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:42,030
Mr. Kim. What were you doing?

576
00:45:43,824 --> 00:45:45,993
-I didn't do anything.
-Why not?

577
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:48,162
What were you doing when she got banned?

578
00:45:49,329 --> 00:45:50,414
My heart was aching.

579
00:45:55,169 --> 00:45:57,671
-That Sibong…
-Mr. Sibong.

580
00:46:00,132 --> 00:46:03,427
It's not like
we can report her missing to the police.

581
00:46:04,136 --> 00:46:07,139
How on earth are we supposed
to find where Taeyang is?

582
00:46:07,681 --> 00:46:09,266
Our coaches seem to be on the same side.

583
00:46:10,058 --> 00:46:13,604
I think we shouldn't blow this
out of proportion and let it--

584
00:46:13,687 --> 00:46:16,273
I'll take full responsibility,
so let's find her.

585
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:21,236
Taeyang's phone is turned off.

586
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:22,863
She's also not checking her texts.

587
00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:24,490
Go back to check the dorm

588
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:26,450
and any place nearby
where she could be at.

589
00:46:26,533 --> 00:46:29,745
She might be wandering nearby,
unable to come back.

590
00:46:29,953 --> 00:46:31,121
That could be the case.

591
00:46:32,831 --> 00:46:35,834
Do we have to do this?

592
00:46:35,918 --> 00:46:38,504
If athletes don't stick up for each other,
then who will?

593
00:46:42,382 --> 00:46:43,217
Go find her.

594
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:45,469
-What are you doing? Let's go.
-Of course.

595
00:46:46,136 --> 00:46:47,221
Hurry up.

596
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:49,973
-Go start the car.
-You haven't done that yet?

597
00:46:54,978 --> 00:46:55,813
Taejun.

598
00:46:57,314 --> 00:46:58,982
Why are you still here?

599
00:46:59,066 --> 00:47:00,609
I wouldn't come back either

600
00:47:01,568 --> 00:47:03,612
unless Coach called first to apologize.

601
00:47:05,781 --> 00:47:07,991
I'm just going to take a nap.

602
00:47:18,335 --> 00:47:21,505
The person you have reached
is not available. Please try…

603
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:24,716
PARK TAEYANG

604
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:32,516
Where did you go?

605
00:48:03,422 --> 00:48:04,756
Miss.

606
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:06,717
We're open for business.

607
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:09,636
We do takeout too.

608
00:48:15,767 --> 00:48:18,562
Mom, can I have 2,000 won?

609
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:20,564
But you got spending money yesterday.

610
00:48:20,647 --> 00:48:22,649
Why would I accept money from that guy?

611
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:24,401
What's wrong with his money?

612
00:48:24,484 --> 00:48:26,236
I just want 2,000 won.

613
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:27,571
What is it for?

614
00:48:27,654 --> 00:48:29,281
I just want to buy something to eat.

615
00:48:29,364 --> 00:48:32,993
-I'm not your bank. Stop asking me.
-Come on.

616
00:48:33,076 --> 00:48:34,870
-Do you want some coffee?
-No, I want money.

617
00:48:37,122 --> 00:48:39,416
CAFE, SUNSHINE

618
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:44,671
Who are you?

619
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:54,765
What is this?

620
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:58,101
Just take it.

621
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:06,109
Mom, do you know her?

622
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:08,820
Take it.

623
00:49:11,239 --> 00:49:12,366
It's okay.

624
00:49:25,337 --> 00:49:27,547
PARK TAEJUN

625
00:49:40,602 --> 00:49:42,145
Why are you looking for Taeyang here?

626
00:49:43,105 --> 00:49:44,398
Isn't she training?

627
00:49:44,481 --> 00:49:45,816
We all got some time off.

628
00:49:50,696 --> 00:49:51,947
But your break is over.

629
00:49:55,283 --> 00:49:56,785
It got extended for a few more days.

630
00:49:56,868 --> 00:49:58,954
It's something urgent,
but I couldn't get hold of her.

631
00:49:59,538 --> 00:50:01,623
What are you talking about?
She went to train.

632
00:50:02,874 --> 00:50:04,001
Is something wrong?

633
00:50:04,084 --> 00:50:06,962
No. I think she went somewhere
to get some rest.

634
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:11,133
If Taeyang comes here,
please ask her to give me a call.

635
00:50:15,929 --> 00:50:18,557
Who's that? Taeyang's boyfriend?

636
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:22,394
Boyfriend, my foot. She's busy training.

637
00:50:23,603 --> 00:50:26,773
Don't you know him?
He's Park Junyoung's little brother.

638
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:29,276
What? Park Junyoung?

639
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:30,402
Yes.

640
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:32,195
When he was a kid,

641
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:34,865
he asked me to teach him
so he could escape his sister's shadow.

642
00:50:36,992 --> 00:50:39,995
I spoke with his parents back then.

643
00:51:22,037 --> 00:51:24,456
It's cold. You should've called
or picked up your phone.

644
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:31,963
Where have you been all day?

645
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:04,287
You're a lifesaver.

646
00:52:09,209 --> 00:52:10,669
You truly are.

647
00:52:35,527 --> 00:52:37,612
How angry is Coach Joo?

648
00:52:38,196 --> 00:52:39,865
I'm in trouble, right?

649
00:52:41,116 --> 00:52:42,951
I forbid you to talk about training.

650
00:52:43,743 --> 00:52:47,205
Is that all you want to talk about
when you finally skipped training?

651
00:52:48,331 --> 00:52:49,374
Gosh.

652
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:52,711
That's why you have to make a habit
out of playing hooky.

653
00:53:00,343 --> 00:53:01,970
Tell me a true story about yourself.

654
00:53:04,264 --> 00:53:05,932
A true story about me?

655
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:07,267
Yes.

656
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:11,313
Your hobbies, your favorite restaurant,

657
00:53:12,272 --> 00:53:15,233
your friends,
a time when you went on a trip.

658
00:53:15,317 --> 00:53:16,610
You know, things like that.

659
00:53:23,825 --> 00:53:24,951
I don't know.

660
00:53:25,827 --> 00:53:28,288
Nothing is really coming to mind.

661
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:32,167
In that case,

662
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:37,214
who do you miss the most?

663
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:40,342
Or,

664
00:53:41,176 --> 00:53:42,969
who do you hate the most?

665
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:50,268
The answer to both would be my mom.

666
00:53:52,145 --> 00:53:53,647
My biological mother.

667
00:53:59,110 --> 00:54:00,320
Is she alive?

668
00:54:01,821 --> 00:54:02,822
Yes.

669
00:54:04,532 --> 00:54:07,118
I used to see her from time to time
when I was younger.

670
00:54:10,538 --> 00:54:11,623
And after you grew up?

671
00:54:16,503 --> 00:54:19,047
I only went to see her twice.

672
00:54:20,757 --> 00:54:24,970
The first time was when I won the gold
at the National Championships.

673
00:54:26,596 --> 00:54:28,265
And the second time

674
00:54:31,101 --> 00:54:34,312
was three years ago, when I ran away
from the National Training Center.

675
00:54:35,563 --> 00:54:41,069
CAFE, SUNSHINE

676
00:54:41,152 --> 00:54:44,447
CAFE, SUNSHINE

677
00:54:44,531 --> 00:54:45,573
It's funny.

678
00:54:46,366 --> 00:54:48,785
I went to see her at my happiest moment

679
00:54:49,035 --> 00:54:51,329
and the most difficult time in my life.

680
00:54:56,376 --> 00:54:57,836
After all, she's still my mom.

681
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:02,882
Wait.

682
00:55:05,677 --> 00:55:07,345
I guess it's three times now.

683
00:55:14,102 --> 00:55:15,228
Taejun.

684
00:55:16,438 --> 00:55:17,814
I have a question for you too.

685
00:55:19,524 --> 00:55:20,358
Yes?

686
00:55:22,527 --> 00:55:23,820
Have you ever slept with a girl?

687
00:55:26,114 --> 00:55:27,574
Why are you asking me that?

688
00:55:28,992 --> 00:55:30,869
Because I want to sleep with you.

689
00:55:42,464 --> 00:55:44,007
What's wrong? Don't you want to?

690
00:55:50,722 --> 00:55:52,057
Why wouldn't I want to?

691
00:55:56,853 --> 00:56:00,690
But do you want to today? Now?

692
00:56:04,194 --> 00:56:05,236
Yes.

693
00:56:07,989 --> 00:56:09,324
But why all of a sudden?

694
00:56:12,702 --> 00:56:14,245
I don't know.

695
00:56:35,016 --> 00:56:36,643
I wonder what love is.

696
00:56:38,937 --> 00:56:40,688
It's what we're doing now.

697
00:56:42,690 --> 00:56:44,651
What is it that you're doing?

698
00:57:07,799 --> 00:57:10,051
What is love?

699
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:19,662
What is it? Did you have a bad dream?

700
00:58:31,424 --> 00:58:34,093
It's okay, Taeyang.

701
00:58:39,724 --> 00:58:41,017
Everything's okay.

702
00:58:43,269 --> 00:58:44,312
It's okay.

703
00:59:02,121 --> 00:59:03,248
You know what?

704
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:13,216
Thank you

705
00:59:14,759 --> 00:59:15,885
for loving me.

706
00:59:22,392 --> 00:59:23,810
Thank you.

707
00:59:41,035 --> 00:59:44,789
I ended up saying thank you again.

708
00:59:47,125 --> 00:59:48,876
What if my thank you

709
00:59:49,711 --> 00:59:51,504
becomes a burden to you as well?

710
00:59:54,007 --> 00:59:57,218
What if it eventually becomes
a painful memory for you?

711
01:00:00,555 --> 01:00:01,848
The thought of it made me afraid,

712
01:00:03,016 --> 01:00:04,559
and so I cried again.

713
01:00:19,824 --> 01:00:24,203
THIS VIDEO IS UNAVAILABLE

714
01:00:28,124 --> 01:00:29,500
TRUTH ABOUT A FORMER NATIONAL ATHLETE

715
01:00:32,211 --> 01:00:35,340
Did I really get hurt
while I went hiking alone?

716
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:38,051
-You have to brace yourself.
-Did you forget that it was a lie?

717
01:00:39,719 --> 01:00:42,472
It happened because I got drunk
and sneaked out to go snowboarding…

718
01:00:42,555 --> 01:00:43,931
What is bound to happen

719
01:00:44,557 --> 01:00:46,726
will happen in the end.

720
01:00:46,809 --> 01:00:48,978
…And you know what happened,

721
01:00:50,146 --> 01:00:51,230
so I don't want to see you.

722
01:00:52,273 --> 01:00:53,483
I hate you.

723
01:00:54,734 --> 01:00:55,902
I just do.

724
01:00:55,985 --> 01:00:57,487
SHE DIDN'T GET INJURED WHILE TRAINING?

725
01:00:57,570 --> 01:00:58,946
WHAT DID I JUST SEE? I WAS HER FAN

726
01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:00,865
YOOK JUNGHWAN'S A COMPLETE LOSER

727
01:01:00,948 --> 01:01:02,367
SHE'S A TOTAL FRAUD

728
01:01:02,450 --> 01:01:04,035
SHE DESERVED IT

729
01:01:34,691 --> 01:01:36,651
GOING TO YOU AT A SPEED OF 493KM

730
01:01:36,734 --> 01:01:39,320
Isn't it ridiculous? Taeyang and me.

731
01:01:39,904 --> 01:01:41,030
It's all in the past.

732
01:01:41,114 --> 01:01:43,866
Why is it coming back to me like this?

733
01:01:43,950 --> 01:01:46,160
I won't make the same mistake this time.

734
01:01:47,078 --> 01:01:49,038
I won't hide behind your back.

735
01:01:49,664 --> 01:01:51,040
-Let's go.
-Whoever filmed it,

736
01:01:51,124 --> 01:01:53,459
I'm going to find them. I'm sure I can.

737
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:57,463
You know, a match that might happen
only once in your lifetime.

738
01:01:57,964 --> 01:02:00,174
A match that's worth dying for.

739
01:02:00,258 --> 01:02:01,676
Have you ever played in one?

740
01:02:13,271 --> 01:02:14,105
GOING TO YOU AT A SPEED OF 493KM

741
01:02:14,188 --> 01:02:16,107
