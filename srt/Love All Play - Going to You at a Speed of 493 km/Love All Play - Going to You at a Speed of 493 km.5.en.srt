1
00:00:37,787 --> 00:00:40,790
GOING TO YOU AT A SPEED OF 493KM

2
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,586
THE PLACES, PEOPLE, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTIONAL

3
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:49,758
Are you the one
who sent Taeyang to Somang?

4
00:00:50,842 --> 00:00:52,177
Why do you care?

5
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,553
I thought you used to be friends.

6
00:00:53,636 --> 00:00:55,388
You used to be friends once.

7
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:57,182
I gave her a good opportunity.

8
00:00:57,807 --> 00:00:58,892
She should be grateful.

9
00:00:58,975 --> 00:01:00,602
Did you wine and dine

10
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:03,104
Somang's coach to send her there?

11
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:06,941
That's a lot of work
just to harass one girl.

12
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:09,569
You must've strained your brain.

13
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:12,822
Isn't it humiliating?

14
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:16,284
I see. You want to fight
because of some girl.

15
00:01:17,952 --> 00:01:20,330
Whatever you two do,
just don't make it obvious to me.

16
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:22,874
And butt out.

17
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:27,504
Don't you mess with me again.

18
00:01:29,672 --> 00:01:31,466
I will if I have to.

19
00:01:36,554 --> 00:01:38,306
You're also doing this for some girl.

20
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:39,849
Your ex-girlfriend.

21
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:50,151
There are levels to hating someone.

22
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,153
How could you kick her out like this?

23
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:54,948
You're the scum of the earth, you loser.

24
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:56,157
Bastard…

25
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:01,579
What do you think you're doing?

26
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:08,920
EPISODE 5

27
00:02:09,003 --> 00:02:09,963
Seriously.

28
00:02:11,005 --> 00:02:12,966
Look at your faces.

29
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:14,342
Sorry, sir.

30
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:17,345
I have a temper too, you know.

31
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:21,266
How old are you that you're still
getting into fistfights?

32
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:24,769
You'll both have your pay docked
and get demerits.

33
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:27,272
You must be overflowing with energy.
Run 100 laps.

34
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:29,315
-Yes, sir.
-Don't want to.

35
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:34,112
-What?
-Dock my pay, give me demerits.

36
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:35,488
But I won't run any laps.

37
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:40,410
Hey, Junghwan. Hey! Kid!

38
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:43,746
Give me a break.

39
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,599
Junghwan says he hooked you up,

40
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:05,727
and you jumped at the chance to jump ship.

41
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:08,980
Explain what's going on.

42
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:13,109
She's going to Somang.
What is there to explain?

43
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:16,404
All she did here was ruin the team spirit.

44
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:19,240
Hey, you. You're quick.

45
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:21,492
Isn't it good for you if I leave?

46
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:27,665
None of you
can stand the sight of me anyway.

47
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:30,418
Wow. She's showing her true colors.

48
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:32,462
You seem to have a lot to say.

49
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:33,755
Hey, Taeyang.

50
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:36,674
Clean up the supply room. Now.

51
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:38,760
Do grunt work until you leave.

52
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:41,846
Don't think of stepping foot on our court.
Got it?

53
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,264
Okay.

54
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,563
This is a mandate.

55
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:53,358
Don't talk to Taeyang.

56
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,526
It's annoying.

57
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:57,862
-Okay.
-Okay.

58
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:18,466
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

59
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:23,805
YUK JUNGHWAN

60
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:25,598
Shoot.

61
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:28,977
I won't pick up.

62
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:31,729
I have my self-esteem.

63
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,399
I won't pick up. Nope.

64
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:37,735
Hello?

65
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:40,029
You scratched my car.

66
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:42,448
Shoot.

67
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:46,077
Shoot.

68
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:55,962
Do we… have to meet at a place like this?

69
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:58,881
-It's better than a police station.
-That's true.

70
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:01,759
What happened to your face?

71
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:03,886
Were you at the police station?

72
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:06,097
Here's the estimate.

73
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:09,017
It would show if I only fix the scratch,
so I'm repainting the hood.

74
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,895
You don't redo your entire makeup
just because your mascara runs.

75
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:16,441
How much is it?

76
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:23,865
Wow. Are you trying to profit from this?

77
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:25,700
Are you a scammer?

78
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:27,243
Although you wear the Korean flag?

79
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:28,786
Buy dinner if you don't want to pay.

80
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,747
Something expensive.
Then I'll call it even.

81
00:05:36,794 --> 00:05:37,879
Shoot.

82
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:48,681
-You have no friends, right?
-I have a lot.

83
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:52,101
Friends who envy your success
and use your sadness against you?

84
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:58,858
It's obvious you got into a big fight
with someone.

85
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:01,861
You're down and don't want to be alone.

86
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:04,238
That's why you called me.

87
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:09,327
You made me go to a body shop
just to have dinner?

88
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:10,828
Talk about being dramatic.

89
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:13,373
Sorry about last time.

90
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:20,213
What was the fight about?

91
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,258
You don't have to tell me.

92
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:30,848
Because I'm the scum of the earth.

93
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:37,021
Because I'm more disgusting
than I thought.

94
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:49,450
I'll go if you tell me to. Like last time.

95
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:50,368
PARK TAEYANG

96
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:57,792
-Hey. What are you doing?
-Let go.

97
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:02,505
You need to leave. Now.

98
00:07:05,049 --> 00:07:07,385
Tell me why you're doing this first.

99
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:10,012
Junyoung won't even answer my calls!

100
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:17,145
How could you smile when you won this?

101
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:20,898
When you were putting this
around your neck with a big smile,

102
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:22,692
Junyoung was sentenced to death.

103
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:26,696
Rehab failed. They can't operate again.

104
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:27,655
Her career is over!

105
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:31,325
What are you talking about?

106
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:34,412
Junyoung said she could do rehab--

107
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:36,956
Take this and get lost.

108
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:40,918
If you have a conscience,
you should retire too.

109
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:12,950
Junyoung! It's me!

110
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:16,913
Who is it?

111
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:19,916
Doesn't Junyoung live here?

112
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:21,584
She's out.

113
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:23,377
Okay.

114
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,600
You should've let her in.
She sounded like a close friend.

115
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:39,393
With the mood like this? What for?

116
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:43,147
Where did your sister go
without even taking her phone?

117
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:47,235
What does she mean, don't look for her?

118
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:51,656
What if she does something drastic?

119
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:54,659
Have some faith in your daughter.
You know what Junyoung's like.

120
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:58,371
Why did Junyoung have to get injured?

121
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:02,041
I won't be able to go on
if something happens to her.

122
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:08,756
Sorry.

123
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:12,635
I should've been the one who got injured.

124
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:17,223
My poor girl.

125
00:09:38,452 --> 00:09:39,287
YUK JUNGHWAN

126
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,163
Are you bitter? Is it hard?

127
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:43,708
If so, good.

128
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:49,088
Just…

129
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,550
leave quietly.

130
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:12,338
Wow. You're all grown up.
You're even training at night.

131
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:18,636
Go on. Let me watch.

132
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:20,513
You know I do the opposite
of what I'm told.

133
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:25,434
Okay. I'll just clean this up then.

134
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:47,998
Taejun.

135
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,293
Remember how

136
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:54,672
you let me go when I stole your bike

137
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:56,382
when we were kids?

138
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:00,678
You could never imagine

139
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:05,516
what opportunities that gave me
and how it changed my life.

140
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:10,771
You were good to me even when you were 12.

141
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:14,150
Are you going to the other team?

142
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,863
Yes. What a traitor, huh?

143
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:20,781
To avoid Junghwan?

144
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:25,286
No. Because I think
it'll be more comfortable there.

145
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:30,541
It's supposed to be a good opportunity,
and I can focus on playing badminton.

146
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:33,919
Don't tell me to overcome it
rather than avoid it--

147
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:36,756
You should avoid it if you can.
Why deal with it?

148
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:46,182
I said do what you want.

149
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:55,941
Taeyang.

150
00:12:57,568 --> 00:12:58,736
You can run away

151
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:02,198
if you're having a hard time.

152
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:04,867
It's okay.

153
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:16,212
Sorry.

154
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:19,048
Why are you smiling?

155
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:24,845
It's better than crying.

156
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:32,645
You should cry if you want to cry,
not smile.

157
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:34,647
Are you stupid?

158
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:46,992
Don't you have

159
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:49,995
anything else to say to me?

160
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:57,461
I don't think so.

161
00:13:58,712 --> 00:14:01,006
Why not? You should.

162
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:02,883
You're good at reading people.

163
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:09,181
Let's go out.

164
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:16,230
What?

165
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:18,941
Let's…

166
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:22,570
go out.

167
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:31,639
Let's go out.

168
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:35,726
Do you not like me?

169
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:37,895
That's not it.

170
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:40,272
Okay. You need time to think?

171
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:42,274
Why are you doing this?

172
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:45,069
Because I like you.

173
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:56,163
But I… So…

174
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,211
I've never gone out with anyone before.

175
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:05,172
Oh.

176
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:10,135
Well… Then it's about time.

177
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:15,140
A day is long enough
to think it over, right?

178
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:19,478
Mull it over for a day.

179
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:23,607
You…

180
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:26,402
like me too.

181
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:31,323
You're acting like a different person.

182
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:33,951
See you tomorrow.

183
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:49,675
What just happened?

184
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:10,779
I wonder if she's watching.

185
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:12,781
Yes.

186
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:17,536
Can you hear me?

187
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:22,124
Taeyang!

188
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:26,503
Give me a chance! I'll be good to you!

189
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:42,728
General.

190
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:46,106
Your previous owner says

191
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:49,401
he likes me.

192
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:31,819
Why are you just standing there? Let's go.

193
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:33,487
Let's get to work.

194
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:51,547
Look at this.
Why is a Somang Bank player here?

195
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:53,799
When are you leaving?

196
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:57,803
Are they paying you a lot?

197
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:01,640
Only top athletes follow the money.

198
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:02,891
So why are you…

199
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:09,231
Kids like you scare me the most.

200
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:13,110
People with nothing
who are filled with ambition.

201
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:16,029
Taeyang. I said not to step foot
on our court.

202
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:18,407
Clean the supply room.

203
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:20,284
Okay.

204
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:42,639
Coach.

205
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,185
Hey.

206
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:50,772
Did you make up your mind?

207
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:54,109
Yes.

208
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,165
Didn't you want

209
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:11,835
Taeyang to leave?

210
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:14,880
Now that she's actually leaving,

211
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:18,342
does that upset you too?

212
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:22,554
You're a real jerk.

213
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:24,473
What was that?

214
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:27,392
You trying to start something?

215
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:30,187
What's it to you
whether or not she leaves?

216
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:33,106
Have you ever treated her like a teammate?

217
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:36,318
All you did was make sure
she felt unwanted.

218
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:42,658
Only those who deserve to

219
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:46,828
can talk bad about others.

220
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:50,832
I'm dumbfounded.

221
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,043
What was that, punk?

222
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:55,754
Is that how you speak to a senior?

223
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:58,215
I only said what was right.

224
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:03,178
Hey. What's with the mood here?

225
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:04,763
Show him some respect.

226
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:07,015
Stay out of it.

227
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:08,976
Did you hear this punk?

228
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:11,228
I can't just let this slide.

229
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:14,564
Stop it.
Let's not start the day like this.

230
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:18,318
Look.
It's because the captain is like this.

231
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:21,947
It's because of you that they have
no respect for their seniors.

232
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:25,117
I get it. Now cut it out.

233
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:27,995
What a great world.

234
00:21:28,328 --> 00:21:29,913
It's easy being an athlete, isn't it?

235
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:33,917
Back in my day, I got beat up
by my seniors before I got to play.

236
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:36,795
If my senior slapped me on my face,
I turned the other cheek.

237
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:40,215
I see. You're only three years older,
and yet that's how it was?

238
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,260
But I won't let anyone hit me.

239
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:45,304
You little punk.

240
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:47,139
-Hey.
-Restrain yourself.

241
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:48,974
Are you nuts?

242
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:50,767
Let go. Are you nuts?

243
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:52,185
-Stop.
-Let go!

244
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:07,117
You'd be dead if it weren't for Seungwoo.

245
00:22:08,952 --> 00:22:09,995
Damn it.

246
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:22,549
I have one ironclad rule as a coach.

247
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:27,179
To give young athletes with potential
two chances.

248
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:31,600
Bringing you to our team was the first.

249
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:35,604
If you want to take back

250
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:38,940
your decision to go to Somang, you may.

251
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:42,110
That will be your second chance.

252
00:22:42,277 --> 00:22:43,362
This is your last chance.

253
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:49,659
If I go and regret it,

254
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:53,747
I'll tell myself I deserve
whatever abuse I get.

255
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:58,293
Sorry, Coach.

256
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:03,465
You're steadfast.

257
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:07,886
Okay, then. Pack your things
and leave quietly tonight.

258
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:11,056
-What?
-Saying goodbye to everyone

259
00:23:11,139 --> 00:23:13,433
will only make the mood awkward.

260
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:17,187
I'll take care of it,
so you should leave quietly.

261
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:21,817
Also, do you plan to continue
playing mixed doubles with Taejun?

262
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:25,320
Yes, since we can
even if we're on different teams--

263
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:27,364
Don't. It's out of spite.

264
00:23:27,447 --> 00:23:28,532
Disappointed? Tough.

265
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:32,327
But I should talk to Taejun about that--

266
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:35,288
I put you two together to help you adjust
to being on the team.

267
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:36,623
What's the point in continuing?

268
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:39,751
I only care about my athletes.

269
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:43,171
I couldn't care less
about your friendship.

270
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:47,676
Okay. I understand.

271
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:52,556
Okay, then.

272
00:24:00,188 --> 00:24:01,231
Cheers.

273
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:09,990
Congrats on returning
to the national team.

274
00:24:10,073 --> 00:24:11,908
Still, you and I should have a drink.

275
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:14,369
Yes. You know
I'm most sorry to you, right?

276
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:18,498
Sorry you have to suffer
because of a partner like me.

277
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:21,835
Junghwan. Don't cause trouble ever again.

278
00:24:22,836 --> 00:24:24,713
-We should go to the Olympics.
-Right.

279
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:26,465
Excuse me!

280
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:29,426
Yes?

281
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:34,806
He wants more radish.

282
00:24:35,056 --> 00:24:37,559
Lots of chili sauce, please.
National team level!

283
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:38,560
Okay.

284
00:24:40,228 --> 00:24:43,315
Hey. Please lower your voice. Relax.

285
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:45,984
I was being as polite as possible.

286
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:48,153
But it's scary.
Let's eat quietly and leave.

287
00:24:48,778 --> 00:24:52,282
Okay. Let's take it easy
and drink just ten of these.

288
00:24:52,365 --> 00:24:55,535
Excuse me! A bottle of soju each, please!

289
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:57,412
Please stop.

290
00:24:57,496 --> 00:25:00,332
Hey. A national team member
has to drink soju.

291
00:25:00,415 --> 00:25:02,209
I believe that's patriotism.

292
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:05,795
-Don't be a patriot.
-Come on.

293
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:07,047
-Let's drink.
-Here.

294
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:10,800
Also, tell me if you want anything else.
I'll order it.

295
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:11,843
Okay.

296
00:25:30,153 --> 00:25:31,029
TAEYANG

297
00:25:31,112 --> 00:25:32,572
Let's meet in front of the dorm.

298
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:40,455
What do you mean?

299
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:43,708
Why can't you be my mixed doubles partner?

300
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:51,007
We kissed.

301
00:25:52,842 --> 00:25:55,804
I can't be partners
with a guy that I've kissed.

302
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:57,347
That's all I'll think about.

303
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:00,016
Hey. What…

304
00:26:01,851 --> 00:26:04,396
See? You can't even make eye contact.

305
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,398
Can you concentrate on the matches?

306
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:09,859
Stop it. Aren't you embarrassed?

307
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:12,737
You're so…

308
00:26:13,321 --> 00:26:14,614
You're embarrassed too, right?

309
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:18,034
See? You shouldn't have crossed the line
with a partner.

310
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,372
Stop hitting me. I'm getting excited.

311
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:25,125
Take responsibility for seducing me.

312
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:27,836
Whatever. I don't owe you anything.

313
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:29,671
Yes, you do. You have my heart.

314
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:30,922
I never asked for it.

315
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:32,465
You stole it.

316
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:34,009
What the heck? How cringe.

317
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:38,430
Let go of me.

318
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:40,640
It's not easy

319
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:43,768
to let you go.

320
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:57,824
You don't want me as a boyfriend

321
00:26:57,907 --> 00:26:59,242
or as a partner.

322
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:01,703
You rejected me twice, right?

323
00:27:03,246 --> 00:27:05,206
Do you really like me?

324
00:27:05,915 --> 00:27:08,043
Why? Give me three reasons.

325
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:10,712
One. You're cool.

326
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:13,673
Two. You're a better person than I am.

327
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:16,843
Three. I want to go out with someone
better than me.

328
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:20,388
What an ambitious guy.

329
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:25,226
I must be greedy when it comes to girls.

330
00:27:45,705 --> 00:27:47,666
I'm leaving the dorm now.

331
00:27:48,249 --> 00:27:50,877
Wow. You're full of surprises today.

332
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,048
You're leaving now? So suddenly?

333
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:58,134
Coach told me to leave quietly.

334
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:01,012
Taejun.

335
00:28:02,972 --> 00:28:07,185
If I were to worry about my love life
in the midst of everything,

336
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:09,270
that would make me a total psycho, right?

337
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:12,607
I mean, look at my situation.

338
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:19,197
I really…

339
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:23,910
I really, really mean it.

340
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:28,289
That was the first time
someone said they liked me.

341
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:32,127
And the fact that it was you…

342
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:35,630
is kind of exciting.

343
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:41,594
An opportunity like this
doesn't come every day.

344
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:43,680
I want to grab it.

345
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:46,182
But…

346
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:50,603
I don't have the courage to yet.

347
00:28:58,570 --> 00:28:59,863
I'll wait.

348
00:29:01,364 --> 00:29:02,449
Don't.

349
00:29:04,325 --> 00:29:05,702
I say this now,

350
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:09,414
but I may fall for another girl.

351
00:29:15,628 --> 00:29:16,713
Taejun.

352
00:29:17,338 --> 00:29:20,884
It was really fun playing with you.

353
00:29:23,803 --> 00:29:26,723
I guess you won't be next to me

354
00:29:27,348 --> 00:29:28,641
or behind me anymore.

355
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:33,313
So…

356
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:37,692
How about we always meet
on weekends, national holidays,

357
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:40,069
and Christmas?

358
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:42,447
During the first snowfall too.

359
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:47,494
Let's go out.

360
00:30:05,553 --> 00:30:07,055
This isn't the time for this.

361
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:10,016
Get it together.

362
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:30,370
Later.

363
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:42,340
Good luck, Taeyang!

364
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:44,551
I hope you do well there.

365
00:30:46,636 --> 00:30:48,680
We should've at least become friends.

366
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:52,433
Don't worry, friend. Good luck to you too!

367
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:03,027
I was rejected.

368
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:06,614
I lost out.

369
00:31:15,748 --> 00:31:19,752
JINCHEON NATIONAL TRAINING CENTER

370
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:23,381
One. Two. Three.

371
00:31:24,632 --> 00:31:25,842
Let's take five.

372
00:31:26,092 --> 00:31:27,302
-Break time.
-Take a break.

373
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:28,386
Stretch it out.

374
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:35,143
Junghwan, did you drink last night?

375
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:37,520
You're sweating a lot today.

376
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:40,607
You even check whether or not I sweat now?

377
00:31:40,815 --> 00:31:41,774
That's awkward.

378
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:45,653
I see. You must not remember last night.

379
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:48,740
Everyone in Korea knows
you drank last night.

380
00:31:48,823 --> 00:31:50,116
What kind of bull is that?

381
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:54,579
Hyukbong. Did something happen last night?

382
00:31:55,204 --> 00:31:56,372
Gosh.

383
00:31:58,541 --> 00:31:59,667
Sorry.

384
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:03,254
What is it? I blacked out…

385
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:05,506
LAST NIGHT

386
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:09,761
Whoever is still awake wins.

387
00:32:09,844 --> 00:32:11,095
Why?

388
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:15,350
Because I'm going to do a livestream.

389
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:18,811
Hey, hey, hey.

390
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:21,356
I'm remembering something right now.
It's not real, right?

391
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:25,693
No way. It must've been a dream.
Yes, it was a dream.

392
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:28,488
Right? It was a dream, right?
Yes, a dream.

393
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:30,573
It was a dream…

394
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:38,790
When I was a kid, I was super frail.

395
00:32:38,873 --> 00:32:40,500
That was why I picked up sports.

396
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:42,168
Everyone laughed at me,

397
00:32:42,251 --> 00:32:45,588
but I laughed at the punks
who laughed at me.

398
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:47,340
That's how awesome I am.

399
00:32:47,423 --> 00:32:52,387
Once I focused on myself
and overcame myself,

400
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:55,014
I truly became Yuk Junghwan!

401
00:32:58,851 --> 00:33:00,687
It was a really hard journey.

402
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:05,733
No. I take it all back.

403
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:08,528
I didn't have squat,
so I needed to have a dream at least.

404
00:33:08,611 --> 00:33:09,904
You know me.

405
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:18,246
What comes next?

406
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:20,540
Shoot. I can't remember.

407
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:21,874
She…

408
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:24,544
bought me this.

409
00:33:24,627 --> 00:33:26,838
I suddenly miss her.

410
00:33:26,921 --> 00:33:30,299
Are you watching?

411
00:33:30,383 --> 00:33:32,301
How are you doing?

412
00:33:32,635 --> 00:33:35,722
Nothing

413
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:39,851
Has changed

414
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:45,940
I've changed

415
00:33:47,775 --> 00:33:49,902
As much as I did before

416
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:53,406
Junghwan! I'm sorry!

417
00:33:54,782 --> 00:33:57,201
YUK JUNGHWAN WAILING,
YUK JUNGHWAN PLASTERED

418
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:59,287
YUK JUNGHWAN'S EX-GIRLFRIEND

419
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:01,998
BOYS BE AMBITIOUS,
YUK JUNGHWAN'S EDUCATION

420
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:06,502
Seriously.

421
00:34:08,921 --> 00:34:10,298
Did I really lose my mind?

422
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:14,552
Is it a reporter?

423
00:34:23,853 --> 00:34:24,854
Hello?

424
00:34:28,858 --> 00:34:29,692
Taejun?

425
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:32,320
You idiot!

426
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:42,580
This is so annoying.

427
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:47,335
YUMIN

428
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:49,045
Why did I have to drink?

429
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:50,588
Is he busy?

430
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:52,632
I need to talk to him.

431
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:55,968
YUK JUNGHWAN

432
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:57,220
Let's go eat.

433
00:34:57,303 --> 00:34:58,346
Okay.

434
00:35:02,683 --> 00:35:03,643
Hey.

435
00:35:04,727 --> 00:35:06,521
What do you think about our coach?

436
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:09,148
What's there to think about?
He's a douchebag.

437
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:11,109
Even if he sees us

438
00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:14,278
as objects to use for the team
and not as human beings,

439
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:16,989
he should at least let us play badminton.

440
00:35:17,573 --> 00:35:18,533
What do you mean?

441
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:23,496
SOMANG BANK

442
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:26,374
There are plenty of other players
with potential.

443
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:28,417
Are you really bringing Park Taeyang?

444
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:29,877
Park Taeyang?

445
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:32,213
I have a use for her.

446
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,756
She's well-known.

447
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,633
She still has use left in her.

448
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:45,059
I try not to criticize coaches
because my dad's one,

449
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,228
but he's a scumbag.

450
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:57,738
How could she leave
without even saying bye?

451
00:35:58,322 --> 00:36:01,075
I told Taeyang to leave quietly.

452
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:05,329
Anyway, this isn't the time
to talk about someone else's life.

453
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:07,290
You know the company league starts soon.

454
00:36:07,957 --> 00:36:11,377
The company has high hopes for you
for this season…

455
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:12,962
Not.

456
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:23,806
They're wondering how long
they have to feed

457
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:25,391
this team of an unpopular sport.

458
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:28,644
We must protect our livelihood.

459
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:32,982
Let's show them our worth! All right!

460
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:36,944
Why are you all quiet?

461
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:39,197
-Let's do it!
-Let's do it.

462
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,448
-Let's do it.
-Let's do it.

463
00:36:41,407 --> 00:36:45,453
Well, our goal is for us
to come in first in the team competition.

464
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:48,581
The company league
is an important tournament.

465
00:36:48,664 --> 00:36:50,750
Will we get a chance?

466
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:53,377
The national team members are a given.

467
00:36:53,669 --> 00:36:57,840
Youngsim and Captain will compete.
Isn't that right?

468
00:36:58,341 --> 00:37:01,135
Try hard if you don't want to be
a benchwarmer.

469
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:03,638
Naturally,
whoever does well will get to compete.

470
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:06,807
What nonsense is that
about giving you a chance?

471
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:08,392
Coach Joo, you had something to say.

472
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:12,021
-Pardon?
-You tell them.

473
00:37:13,522 --> 00:37:14,899
What? Me?

474
00:37:14,982 --> 00:37:16,984
-Please.
-Coach. But…

475
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:18,986
-Have a nice day.
-You too.

476
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:34,293
-Taejun and Seungwoo.
-Yes, sir.

477
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:36,587
You'll start special training today.

478
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:38,923
Go to the training room.

479
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:41,592
So…

480
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:43,719
You're dismissed!

481
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:46,222
-Dismissed.
-Dismissed.

482
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:49,225
Dismissed.

483
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:52,270
-Dongwan.
-Forget it.

484
00:37:58,526 --> 00:37:59,485
Hi.

485
00:38:00,236 --> 00:38:01,195
Here.

486
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:06,242
I'll get you in shape for the tournament,
so work with me.

487
00:38:06,742 --> 00:38:07,868
Yes, sir.

488
00:38:09,161 --> 00:38:10,579
I have a serious comment to make.

489
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:15,001
Can I not do the special training?

490
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:17,003
I'm going through a hard time.

491
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:19,839
I'm too mentally unstable

492
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:22,341
to bear the weight of the team's fate.

493
00:38:25,761 --> 00:38:27,847
I'm lethargy personified.

494
00:38:28,931 --> 00:38:31,100
Why? Is something wrong?

495
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:34,437
I was rejected by a girl.

496
00:38:36,939 --> 00:38:37,982
Oh.

497
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:41,694
Come on. A little more!

498
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:44,280
A little more!

499
00:38:45,072 --> 00:38:46,949
-A little more!
-A little more!

500
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:49,327
Let's take five!

501
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:51,454
Yes!

502
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:54,582
You're looking good today.

503
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:58,169
Did you hear from her or something?

504
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:01,005
Why did you say that?

505
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:02,673
I'm trying

506
00:39:03,257 --> 00:39:05,301
so hard to forget her!

507
00:39:14,101 --> 00:39:15,519
Why'd you stop?

508
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:17,313
What's the use in jumping over this?

509
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:22,610
It'll help your jumping skills
and improve agility and reflexes--

510
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:24,028
What use is any of that?

511
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:26,572
Agility and reflexes? Whatever.

512
00:39:26,655 --> 00:39:27,698
I can't even get a girl.

513
00:39:31,118 --> 00:39:33,454
Don't piss him off. You'll regret it.

514
00:39:34,121 --> 00:39:35,331
I warned you.

515
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:40,419
Diagonal court dashes. Go!

516
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:47,301
Faster.

517
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:50,304
Faster. Run.

518
00:39:52,014 --> 00:39:54,183
I should take today off.

519
00:39:56,018 --> 00:39:58,104
What now? What is it this time?

520
00:40:02,316 --> 00:40:03,150
You know.

521
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:04,652
No, I don't!

522
00:40:07,279 --> 00:40:08,531
Mr. Sibong!

523
00:40:10,324 --> 00:40:11,283
What is it?

524
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:12,618
My phone's ringing.

525
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:17,748
It's spam.

526
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:21,293
I'm going to take a break.

527
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:36,142
Mr. Sibong did judo competitively.

528
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:38,769
"Get them in shape no matter what!"

529
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,689
The coach yells at me.
The assistant coach is on my case.

530
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:42,982
The athletes are exhausted.

531
00:40:43,065 --> 00:40:46,360
I'm sacrificing my health and enduring
body aches to put up with it.

532
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:48,904
But you're whining about your love life?

533
00:40:48,988 --> 00:40:50,156
You punk.

534
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:52,366
How about I kill you?

535
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:14,889
Sorry. My bad.

536
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:27,401
Why do they laugh every time they miss?

537
00:41:28,694 --> 00:41:29,945
How fascinating.

538
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:40,706
He was being so pushy,
but not a single phone call?

539
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:44,710
Did he fall for another girl already?

540
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:02,394
Hi, Dad.

541
00:42:02,978 --> 00:42:04,605
Somang called.

542
00:42:04,813 --> 00:42:07,733
They want to see you tomorrow
and give us the draft contract.

543
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:11,237
Okay.

544
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:15,533
I heard it myself.

545
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:18,577
I wanted to ignore it,

546
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:20,454
but that's just wrong.

547
00:42:22,331 --> 00:42:23,165
Right?

548
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:28,337
Our coach wants to use her
as just a marketing panhandler.

549
00:42:29,004 --> 00:42:30,756
He doesn't see her as an athlete.

550
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:32,925
So? What do you want from me?

551
00:42:34,134 --> 00:42:36,428
She left already. It's out of my hands.

552
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:38,764
-Dad.
-Shoot.

553
00:42:39,598 --> 00:42:40,558
What was that about?

554
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:41,892
So…

555
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:57,658
It looks good overall,

556
00:42:58,450 --> 00:43:01,203
but if there's a conflict
in the interpretation of the contract,

557
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:02,788
the company's interpretation prevails?

558
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:07,167
For anything not stated in the contract,
she must follow the company's orders.

559
00:43:08,127 --> 00:43:09,545
This is a bit…

560
00:43:09,628 --> 00:43:13,716
She must do as the company says
regarding anything important.

561
00:43:13,799 --> 00:43:15,467
So it's a slave contract, is that it?

562
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:18,387
Well, I wouldn't go that far.

563
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:21,473
The contract is just a formality,
so don't worry about it.

564
00:43:22,349 --> 00:43:24,226
Taeyang, do you like doing volunteer work?

565
00:43:25,144 --> 00:43:26,228
Excuse me?

566
00:43:26,812 --> 00:43:30,566
I'd like you to work hard for the team
when you first join.

567
00:43:30,983 --> 00:43:34,486
Like one-day classes that we host
or donating your talent.

568
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:37,573
We give private lessons
to Somang Bank's VIP clients.

569
00:43:37,656 --> 00:43:39,867
They'd line up around the block

570
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:42,077
if they heard
Park Taeyang was the instructor.

571
00:43:43,203 --> 00:43:45,122
Anyone who knows a little about badminton

572
00:43:45,205 --> 00:43:47,291
would wonder how she's doing.

573
00:43:57,509 --> 00:43:59,637
I understand what you mean.

574
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:02,514
I'll look it over and let you know.

575
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:11,607
They're bastards.

576
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:14,276
Will they even let you play badminton?

577
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:17,655
What a despicable slave contract.

578
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:21,075
Forget them. I'll find another team.

579
00:44:21,158 --> 00:44:22,368
Which team?

580
00:44:23,994 --> 00:44:25,704
Even when I first came back,

581
00:44:25,788 --> 00:44:28,165
Yunis was the only one that took me in.

582
00:44:28,248 --> 00:44:31,377
You have plenty of options.
Think of all that you've accomplished.

583
00:44:32,378 --> 00:44:35,714
Prodigy Park Taeyang.
They don't call just anyone that.

584
00:44:37,925 --> 00:44:41,136
Nothing's working out
because you have no confidence.

585
00:44:44,014 --> 00:44:46,141
They want to use you
as a publicity mascot.

586
00:44:46,225 --> 00:44:47,643
If you had any self-respect,

587
00:44:47,726 --> 00:44:51,355
you'd muster up whatever remnants of pride
you had remaining.

588
00:44:54,108 --> 00:44:57,403
At least pretend to listen
when someone talks to you.

589
00:44:58,737 --> 00:44:59,988
Seriously.

590
00:45:01,407 --> 00:45:02,991
Are you mad at me?

591
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:06,954
You know the crap I went through
to raise you.

592
00:45:14,962 --> 00:45:16,004
I know.

593
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:19,258
Your dream and goal in life
is to make me a star.

594
00:45:19,341 --> 00:45:21,677
That I'm not your daughter
unless I play badminton.

595
00:45:22,803 --> 00:45:25,264
That was why you didn't even text once
for three years.

596
00:45:31,311 --> 00:45:32,521
If not for Mom,

597
00:45:33,814 --> 00:45:35,858
you wouldn't have contacted me.

598
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:41,613
WELCOME

599
00:46:09,141 --> 00:46:13,395
DAD

600
00:46:21,487 --> 00:46:22,654
Dad.

601
00:46:23,238 --> 00:46:26,492
How are you doing?

602
00:46:29,077 --> 00:46:30,329
Mom…

603
00:46:32,164 --> 00:46:33,290
is very sick.

604
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:39,087
I know she wasn't nice to you,
but she did raise you.

605
00:46:42,132 --> 00:46:43,258
Where are you?

606
00:46:49,389 --> 00:46:53,727
FUNERAL HOME

607
00:47:26,134 --> 00:47:27,302
I'll play

608
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:30,347
badminton again.

609
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:34,601
I'll work…

610
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:39,815
I'll work hard.

611
00:47:57,374 --> 00:47:58,375
Dad.

612
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:00,878
I like badminton.

613
00:48:01,461 --> 00:48:03,589
What else do I have in my life?

614
00:48:03,672 --> 00:48:05,674
I want to do well too.

615
00:48:05,757 --> 00:48:08,969
I don't care
whether it's your dream or mine.

616
00:48:09,052 --> 00:48:11,930
I just have to do well, so…

617
00:48:14,641 --> 00:48:16,143
I just want to do well.

618
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:23,942
I'll go to Somang.

619
00:48:24,776 --> 00:48:28,363
I don't care how they use me.
I'll just work hard.

620
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:31,408
I'm good at working hard.

621
00:48:36,204 --> 00:48:37,581
I made myself clear.

622
00:48:39,041 --> 00:48:41,168
I don't want
to keep feeling so small all the time.

623
00:48:41,251 --> 00:48:42,294
I'll join Somang.

624
00:48:44,087 --> 00:48:46,590
I'll join Somang.

625
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:22,000
To think, I came to the national team
training center for a girl.

626
00:49:22,084 --> 00:49:23,794
Was our fight last time
not enough for you?

627
00:49:23,877 --> 00:49:25,128
Let me ask you something.

628
00:49:26,672 --> 00:49:30,050
Did you know what Somang's coach
planned to do with Taeyang?

629
00:49:30,884 --> 00:49:32,928
Or was it your plan all along?

630
00:49:33,512 --> 00:49:35,722
To use her as a marketing panhandler?

631
00:49:38,266 --> 00:49:39,434
A panhandler?

632
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,563
If you planned it, undo it.

633
00:49:44,564 --> 00:49:48,068
Even if you didn't know, undo it.

634
00:49:48,944 --> 00:49:50,195
Are you sure?

635
00:49:50,278 --> 00:49:51,863
You sent her there not knowing that?

636
00:49:52,781 --> 00:49:56,243
Do you know how to live without badminton?

637
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:58,286
I don't.

638
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:01,748
You know that to an athlete,
their sport is everything.

639
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:03,750
How could you? She's also an athlete.

640
00:50:04,793 --> 00:50:07,879
Leave. I have no idea
what you're talking about.

641
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:10,966
Plus, I couldn't care less
what happens to her.

642
00:50:12,634 --> 00:50:14,970
You need to care before I get angry.

643
00:50:15,053 --> 00:50:18,306
I don't want to fight.
I can't cause trouble.

644
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:23,687
So get lost.

645
00:50:26,565 --> 00:50:28,150
Please do this for me!

646
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:34,281
Asking you of all people for a favor…

647
00:50:37,993 --> 00:50:39,494
isn't easy for me.

648
00:50:40,245 --> 00:50:41,621
Then don't do it.

649
00:50:44,166 --> 00:50:46,710
-Don't.
-I need to do something.

650
00:50:49,421 --> 00:50:51,673
I feel like crap

651
00:50:53,008 --> 00:50:55,093
that I can't help her.

652
00:50:56,845 --> 00:50:59,389
You'd know
if you ever truly liked someone.

653
00:50:59,473 --> 00:51:01,808
Why are you telling me
about your feelings for her?

654
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:05,145
Go and tell her. She'd be happy.

655
00:51:05,228 --> 00:51:06,521
I did, but she rejected me.

656
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:09,357
Yet, I'm still doing this.

657
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:12,861
In case she falls apart.

658
00:51:17,407 --> 00:51:21,453
Our coach hasn't processed
her resignation yet.

659
00:51:21,536 --> 00:51:22,788
But

660
00:51:23,872 --> 00:51:25,707
he won't listen to me, obviously.

661
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,836
You started it, so explain the situation

662
00:51:30,504 --> 00:51:32,214
and persuade him.

663
00:51:32,964 --> 00:51:34,591
Let's bring Taeyang back.

664
00:51:37,511 --> 00:51:38,887
Please help me.

665
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:51,399
PARK TAEYANG

666
00:52:14,714 --> 00:52:16,633
I'll meet with Coach tomorrow.

667
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:21,471
Why hasn't he called?

668
00:52:30,397 --> 00:52:32,357
You've been calling me a lot lately.

669
00:52:34,609 --> 00:52:37,696
Took you long enough to show up.
Go and do what you came to do.

670
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:41,533
Is that how you ask for a favor?
You're still acting proud.

671
00:52:42,951 --> 00:52:43,869
Hey.

672
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:45,829
I was worried you might've forgot.

673
00:52:47,205 --> 00:52:50,542
You're doing a favor for me.
I can't have you die of humiliation.

674
00:52:54,963 --> 00:52:57,549
Why would I do what you ask
when you act like this?

675
00:52:58,383 --> 00:52:59,301
Hey!

676
00:53:00,343 --> 00:53:02,345
What are you two doing here?

677
00:53:20,906 --> 00:53:23,825
Did you think about the TV show
I mentioned?

678
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:27,454
It'll be a contract violation
if I refuse, right?

679
00:53:28,288 --> 00:53:29,748
Section 8.5.

680
00:53:30,457 --> 00:53:32,459
"If the company requests
the athlete's attendance,

681
00:53:32,542 --> 00:53:34,169
the athlete must comply."

682
00:53:35,462 --> 00:53:37,088
I'll have to do whatever the team says.

683
00:53:38,298 --> 00:53:40,342
You didn't sign here.

684
00:53:43,428 --> 00:53:45,013
This is the last one, right?

685
00:53:50,852 --> 00:53:52,103
What are you doing?

686
00:53:56,191 --> 00:53:57,067
Hi there.

687
00:53:58,985 --> 00:54:00,278
You're not saying hi back.

688
00:54:01,321 --> 00:54:04,157
You're still working for us, you know.

689
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:09,537
You bastard.

690
00:54:14,167 --> 00:54:17,254
Do you want to go to court?
Can you afford it?

691
00:54:18,338 --> 00:54:19,839
No, I can't.

692
00:54:20,966 --> 00:54:22,008
Then

693
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:24,719
come with me.

694
00:54:28,056 --> 00:54:30,183
You can't steal my athlete
behind my back like this!

695
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:34,229
What? I thought her contract
was terminated already.

696
00:54:34,312 --> 00:54:37,190
No, it was not terminated,
so give up on her.

697
00:54:41,736 --> 00:54:43,238
Let's get soju sometime.

698
00:54:48,076 --> 00:54:49,494
Don't just sit there, get up!

699
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:54,457
You're still my athlete.

700
00:55:07,512 --> 00:55:09,180
You're my athlete.

701
00:55:31,745 --> 00:55:32,787
Hush.

702
00:55:33,913 --> 00:55:36,041
How is an athlete so frail?

703
00:55:38,543 --> 00:55:41,087
Your hand is just so warm.

704
00:55:52,057 --> 00:55:54,059
You know my ironclad rule
as a coach, right?

705
00:55:55,268 --> 00:55:57,729
I give two chances
to young athletes with potential.

706
00:55:57,812 --> 00:56:00,231
You've used up your second chance today.

707
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:05,570
How many times do you offer
that second chance?

708
00:56:07,739 --> 00:56:08,865
Well…

709
00:56:11,868 --> 00:56:13,995
Anyway, I won't show mercy anymore.

710
00:56:14,579 --> 00:56:17,082
You'll be penalized for the days
you were out.

711
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:19,125
I'll dock your pay or something.

712
00:56:21,127 --> 00:56:22,295
Yes, Coach.

713
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:23,630
Come tomorrow morning.

714
00:56:24,923 --> 00:56:25,924
Dismissed.

715
00:56:26,549 --> 00:56:28,468
That's right. I came. Bye.

716
00:56:37,936 --> 00:56:39,145
I've been saved.

717
00:56:58,164 --> 00:57:01,709
How are you doing?
Can we meet if you have time?

718
00:57:06,714 --> 00:57:08,216
Let's meet at that fountain.

719
00:57:33,408 --> 00:57:34,701
Did you wait long?

720
00:57:40,248 --> 00:57:43,751
You must be very busy.
You didn't contact me once.

721
00:57:45,003 --> 00:57:48,548
You try being rejected.
It's not easy to reach out first.

722
00:57:53,595 --> 00:57:56,181
Anyway, did you decide to join Somang?

723
00:57:56,556 --> 00:57:57,640
Are the teammates nice?

724
00:57:58,391 --> 00:58:00,018
Oh, that?

725
00:58:02,103 --> 00:58:05,440
I've had a change of heart.

726
00:58:06,983 --> 00:58:09,277
I may remain at Yunis.

727
00:58:11,779 --> 00:58:12,697
Really?

728
00:58:13,781 --> 00:58:14,782
That's good.

729
00:58:19,037 --> 00:58:20,455
Should I go to Somang?

730
00:58:21,706 --> 00:58:23,041
Should I sign the contract?

731
00:58:23,708 --> 00:58:25,126
Up to you. You're not back for me.

732
00:58:28,004 --> 00:58:30,965
Wait. Did you come back for me?

733
00:58:31,132 --> 00:58:33,134
I may leave again because of you.

734
00:58:33,635 --> 00:58:35,345
What's with the reaction? Are you unhappy?

735
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:38,723
I guess your feelings have changed

736
00:58:39,891 --> 00:58:41,267
in the past few days.

737
00:58:41,851 --> 00:58:42,685
What feelings?

738
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:46,314
What?

739
00:58:51,569 --> 00:58:53,404
That…

740
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:56,157
That what?

741
00:58:57,075 --> 00:58:58,576
That…

742
00:58:59,452 --> 00:59:02,997
That… which both you and I know.

743
00:59:07,126 --> 00:59:08,962
-Why are you laughing?
-Because you're cute.

744
00:59:10,713 --> 00:59:12,298
-Why'd you hit me?
-You're annoying.

745
00:59:15,635 --> 00:59:17,512
Why are you laughing again?

746
00:59:17,595 --> 00:59:18,972
Because I'm happy.

747
00:59:20,014 --> 00:59:22,559
-Why do you keep hitting me?
-In case I start liking you.

748
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:43,788
Taeyang, know something?
This is the first snowfall.

749
01:00:07,729 --> 01:00:09,105
I'm glad it's snowing.

750
01:00:11,899 --> 01:00:13,192
I'm even happier

751
01:00:15,153 --> 01:00:16,321
that you're back.

752
01:00:18,364 --> 01:00:21,826
I'm so very happy!

753
01:01:14,128 --> 01:01:16,047
GOING TO YOU AT A SPEED OF 493KM

754
01:01:16,130 --> 01:01:17,799
Wait for me, my sun!

755
01:01:17,882 --> 01:01:18,925
Taeyang!

756
01:01:19,717 --> 01:01:21,844
Are you ready to be humble?

757
01:01:21,928 --> 01:01:23,388
I'm ready to be humble.

758
01:01:23,971 --> 01:01:26,391
I betrayed you and came back!

759
01:01:27,183 --> 01:01:30,603
We'll choose who participates
in the tournament through tests.

760
01:01:30,687 --> 01:01:33,439
Please do your best for Yunis.

761
01:01:33,523 --> 01:01:35,358
Let's win the team competition!

762
01:01:35,441 --> 01:01:36,693
Yes!

763
01:01:37,193 --> 01:01:38,611
Let's go. I made a reservation.

764
01:01:38,695 --> 01:01:40,697
Nice. A restaurant
that requires reservations.

765
01:01:40,863 --> 01:01:42,699
Hi. It's Junyoung.

766
01:01:53,876 --> 01:01:55,002
GOING TO YOU AT A SPEED OF 493KM

767
01:01:55,086 --> 01:01:57,088
