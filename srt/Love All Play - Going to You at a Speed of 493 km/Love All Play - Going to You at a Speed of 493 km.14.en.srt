1
00:00:37,787 --> 00:00:40,790
GOING TO YOU AT A SPEED OF 493KM

2
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,586
THE PLACES, PEOPLE, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTIONAL

3
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:47,964
EPISODE 14

4
00:00:49,632 --> 00:00:52,802
I see you're okay now,
so I'd better get going.

5
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:54,971
You're just going to leave?

6
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:59,059
You should also… get some rest.

7
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:00,477
I mean…

8
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:05,106
And I trained all day today,
so I'd like to get some rest too.

9
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:07,984
Lie down.

10
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:11,029
Make sure to eat well.

11
00:01:11,654 --> 00:01:14,616
You should take this seriously,
or else you could get really sick.

12
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:18,078
You're so worried about me.

13
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:22,165
Maybe I'm still not over you.

14
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:29,839
I mean, look.

15
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:34,677
What am I supposed to do
when I just can't help myself?

16
00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:40,308
So I'll keep on worrying about you.

17
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:44,562
Get well soon, Taejun.

18
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:49,734
I'm not over you either.

19
00:01:57,033 --> 00:01:58,660
Thanks for coming by.

20
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:01,204
And for worrying about me.

21
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:27,063
You know that
your contract ends soon, right?

22
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:34,445
I do.

23
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,700
About your contract…

24
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,996
We won't be able to renew it.

25
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:48,960
So, if you want,

26
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:52,463
I could find out if there are
any spots open on other teams.

27
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:53,965
No, thank you.

28
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:59,762
I had always considered
Yunis to be my last team.

29
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:02,849
Okay. Well…

30
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:04,726
You've done more than enough.

31
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:09,439
Gosh. Even so,
you must be a bit disappointed.

32
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:16,654
I'm sorry.

33
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:24,662
I thought I'd get to play
for one more year.

34
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:33,254
Thank you for everything.

35
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:40,678
Goodness.

36
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:51,940
It's not a big deal, right?

37
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:55,818
You could say it's a big deal
or it's not that big of a deal.

38
00:03:57,612 --> 00:03:58,863
Just come right out with it.

39
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,785
I…

40
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:06,246
can continue to play, right?

41
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:08,289
-Do you want to?
-Yes.

42
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:13,753
You don't have to worry too much
at this stage,

43
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:16,714
but if you want to keep playing
for a long time

44
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:19,342
let's focus on rehabilitation for now.

45
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:22,428
And keep coming to the hospital.

46
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:27,517
What took you so long
to tell me the good news?

47
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:31,271
But I have a tournament coming up.

48
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:35,191
It'll become chronic
if you strain yourself,

49
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,735
and if it ruptures,
surgery will be your only option.

50
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:40,154
You might never get to play then.
You know this, right?

51
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:43,491
Skip the tournament.

52
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:48,371
If you don't listen to me,
I'll ki… yell at you!

53
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:51,499
I feel fine though.

54
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:57,297
Doctor, I'll do as you say.

55
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:00,133
Just please don't tell my family.

56
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:02,260
What?

57
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:04,846
If people around me
start worrying too much,

58
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:06,764
it'll get tiring.

59
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:10,810
I agree. That is tiring.

60
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:25,158
What did she say?
It's nothing serious, right?

61
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,535
I'll just have to do some rehab.

62
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:29,329
And the tournament?

63
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:32,707
You know. She said we can decide
after seeing how it progresses.

64
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:33,833
The usual stuff.

65
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:36,711
Why do you keep coming?
It makes me uncomfortable.

66
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:39,130
What? The least you can do is thank me.

67
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:40,631
Hey, Jiho.

68
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:43,843
Taejun. What room are you in?
Are you still in the hospital?

69
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:46,220
You don't have to come. I'm leaving now.

70
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:48,890
-Wait. I'm inside the elevator.
-What? You're here already?

71
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:50,350
I'll be there in ten seconds.

72
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:52,602
You didn't have to… Hold on.

73
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:55,313
Hide. Quick.

74
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,648
-What?
-A teammate of mine is coming.

75
00:05:57,732 --> 00:05:58,858
Pretend you don't know me.

76
00:06:00,401 --> 00:06:02,236
Hey, are you ashamed of me?

77
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,196
Yes, I am.

78
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:05,490
I'm not your brother.
We're total strangers.

79
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:08,701
-Taejun!
-Hey, Jiho!

80
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:10,620
You came all the way here.

81
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:13,581
Taejun, have you been discharged?
Then come with me.

82
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:14,791
Where to?

83
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:18,378
Listen. We got today off
for doing the fitness test yesterday.

84
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:19,379
On this special day,

85
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:21,464
do you know what Taeyang
and the girls are doing?

86
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:23,508
What are they doing?

87
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:26,344
Going on a group date.
And it's with soccer players.

88
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:29,013
Really! Are you just going to sit around
and let this happen?

89
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:33,643
Are you?

90
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,980
Okay. There you go.

91
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:40,817
Eyes. Look up.

92
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:43,986
Here too.

93
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:48,116
Gosh, you look pretty.

94
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:50,410
Am I all set?

95
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:51,619
Not so fast.

96
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:54,747
Why can't you just stay still
for five minutes?

97
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:57,125
Do you think it's easy to become pretty?

98
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:59,669
Anyway, go like this with your lips.

99
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:02,380
I want to be kissed by you

100
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:04,173
Wait. I can do it myself.

101
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:07,009
I'm too excited, right?

102
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:12,557
-Like this?
-Yes, they're getting moist.

103
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:14,183
I can feel it.

104
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:16,352
Remember, girls.

105
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:19,188
Today, you're not an athlete.
You're totally…

106
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:21,816
a woman.

107
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:26,821
Honestly, if it weren't for me,
how would you meet the Hanil soccer team?

108
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:28,281
By joining their fan club?

109
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:30,575
Or by running into them
at a convenience store out front?

110
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:32,994
You guys need to be grateful.

111
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:37,123
I know! You're a senior like no other.

112
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,625
I'm totally seeing you in a new light.

113
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:40,918
You're so well-connected.

114
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:45,339
But why am I getting so nervous?

115
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:48,134
How long has it been
since I went on a group date?

116
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:49,510
What if I meet the one?

117
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:52,638
Sungsil, you seem very excited.

118
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:56,184
But is it okay
for you to take part in this?

119
00:07:57,059 --> 00:07:59,562
Well, you're going too.

120
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:01,647
There's no reason for me not to go.

121
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:05,109
Why? Why wouldn't it be okay?

122
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:08,362
Do you have a boyfriend?

123
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:13,075
-So today's your first time?
-Yes, it's my first group date.

124
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:14,494
-Oh, really?
-Yes.

125
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:16,746
-Gosh.
-Are badminton players all this pretty?

126
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:20,082
We only put on some BB cream.

127
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:23,753
But do you not mind dating an athlete?

128
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:25,671
Well, it depends.

129
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:28,341
Athletes can better understand each other.

130
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:29,926
Yes, that's true.

131
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:32,803
Normal people can't understand
the way we live.

132
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:34,347
No, they can't.

133
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:38,434
Athletes are the best.

134
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:39,644
That's true.

135
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:42,480
But on co-ed teams,

136
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:44,440
don't teammates date each other?

137
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:48,236
Come on. A man holding a racket
isn't a real man.

138
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:49,195
A real man

139
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,531
should play soccer.

140
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:52,990
A racket? That's a no.

141
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:54,492
I should try my best to play well.

142
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:57,328
Sungsil, you're really into this.

143
00:08:57,954 --> 00:09:02,208
Of course, Taeyang. Soccer players
have got really great thighs.

144
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:08,047
Hi. Taeyang, you're here too.

145
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,006
Hi, Jiho.

146
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:12,176
Jiho, what are you doing here?

147
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:14,595
Oh, he's a junior on our team.

148
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:19,267
I was in the area, so I just dropped by.

149
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:21,519
Gosh, a group date?

150
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:25,398
I see. They're no joke, right?

151
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:27,149
And by that,
I really mean they're no joke.

152
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,735
You wouldn't know
since you haven't lived with them--

153
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:31,779
What do you mean you live with us?

154
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:34,615
We're basically living together.

155
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:37,410
Hey, just go.

156
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:39,495
Yuri, you're about to lose your temper.

157
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:43,833
Anyway, think of this as charity work.

158
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:47,336
I hope you go on a second
and third round for drinks.

159
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:50,840
Follow me.

160
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:53,301
Have fun.

161
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:54,802
Bye!

162
00:09:58,514 --> 00:10:00,933
I'll see him off and come back.

163
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:02,184
Okay.

164
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:04,979
Goodbye.

165
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:09,233
-You live together?
-No, we don't live together.

166
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:11,777
We just live in the same dorm, that's all.

167
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:17,283
Hey, sis.

168
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:19,619
You really went on a group date.

169
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:22,496
-Sis?
-I mean…

170
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:25,291
You said a man
with a racket isn't a real man, sis.

171
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:29,503
Come on. I was just being over-the-top
since Yuri was there.

172
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:31,213
I didn't want us to get caught.

173
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:33,799
You seemed to be having too much fun
for me to believe that.

174
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:36,886
I got dragged out by Yuri. I mean it.

175
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:41,015
Your eyes were twinkling too much
for me to believe that.

176
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:44,018
Come on. Why are you being so petty?

177
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:47,104
This is all just a part of socializing.

178
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:48,689
How can you say that to me?

179
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:50,983
Am I your junior or a younger brother?

180
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:52,985
I'm your boyfriend.

181
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:55,071
Oh, my gosh!

182
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:57,740
Are you two going out?

183
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:01,869
Yuri. This isn't what it looks like.

184
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:03,704
No…

185
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:20,262
When did this start?

186
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:23,933
On Christmas day, two years ago.

187
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:28,437
Two years? Not just one year but two?

188
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:30,648
How could you fool us like that?

189
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:33,067
You're scary.

190
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:36,654
But there's nothing wrong
with being in love…

191
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:40,157
It's not wrong,
but you've completely betrayed us.

192
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:43,786
Teammates aren't allowed to date, so…

193
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:46,580
If I think about how I've been fooled
all this time…

194
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:49,375
Am I wrong?

195
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:52,086
They must really like each other.

196
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:56,173
Taeyang, is that all you have to say?

197
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:59,635
Oh, about the laundry?
I'd better go do some laundry.

198
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:04,265
Taejun. Have you been discharged?
How's your knee?

199
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:07,685
Come here.
Where do you think you're going?

200
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:10,479
They got caught.

201
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:15,151
Were you two going out?

202
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:18,028
Why did you have to date a teammate?

203
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:20,656
I'm going to my room to get some rest.

204
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:22,867
I have to be on bed rest.

205
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:24,368
We aren't the only ones.

206
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:26,620
Taejun and Taeyang are going out too.

207
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:28,038
-Hey.
-What?

208
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:29,665
I can't go down alone like this.

209
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:33,544
You've been taking advantage of us dating
to boss me around.

210
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:37,256
Did you all know about this
and help each other out?

211
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:40,259
So this was a dating camp.

212
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:42,344
You two. Are you really together?

213
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:43,387
-No.
-No.

214
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:45,598
What? They can't be apart for even a day.

215
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:47,057
That's not true.

216
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:49,560
I knew it.

217
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:51,729
I told you there was something
between the Park twins.

218
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:54,106
-We're not dating.
-Gosh. You've got some nerve.

219
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,233
Gosh, seriously. We're not together. You…

220
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:59,361
You two are together.

221
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:03,240
I figured out you guys were dating.

222
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:05,993
I've known about it too for some time now.

223
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:08,537
Taejun even said he wanted to get married.

224
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:11,665
-No way!
-Married?

225
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:13,751
This is a serious issue.

226
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:16,378
Get over here.
Let's start a hearing of the Park twins.

227
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:20,716
Come on. What hearing?
I'm telling you, we're not together.

228
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:29,308
Hey.

229
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:31,268
What's going on?

230
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:33,771
The Park twins are dating.

231
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:37,483
I see. But that's questionable.

232
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,701
What's with him?

233
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:51,997
Gosh, I can't run like I used to.

234
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:53,582
-Jiho, take over.
-Yes, sir.

235
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,292
Don't fall behind.

236
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:56,418
Yes, sir.

237
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:00,214
I'll go on ahead first.

238
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:01,590
Me too.

239
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:04,885
-Gosh.
-That's sweet.

240
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:31,579
Hey!

241
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:34,915
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

242
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,758
I'll take her to the infirmary.

243
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:46,343
-Okay.
-I'm okay.

244
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:47,428
Let's just go.

245
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,400
Let's have a seat here.

246
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:10,284
What will the others think
if we just walk out like this?

247
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:11,619
They're already saying stuff…

248
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:16,957
about whether we're dating or not.

249
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:20,628
Why does it matter so much
what the others think?

250
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:24,590
If it's bothering you that much,
you can tell them the truth.

251
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:26,592
Why won't you tell them

252
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:29,637
that we broke up?

253
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:33,724
That will make things more complicated.
Can't you see?

254
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:36,602
Then they'll start
to walk on eggshells around us,

255
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:38,854
and that will make things
between us even more awkward.

256
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,898
If we just pretend like
nothing's ever happened--

257
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:43,943
I got it. Let's just say
nothing's ever happened between us.

258
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:45,861
That will make things easy.

259
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:53,911
How is your knee?

260
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:55,788
You're doing rehab, right?

261
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:59,500
Do you think I'd feel like doing rehab
while somebody is going on group dates?

262
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:01,418
That…

263
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:04,964
You might end up getting surgery
if this becomes chronic.

264
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,424
So get absolute rest and--

265
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:09,551
That's what I should be doing

266
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:11,220
while somebody is going on group dates.

267
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:13,180
Goodness.

268
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:15,474
I'm going.

269
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:19,853
I need absolute rest.

270
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,525
Let's stay like this for a bit.

271
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:49,341
Where should we go?

272
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:51,093
It's our first date.

273
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:00,352
Let's first get you a pair of shoes.

274
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:02,187
Do you want to buy me a gift?

275
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:06,233
They say if you buy a girl heels,
she'll run away.

276
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:14,199
You should wear sneakers
so we can go exercise.

277
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:15,868
You can borrow clothes from there.

278
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:17,536
You really want to go to a gym?

279
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:19,371
Hey, that gym is awesome.

280
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,291
This is pretty. What do you think?

281
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:24,501
Do you have this in a size 230?

282
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:25,711
Yes!

283
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:32,843
I don't want to.

284
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:35,679
Yumin doesn't want to.

285
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:38,390
Do you think I dressed up
to get sweaty and go run with you?

286
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:40,100
No.

287
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,854
Can't we go someplace nice and pretty?

288
00:17:45,689 --> 00:17:46,774
Please?

289
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:48,859
Somewhere with a great ambiance.

290
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:52,446
A place where normal people go to. Please?

291
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,073
It's our first date.

292
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:04,083
Gosh. Hey.

293
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:08,337
I'm sorry, but I can't handle this.

294
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:10,923
I knew this wouldn't work.

295
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:15,094
You seriously want to wear sneakers
and go to the gym?

296
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:16,637
Work and love.

297
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,014
It's not that easy
to kill two birds with one stone.

298
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,933
When will you train
if you're always having fun?

299
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:25,145
That's why you haven't improved.

300
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:27,815
What?

301
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:30,609
-Do you want to try this on?
-Yes.

302
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:32,861
No, I don't like it.

303
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:36,490
And it doesn't suit me at all.

304
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:38,784
Wait, hey.

305
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:41,787
Sorry. I'll come back later.

306
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:45,249
Hey, Yumin. Hold up.

307
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,585
What did I do wrong?

308
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:51,088
I came in my heels to look pretty for you.

309
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:53,257
Do you really have to put me in sneakers?

310
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:58,053
I know that,

311
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:00,681
but it's good to work hard.

312
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:07,396
It may seem pathetic to you,

313
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:10,524
but I like being just like everyone else.

314
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:12,234
On a first date,

315
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:14,319
I want to watch a movie, dine out,
and have coffee.

316
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:18,699
That kind of happiness is important to me.

317
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,160
I'm not Park Junyoung.

318
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:23,829
Why are you bringing that up?

319
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:27,541
Because I think
you've mistaken me for her.

320
00:19:27,624 --> 00:19:28,709
I'm leaving.

321
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:30,043
But…

322
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:42,639
Badminton season is back again

323
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:47,186
Why are there so many tournaments?

324
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:50,022
It's hard, right?

325
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:53,150
It's not hard for me.

326
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:55,319
It's not like I'm competing.

327
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:59,323
We should get our kids ready.

328
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:00,407
Yes.

329
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:04,453
By the way, about Seungwoo.

330
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:06,288
Will he be playing in this tournament?

331
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:12,502
What about Taejun?
Do you think he can play?

332
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:15,964
Yes. It's just patellar tendinitis.

333
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:17,674
We'll get him into shape to play.

334
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,802
All right.

335
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:28,435
You think a human body is a pile of dough?

336
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:31,647
It's not something I can knead
into a shape that I want.

337
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:34,399
But that's your job, Mr. Sibong.

338
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:36,485
I also retired due to an injury.

339
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:38,528
But you can't do anything about it.

340
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:41,740
Every athlete has to take on
the risk of injury.

341
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:44,952
Taejun's been doing great these days.

342
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:48,538
His game is picking up,
so this is when we need to push him.

343
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:51,708
Taejun shouldn't compete now. Never.

344
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:53,335
Why are you pushing for this so much?

345
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:55,963
Because that's what you need to do
to win another game.

346
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:58,507
That's what sports are all about.

347
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,259
I have my principles,

348
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:03,595
and I can't let an athlete go down a path
that could ruin him.

349
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,402
Hey, Junghwan. For this upcoming match--

350
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:19,820
I'm playing with Hyukbong.

351
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:21,613
Did I ask you to be my partner?

352
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:27,077
-You'll be my partner, right?
-No.

353
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:29,454
I'm going to focus on mixed doubles.

354
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:32,040
Now he's dating out in the open.

355
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:37,671
-Captain, then would you--
-Sorry.

356
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:39,881
I'll head out first.

357
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:41,425
-Take care.
-Get back safe.

358
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:44,720
You don't have a partner to play with?

359
00:21:45,762 --> 00:21:48,307
You could ask Taeyang to be your partner
for mixed doubles.

360
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:52,561
Gosh, seriously. Hey, daters.

361
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:54,354
You can cook dinner tonight.

362
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:55,314
-What?
-What?

363
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:57,816
We kept it a secret from the coaches
for you guys.

364
00:21:57,899 --> 00:21:59,234
It's the least you can do.

365
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,987
You can go buy groceries,

366
00:22:02,195 --> 00:22:04,239
and you can cook. Show us what you've got.

367
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:05,407
Yes!

368
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:11,079
-It looks good.
-It really does.

369
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:13,040
The food looks even more special today.

370
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:14,166
Jiho.

371
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:17,961
-Let's dig in!
-Yes!

372
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:20,881
-Thanks for the meal.
-Thanks for the meal.

373
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:23,842
Jiho, you should just retire early
and open a restaurant.

374
00:22:23,925 --> 00:22:25,635
I'm going to, after I save up.

375
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:27,512
I completely agree.

376
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:29,723
There isn't much we can do once we retire.

377
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:31,850
That's better than teaching
for the rest of your life.

378
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:33,226
I'll be your VIP customer.

379
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:37,189
I'll go back to my hometown
and raise dogs.

380
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:39,566
Mr. Oh, the dog trainer.

381
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:43,779
Seungwoo. You'll play
even after you retire, right?

382
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:44,863
I bet…

383
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:47,657
he'll die with a racket in his hands.

384
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:50,410
I plan to take over my parents' business.

385
00:22:51,661 --> 00:22:55,248
I'll end this for good
and never wear sneakers again.

386
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:56,792
That's what I promised my parents.

387
00:23:01,671 --> 00:23:03,673
Hey, I haven't heard that before.

388
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:05,133
Does your family run a business?

389
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:08,178
Gosh. You were born with a silver spoon.
I didn't know.

390
00:23:08,261 --> 00:23:11,598
Yes, my family uses silver spoons,
although they're silver-plated.

391
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:13,225
We have a spoon factory.

392
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:16,311
-Really?
-For real?

393
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:18,313
-Spoons like this?
-You guys didn't know?

394
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:20,357
His family owns a huge spoon factory.

395
00:23:22,692 --> 00:23:24,319
Since we're on the topic,

396
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:26,905
I want you all to congratulate me.

397
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:29,366
I'm retiring.

398
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:39,167
Yes, you are. You'll retire at some point.

399
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:43,046
There will be a ceremony this week.

400
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:46,091
I figured it would be best for the team

401
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:47,968
for me to leave before the tournament.

402
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,975
Are you serious?

403
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:57,978
Yes. It just sort of happened.

404
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:07,154
I mean, retiring isn't a bad thing.

405
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:10,240
Congratulations, Seungwoo.

406
00:24:10,323 --> 00:24:11,450
Congratulations.

407
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,939
How do you feel
with your retirement coming up?

408
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,860
Well, you know…

409
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:49,738
I can't really picture it.

410
00:24:50,697 --> 00:24:52,782
Me wearing dress shoes and a tie,

411
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:56,203
selling spoons for the rest of my life.

412
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:01,875
When I was in the hospital this time,

413
00:25:04,377 --> 00:25:06,129
I suddenly got scared.

414
00:25:07,088 --> 00:25:09,716
Why? Were you scared that
you might not get to play anymore?

415
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:11,009
Yes.

416
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:16,973
"I'm going to quit."

417
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:19,434
I used to say this all the time.

418
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:24,773
But the thought of
actually not being able to play…

419
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:27,359
Gosh.

420
00:25:28,276 --> 00:25:30,028
It would be so boring.

421
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:35,742
What could be more fun for an athlete?

422
00:25:36,326 --> 00:25:39,538
We live fiercely
to make every moment count.

423
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:41,957
We're lucky
to have experienced living like that.

424
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:44,167
Why don't you stay for a little longer?

425
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:46,461
Maybe just until this tournament.

426
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:47,712
No.

427
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:49,631
This is it for me.

428
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:53,593
I never thought there would be an end,

429
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:55,929
but I can feel that the time has come.

430
00:25:57,639 --> 00:25:59,724
There's this one thing
that's been bothering me,

431
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:02,227
but I'll just let go of it.

432
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:04,604
Do you mean Youngsim?

433
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:12,862
You and Youngsim are
the most romantic couple on our team.

434
00:26:15,323 --> 00:26:18,868
Romantic, my foot.
We never even started dating.

435
00:26:22,163 --> 00:26:24,207
Hold on tight
when you still have the chance.

436
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:27,460
There might not be a next time.

437
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:49,649
You look pretty.

438
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:51,818
Don't…

439
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:54,696
Don't I look a bit awkward?

440
00:26:54,904 --> 00:26:57,240
No, you look very pretty.

441
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:01,870
But is it okay for me to see this first?

442
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:05,498
He's not in Korea, so what can I do?

443
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:12,213
Seungwoo.

444
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:13,882
I'm having a baby.

445
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:18,219
I'm pregnant.

446
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:19,387
Hey.

447
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:22,140
Congratulations!

448
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:24,017
But why are you crying, silly?

449
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:26,853
Everyone's looking at you.

450
00:27:26,936 --> 00:27:28,772
I'm overwhelmed.

451
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:32,484
I'm going to be a mom.

452
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,154
Hey…

453
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:47,707
We're getting a divorce.

454
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:55,507
He told me to choose
between badminton and my family.

455
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:00,387
He's a completely different man.

456
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,232
What a jerk.

457
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:17,862
What does he think I can do without him?

458
00:28:22,617 --> 00:28:24,828
Darn it. He's just such a jerk.

459
00:29:02,198 --> 00:29:03,116
Hey, dump truck.

460
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,702
It's time for you to get out of the way.

461
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:56,044
I wanted to at least pay
for the hospital bills

462
00:29:56,836 --> 00:29:58,922
so that we could find some closure.

463
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:02,675
But your parents are avoiding me.

464
00:30:07,096 --> 00:30:09,933
I've already put it behind me.

465
00:30:13,728 --> 00:30:17,065
I'm very ashamed to say this,

466
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:22,487
but my daughter can't go on living
with this guilt forever.

467
00:30:23,738 --> 00:30:27,200
And I couldn't just sit back and watch.

468
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:32,330
I bet she was scared to tell everyone

469
00:30:33,706 --> 00:30:36,000
that it was her fault you got injured.

470
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:39,546
She lived her entire life

471
00:30:41,881 --> 00:30:44,342
being afraid of letting me down,
even just a little bit.

472
00:30:46,886 --> 00:30:48,763
I'm the one…

473
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:52,392
who put her in a tight spot.

474
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:59,232
I wanted Taeyang to become
a great athlete like you,

475
00:31:02,068 --> 00:31:05,864
so I was on her back all the time.

476
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:09,242
"It's okay to make a mistake."

477
00:31:10,493 --> 00:31:12,954
"You can do better next time."

478
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,541
I never said anything like that to her.

479
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:21,004
I acted like I wouldn't treat her
like my daughter if she didn't do well.

480
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:28,011
I was very harsh on her.

481
00:31:35,351 --> 00:31:38,730
You don't have to be so formal with me.
You can speak casually.

482
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:43,776
I'm the guilty one.

483
00:31:44,777 --> 00:31:47,822
It's entirely my fault
that Taeyang made such a mistake.

484
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:51,576
I'm to blame for raising her like that.

485
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:55,455
I was wrong.

486
00:31:57,707 --> 00:31:58,750
I'm very…

487
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:03,421
I'm very sorry.

488
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:11,471
I promise to wish for your happiness

489
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:16,309
more than my own child's
for the rest of my life.

490
00:32:20,146 --> 00:32:21,356
I'm sorry.

491
00:32:22,815 --> 00:32:23,942
I'm very sorry.

492
00:32:33,576 --> 00:32:36,079
Now let's move down.
Keep your back straight.

493
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:41,584
Okay. Let's stop there for ten seconds.

494
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:45,630
All right. Ten, nine, eight,

495
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:47,840
seven, six…

496
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:52,428
Come on, Doctor.

497
00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:56,057
Yes, you've gotten better,
but not enough for the tournament.

498
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:58,935
You said I've gotten better.
I'm on a professional team.

499
00:32:59,018 --> 00:33:00,687
Telling me not to compete

500
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:03,022
is the same as telling me
to quit making a living.

501
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:06,693
Gosh, I feel light.

502
00:33:06,776 --> 00:33:08,194
My condition couldn't be better.

503
00:33:08,277 --> 00:33:10,571
Yes, you can play. However--

504
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:11,614
Thank you!

505
00:33:13,741 --> 00:33:15,868
Don't overwork yourself.

506
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,287
Come straight to the hospital
if you feel off. Okay?

507
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:19,414
Okay.

508
00:33:20,206 --> 00:33:21,332
I'll get going.

509
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:23,209
Don't run!

510
00:33:23,876 --> 00:33:25,044
Spare your knee!

511
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:26,963
-Sir, please put it over here.
-Okay.

512
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,256
Thank you.

513
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:29,632
The banner is here.

514
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:32,677
All right. Banner, okay. Check.

515
00:33:32,802 --> 00:33:34,554
-Yuri, where's the cake?
-I'll go get it now.

516
00:33:34,637 --> 00:33:36,264
Why are you going now to pick that up?

517
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:38,224
We haven't got all day.

518
00:33:38,307 --> 00:33:39,642
YEON SEUNGWOO RETIREMENT CEREMONY

519
00:33:39,726 --> 00:33:43,855
For your pure passion that has moved
and encouraged us all,

520
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:47,692
we would like to express our gratitude
by honoring you with this plaque

521
00:33:47,775 --> 00:33:49,193
PLAQUE OF APPRECIATION

522
00:33:49,777 --> 00:33:50,778
Thank you.

523
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:55,116
Nice work.

524
00:33:56,409 --> 00:33:58,119
-You've done great.
-Thank you, Coach.

525
00:33:58,828 --> 00:33:59,787
Here.

526
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:01,664
A golden key.

527
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:03,499
-Thank you for all your hard work.
-Thank you.

528
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:12,759
All right then. Seungwoo.

529
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:15,219
Say a few words.

530
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:20,224
First of all…

531
00:34:20,683 --> 00:34:21,517
Sir.

532
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:26,939
I'd appreciate it if you could help
the athletes focus only on their training.

533
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:29,942
I know we upset you at times

534
00:34:30,151 --> 00:34:34,363
since we use the company budget to train,
yet have no idea what's going on.

535
00:34:35,114 --> 00:34:38,367
Playing badminton is the only thing
we know how to do,

536
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:40,912
so please see us in a good light.

537
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:43,414
-You've done a great job.
-Thanks.

538
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:46,209
And to my dear teammates.

539
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:50,963
I know it sounds cliché,
but if I were to add one cautionary note…

540
00:34:51,547 --> 00:34:52,590
Gosh!

541
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:58,054
Now that it's come to an end,
this is all I have left to say.

542
00:34:59,555 --> 00:35:00,973
Let's be thankful for the present

543
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:04,977
and live life to the fullest,
with no regrets.

544
00:35:08,022 --> 00:35:09,232
I really did my very best.

545
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:15,321
Thank you, everyone.

546
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:21,494
-Thank you!
-Thank you!

547
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:24,163
-You're awesome!
-We love you!

548
00:35:25,164 --> 00:35:27,083
-You're the best.
-Congratulations.

549
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:31,420
Let's have a toast.

550
00:35:31,587 --> 00:35:36,134
-For Yeon Seungwoo!
-For Yeon Seungwoo!

551
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:41,931
Stop crying.

552
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:48,896
I wanted to leave while I was on top
and get a round of applause.

553
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:51,774
When would that be?

554
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:52,817
What?

555
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:56,112
Everyone, let's give him a big hand!

556
00:35:56,612 --> 00:35:58,656
-All right!
-Give him a hand!

557
00:35:58,739 --> 00:36:00,908
Go Yeon Seungwoo!

558
00:36:05,955 --> 00:36:07,748
We wish you all the best, Seungwoo.

559
00:36:07,957 --> 00:36:11,210
Seungwoo, I hope your spoon business
is a smashing success.

560
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:15,548
Seungwoo. I hope everything goes well
for you. Okay?

561
00:36:15,631 --> 00:36:16,841
Thanks.

562
00:36:16,924 --> 00:36:18,050
Seungwoo.

563
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:19,760
I love you.

564
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:20,887
I love you too.

565
00:36:21,387 --> 00:36:23,097
I'm going to miss you.

566
00:36:24,056 --> 00:36:26,225
Gosh. Stop crying, Sunsoo.

567
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:28,769
-We can get together another time.
-Okay.

568
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:30,646
Seungwoo.

569
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:34,483
You've always been awesome.
You know that, right?

570
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:37,445
Seungwoo!

571
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:39,822
Why? What's the matter, Dongwan?

572
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:43,868
Thanks for everything.

573
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:49,373
Hey. Thank you too.

574
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:52,335
Thank you.

575
00:36:52,418 --> 00:36:54,212
-I love you too.
-Seungwoo.

576
00:36:54,795 --> 00:36:56,756
I love you guys.

577
00:36:57,548 --> 00:37:00,301
-Everyone, raise your glass.
-Raise it up.

578
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:04,805
All right. Let's all be happy!

579
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:06,557
-Let's be happy!
-Let's be happy!

580
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:08,976
-Go, Yunis!
-Let's go!

581
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:15,233
Don't cry, okay?

582
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:18,986
This is an eye-opener.

583
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:21,322
-Hey, do you want help with that?
-Yes.

584
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:27,161
A Taeyang butterfly
I'm a butterfly

585
00:37:29,538 --> 00:37:30,957
Stop. Both of you.

586
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:35,419
Stop following me.

587
00:37:36,295 --> 00:37:38,923
I hate you,

588
00:37:39,006 --> 00:37:40,091
and I hate you too.

589
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:42,176
I'm going to go by myself.

590
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:44,512
We're on our way to the dorm.

591
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:49,558
She's going to fall over.

592
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:51,018
She's got great reflexes.

593
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:55,189
Gosh, really?

594
00:37:56,899 --> 00:37:59,235
I told you to stop following me.

595
00:37:59,568 --> 00:38:01,279
I want to go by myself.

596
00:38:01,862 --> 00:38:02,905
Guys!

597
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:05,992
We aren't following you.

598
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:07,994
I mean…

599
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:13,416
An athlete's career is so short.

600
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:18,045
You have that moment,
which ends in the blink of an eye.

601
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:22,800
You don't really get that many chances

602
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:25,303
to start over.

603
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:28,848
Do you know what a cicada is?

604
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:30,182
A cicada

605
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:33,644
waits underground for seven years

606
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:36,063
to make all that noise for one summer.

607
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:37,773
It's just like that.

608
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:40,609
The wait is too long,

609
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:44,613
and the summer is way too short.

610
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:48,242
That's what makes it cool.

611
00:38:51,037 --> 00:38:54,749
It makes us so desperate
because it ends in the blink of an eye.

612
00:38:55,958 --> 00:38:58,794
It drives a person crazy
because it's a rare opportunity.

613
00:39:00,796 --> 00:39:02,089
That's what makes it cool.

614
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:11,849
Are you a cicada?

615
00:39:11,932 --> 00:39:13,059
I'm going.

616
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:15,728
Hey, let's go together. Take her with you.

617
00:39:15,811 --> 00:39:17,021
Were you a cicada?

618
00:39:17,104 --> 00:39:18,939
-Hey!
-You're a badminton player!

619
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:27,823
I'll take a taxi.

620
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:30,451
You should go.

621
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:36,332
I live in Seoul.

622
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:38,709
We can meet every night
if we set our minds to it.

623
00:39:44,673 --> 00:39:45,841
It's about time

624
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:49,261
I let you go, right?

625
00:39:55,142 --> 00:39:58,396
I don't plan to get into a relationship
since I have Hana.

626
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:06,237
But, to be honest,
I pretended not to know how you felt.

627
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:13,828
Because I couldn't do it without you.

628
00:40:16,038 --> 00:40:17,915
I just waited

629
00:40:19,291 --> 00:40:22,211
to let time do its job.

630
00:40:26,006 --> 00:40:27,633
But I shouldn't have done that.

631
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:31,178
We're friends.

632
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:36,016
Seungwoo.

633
00:40:37,393 --> 00:40:38,477
From now on,

634
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:41,397
meet a lot of other friends

635
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,901
and find a nice person like yourself
to be your girlfriend.

636
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:53,951
Take care.

637
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:00,249
Would it be okay

638
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:05,129
if I gave you a hug just once?

639
00:41:16,265 --> 00:41:17,433
You do know

640
00:41:18,392 --> 00:41:20,728
that it took you 15 years
to say that, don't you?

641
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:28,527
That's just the way I am.

642
00:41:55,429 --> 00:41:57,973
-Let's just have one more drink.
-No!

643
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:00,601
Anyone who wants to drink with Taeyang
Raise your hand!

644
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:02,269
-No one.
-Come on!

645
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:03,187
Hey.

646
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:06,732
You're finally here.

647
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:11,904
Junyoung.

648
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:18,494
What brings you here?

649
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:20,162
I didn't come to see you.

650
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:24,708
You can go inside first.

651
00:42:25,292 --> 00:42:26,335
You should've called.

652
00:42:34,301 --> 00:42:35,427
Are you drunk?

653
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:40,849
How about another round with me?

654
00:43:04,331 --> 00:43:06,625
Your father came to see me.

655
00:43:07,626 --> 00:43:09,169
My dad? Why?

656
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:12,798
Did you know
that your dad met with my parents?

657
00:43:15,509 --> 00:43:16,510
No.

658
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:22,433
He wanted to pay them compensation,

659
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:24,643
so he kept reaching out to them.

660
00:43:26,895 --> 00:43:30,357
My parents kept avoiding him,
so he came to our house,

661
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:32,735
and I happened to run into him.

662
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:37,615
I had no idea.

663
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:42,828
Let's cut to the chase.

664
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:46,415
Hey, Taeyang.

665
00:43:49,543 --> 00:43:51,462
I told him I'd work things out with you.

666
00:43:56,508 --> 00:44:00,387
He told me
you committed yourself to training

667
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:02,973
just so you could get his approval.

668
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:09,813
Isn't it funny? I could understand
where you were coming from.

669
00:44:14,943 --> 00:44:16,528
I used to be like that too.

670
00:44:17,863 --> 00:44:21,158
I was always so afraid of being abandoned

671
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:27,706
if I didn't come in first place.
Just like you.

672
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:41,387
Let's just go. This is childish.

673
00:44:41,804 --> 00:44:45,140
You've been watching with me all along.
Let's just see how it goes.

674
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:57,778
Seungwoo retired today.

675
00:44:57,861 --> 00:44:59,113
He did?

676
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:00,864
Yes.

677
00:45:01,448 --> 00:45:05,077
And it kept reminding me of you.

678
00:45:08,664 --> 00:45:13,001
You should've left with all the applause.

679
00:45:15,254 --> 00:45:18,048
But you didn't get to have
a proper retirement ceremony.

680
00:45:21,093 --> 00:45:22,261
Hey.

681
00:45:23,303 --> 00:45:25,055
That's actually one of my biggest regrets.

682
00:45:26,014 --> 00:45:29,727
You get a flower bouquet
even when you graduate from kindergarten.

683
00:45:30,185 --> 00:45:32,771
When I was retiring,
everyone was in tears,

684
00:45:33,021 --> 00:45:34,648
as if my life had come to an end.

685
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:39,111
"You worked hard. Congratulations."
I never got to hear that.

686
00:45:41,113 --> 00:45:42,114
I'm sorry.

687
00:45:45,659 --> 00:45:47,244
Then you can say that to me.

688
00:45:50,456 --> 00:45:52,082
"Congratulations on your retirement."

689
00:45:55,127 --> 00:45:56,420
Although it's a little overdue.

690
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:02,843
How could I?

691
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:05,262
When it's all my fault.

692
00:46:19,651 --> 00:46:20,611
But Junyoung.

693
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:25,949
You…

694
00:46:28,911 --> 00:46:31,455
truly were a great athlete,

695
00:46:33,248 --> 00:46:34,500
and even more happiness

696
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:38,295
awaits you in the future.

697
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:15,624
All right.

698
00:47:16,208 --> 00:47:17,251
Hello, sir.

699
00:47:17,334 --> 00:47:21,547
We're still submitting applications,
so let me know when you choose a partner.

700
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:22,631
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

701
00:47:22,714 --> 00:47:24,925
Oh. Let me know
if you're also entering mixed doubles.

702
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:27,469
-Yes, sir.
-Mixed doubles?

703
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:29,346
Why?

704
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:33,141
What?

705
00:47:38,647 --> 00:47:41,316
Aren't you entering the individual event
with Hyukbong?

706
00:47:42,067 --> 00:47:43,110
I am.

707
00:47:43,193 --> 00:47:45,028
So what else do you have to tell me?

708
00:47:45,612 --> 00:47:48,282
In order to test out my potential,

709
00:47:48,448 --> 00:47:51,326
and participate with all that I have,

710
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:53,871
I'd like to enter another match.

711
00:47:55,205 --> 00:47:59,418
I'd like to enter
the mixed doubles event too.

712
00:48:00,002 --> 00:48:00,961
Mixed doubles?

713
00:48:02,462 --> 00:48:05,257
With whom? With Taeyang?

714
00:48:07,801 --> 00:48:08,844
Then with whom?

715
00:48:09,678 --> 00:48:12,556
Ms. Lee Yumin from Somang Bank.

716
00:48:13,974 --> 00:48:15,183
My Yumin?

717
00:48:16,977 --> 00:48:19,980
-Yes, she's a great player.
-Yes, she's great.

718
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:27,112
My… Yumin?

719
00:48:27,696 --> 00:48:28,655
So,

720
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:31,241
you mean my daughter, Yumin?

721
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:32,993
Yes, that's right.

722
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:35,287
My Yumin…

723
00:48:35,370 --> 00:48:36,872
-Why?
-Because she's pretty--

724
00:48:38,415 --> 00:48:40,250
No, no. Wait.

725
00:48:43,211 --> 00:48:45,213
I'd like to take care of your daughter!

726
00:48:58,393 --> 00:49:01,271
Hey. What the heck are you saying?

727
00:49:01,897 --> 00:49:04,232
I'll take responsibility
and be responsible.

728
00:49:05,651 --> 00:49:08,737
-"Responsible"?
-Responsible.

729
00:49:09,696 --> 00:49:12,616
Did you do something
you need to take responsibility for?

730
00:49:12,699 --> 00:49:14,451
No. I didn't do a thing, Father.

731
00:49:14,534 --> 00:49:17,454
"Father"?

732
00:49:17,537 --> 00:49:19,748
-Father--
-I'm not your father!

733
00:49:19,998 --> 00:49:22,542
-I'm not Junghwan's father!
-Where are you going?

734
00:49:23,418 --> 00:49:26,171
Hey, who gave you permission
to sign me up for mixed doubles?

735
00:49:26,254 --> 00:49:27,923
Did I agree to be your partner?

736
00:49:29,591 --> 00:49:31,802
I thought you'd be happy about this.

737
00:49:32,386 --> 00:49:35,847
I mean, you didn't even ask me.

738
00:49:37,307 --> 00:49:40,060
Don't get into any more trouble
and just stay put. I'm on my way.

739
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:44,564
Okay.

740
00:49:49,695 --> 00:49:51,405
Are you two dating?

741
00:49:52,364 --> 00:49:53,657
We're not dating.

742
00:49:55,033 --> 00:49:56,743
Gosh, you had me really worried--

743
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:58,912
Junghwan isn't interested in me.

744
00:49:59,246 --> 00:50:00,080
What?

745
00:50:01,623 --> 00:50:04,751
-What? You little piece of--
-Wait.

746
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:05,794
-Stop.
-Why?

747
00:50:05,877 --> 00:50:08,046
I'm the one who has a crush on him.
Just me.

748
00:50:09,756 --> 00:50:11,299
-Dad?
-My goodness.

749
00:50:12,718 --> 00:50:14,469
Gosh, you had me there for a second.

750
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:16,054
I don't care.

751
00:50:17,389 --> 00:50:19,599
Don't you dare come
between Junghwan and me.

752
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:22,436
I'll move out of the house. I mean it.

753
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:25,188
But you already don't live with us.
You live in a dorm.

754
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:27,899
Yumin. Get it together. Come on!

755
00:50:27,983 --> 00:50:29,026
You're right.

756
00:50:29,901 --> 00:50:32,654
Then, I'll shave my head bald.

757
00:50:32,738 --> 00:50:35,782
That's something I'd do to you.

758
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:38,410
I want to pull out all the hair
from your head right now.

759
00:50:38,493 --> 00:50:39,911
-You punk.
-That's right.

760
00:50:40,328 --> 00:50:43,498
Then, I'll quit badminton.

761
00:50:43,832 --> 00:50:46,293
I'll get drunk every day
and date hundreds of guys.

762
00:50:46,376 --> 00:50:49,212
Yumin.

763
00:50:49,296 --> 00:50:50,756
-Yumin.
-No!

764
00:50:50,839 --> 00:50:52,132
She's an amazing woman.

765
00:50:59,765 --> 00:51:01,433
Hey, let's get out of here.

766
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:03,226
Yes, let's go.

767
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:06,646
Right. I forgot to tell him
that we're dating.

768
00:51:10,525 --> 00:51:13,111
Let's go somewhere nice today.
You can wear heels.

769
00:51:16,782 --> 00:51:18,075
Come on.

770
00:51:28,627 --> 00:51:30,545
Hello, sir.

771
00:51:32,798 --> 00:51:34,508
Are you going to partner with Taejun?

772
00:51:36,176 --> 00:51:39,387
No. Sungsil and I want to compete
in an individual match.

773
00:51:39,471 --> 00:51:40,931
Who told you to enter only one game?

774
00:51:42,307 --> 00:51:44,851
-Pardon?
-You should get ready for a team match.

775
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:46,645
Make yourself useful.

776
00:51:46,728 --> 00:51:48,313
A team match?

777
00:51:49,439 --> 00:51:50,982
Am I a starter?

778
00:51:51,983 --> 00:51:52,818
Yes.

779
00:51:56,696 --> 00:51:58,949
Oh, my gosh! A starter!

780
00:52:01,326 --> 00:52:04,830
Yes! I'm a starter!

781
00:52:04,913 --> 00:52:06,540
Starter!

782
00:52:25,267 --> 00:52:26,434
What?

783
00:52:28,478 --> 00:52:30,397
-Are you home, Taeyang?
-Hey, Dad!

784
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:32,440
Since it's the weekend.

785
00:52:32,524 --> 00:52:35,402
Hey, when will you train
if you take time off every weekend?

786
00:52:36,069 --> 00:52:38,196
Kids just don't work these days.

787
00:52:38,947 --> 00:52:40,365
Anyway, what's this smell?

788
00:52:40,448 --> 00:52:41,616
I'm cooking beef bone soup.

789
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:42,617
You are?

790
00:52:43,118 --> 00:52:45,120
Gosh, that's unusual.

791
00:52:46,538 --> 00:52:48,665
You can have some, and I can have some.

792
00:52:52,377 --> 00:52:53,461
The thing is,

793
00:52:54,754 --> 00:52:57,507
one of my teammates injured his knee,

794
00:52:57,966 --> 00:53:00,093
so while I was at it, you know…

795
00:53:00,927 --> 00:53:02,304
I knew it.

796
00:53:03,305 --> 00:53:05,515
Why would you go through
all that trouble for me?

797
00:53:06,725 --> 00:53:08,476
Do you even know how to cook it?

798
00:53:09,269 --> 00:53:10,437
I searched online.

799
00:53:23,283 --> 00:53:24,201
Now stop eating.

800
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:29,789
Dad. By the way,

801
00:53:30,373 --> 00:53:32,209
I'll be playing in a team match.

802
00:53:32,709 --> 00:53:35,545
Well, of course. That's a given.

803
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:47,682
My gosh!

804
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:49,684
You didn't even knock.

805
00:53:50,477 --> 00:53:53,063
I need my privacy too.

806
00:53:55,774 --> 00:53:58,818
I made up with Junyoung.

807
00:54:00,195 --> 00:54:01,279
Really?

808
00:54:03,782 --> 00:54:05,075
Thank you.

809
00:54:08,912 --> 00:54:11,456
Why can't she say that
with a hug or something?

810
00:54:12,415 --> 00:54:15,335
Why is she so stoic?
Who did she get that from?

811
00:54:15,418 --> 00:54:16,670
I got it from you, Dad.

812
00:54:28,974 --> 00:54:30,809
-There you are.
-Gosh, you scared me.

813
00:54:30,892 --> 00:54:32,394
What a coincidence.

814
00:54:34,229 --> 00:54:35,981
Were you waiting for me?

815
00:54:36,064 --> 00:54:37,565
No. Who, me?

816
00:54:38,817 --> 00:54:39,985
It's just a coincidence.

817
00:54:40,777 --> 00:54:43,238
Since we ran into each other,
do you want to have this?

818
00:54:44,447 --> 00:54:45,573
What is it?

819
00:54:47,659 --> 00:54:50,704
It's beef bone soup.
It's supposed to be good for your bones.

820
00:54:54,624 --> 00:54:56,918
What are you looking at?
Why can't you look me in the eye?

821
00:54:58,169 --> 00:55:00,005
I'm looking at the trees
because they're pretty.

822
00:55:03,675 --> 00:55:05,093
Did you make this yourself?

823
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:10,390
Why? Does it matter?

824
00:55:10,473 --> 00:55:12,851
What matters is you eat something
and get better soon.

825
00:55:14,185 --> 00:55:16,855
I told you I'd worry about you.

826
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:20,608
Even if you meant this
as a nice gesture for your ex,

827
00:55:20,692 --> 00:55:22,360
you're crossing the line.

828
00:55:23,987 --> 00:55:24,821
What…

829
00:55:25,488 --> 00:55:27,032
Ask anyone on the street.

830
00:55:27,615 --> 00:55:28,867
Beef bone soup means love.

831
00:55:29,451 --> 00:55:31,619
It's a Korean's way of showing they care.

832
00:55:31,703 --> 00:55:34,331
A Korean heart. Don't you know?

833
00:55:55,643 --> 00:55:56,603
All right.

834
00:56:15,997 --> 00:56:18,666
Hey. Are you secretly eating by yourself?
That's cheap.

835
00:56:19,793 --> 00:56:22,587
-Where are the spoons?
-Don't even think about it.

836
00:56:22,712 --> 00:56:23,880
Just go back to sleep.

837
00:56:24,381 --> 00:56:25,632
I'm wide awake.

838
00:56:26,716 --> 00:56:28,885
Can't you see how brightly
my eyes are shining?

839
00:56:29,552 --> 00:56:31,471
They're shiny like the eyes of…

840
00:56:32,138 --> 00:56:32,972
a dead fish.

841
00:56:36,267 --> 00:56:38,019
My gosh. That smells amazing.

842
00:56:38,353 --> 00:56:40,688
Taejun, can I have some?

843
00:56:41,523 --> 00:56:43,691
I'm not supposed to share
this meaningful soup.

844
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:46,027
What are you talking about?
Get out of my way. I'm hungry.

845
00:56:46,611 --> 00:56:48,029
That's none of my concern.

846
00:56:48,822 --> 00:56:51,616
I might not get to play in the tournament
because I don't have a partner.

847
00:56:52,617 --> 00:56:54,786
Has either of you bothered
to ask me to be your partner?

848
00:56:54,869 --> 00:56:56,955
That's all because of Taeyang.

849
00:56:57,038 --> 00:56:58,248
Same here.

850
00:56:58,581 --> 00:57:00,375
Did she also tell you
not to partner with him?

851
00:57:00,458 --> 00:57:01,626
Yes.

852
00:57:01,709 --> 00:57:02,836
What are you talking about?

853
00:57:05,547 --> 00:57:06,673
You.

854
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:09,884
Don't partner with Taejun.

855
00:57:09,968 --> 00:57:11,553
He needs to get enough rest.

856
00:57:11,636 --> 00:57:14,055
He said he'll play because he can.

857
00:57:14,139 --> 00:57:16,975
Hey, don't worry about him. He's Taejun.

858
00:57:17,058 --> 00:57:19,269
He won't play
if he can find the slightest excuse.

859
00:57:19,352 --> 00:57:22,897
No. He'll play even if it could lead
to serious consequences.

860
00:57:22,981 --> 00:57:24,691
He'll just pretend to be okay.

861
00:57:25,650 --> 00:57:27,527
He keeps saying that he doesn't want to,

862
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:29,529
but I know he's desperate to play.

863
00:57:30,321 --> 00:57:33,241
Taejun likes badminton.

864
00:57:34,075 --> 00:57:35,118
So don't partner with him.

865
00:57:37,078 --> 00:57:37,954
I'll figure it out.

866
00:57:39,414 --> 00:57:41,416
-You promised!
-Whatever.

867
00:57:43,209 --> 00:57:46,963
She also stopped me,
telling me that you shouldn't play now.

868
00:57:48,214 --> 00:57:50,550
Hey, can I have some now?

869
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:55,013
You guys can have it all.

870
00:57:55,096 --> 00:57:57,015
Yes! I need a spoon.

871
00:57:57,223 --> 00:57:58,224
Wait.

872
00:58:00,768 --> 00:58:02,770
Talking about spoons reminds me
of Seungwoo.

873
00:58:02,854 --> 00:58:03,688
Right?

874
00:58:04,189 --> 00:58:06,691
Gosh! Are you eating with a used spoon?
That's disgusting.

875
00:58:06,774 --> 00:58:08,651
Hey, wait. I want some too.

876
00:58:08,735 --> 00:58:09,903
This tastes really good.

877
00:58:24,584 --> 00:58:25,710
What is it?

878
00:58:30,381 --> 00:58:33,301
You're completely blocking my way.

879
00:58:33,927 --> 00:58:35,011
What are you talking about?

880
00:58:35,094 --> 00:58:38,640
You told Jiho and Junghwan
not to partner with me.

881
00:58:40,308 --> 00:58:44,020
It was to make sure you got to rest.

882
00:58:45,939 --> 00:58:48,066
You're as sly as a fox.

883
00:58:50,902 --> 00:58:52,153
"Sly as a fox"?

884
00:58:52,237 --> 00:58:54,822
Why didn't you tell me
that you made up with my sister?

885
00:58:56,741 --> 00:58:58,743
Look at how sly you are.

886
00:58:59,327 --> 00:59:02,664
This is why we have communication issues.

887
00:59:05,041 --> 00:59:06,834
My doctor said I can enter the tournament.

888
00:59:08,670 --> 00:59:11,798
But you didn't even know,
and you took away my potential partners.

889
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:15,635
-Really?
-Yes.

890
00:59:17,053 --> 00:59:19,097
Now I can't enter, all because of you.

891
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:20,807
What are you going to do about this?

892
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:25,937
You've got some healing powers
that are completely over the top.

893
00:59:27,272 --> 00:59:30,608
How could I have known
about your freakishly good health?

894
00:59:34,362 --> 00:59:38,116
But are you sure? Can you really play?

895
00:59:38,199 --> 00:59:39,742
Yes, totally.

896
00:59:39,826 --> 00:59:42,328
-What should I do?
-Isn't it obvious?

897
00:59:42,829 --> 00:59:43,871
Take responsibility.

898
00:59:48,293 --> 00:59:50,086
I worked really hard to rehab my knee,

899
00:59:51,296 --> 00:59:52,297
just in case

900
00:59:53,256 --> 00:59:55,008
I got to be your partner.

901
00:59:56,342 --> 00:59:57,427
Just in case…

902
00:59:59,554 --> 01:00:02,140
I got one more chance.

903
01:00:09,981 --> 01:00:11,107
Let's be partners.

904
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:17,739
I'm dying to play with you.

905
01:01:10,541 --> 01:01:12,460
GOING TO YOU AT A SPEED OF 493KM

906
01:01:12,543 --> 01:01:14,962
I want to try my best till the end.

907
01:01:15,088 --> 01:01:17,924
Let's give it our all
and leave no regrets.

908
01:01:18,007 --> 01:01:20,677
All right. Let's do our best,
and see you at the finals!

909
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:22,970
You and Taeyang seem to have
an easy schedule.

910
01:01:23,054 --> 01:01:25,014
We don't care,
but you seem to care a lot about us.

911
01:01:25,098 --> 01:01:27,225
Hey, doesn't it look like he's limping?

912
01:01:27,308 --> 01:01:29,143
What do you mean you'll play?

913
01:01:29,227 --> 01:01:31,229
This isn't right. We should just give up.

914
01:01:31,312 --> 01:01:33,940
Don't run! Spare your knee!

915
01:01:34,023 --> 01:01:35,858
What would be your wish?

916
01:01:36,442 --> 01:01:38,653
-To win?
-To kiss you right now.

917
01:01:51,082 --> 01:01:52,250
GOING TO YOU AT A SPEED OF 493KM

918
01:01:52,333 --> 01:01:54,335
