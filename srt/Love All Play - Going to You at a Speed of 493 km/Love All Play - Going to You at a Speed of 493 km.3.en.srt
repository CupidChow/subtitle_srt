1
00:00:37,787 --> 00:00:40,790
GOING TO YOU AT A SPEED OF 493KM

2
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,586
THE PLACES, PEOPLE, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTIONAL

3
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:48,048
EPISODE 3

4
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:50,633
We've decided to be partners.

5
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:53,511
An athlete's opinion
is most important after all.

6
00:00:54,637 --> 00:00:57,307
Sure. The Park twins. Good luck.

7
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:58,558
-Thank you!
-Thank you!

8
00:00:58,975 --> 00:01:01,269
Okay. Practice with your partners.
Get ready.

9
00:01:01,352 --> 00:01:02,687
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

10
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:04,773
Coach.

11
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:05,774
Yes?

12
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:08,943
Does that mean I can practice too?
I have a partner now.

13
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:12,989
Sure. Warm up.

14
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:14,908
Yes, sir!

15
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:16,159
-Hey, Sanghyun.
-Yes, sir.

16
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:19,329
Should we practice there?
Or should we go to that corner?

17
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:21,414
Are you that happy?

18
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:23,792
Of course. I've been dying to play.

19
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:25,710
Let's practice crazy hard today.

20
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:26,961
Come with me.

21
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,214
Let's take it easy.

22
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:32,634
All right.

23
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:35,303
I should practice some today.

24
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:37,222
Sit down and rest today.

25
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:39,808
You have a busy day
of posting on social media and stuff.

26
00:01:42,393 --> 00:01:44,896
I can't see.
Excuse me, Mr. Yuk. I can't see.

27
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,315
Go over there. Go on.

28
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,776
Hello, everyone.

29
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:52,195
-Dad.
-Hey, Daughter!

30
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,199
What are you doing here?
What about training?

31
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:59,536
I stopped by on my way to PT
because I wanted to see you.

32
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:00,662
You little…

33
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:06,501
She adores her dad so much
although she's all grown up!

34
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:09,921
-She wants to marry her dad.
-Hey, 19 million won.

35
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:15,802
Let's have a match.

36
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:25,103
PARK TAEJUN

37
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:26,729
She's going to practice with me.

38
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:30,483
That's right. You're a pair now.

39
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:32,277
Then you can both play.

40
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:35,780
Hey. It's self-practice today--

41
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:39,742
I'll train however I want
with whomever I want.

42
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:41,661
You little punk.

43
00:02:41,744 --> 00:02:43,580
You promised in front of the president.

44
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:46,124
Sibong.

45
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:49,544
I knew it.

46
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:53,089
Hey, brat. Have you no respect?

47
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:57,510
Want to play with me?

48
00:02:57,927 --> 00:03:00,221
-What?
-Be my partner for this match.

49
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:25,955
I missed it… again.

50
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:32,879
Ten-nothing.

51
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:39,761
Putting aside the difference in skill,
the Park twins have no teamwork.

52
00:03:39,844 --> 00:03:42,847
Taeyang needs to create a shield
so that Taejun can attack.

53
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:44,098
But…

54
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:46,017
Their positions are switched.

55
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:48,603
Taejun's stronger at the net.

56
00:03:48,686 --> 00:03:50,647
and Taeyang's stronger from the back.

57
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,357
But they switched.

58
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:55,610
Neither of them belong in mixed doubles.

59
00:03:58,863 --> 00:04:00,031
Is this all you can do?

60
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:06,079
How lame. Let's end it quickly
and get some sleep.

61
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:13,503
Just piss her off

62
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:16,089
if you want Taeyang
to show her true skills.

63
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:19,217
Now that you're her teammate,

64
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,469
I'm asking you as her dad.

65
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:24,514
Please get my daughter riled up.

66
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,141
-Pardon?
-She's very simple-minded.

67
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,644
The more she's stepped on,
the angrier she gets.

68
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:36,651
PARK TAEYANG

69
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:43,616
Sorry. It's my fault.

70
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:46,619
I'll do it on my own.
You should just stay out of it.

71
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:48,579
You keep blocking my view.

72
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:50,623
Just go to the corner

73
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:52,208
and stand next to Sunsoo.

74
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:56,587
Hey. You have good days
and bad days when you play.

75
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:58,673
-I'm just out of it--
-Right now…

76
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:01,759
the best you can do is get out of my way.

77
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:06,681
Don't try too hard if you can't do it.

78
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:24,741
If I don't score now,

79
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,243
I'll drown myself in a bowl of water.

80
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:56,105
Should I just die?

81
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:04,822
Hey.

82
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,075
Sleep at home.

83
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:15,291
I was just thinking.

84
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:17,418
And my hand slipped.

85
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:19,212
You mean your foot slipped.

86
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:22,382
Oh. Are those your hands
and those your feet?

87
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:26,636
Oh. You've been playing
with your feet all this time.

88
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,137
Now, it makes sense.

89
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:29,555
I played with my feet?

90
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,766
It's a little late,
but you should try playing soccer.

91
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:36,145
Sorry.

92
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:38,815
I meant to pat your back,
but my foot went out instead.

93
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:40,233
Since my hands and feet are swapped.

94
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:42,068
We're on the same team.

95
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:44,320
Yes, we are.

96
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:48,574
What are you doing?

97
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:52,245
Why are they fighting so much?

98
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:55,665
What if they split up
shortly after becoming partners?

99
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,961
Just wait and see.

100
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:05,258
You couldn't even step on my shadow
back in the day.

101
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:08,219
Then show me.

102
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:11,139
You seem pissed off enough.

103
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,395
I can't believe the disrespect.

104
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:20,565
Should I show him my crazy talent?

105
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:28,906
Gosh.

106
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:04,567
It's me.

107
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:08,863
I was fooled.

108
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:29,800
That was Taeyang's smash.

109
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:31,469
Wow. Finally.

110
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:32,762
What was that?

111
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:42,480
How long has it been?

112
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:50,613
She really is simple-minded.

113
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:01,707
-Nice!
-Yes!

114
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:05,419
What's going on?

115
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:07,213
-You can do it.
-Come on.

116
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:08,839
-Nice.
-Now it's getting fun.

117
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:10,508
-Let's go.
-All right.

118
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:13,678
You came after the fun stuff ended.

119
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:17,056
PARK TAEYANG

120
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:19,225
Aren't they getting killed?

121
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:21,143
The Park Twins started to fight back,

122
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:22,562
so Junghwan got pissed off.

123
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:25,648
No one can compete with him
when he plays for real.

124
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:31,612
It's surprising
that they even got him pissed off.

125
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:36,576
Mr. Sibong.

126
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:40,162
Are you hurt?

127
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:41,831
Did you twist it?

128
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:42,915
-Taejun, are you okay?
-Make room.

129
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:46,335
Stop the match.

130
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:48,671
I can play. This is nothing.

131
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:51,424
Are you really hurt?

132
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:53,551
-Help him up.
-I'll take him to the infirmary.

133
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:54,510
He can't play.

134
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:03,311
-Let's go.
-We were making a comeback.

135
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:06,105
What a shame.
Let's play for real next time.

136
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:09,942
-Let's go.
-Hey. That's an act, isn't it?

137
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:12,361
I'm smiling through the pain.

138
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:24,165
If anyone asks you later
how far you went in your badminton career,

139
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:27,209
say you competed with Yuk Junghwan
in your prime.

140
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:28,961
Good work today.

141
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:31,672
Is that the image you made for yourself?

142
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:34,675
Why do you take a loss like that?
Are you that nice?

143
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,093
What do you mean?

144
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:38,929
You say "nice" like it's a bad thing.

145
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:41,307
You mainly support your partner
when you play.

146
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:43,726
You kept trying
to give me a chance to shine.

147
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:46,646
You value teamwork over yourself.

148
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:50,399
You picked up on that?

149
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:52,693
No wonder you're on the national team.

150
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:56,280
No one will appreciate you
for making your partners look good.

151
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,407
They'll think they did well
because they're good.

152
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:01,369
Why would you help others?

153
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,956
Because I play doubles.

154
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:23,849
How dare you joke around with your body!

155
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,477
What? You faked it?

156
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:28,729
You faked it?

157
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:31,357
You live off your body,
and you think injuries are a joke?

158
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:34,902
I'm sorry, sir.

159
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:38,698
Did you just laugh?

160
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:43,744
Hey, Taejun. Do you think this is funny?

161
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,288
-Is it funny?
-You shouldn't hit an athlete.

162
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:47,748
Let go of me.

163
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:48,874
An athlete?

164
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:52,837
Hey, punk. Do you think you're an athlete?

165
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,171
You think you're an athlete?

166
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:56,465
You've got the wrong attitude, you punk!

167
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:59,510
What about you? Did you act like a coach?

168
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:04,306
-What?
-It was low of Junghwan

169
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,767
to ask Taeyang, who isn't ready
to compete yet, to a match.

170
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:10,938
It's enough I let him vent at me.
Did I have to play fair too?

171
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:14,650
"Focus on your training.
Don't take it out on others."

172
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,318
Why can't you say that to him?

173
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:20,281
You're saying…

174
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:23,409
you want to be treated
the same as Junghwan.

175
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:25,578
Hey, Taejun.

176
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:28,414
You think you're the same?

177
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:37,506
Do you think we're like your old team that
takes in third-rate athletes like you?

178
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:41,051
This is Yunis.

179
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:45,473
More than half the team
wore the Korean flag on their chest

180
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:48,434
or still do right now.

181
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:50,311
But you… have you ever worn

182
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:52,813
anything here?

183
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:54,732
Have you ever worn anything--

184
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:55,733
Stop touching me.

185
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:57,693
-I don't think we have to go this far…
-Let go.

186
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:58,903
-Stop touching you?
-Coach.

187
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:00,654
I touched you, kid.

188
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:03,115
-I touched you. Let go, punk!
-Coach!

189
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:04,492
-Let go.
-Oh my!

190
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:21,133
As long as you're on my team,

191
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:24,970
shut your mouth and know your place, punk.

192
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:43,447
You know how…

193
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:46,575
I'm the goddess of luck
in this field, right?

194
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:49,662
"Good fortune comes to those
who partner up with Lee Yumin."

195
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:53,707
It's probably one
of the top seven legends here.

196
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,626
Like the dol hareubang.

197
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:58,295
You'll have a son if you rub his nose.

198
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:02,633
Imagine how annoying it must be
for that dol hareubang.

199
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:05,427
It doesn't even have a child of its own.

200
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:09,640
But someone understands how that feels.

201
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:14,770
Although we played
only one match together.

202
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:19,441
You come here to play, right?
I come here to work.

203
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,902
Hence, I must go work.

204
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:24,530
Does he come here often?

205
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:31,203
I thought that guy, Yuk Junghwan,
came here regularly.

206
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,541
He just left.

207
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:36,917
Right before you came.

208
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:45,259
He must've left by now.

209
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:47,636
What are you doing?

210
00:15:01,775 --> 00:15:03,402
-Hello?
-What's up?

211
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:09,199
What? Did you recognize my voice
right off the bat?

212
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:12,453
I saw you at the hospital.

213
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:15,706
You saw me?

214
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:18,459
I couldn't say hi
because I had to leave in a hurry.

215
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:20,002
I called because I felt bad.

216
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:21,837
Where are you now?

217
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,130
I'm driving.

218
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:26,842
Why are you lying?
There's no way you saw me.

219
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:30,054
I saw you.

220
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:33,599
Why would I call you if I didn't see you?

221
00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:36,185
Anyway,

222
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:39,188
why didn't you say hi

223
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:40,898
if you saw me?

224
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:43,734
It was a bit difficult to say hi.

225
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:45,819
-Bye. I'm driving.
-Wait!

226
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:51,867
I didn't call with some weird intention.

227
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,746
I want to set you up.

228
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:59,583
I have this friend,
and she'd be perfect for you.

229
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:01,669
Okay. Text me the time and place.

230
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:04,004
Why are you so easy?

231
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:05,464
You have no questions?

232
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:07,549
You said it was a girl. Thanks.

233
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:09,259
Hey.

234
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:12,304
What?

235
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:14,807
So all girls are good?

236
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:18,852
Dang it. Why did I say
I'd set him up with a girl?

237
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:20,646
You idiot.

238
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:22,606
A blind date?

239
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:23,774
Shoot.

240
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:27,569
Let's see what you say later.

241
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:35,536
Thanks for your hard work!

242
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:37,496
-Hey.
-Are we off now?

243
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,916
Taejun is a human alarm clock.

244
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,794
Let's clock out exactly on time
and go home!

245
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:46,380
Gosh.

246
00:16:46,463 --> 00:16:50,300
Dang it. Hey. Don't tell anyone
that you're an athlete.

247
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:53,262
Look at that gut. What is that?

248
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:56,515
I have just enough muscle
and just enough sex appeal.

249
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:59,143
This is the ideal guy's body.

250
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:02,187
You're good at everything else
but judging guys.

251
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:03,689
You're in trouble.

252
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:05,899
I can't get used to a co-ed team.

253
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:07,860
Taejun!

254
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:10,654
Take off your shirt.
Let's see how hard you trained.

255
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:11,697
You first.

256
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:14,950
-What the heck?
-Aren't you cold?

257
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:18,037
-Will you take it off?
-I can. I can take it off.

258
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,455
What are you doing?

259
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:22,875
Don't do it, Youngsim.
You're way too sexy. Don't do it.

260
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:28,547
What are you doing?

261
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:31,467
I was watching…
I mean, I was looking for you.

262
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:37,097
Hey.

263
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:39,767
You're rock hard.

264
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,226
It's so hard.

265
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:44,354
Taejun, stop flexing.

266
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:46,607
I'm not flexing.

267
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:48,817
Your face looks like
it's about to explode.

268
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:51,028
It looks like it's about to explode.

269
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:52,654
Hey…

270
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:56,742
What's this?

271
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:02,790
I have to get calluses quickly.

272
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:06,710
So partner, practice with me, okay?

273
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:08,962
I only have time at night
because of training.

274
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:10,380
So let's practice tonight.

275
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:13,050
I have plans.

276
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:15,552
You do?
I don't have anyone to practice with.

277
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:17,221
That's your problem.

278
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:21,975
Also. I really wasn't flexing.

279
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:29,066
Hey. Can't you help me out? I'm serious.

280
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:31,527
So am I. I'm going to play seriously.

281
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:34,947
PARK TAEJUN

282
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:55,384
So annoying…

283
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:59,012
What is it?
Is your ex-husband in the news again?

284
00:19:01,431 --> 00:19:03,433
Oh. You're buying clothes for Hana?

285
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:05,811
I don't know her size.

286
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,939
That's God's way of telling you
not to buy it.

287
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:13,819
To be honest, the color's really tacky,

288
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:15,154
and it looks cheap.

289
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:17,114
Don't you know what kids like?

290
00:19:17,197 --> 00:19:18,949
See? The price is cheap.

291
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:29,585
You're right. I don't know
my daughter's size or what she likes.

292
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:32,629
I see her only once every two weeks.

293
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:36,842
Look at this.

294
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:39,344
-Hey. It's dusty.
-Look at this.

295
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:41,680
When was this last washed? It's so dusty.

296
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:42,848
I'll do that.

297
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:45,058
Sungsil. I need you to make
a convenience store run.

298
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:46,518
-I want cup noodles.
-Okay.

299
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:48,812
I'll go.

300
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:01,617
The person you have reached
is not available.

301
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:04,536
Why won't you pick up?

302
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,121
Yo, Taejun.

303
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:07,915
Hey.

304
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:10,334
What are you doing?
You're the one who called me here.

305
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:12,502
You begged me to come out
since you had nowhere to go.

306
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:14,713
But you keep checking your phone
while we're drinking.

307
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:16,757
Freeze.

308
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:19,301
What's this?

309
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,179
You called a girl.

310
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:24,097
I did not.

311
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:25,515
Why you…

312
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:30,938
"I'm drunk. Where are you?"

313
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:32,856
"I miss you."

314
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:35,859
"Can I come to you?"

315
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:38,570
That was what you were trying to do,
wasn't it? It's obvious.

316
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:40,739
-Whatever.
-Look at you. Are you flustered?

317
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:43,116
I got you. Don't run away.

318
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:49,206
I think Taejun has a girlfriend.

319
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:52,042
-What?
-Lucky you.

320
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:54,878
Whatever. I'm going to go out
with a frail girl.

321
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:56,380
Someone under 30.

322
00:20:56,463 --> 00:20:58,090
Right. Is she an athlete?

323
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:01,385
Is she on your team?

324
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:03,512
That's why he went to Yunis.

325
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:05,055
-You punk.
-No, it's not.

326
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,183
PARK TAEYANG

00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:09,434
-Is that her?
-Get off.

328
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:10,602
Hey.

329
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,938
Hi, this is Taejun's friend.

330
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:14,815
-Hey.
-We're at Prebird nearby.

331
00:21:14,898 --> 00:21:18,110
Taejun is plastered.
Can you come pick him up?

332
00:21:18,193 --> 00:21:20,487
-Please come!
-Please come!

333
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:21,655
We'll be waiting.

334
00:21:21,738 --> 00:21:23,782
Hey. What are you doing?

335
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:25,492
Hey!

336
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:28,745
What's the problem? It's waterproof.

337
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:30,747
You can't use your phone
until your girl comes.

338
00:21:32,332 --> 00:21:33,667
My phone isn't waterproof.

339
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,591
-Hold him back.
-Yo.

340
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:43,468
-Hey!
-Get over here!

341
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,804
-Calm down.
-Sorry.

342
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:47,264
Let go of me.

343
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:58,317
Why isn't Taejun answering his phone?

344
00:22:01,903 --> 00:22:04,281
-Hey.
-Let's go.

345
00:22:04,364 --> 00:22:05,490
She won't come.

346
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:07,784
It's past curfew. Why would she come here?

347
00:22:08,368 --> 00:22:09,453
We're not like that.

348
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:11,872
Still, we need to see her--

349
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:14,416
-Hey. Get lost.
-Let's go!

350
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:16,168
Hey. Call me when you get a new phone.

351
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:18,712
-Get lost.
-Let's go! Let's go!

352
00:22:18,795 --> 00:22:19,671
Bye.

353
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:22,632
You punk. You're so bad.

354
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:25,761
Let's go to my place.

355
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:31,683
Sorry.

356
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:34,686
I need something to sober up.
The strongest you have.

357
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:37,105
And mouthwash too. The strongest you have.

358
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:40,442
Let's see…

359
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:50,619
She should be here by now.

360
00:22:53,288 --> 00:22:54,581
Is she really not going to come?

361
00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:58,085
Good going, Taejun.

362
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:03,131
Your friend sounded all pompous.

363
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:04,299
Did he dump you here?

364
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:06,635
Yes, he left me.

365
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,721
I thought you were wasted.

366
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:11,681
You look like you can make it back alone.

367
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:18,313
I waited for you
in case we missed each other.

368
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:23,110
What if you came and I wasn't here?

369
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:26,738
I felt like you'd come.

370
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:34,496
I shouldn't have come.

371
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:36,164
It's way past curfew.

372
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,166
You came though.

373
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:39,835
My sweet Taeyang came

374
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:42,379
because I called.

375
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:43,964
You were worried about me.

376
00:23:58,395 --> 00:23:59,396
Let's go.

377
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:01,106
Okay.

378
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:21,626
Since you came all this way
to pick me up, here's a gift.

379
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:23,253
It just broke.

380
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:24,963
Did you wreck your phone?

381
00:24:25,046 --> 00:24:26,715
You'll kick yourself tomorrow.

382
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:29,468
What? Do you want to kick a ball?

383
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:31,052
You like hitting and kicking.

384
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:33,889
Wait.

385
00:24:35,223 --> 00:24:37,058
Want me to pull this out for your room?

386
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:39,394
Say the word. I'll do anything you ask.

387
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:40,812
Yes, pull it out for me.

388
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:43,231
It's very dark in my room.
Pull it out right now.

389
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:44,649
Okay. Sure.

390
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:47,986
So then… I need to pull out
this streetlamp, so…

391
00:24:57,078 --> 00:24:59,414
This is yours, so you carry it.

392
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:01,333
We should carry our own bags.

393
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:02,501
What is it?

394
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:04,711
For your hand.

395
00:25:04,794 --> 00:25:08,548
OINTMENT

396
00:25:10,383 --> 00:25:11,343
Hey.

397
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:13,803
Seriously…

398
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:20,644
Do you think ointment is like fruit?
Why'd you buy so many?

399
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:24,689
You should've just practiced with me.

400
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:27,275
I did it so you can rest.

401
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:30,403
You can't hold a racket with that hand.

402
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:33,907
Don't you feel bad for your hand?

403
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:37,244
No. It's humiliating

404
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:39,579
that an athlete has such pretty hands.

405
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:45,210
To be honest, they're not pretty.

406
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:49,798
They're cool.

407
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:56,429
You're cool.

408
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:01,017
It's cool how you try hard
without doubting yourself.

409
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:03,853
Am I right?

410
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:07,941
Are you cool or not? You're cool, right?

411
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:10,235
I should've grabbed that.
Should I go back?

412
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:12,571
You should work hard too.

413
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:14,781
You're a player, not a spectator.

414
00:26:22,622 --> 00:26:23,790
Like I haven't tried?

415
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:30,130
I tried as much as I could.
Why does everyone tell me to try?

416
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:44,019
You have talent. I mean it.

417
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:48,356
Know what the most annoying thing
in the world is?

418
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:50,066
What?

419
00:26:53,194 --> 00:26:54,279
Being slightly talented.

420
00:26:57,866 --> 00:26:59,618
You think you aren't good, don't you?

421
00:27:01,536 --> 00:27:02,746
Taejun.

422
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:05,582
Do you know what happens
when it rains in the desert?

423
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:09,586
Flowers bloom. Amazing ones.

424
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:15,592
You're like the desert.

425
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:17,761
It just hasn't rained yet.

426
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:24,559
Try appreciating your talent
half as much as you appreciate mine.

427
00:27:24,934 --> 00:27:27,145
You would've been huge by now if you had.

428
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:28,605
What?

429
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:31,608
Like a pretty good player
on a company team?

430
00:27:32,567 --> 00:27:33,652
No.

431
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:37,822
The best.

432
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:26,705
Park Taejun wins the gold medal!

433
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:30,667
Korea's Park Taejun
has won the gold in the Olympics!

434
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:34,087
Park Taejun claims
the gold medal and the glory.

435
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:36,756
Amazing. I'm so proud of him.

436
00:28:58,194 --> 00:29:00,113
Of course, I had a dream too.

437
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:02,991
But…

438
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:05,994
dreams are only for nighttime.

439
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,807
What are you eating?

440
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:11,684
Do you eat double portions
in your dream too?

441
00:30:12,852 --> 00:30:14,521
What is she dreaming about?

442
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:33,414
Hey. You shouldn't…

443
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:00,692
Stop eating.

444
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:03,903
Just sleep. Sleep in your dream too.

445
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,408
What?

446
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:15,665
You rolled over here.

447
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,422
What were you eating in your dream?

448
00:31:22,505 --> 00:31:23,548
My dream?

449
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:38,354
Kiss…

450
00:31:38,938 --> 00:31:39,898
Kiss?

451
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:42,859
No. No! No.

452
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:47,363
I meant I dreamt about growing!
About growing really tall!

453
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:48,781
You know what I mean.

454
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:52,410
I'm still unhappy with my height
and have dreams like that.

455
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:54,621
You've already stopped growing.

456
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:56,789
I have. I've stopped growing for good.

457
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,542
But it's a dream. What can I do?
Dreams are your subconscious.

458
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:02,754
My subconscious?

459
00:32:03,963 --> 00:32:05,089
Do I want that?

460
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:10,511
Stop it. Stop. You're being loud.

461
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:12,096
Let's have a peaceful morning.

462
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:19,771
I think it's good.

463
00:32:19,854 --> 00:32:22,357
-We should try using it.
-I think we should… oops.

464
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:36,955
Am I still drunk or something?

465
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:39,207
What am I looking at here?

466
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:40,625
"Yuk Junghwan

467
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:43,419
hosts national badminton tournament
in Wando to celebrate dominating Asia."

468
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:46,589
Jeez. Yuk Junghwan
is becoming insufferable.

469
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:49,008
This little punk.

470
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:03,940
Why isn't my blind date coming?

471
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:07,443
Oh.

472
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:14,158
Oh, no. She had messaged me.

473
00:33:15,284 --> 00:33:16,995
I'm so sorry.

474
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:18,955
She's sick and can't make it.

475
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:23,167
I feel bad splitting like this.

476
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:27,296
I'll buy lunch. How about drinks?

477
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,464
What for?

478
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:31,342
I came to meet your friend,
not hang out with you.

479
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:34,804
You act like you're into her already
when you haven't even met.

480
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:36,931
Did you marry her in your mind already?

481
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:38,391
Hi, Coach.

482
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:40,309
-My dad?
-Hi, Junghwan.

483
00:33:40,393 --> 00:33:41,477
My dad?

484
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:43,938
Where are you?

485
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:45,231
You punk!

486
00:33:45,648 --> 00:33:48,234
You need to come in to train
until you go to the training center.

487
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:51,654
Anyway, whatever. So…

488
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:53,740
What is this?

489
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:55,783
Isn't the poster cool?

490
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:57,994
Simply put,

491
00:33:58,119 --> 00:34:01,205
my dad wanted to brag about his son
and caused a fuss.

492
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:03,541
And he's a bigwig in the area.

493
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:07,962
Many top athletes hold competitions
in their names.

494
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:11,507
Junghwan, why are you
getting so ahead of yourself?

495
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:15,511
These things are done
by gold medalists like me.

496
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:16,888
But even I don't do that.

497
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:20,099
People will laugh.

498
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:24,395
I'm saying this
out of concern for you, kid.

499
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,981
Can you send two of our teams
to the competition?

500
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:31,694
And I'll put your daughter on.

501
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:33,863
-Why are you putting her on?
-Say hi.

502
00:34:34,697 --> 00:34:35,740
My daughter?

503
00:34:36,282 --> 00:34:38,493
Yu… Yumin!

504
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:39,952
Dad. Sorry.

505
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:42,622
-I'll explain later.
-Why are you with him? Hey--

506
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:50,922
What's this? Why are they together?

507
00:34:52,381 --> 00:34:54,509
What are they doing?
What do you think they're doing?

508
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,010
-They're together again?
-Yes.

509
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:57,929
-She said sorry?
-She said sorry.

510
00:34:59,305 --> 00:35:02,016
What are you thinking it is?
Damn it! It's not like that!

511
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,684
My sister suddenly did that too--

512
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:05,686
-Why you… Hey.
-Yes?

513
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:06,771
Hold on.

514
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:14,320
What? Can't you be with me?

515
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:18,950
Wouldn't he be happy
that you have high-quality friends?

516
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:23,204
I'll apologize then.

517
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:27,542
That's not the point.

518
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:29,418
Your dad is a bigwig?

519
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:34,048
How amazing is your family
that you have no respect for my dad?

520
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:35,967
My dad's a gold medalist.

521
00:35:37,009 --> 00:35:39,428
What did your family do
to bring honor to the nation?

522
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:42,807
He made Korean abalone popular
all across the globe.

523
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:44,183
Abalone?

524
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:46,936
Are you talking about… friend to the clam?

525
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:48,688
My parents have an abalone fishery.

526
00:35:48,771 --> 00:35:51,274
I'm the Prince of Wando. Wando swag.

527
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:57,321
YUK JUNGHWAN HOSTS
NATIONAL BADMINTON TOURNAMENT IN WANDO

528
00:36:04,036 --> 00:36:07,331
What can we do? A fellow teammate
is hosting the tournament.

529
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:09,959
Let's have two teams go.

530
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:11,919
Any volunteers?

531
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:16,465
-We can have sushi and get some fresh air.
-We're too good for that.

532
00:36:17,049 --> 00:36:18,217
Coach.

533
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:21,220
Why should we go
to that ridiculous tournament?

534
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:25,266
Like there would be
any decent players competing?

535
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:26,601
I'll go.

536
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:30,062
I really want to go!

537
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:31,397
We'll go too.

538
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:34,400
We're the youngest. We should
sacrifice ourselves for the team.

539
00:36:34,483 --> 00:36:38,196
Me too. Of course, I should go
if it's for the team.

540
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:39,572
-Yes.
-Yes.

541
00:36:40,781 --> 00:36:42,909
You two prepare for the corporate league.

542
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:45,536
Let's have the Park twins go.

543
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:46,871
-What?
-What?

544
00:36:46,954 --> 00:36:47,830
That's all. Dismissed.

545
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:50,041
Yes, sir.

546
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:54,629
STRAWBERRIES

547
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:57,131
Yuk Junghwan's competition? What a joke.

548
00:36:57,465 --> 00:36:59,634
Still, I think it would be fun to go.

549
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:01,010
Fun? Whatever.

550
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:03,804
Why would you go to a tournament
in some hick town?

551
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:05,389
We have Taeyang.

552
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:07,767
Make her go to all the tournaments

553
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:10,019
and annoying events
that you don't want to go to.

554
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:11,938
She should earn her pay.

555
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:16,150
Excuse me.

556
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:18,736
Are you making a delivery?

557
00:37:19,862 --> 00:37:20,696
No…

558
00:37:21,697 --> 00:37:22,990
I'm Park Taeyang's dad.

559
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:31,249
Would you please get her for me?

560
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:34,335
I don't know where she is.

561
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:38,089
I'll give her a call then.

562
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:43,970
Anyway, I got these strawberries
from a friend's greenhouse.

563
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:45,638
Please share them among yourselves.

564
00:37:46,889 --> 00:37:48,099
And…

565
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:52,228
please be nice to Taeyang.

566
00:38:02,488 --> 00:38:03,489
Huh?

567
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:16,252
Stop acting like a PTA member, you punk.

568
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:21,132
Hey.

569
00:38:24,885 --> 00:38:27,138
Yes, I started badminton because of you.

570
00:38:27,596 --> 00:38:29,807
But I did better afterward.

571
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:33,019
Hey. Do you really think we compare?

572
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:37,064
Punk. How could you
never acknowledge that even once?

573
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:40,860
If only our family hadn't gone bankrupt…

574
00:38:42,236 --> 00:38:45,823
Hey. Even if you had continued…

575
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:47,825
Why do I bother?

576
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:53,581
Taeyang is suffering
because you're so pigheaded.

577
00:38:54,623 --> 00:38:56,417
Why did you make her offer a bribe?

578
00:38:57,668 --> 00:38:58,878
What bribe?

579
00:38:58,961 --> 00:39:02,340
You made Taeyang give up her career
because of your greed.

580
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:04,216
She gets no respect from the others.

581
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,676
Snap out of it.

582
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,804
If you show up out of nowhere like this,

583
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:10,514
how do you think it'll make her look?

584
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:12,433
-What do you mean?
-Like you don't know?

585
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:13,476
Dad.

586
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,605
Dad.

587
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:35,831
It's just a bad rumor.
Don't worry about it.

588
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:39,627
And why are you just taking it?

589
00:39:40,669 --> 00:39:43,964
Are you really not going to tell me
why you ran away three years ago?

590
00:39:45,591 --> 00:39:48,427
You disappeared after sending
one text saying you're sorry,

591
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:50,763
but I never asked why.

592
00:39:50,846 --> 00:39:52,848
At first, I thought you were in a slump.

593
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:55,976
Then I thought maybe you were injured.
Maybe you got in trouble.

594
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,895
All sorts of thoughts ran through my head,

595
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:00,523
but I assumed you'd tell me someday.

596
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:04,610
I came back as you wanted.

597
00:40:04,693 --> 00:40:06,028
That's what matters.

598
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:10,491
You're saying you'll never tell me.

599
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:13,327
That I should stay out of it, right?

600
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:16,747
How could you repay me like this
after how I raised you?

601
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:21,168
Exactly. It's because I know
how you raised me.

602
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:25,089
I need to repay you.
I don't want you to know what I did wrong.

603
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:28,008
You brat.

604
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:32,596
This brat is going to go train.

605
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:39,228
I just gave them

606
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:42,189
a whole bunch of strawberries!

607
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:45,401
Stand tall!

608
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:53,075
Like anyone would eat them.

609
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:02,334
RESIDENCE HALL C

610
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:06,755
Tonight is the highlight
of winter training, nighttime hiking…

611
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:10,092
which was canceled
because of the frozen ground.

612
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:13,053
-Yes!
-Don't go anywhere.

613
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:15,973
Behave and rest in the residence hall.

614
00:41:16,056 --> 00:41:18,726
And remember. No alcohol.

615
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:19,643
Dismissed.

616
00:41:21,103 --> 00:41:22,688
Yay, Junyoung!

617
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:24,940
It's cold. Hurry inside.

618
00:41:31,697 --> 00:41:34,158
Junyoung. Come with me.

619
00:41:34,241 --> 00:41:36,869
-No.
-Come with me.

620
00:41:36,952 --> 00:41:38,746
Go by yourself.

621
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:43,125
-Will you still refuse? Come with me.
-Stop it.

622
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:44,919
-Will you come with me or not?
-Okay.

623
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:47,713
Stop it. Seriously!

624
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:52,176
Where?

625
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:56,388
One, two, three!

626
00:42:03,729 --> 00:42:04,855
Wow.

627
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:07,316
It's completely empty.

628
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:09,568
It's amazing.

629
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:11,237
Isn't it?

630
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:14,573
They're opening for the season
this weekend.

631
00:42:14,657 --> 00:42:15,991
Aren't you glad you came?

632
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:20,412
Taeyang! You can go boarding if you want!

633
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:21,330
Okay!

634
00:42:24,416 --> 00:42:27,086
He's a friend from school.
We're not that close, actually.

635
00:42:28,337 --> 00:42:30,548
I cozied up to him a bit.

636
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:34,718
This is really awesome.

637
00:42:37,137 --> 00:42:38,222
Here.

638
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:45,312
I wanted to drink with you.

639
00:42:46,146 --> 00:42:49,191
You've lost your mind. What's wrong?

640
00:42:49,858 --> 00:42:51,193
Are you having a tough time?

641
00:42:56,699 --> 00:42:58,492
I'm not, but you are.

642
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:01,996
You've been under a lot of stress lately.

643
00:43:03,122 --> 00:43:05,249
Be good to the 24-year-old Park Junyoung,

644
00:43:05,332 --> 00:43:08,002
not just the national team member
Park Junyoung.

645
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:10,796
I feel sorry for her.

646
00:43:12,715 --> 00:43:16,385
So let's go crazy today!

647
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:20,139
Thanks.

648
00:43:37,531 --> 00:43:39,992
You've got talent.
That's good for your first time.

649
00:43:40,993 --> 00:43:41,952
Oh, no.

650
00:43:55,215 --> 00:43:58,052
Hey. I don't think I can do it.

651
00:43:58,927 --> 00:44:02,348
I've been drinking, and you're drunk too.

652
00:44:02,598 --> 00:44:04,933
We can't walk down though.

653
00:44:05,142 --> 00:44:08,437
We can go slowly, little by little.

654
00:44:08,937 --> 00:44:10,439
There's no one here.

655
00:44:10,939 --> 00:44:13,692
I'm starting to get a little annoyed.

656
00:44:14,902 --> 00:44:16,862
Shoot. Seriously.

657
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:22,826
I knew she'd get back on it.

658
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:25,996
That's it! You got it!

659
00:44:26,288 --> 00:44:28,832
Lower your stance a little!

660
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:32,711
I'm coming!
I'm going to speed up a little!

661
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:27,933
SEND MESSAGE

662
00:45:30,227 --> 00:45:33,439
Hey, Junyoung. Are you still in Spain?

663
00:45:34,022 --> 00:45:35,399
At least let me know you're alive.

664
00:45:36,191 --> 00:45:37,526
Mom and Dad are worried.

665
00:45:39,027 --> 00:45:40,154
Are you doing well?

666
00:45:41,029 --> 00:45:43,073
I'm still as pathetic as ever,

667
00:45:43,615 --> 00:45:45,159
collecting sneakers.

668
00:45:52,666 --> 00:45:54,376
1 WEEK AGO

669
00:45:56,462 --> 00:46:01,800
If I don't hear from you within a week,

670
00:46:01,925 --> 00:46:04,344
I swear I'll kill you.

671
00:46:09,725 --> 00:46:11,977
Hey. I can't fall asleep.

672
00:46:12,478 --> 00:46:13,896
Why not?

673
00:46:13,979 --> 00:46:15,355
Were you watching something bad?

674
00:46:15,898 --> 00:46:17,107
Something bad but good?

675
00:46:19,568 --> 00:46:20,569
Whatever.

676
00:46:20,652 --> 00:46:23,363
Did you see Taeyang?

677
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:25,157
How is she? I feel really bad.

678
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:26,742
No. Why?

679
00:46:27,326 --> 00:46:28,410
You must not know.

680
00:46:43,675 --> 00:46:45,052
Don't quit. Finish it all.

681
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:49,014
Why did I have to open my big mouth?

682
00:46:51,016 --> 00:46:53,435
I really can't eat anymore.

683
00:46:54,478 --> 00:46:56,563
I'm going to explode.

684
00:46:57,940 --> 00:46:59,483
If you don't empty this bowl,

685
00:47:00,067 --> 00:47:01,318
I'll expose that you're dating.

686
00:47:05,364 --> 00:47:06,698
-Dang it.
-Dang it.

687
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:08,408
I know it's not fair.

688
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:11,662
He brought it for everyone,
but no one will touch it.

689
00:47:11,745 --> 00:47:13,080
That's much worse.

690
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:22,840
We came to have some strawberries,
but they were already gone.

691
00:47:23,674 --> 00:47:27,010
How could they finish it all
without telling us? How mean, right?

692
00:47:27,469 --> 00:47:29,638
We didn't get to have any.

693
00:47:29,721 --> 00:47:31,181
We didn't even get a taste.

694
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:32,558
Yeah.

695
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:35,519
I thought no one would eat them.

696
00:47:37,062 --> 00:47:39,523
You must be hungry.
Want to order some food?

697
00:47:40,649 --> 00:47:43,277
Why don't they want to eat?
I said I'd treat them.

698
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:44,820
If we have chicken,

699
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:47,906
we'll have to run 20 laps here.

700
00:47:54,246 --> 00:47:55,247
What?

701
00:47:57,165 --> 00:47:59,126
I'm going to practice a little more.

702
00:48:00,043 --> 00:48:02,421
You're not going
to Junghwan's tourney, are you?

703
00:48:02,504 --> 00:48:03,505
Of course not.

704
00:48:04,423 --> 00:48:06,383
I'll tell them we won't go.

705
00:48:06,967 --> 00:48:09,386
-I'm going.
-You are? Why?

706
00:48:09,469 --> 00:48:10,596
The team told us to go.

707
00:48:11,179 --> 00:48:12,264
But I'm not going.

708
00:48:12,347 --> 00:48:13,974
I know. I figured.

709
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:17,019
I'm saying that I'll go alone.

710
00:48:18,645 --> 00:48:19,855
Without me? How?

711
00:48:20,439 --> 00:48:24,151
Well… I'll ask anybody on the street
to play with me.

712
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:26,778
Don't be stupid.

713
00:48:27,362 --> 00:48:30,782
Taeyang. I really don't want to go there.

714
00:48:30,866 --> 00:48:33,368
Goodness. Don't worry.

715
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:36,663
I'll handle all the degrading
and annoying stuff.

716
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:38,874
You only do the good stuff, okay?

717
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:41,752
Don't touch my butt. Gross.

718
00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:43,670
Don't cross the line.

719
00:48:44,463 --> 00:48:45,631
Exactly.

720
00:48:50,469 --> 00:48:52,095
Here's the line.

721
00:49:15,077 --> 00:49:18,830
I keep crossing this line and end up
going to you because I can't see it.

722
00:49:24,753 --> 00:49:26,713
There's something I can't forget,

723
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:30,300
but I keep forgetting it
when I'm with you.

724
00:49:31,176 --> 00:49:32,803
I keep laughing,

725
00:49:33,762 --> 00:49:35,764
depend on you, and ask you for favors.

726
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:43,814
Why am I so comfortable around you?

727
00:49:44,398 --> 00:49:45,649
Have I lost my mind?

728
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:51,738
Isn't that a good thing?

729
00:49:58,036 --> 00:49:59,746
Being comfortable when I'm with you…

730
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:03,667
makes me uncomfortable.

731
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:09,214
I don't want to do that anymore.

732
00:50:21,643 --> 00:50:23,145
Go to the tourney alone.

733
00:50:27,983 --> 00:50:29,484
You're going to practice, right?

734
00:50:31,194 --> 00:50:32,237
Later.

735
00:50:36,116 --> 00:50:38,118
Don't get mad though!

736
00:50:38,201 --> 00:50:41,246
Why would I get mad
when I don't know what you mean?

737
00:50:41,329 --> 00:50:44,416
I need to know what you're talking about
in order to get mad. Train hard!

738
00:51:10,817 --> 00:51:11,818
It's burning up!

739
00:51:19,701 --> 00:51:20,786
Shut that off!

740
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:24,706
What the heck's wrong with you?

741
00:51:25,999 --> 00:51:28,126
But this is the guys' dorm.

742
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:31,129
She killed the mood.
Let's start it back up.

743
00:51:35,258 --> 00:51:36,301
Why are you going to Wando?

744
00:51:38,595 --> 00:51:42,307
Why are you going there with Taeyang?

745
00:51:43,183 --> 00:51:46,228
Hey. Even if
Taeyang did something terrible,

746
00:51:46,311 --> 00:51:48,480
she's going in our place.
I can't ignore her.

747
00:51:48,563 --> 00:51:50,107
I'm the captain after all.

748
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:51,942
They think the captain is a chump.

749
00:51:53,318 --> 00:51:55,862
-That's why they keep--
-I'm old

750
00:51:55,946 --> 00:51:59,116
and in the way of the younger teammates.
I should at least be a chump.

751
00:52:01,743 --> 00:52:04,704
I'll bring you some abalone. Youngsim.

752
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:12,337
WANDO ARENA

753
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:14,005
Good. He's here.

754
00:52:14,756 --> 00:52:17,926
-Well, look at him.
-He's here. Junghwan's here.

755
00:52:18,718 --> 00:52:20,929
-Look.
-I can't believe it.

756
00:52:21,012 --> 00:52:23,473
What a nice car.

757
00:52:23,557 --> 00:52:27,978
Seriously, Dad. Did you
have to make such a big deal out of it?

758
00:52:28,061 --> 00:52:29,563
This is huge.

759
00:52:30,313 --> 00:52:32,357
That's my pull in this town.

760
00:52:33,108 --> 00:52:35,694
Your hometown should support you
at least this much.

761
00:52:37,154 --> 00:52:38,155
Did you eat?

762
00:52:39,698 --> 00:52:40,866
No. I'm starving.

763
00:52:45,871 --> 00:52:51,585
WANDO INTERCITY BUS TERMINAL

764
00:52:57,674 --> 00:52:59,384
We're in Junghwan's hometown.

765
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:01,887
This is what you call a true pilgrimage.

766
00:53:02,345 --> 00:53:05,682
-Seriously. Cut it out.
-Hold on.

767
00:53:07,475 --> 00:53:08,310
Stop it.

768
00:53:09,686 --> 00:53:12,314
Taeyang. What's wrong with your leg?

769
00:53:12,397 --> 00:53:15,483
I'm wearing new sneakers,
and they're kind of uncomfortable.

770
00:53:15,567 --> 00:53:18,236
Who gets new sneakers just before a match?

771
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:20,113
To blame them if you lose?

772
00:53:20,197 --> 00:53:21,781
My old ones fell apart.

773
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:23,533
How many have you gone through already?

774
00:53:23,617 --> 00:53:26,453
I guess that's how hard I worked.

775
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:32,417
-Let's go.
-Okay.

776
00:53:36,796 --> 00:53:37,756
Hey.

777
00:53:39,257 --> 00:53:41,635
I know it was my idea to go,

778
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:44,512
but how could you not drive once
the entire way to Wando?

779
00:53:46,598 --> 00:53:47,766
Are you sleeping?

780
00:53:50,810 --> 00:53:51,978
Shoot.

781
00:53:53,396 --> 00:53:54,439
Sleep.

782
00:53:56,524 --> 00:53:58,485
What am I doing?

783
00:54:28,807 --> 00:54:31,893
Hold a tourney in your hometown later on.

784
00:54:32,894 --> 00:54:35,939
I want a gold necklace from you.
A gold medal.

785
00:54:39,651 --> 00:54:41,569
I should've just bought her a necklace.

786
00:54:42,862 --> 00:54:44,906
I want to meet your parents

787
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:46,908
and see where you grew up.

788
00:55:50,972 --> 00:55:52,515
The team told me to come.

789
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:54,642
I can see why.

790
00:55:56,269 --> 00:55:57,687
So you really came?

791
00:55:59,064 --> 00:56:02,650
Why didn't I know back then
how self-centered you were?

792
00:56:02,734 --> 00:56:05,737
-Why did Junyoung--
-Are you in touch with her?

793
00:56:06,446 --> 00:56:08,948
If you are, let me see her just once.

794
00:56:10,283 --> 00:56:11,951
You're really annoying me.

795
00:56:13,495 --> 00:56:14,746
Are you in touch?

796
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:16,539
Three years.

797
00:56:18,166 --> 00:56:20,794
Those three years were probably
not long enough for her

798
00:56:20,877 --> 00:56:23,671
to get anything in order
or start anything, unlike someone else.

799
00:56:23,755 --> 00:56:25,882
That's probably why
she hasn't contacted us.

800
00:56:30,553 --> 00:56:32,806
We're not over what happened yet.

801
00:56:34,307 --> 00:56:35,809
Then get past it.

802
00:56:37,268 --> 00:56:39,104
Sorry about you two breaking up.

803
00:56:44,984 --> 00:56:46,528
I hate your guts.

804
00:56:48,613 --> 00:56:50,031
Don't say that so easily.

805
00:56:55,954 --> 00:56:57,330
To be honest,

806
00:56:58,415 --> 00:57:00,417
I don't remember much about that incident.

807
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:05,088
I'm happy that I started
playing badminton again. It's fun.

808
00:57:06,756 --> 00:57:08,633
I'm being shameless and doing well.

809
00:57:09,634 --> 00:57:13,179
Why are you suffering more
when you're the victim?

810
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:14,431
Right.

811
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:17,225
I was a victim.

812
00:57:26,234 --> 00:57:27,527
Let me ask you something.

813
00:57:28,945 --> 00:57:32,073
There isn't a day
that I don't think about Junyoung.

814
00:57:32,907 --> 00:57:35,201
But I can't see her, call her,

815
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:37,954
or even find out
whether or not she's alive.

816
00:57:39,122 --> 00:57:41,166
I can't handle it anymore,

817
00:57:42,542 --> 00:57:44,169
so should I forget her?

818
00:57:45,128 --> 00:57:46,421
What do you think?

819
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:50,675
It was your fault,
but you erased it from your memory.

820
00:57:50,758 --> 00:57:52,343
Should I forget her too? Then…

821
00:57:55,013 --> 00:57:56,848
Then who will remember her?

822
00:58:00,518 --> 00:58:03,480
Who will feel sorry for her?
Who will wait for our Junyoung?

823
00:58:04,355 --> 00:58:05,440
Junghwan.

824
00:58:11,112 --> 00:58:13,781
Even if I'm not forgiven
for as long as I live,

825
00:58:14,866 --> 00:58:16,326
I'll get past it somehow.

826
00:58:17,994 --> 00:58:19,871
Because it was a horrible accident
for me too.

827
00:58:19,954 --> 00:58:21,706
You weren't the victim of the accident.

828
00:58:21,789 --> 00:58:23,583
You caused it, Taeyang!

829
00:58:23,666 --> 00:58:25,835
And how long will you
continue living like this?

830
00:58:28,004 --> 00:58:30,048
Forget it or don't. Whatever. Just…

831
00:58:33,885 --> 00:58:35,762
Just shake it off.

832
00:58:35,845 --> 00:58:36,930
Why?

833
00:58:37,805 --> 00:58:40,475
Because you should be happier than me.

834
00:58:41,643 --> 00:58:42,810
Are you stupid?

835
00:59:10,255 --> 00:59:12,340
Junyoung! Are you okay?

836
00:59:15,802 --> 00:59:17,136
My leg.

837
00:59:17,762 --> 00:59:20,390
Your leg? Why? Does it hurt?

838
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:21,933
A little.

839
00:59:23,685 --> 00:59:24,894
It'll be fine.

840
00:59:29,065 --> 00:59:30,024
NATIONAL TEAM COACH

841
00:59:30,108 --> 00:59:31,651
It's Coach.

842
00:59:36,155 --> 00:59:37,657
Hello, Coach.

843
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:40,034
Where are you? Aren't you in the dorm?

844
00:59:40,118 --> 00:59:42,370
I was in the dorm all night
and came out for a stroll

845
00:59:42,453 --> 00:59:45,206
because I couldn't fall asleep.
I'm heading back now.

846
00:59:46,291 --> 00:59:47,667
Yes, Coach.

847
00:59:51,546 --> 00:59:54,674
Coach must've come by our room.
What do we do?

848
01:00:01,681 --> 01:00:02,849
Thank goodness.

849
01:00:03,683 --> 01:00:06,728
Let's take that down the mountain
and go straight to a hospital.

850
01:00:06,811 --> 01:00:07,937
Forget it.

851
01:00:08,313 --> 01:00:11,107
You said you were by the dorm.
What excuse will you make?

852
01:00:16,070 --> 01:00:17,363
Over here.

853
01:00:21,993 --> 01:00:22,994
Junyoung.

854
01:00:23,536 --> 01:00:25,121
Why did you go hiking alone at night?

855
01:00:25,413 --> 01:00:26,914
We told you the ground was frozen.

856
01:00:33,963 --> 01:00:34,922
I'm sorry.

857
01:00:41,429 --> 01:00:45,975
Listen. "Park Junyoung suffers an injury
during intense training."

858
01:00:47,852 --> 01:00:49,604
"A tragedy brought on by hard work."

859
01:00:49,771 --> 01:00:52,106
"Badminton's Park Junyoung
injured during winter training."

860
01:00:52,732 --> 01:00:54,859
They say even my willpower
is of national-team caliber.

861
01:00:55,193 --> 01:00:56,444
They hope it's nothing serious.

862
01:00:57,779 --> 01:01:00,198
Hey. Everyone thinks I got hurt

863
01:01:01,157 --> 01:01:03,034
while training alone in the mountains.

864
01:01:03,618 --> 01:01:05,828
Should I say this happened
from snowboarding drunk?

865
01:01:06,412 --> 01:01:09,707
I'm really sorry.
I don't know what to say.

866
01:01:09,791 --> 01:01:11,501
Why did you take her snowboarding?

867
01:01:12,085 --> 01:01:14,796
They said I'll be fine with some rehab.

868
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:16,214
It's not a big deal.

869
01:01:16,798 --> 01:01:19,842
Junghwan, keep your mouth shut.
Don't blow things out of proportion.

870
01:01:20,635 --> 01:01:22,970
Not even my family knows about this.

871
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:51,124
SEA OF IMAGINATION HOTEL

872
01:02:19,694 --> 01:02:21,529
Why are you here?

873
01:02:28,828 --> 01:02:30,037
To win.

874
01:03:06,157 --> 01:03:07,283
What's wrong?

875
01:03:08,576 --> 01:03:10,495
Were you sad I wasn't here?

876
01:03:14,081 --> 01:03:15,124
Is it…

877
01:03:16,667 --> 01:03:18,294
okay for me to win?

878
01:03:20,588 --> 01:03:23,341
Do I have the right to?

879
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:27,780
GOING TO YOU AT A SPEED OF 493KM

880
01:04:27,864 --> 01:04:30,074
-That's ridiculous.
-Man up front, woman in back?

881
01:04:30,157 --> 01:04:31,909
You want to switch positions?

882
01:04:31,993 --> 01:04:33,244
-Let's push ahead.
-Okay.

883
01:04:33,327 --> 01:04:35,162
They must really want to win.

884
01:04:35,746 --> 01:04:38,040
Trust me as I trust you.

885
01:04:38,124 --> 01:04:39,208
I'm strong.

886
01:04:39,792 --> 01:04:42,461
We'll have a moment
like that someday, right?

887
01:04:43,045 --> 01:04:46,257
The moment we become our strongest selves.

888
01:04:46,799 --> 01:04:49,760
Even if it's an unofficial record of 493.

889
01:04:50,678 --> 01:04:52,805
-Let's win.
-Let's do it even if we don't win.

890
01:05:04,233 --> 01:05:05,359
GOING TO YOU AT A SPEED OF 493KM

891
01:05:05,443 --> 01:05:07,445
