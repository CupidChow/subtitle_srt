1
00:00:37,787 --> 00:00:40,749
GOING TO YOU AT A SPEED OF 493KM

2
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,586
THE PLACES, PEOPLE, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTIONAL

3
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:48,423
EPISODE 13

4
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:38,515
I went out with Taejun.

5
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:44,938
But we broke up.

6
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:49,734
I feel like I should tell you
so that I don't waver.

7
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:54,781
Now, I'll…

8
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:58,409
I'll really get my act together.

9
00:01:59,994 --> 00:02:01,121
Good.

10
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:03,873
I knew you were going out with him.

11
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:11,297
Then why didn't you say anything?

12
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:15,426
Do other dads have a say
in their daughters' love lives?

13
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:18,138
How do they manage that? I'd like to know.

14
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:28,648
Let's move on together.

15
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:32,527
You've moved on. So should I.

16
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:35,738
Move on from what?

17
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:37,490
I should clean out your mom's room.

18
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,285
Let's do it today.

19
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:48,001
-Taeyang will be out for two weeks.
-What? Why?

20
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:52,380
-Why is that?
-What do you think?

21
00:02:53,047 --> 00:02:55,216
For what she posted online.

22
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:59,053
That was her punishment for what she did.
Just so you know.

23
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:04,642
So please, stay off of social media. Okay?

24
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,853
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

25
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:09,814
All court strokes.

26
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:11,482
Darn it.

27
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:14,694
-Too bad for them.
-Let's start.

28
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:17,530
-Okay.
-Okay.

29
00:03:20,783 --> 00:03:23,453
Hey. Forget doing strokes.
Just lob them to me.

30
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:26,664
Fine.

31
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,212
What's gotten into you?

32
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:34,005
You said to lob them to you.

33
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:43,264
What?

34
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:46,434
Why are you doing as I ask? It's weird.

35
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,728
-Should I not?
-That's not it.

36
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:50,396
Then just hit them.

37
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:55,652
Again.

38
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:02,659
Hey.

39
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:05,411
Why did you become nicer
when Taeyang was the one punished?

40
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:07,205
Are you two one person?

41
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:10,083
Is Taeyang doing okay?

42
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:13,211
We broke up.

43
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:16,381
What?

44
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:18,216
We broke up.

45
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:38,820
I miss Mom.

46
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:42,365
Don't you hate her?

47
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,576
She was never nice to you.

48
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:48,371
Look who's talking.

49
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:52,667
She was better than you, to be honest.

50
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:04,804
You know,

51
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:09,142
I thought you didn't like Mom.

52
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:16,274
But when I saw you unable to come in here
after she passed away,

53
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:21,404
I realized you liked her a lot.

54
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,489
I never knew before then.

55
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:27,410
I didn't realize it either.
Not until she was gone.

56
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,496
They say it's too late when you regret it.

57
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:35,126
I wonder if there is anything that ends
which doesn't leave behind regrets.

58
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,717
It's time to clean out the room.

59
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:46,888
I hated seeing you sleep
all scrunched up on the couch.

60
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:52,477
Hey. It's a good thing
you broke up with Taejun.

61
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:55,104
He's Junyoung's brother.

62
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:58,941
I won't be all sappy about it.

63
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:01,069
It's a good thing you broke up.

64
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:07,325
What could you have learned from me
when I'm a sap?

65
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:12,580
Anyway, I'll move on,

66
00:06:12,663 --> 00:06:14,832
so you should too. Got it?

67
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:20,630
Goodness. It feels cathartic.

68
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:23,966
Are you done?

69
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,766
SPORTS BRAND MARKETING

70
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:33,309
SPORTS AND HEALTHY LIVING

71
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:41,859
JUNGHWAN

72
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:51,661
I'm at a bookstore, so I'll--

73
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:53,413
Then can you just listen?

74
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:56,749
It's about Taeyang.

75
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,752
Go on. What is it?

76
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:02,964
Because she explained
what happened to you,

77
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:05,299
Coach Kwon tried to get her fired.

78
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,469
I think

79
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:11,639
she expected to lose everything
when she came clean.

80
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:14,267
So? What happened?

81
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:17,437
Luckily, our coach helped her,
so she's okay.

82
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:18,855
I thought you should know.

83
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:21,941
I'm sure Taejun will comfort her.

84
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:24,777
I know they're seeing each other.

85
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,530
Taeyang and your brother

86
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:29,866
broke up.

87
00:07:31,075 --> 00:07:32,201
What?

88
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:34,996
You know how much Taeyang adored you.

89
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:36,873
She wouldn't wrong you twice.

90
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:40,334
Bye.

91
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:17,872
TRAINING DIARY

92
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,542

Wow. Mr. Hwang. This is such an honor.

110
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:29,271
I get to play with Yook Junghwan
thanks to you.

111
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:32,817
Why don't we stop?
Let's stop. Okay, that's enough.

112
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:34,902
What took you so long?

113
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:39,532
Wait. You should say something
about how well he played.

114
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:41,617
He's really something, isn't he?

115
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:44,036
Yes, he's really something…

116
00:11:44,995 --> 00:11:46,288
bad.

117
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:50,292
Why are you joking around?

118
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:52,878
Are you all here to watch a show?

119
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:54,380
Aren't you going to play?

120
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:58,008
Have fun!

121
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:03,931
You jerk. Get over here.

122
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:06,600
You…

123
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:09,979
You're socially inept.

124
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:12,356
People show you respect
only because you're an athlete.

125
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,608
Hey. I simply stated a fact.

126
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:17,987
Who asked for facts?
You should've given him hope!

127
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:21,073
Will you pay for the memberships
if my dad loses his source of income?

128
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:25,035
If I weren't on probation,
you'd be dead by now.

129
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:27,872
What?

130
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:37,131
Hey. You were back to yourself
from three years ago just now.

131
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:45,014
We used to squabble all the time
back in the day.

132
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:49,643
What's with the sudden comment?
You're reminding me of someone.

133
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:52,396
That was my favorite time in my career.

134
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:55,274
How did we end up like this?

135
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:58,736
Are you trying to make up with me?

136
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:03,532
Then I'm kind of moved.

137
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:07,369
You were a good friend too.

138
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:10,956
Sorry for how I've behaved.

139
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:16,962
Same here.

140
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:24,512
Anyway, do you want to hear about Taejun?

141
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:28,641
I heard that you two broke up.

142
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:30,684
Did he tell you?

143
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:33,521
That was quick.

144
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:35,189
Well, so…

145
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:37,191
If I did something wrong…

146
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:39,777
Let's stop talking about him.

147
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:45,199
DELETE

148
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:05,719
Here.

149
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:10,808
Why isn't this clicking?

150
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:15,938
Hey. You're taking a video.
You're so technically challenged.

151
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:18,816
Give me that.
You can't press the right button?

152
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:26,782
Hey, let's go here later.

153
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,660
Even DiCaprio stayed at this resort.

154
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:32,037
Why do I look worse than in real life?

155
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,167
We have to go to a resort

156
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:40,212
so that we can do nothing
but eat and play.

157
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:42,882
Should I be crazy and book our flight?

158
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:46,719
Well lose our muscles
and suffer like crazy later.

159
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:49,680
I've never traveled abroad before.

160
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:52,057
Me neither, other than for tournaments.

161
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:55,644
That's how it is for athletes.
We don't have time.

162
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:59,315
Just tell yourself this is a resort

163
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:02,192
and that DiCaprio is next door.

164
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:05,446
Come here. Let's take some selfies.

165
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:09,491
Here.

166
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:15,915
Why isn't this clicking?

167
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:21,587
Hey. You're taking a video.
You're so technically challenged.

168
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:24,340
Give me that.
You can't press the right button?

169
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,304
My bad. Sorry.
That must've hurt. That was loud.

170
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:31,680
Are you laughing?

171
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:35,267
-You did that on purpose.
-Why would I?

172
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:37,144
Because we can't go to DiCaprio's resort.

173
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:39,021
Don't start up with me again.

174
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:40,397
Don't try to run away.

175
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:42,983
Get over here. You deserve a noogie.

176
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:45,486
I'm not that easy to catch.

177
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:47,404
And I don't lose my target that easily.

178
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:48,322
Then try to catch me.

179
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:54,328
Get over here.

180
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:56,914
My reflex speed is 0.3 seconds.

181
00:15:57,748 --> 00:15:58,999
I'm so annoyed.

182
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:01,585
You punk.

183
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:05,589
Let's stop.

184
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,883
Okay?

185
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:09,551
This isn't right.

186
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:11,011
-Let's make up.
-No.

187
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:13,097
-Hey.
-Let's make up.

188
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:16,642
-Okay?
-Let go. This is excessive force. Let go.

189
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:28,946
SOLO TRAINING LAST DAY

190
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:36,912
NIGHT - DELETE PICS FROM PHONE. THE END.

191
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:43,752
NIGHT - DELETE PICS FROM PHONE. THE END.

192
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,045
TRAINING DIARY

193
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,446
Why am I so hungry?

194
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,157
We had dinner just two hours ago.

195
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:15,909
It's been long enough since dinner.
What should we order?

196
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:18,620
Chicken feet? Tripe? Chicken?

197
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:20,247
Hey.

198
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:23,792
Get them all.

199
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,502
You can't get just one.

200
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:27,296
-Sounds good.
-Nice.

201
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:29,965
Delivery!

202
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:31,258
What?

203
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:34,303
Did you order already?

204
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:36,847
That was way too fast.

205
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:38,682
Coming!

206
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:43,312
-What?
-Taeyang. Are you back?

207
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:44,521
Thank you.

208
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:49,234
Hi, everyone. I'm back!

209
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:51,403
Taeyang.

210
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,614
Is this all you got?

211
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:55,115
There's so little.

212
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:59,995
I guess they like the chicken
more than me.

213
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:08,837
Welcome back.

214
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:12,591
Thank you.

215
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:19,890
What? Taeyang is back.

216
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:22,017
-What? She is?
-Yes.

217
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:26,063
She's back.

218
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:28,482
Okay.

219
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:32,111
Hey. Didn't you say
you were going to the convenience store?

220
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:33,237
No.

221
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:39,076
That's right. You said
you wanted to go for a run.

222
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:42,704
Taeyang's here. You should go.

223
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:47,626
I'm tired. I'm going to bed.

224
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:51,964
You're not going out? For real?

225
00:18:53,423 --> 00:18:54,550
What's wrong with you?

226
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:07,938
We will have a physical fitness test
ten days from now.

227
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:12,901
-Sorry I'm late.
-Be punctual from now on.

228
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:13,944
Yes, sir.

229
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:21,410
What is this?

230
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:24,580
We set goals per person
based on last year's test results.

231
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:28,750
Focus on getting fit until the test.

232
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:30,043
Coach.

233
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:34,506
I know it's a Yunis tradition,
but must we do this?

234
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,801
To be honest, what other team
does physical fitness tests?

235
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:39,678
We're not kids.

236
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:42,306
Everyone should be responsible
for keeping in shape on their own.

237
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:45,267
It will affect your salary next year.

238
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:47,144
Pardon?

239
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:52,357
Tell yourself you'll get paid
as much as you sweat, and work hard.

240
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:54,735
How fair is that?

241
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:56,695
What a beautiful tradition.

242
00:19:57,237 --> 00:19:58,447
-Coach.
-Coach.

243
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,573
What?

244
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:01,450
Can't I just train instead?

245
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:02,826
I'd rather practice my hits.

246
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,870
And I want to hit you. Why you…

247
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:08,999
Good. I need you guys to complain
so that I can let you have it.

248
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:10,334
Is there anything I can throw?

249
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:12,753
Can't we just take the test now then?

250
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,130
If we meet the goal,
there's no need for a test.

251
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:17,674
That's a good idea. Me too. I want to try.

252
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:19,927
-Me too.
-I'll try too.

253
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:22,930
These kids want to make a bet.

254
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:25,682
-You're confident, is that it?
-Yes!

255
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:28,518
Fine. That can be arranged. Deal!

256
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:30,646
But wait. Hold on.

257
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:33,690
You need to bet something too, to be fair.

258
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:36,318
-What?
-If you fail,

259
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,111
give up your phones.

260
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:42,908
Come on, Coach. It should be
cleaning or doing laundry for a week.

261
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:45,452
That's the tradition among athletes.

262
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:46,954
I don't give a hoot.

263
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:51,208
What do you kids care about the most?
Your phones.

264
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:53,001
It's your phone or nothing.

265
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:56,755
What do you say?
Are you in or are you out?

266
00:20:56,838 --> 00:20:59,341
-I'll do it.
-See you later.

267
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:00,884
Nice. I like your confidence.

268
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:02,427
Good. Yuri?

269
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:05,305
-I don't have my phone on me.
-Anyone else?

270
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:08,392
Last call.

271
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,726
What about you?

272
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:11,728
Ready?

273
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:13,021
Begin.

274
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:19,403
Do you think you'll pass?

275
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:29,079
They bet their phones.

276
00:21:29,162 --> 00:21:31,039
We need to do something too.

277
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:33,959
Losers pay for dinner and drinks.

278
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:36,086
No limits.

279
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:37,212
Fine.

280
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:39,840
Junghwan will pass.

281
00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:42,259
Taejun will fail!

282
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:44,136
-Me too.
-Me too.

283
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:47,556
I say they both…

284
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:49,850
pass.

285
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:50,892
Me too.

286
00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:55,772
I say they both fail.

287
00:21:57,774 --> 00:22:00,110
What about you? Place your bet.

288
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:04,823
Taejun will pass, Junghwan will fail.

289
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:07,743
That's a wild bet.

290
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:09,036
It'll be an unexpected twist.

291
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:11,538
There are no unexpected twists in life.

292
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:12,539
You're right.

293
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:14,374
Freeze!

294
00:22:15,917 --> 00:22:17,461
Anyone who touches the credit cards

295
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:20,464
will lose their hand.

296
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:23,717
Creak, creak.

297
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,010
What are you doing?

298
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:28,764
How did it go?

299
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:34,895
-I passed.
-I passed.

300
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,150
-They both passed?
-Nice. Let's get ribeye.

301
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:43,195
-That sounds good.
-Let's have lobster too.

302
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:04,341
I'm sorry, but do you mind
sharing a table since it's lunchtime?

303
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:07,803
-Pardon?
-Sorry. I'll give you some free food.

304
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:11,515
Here.

305
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:14,601
Okay.

306
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:21,316
You want the lunch special, right?

307
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,235
-Yes.
-Okay.

308
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:30,909
I'm almost done. I'll be leaving soon.

309
00:23:33,995 --> 00:23:35,330
Are you sure you're done?

310
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:37,207
Yes. Enjoy your lunch.

311
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:52,722
You don't have to avoid me.

312
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:56,226
I'll avoid you, so you can act normal.

313
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:58,645
Is that why you're not doing
the fitness test? To avoid me?

314
00:23:58,728 --> 00:24:00,397
I thought we'd both prefer that.

315
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:03,733
You came here to eat to avoid me.

316
00:24:04,734 --> 00:24:07,612
I'm here because I'm meeting someone.

317
00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:11,324
Here? Who?

318
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:14,035
It's true.

319
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:19,082
We'll have to keep seeing each other.

320
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:22,961
Wouldn't it be harder to avoid each other?

321
00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:25,464
I won't avoid you,

322
00:24:26,047 --> 00:24:29,426
so don't avoid me
if it doesn't bother you.

323
00:24:34,097 --> 00:24:35,265
You're here too?

324
00:24:35,932 --> 00:24:37,225
Sit down.

325
00:24:40,228 --> 00:24:43,273
I told you I was meeting someone.

326
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:44,983
We made up.

327
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:48,361
You could say we're like besties.

328
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:57,704
I was leaving.

329
00:24:59,122 --> 00:25:00,165
What the heck?

330
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:03,835
Excuse me. One lunch special, please.

331
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,003
Okay.

332
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:09,758
Hey. Sorry,
but you'll have to eat by yourself.

333
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:12,636
What do you mean? I came all this way.

334
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:14,638
I know. Sorry.

335
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:18,517
What the heck? You're really leaving?

336
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:20,685
What…

337
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,398
I hate eating alone.

338
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:30,403
Including Taeyang's,
we have a total of five credit cards.

339
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:34,115
Which means we have to drink
at least until 4 a.m.

340
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:37,285
But we need to start working out
starting tomorrow.

341
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:40,163
Let's just drink and die!

342
00:25:40,747 --> 00:25:41,915
Why?

343
00:25:41,998 --> 00:25:46,211
Because there is no tomorrow!

344
00:25:46,294 --> 00:25:49,172
-There's no tomorrow! Drink!
-Drink!

345
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:53,051
-Fill it up. Okay. Nice.
-Yes.

346
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:55,762
That's enough for me.

347
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,474
PHYSICAL FITNESS GOALS

348
00:26:07,023 --> 00:26:08,066
What's wrong?

349
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:10,527
What were you looking at?

350
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:19,661
Gosh.

351
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:23,707
I used to be confident
about my physical fitness back in the day.

352
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,086
Now, I'm not confident even in that.

353
00:26:29,629 --> 00:26:31,715
I'd prefer to play a match.

354
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:37,220
How do your goals look?
Do they look doable?

355
00:26:38,513 --> 00:26:39,639
Just…

356
00:26:40,348 --> 00:26:42,934
Isn't your goal
just maintaining status quo too?

357
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:46,187
Mine too.

358
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:48,148
Just don't fall behind.

359
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:51,234
Although that takes crazy effort too.

360
00:26:53,236 --> 00:26:54,779
My goals went down.

361
00:26:58,325 --> 00:27:01,036
It's too hard for me
to even maintain my current shape.

362
00:27:01,911 --> 00:27:03,288
All that's left is going downhill.

363
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:06,708
Not falling apart

364
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:09,711
and coming down step by step
without being humiliated.

365
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:12,881
That's my goal now.

366
00:27:15,091 --> 00:27:16,301
Well…

367
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:21,640
That's just what Coach
and Mr. Sibong think.

368
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:24,559
Are they telling me to quit?

369
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:34,694
Do you play badminton
purely with your physique?

370
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:45,705
Hey. Captain. We've decided
to cut training together tomorrow.

371
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:47,290
-What?
-We won't go!

372
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:50,543
-Try and make us.
-We're going to have fun. Let's drink!

373
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:51,795
Yes!

374
00:27:51,878 --> 00:27:53,421
Hey, you.

375
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:56,341
We'll drink until the bar closes.

376
00:27:56,424 --> 00:28:00,011
And no one is going back to the dorm.
Got that?

377
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:01,429
-Yes!
-Yes!

378
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:03,014
Okay, let's go!

379
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:05,725
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

380
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:07,644
-Let's go.
-You can't go home.

381
00:28:07,727 --> 00:28:09,646
I won't let you.

382
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:11,606
Let's go.

383
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:15,068
Let's go

384
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:27,580
I'll see you again in the spring.

385
00:28:29,624 --> 00:28:31,584
It's gotten a lot warmer, right?

386
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:33,461
This is totally spring.

387
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:35,839
Why do you keep talking about spring?

388
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:38,007
Is it spring?

389
00:28:38,591 --> 00:28:40,677
Flowers bloomed in front of the dorm.
Didn't you see?

390
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:42,929
It's totally spring. Totally.

391
00:28:46,933 --> 00:28:49,102
Will spring ever come to my life?

392
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:02,699
I think spring is coming.
I think spring is here already.

393
00:29:02,782 --> 00:29:03,992
Spring, spring, spring.

394
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,046
Why aren't you practicing?

395
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:23,303
Me knee hurts.

396
00:29:23,386 --> 00:29:24,387
Don't make excuses.

397
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:27,056
You did that fitness test with a bad knee?

398
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,475
It really does hurt.

399
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:30,727
Why aren't you practicing?

400
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:34,230
Someone likes me,

401
00:29:34,564 --> 00:29:36,900
but I don't have the nerve to even start.

402
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:40,987
I don't know
if I'm ready for a relationship.

403
00:29:41,571 --> 00:29:45,200
What kind of a stupid concern is that?
Especially in front of me.

404
00:29:50,413 --> 00:29:54,584
Are you in deep distress
because of our Taeyang?

405
00:29:56,419 --> 00:29:58,379
-"Our Taeyang"?
-Right.

406
00:29:58,546 --> 00:30:02,300
I've been close to our Taeyang
way longer than you.

407
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:04,928
I bet I know our Taeyang
much better than you do.

408
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:06,763
An ex-boyfriend
doesn't compare to a bestie.

409
00:30:08,264 --> 00:30:09,724
Taeyang.

410
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:15,772
You think that's funny, you scum--

411
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:31,079
You know how much Taeyang adored you.

412
00:30:31,287 --> 00:30:32,914
She wouldn't wrong you twice.

413
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:45,426
Hey. Junyoung.

414
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:46,553
Yes?

415
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:48,847
Are you in touch with Taejun?

416
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:50,723
I wonder how he's doing.

417
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:52,725
Why don't you call him?

418
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:54,185
It's okay.

419
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:56,855
He's busy.

420
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:01,317
I doubt he's doing very well.

421
00:31:03,653 --> 00:31:05,196
They broke up.

422
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:07,365
What?

423
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:10,994
I know everything,
so you can drop the act.

424
00:31:11,077 --> 00:31:14,706
I know you can't even sleep
because of the girl Taejun's seeing.

425
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:19,878
Don't worry.

426
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,964
You'll never have to see Taeyang.

427
00:31:25,925 --> 00:31:27,510
That's a relief.

428
00:31:29,512 --> 00:31:31,806
I'm sure it happened unexpectedly.

429
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:34,684
Don't be too hurt.

430
00:31:35,351 --> 00:31:37,395
Why would I be hurt?

431
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:39,314
They broke up because of me.

432
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:00,251
Hi, Dad.

433
00:32:00,501 --> 00:32:03,630
Taeyang. I'm…

434
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:07,508
very sick.

435
00:32:10,553 --> 00:32:12,972
-Where are you going?
-Family emergency.

436
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:20,772
What?

437
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:29,405
-Hi.
-Hi.

438
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:32,909
TAVERN HOUSE

439
00:32:32,992 --> 00:32:34,452
You're going here too?

440
00:32:34,577 --> 00:32:35,536
Yes.

441
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:38,873
Did Dad call you too?

442
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:48,424
Hey. My daughter Yumin will come first.

443
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:52,387
She comes running
if she hears her dad's voice.

444
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:55,056
Goodness. Whatever.

445
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:58,643
To my daughter, her dad is her God.

446
00:32:58,726 --> 00:33:02,271
See? Listen to yourself talk.

447
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:07,568
Hey. A dad who's like a friend like me
is the best.

448
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:10,488
That's why you're looked down on
all your life.

449
00:33:10,571 --> 00:33:12,073
You punk.

450
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:16,077
Anyway, let's see who comes first.

451
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:19,455
Yumin is outside right now…

452
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:21,708
-Hey. It's Yumin.
-Really?

453
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:23,543
Hi, Yumin.

454
00:33:24,293 --> 00:33:25,503
Sike.

455
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:27,964
You startled me.

456
00:33:28,047 --> 00:33:32,010
You punk.
Why are you taking this so seriously?

457
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:37,098
Let me get this straight.
Those immature dads

458
00:33:37,306 --> 00:33:40,518
made a bet
to see whose daughter comes first.

459
00:33:40,601 --> 00:33:42,437
It looks that way.

460
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:45,648
He told me he thought his appendix burst.

461
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:47,900
Mine said his intestines were tangled.

462
00:33:50,403 --> 00:33:51,654
I'm leaving.

463
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:54,782
You're leaving?

464
00:33:56,784 --> 00:33:57,827
Wait.

465
00:33:58,953 --> 00:34:00,038
Hey, Taeyang.

466
00:34:07,795 --> 00:34:08,963
Anyway,

467
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:12,133
thanks.

468
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:16,095
For saving Taeyang.

469
00:34:18,347 --> 00:34:19,474
So…

470
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:25,104
I'll call it even for how you hurt me
back when we were athletes.

471
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:28,775
You punk. What's wrong with you?

472
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:31,903
Hey, but you know…

473
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:36,449
I never did anything
to hurt your feelings.

474
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:40,912
You had your feelings hurt
all by yourself.

475
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:45,166
Gosh. She should be here by now.

476
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:47,293
-What? It's Taeyang.
-Is she here?

477
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:49,003
Sike.

478
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:55,134
Yumin is almost here.

479
00:35:11,692 --> 00:35:13,694
I wanted to ask you something.

480
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:15,822
What's between you and Junghwan?

481
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:20,201
From what I could tell,
you used to be friends

482
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:22,912
but don't get along anymore.

483
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:27,834
We made up.

484
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:29,418
You did?

485
00:35:31,003 --> 00:35:32,338
What about you?

486
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:35,466
I don't know.

487
00:35:36,676 --> 00:35:38,678
I wanted to keep him
because I couldn't cut him off,

488
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:41,305
but he says
it's an international shipment, so wait.

489
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:43,641
Guys, alcohol, sports.
Nothing helps me forget him.

490
00:35:43,724 --> 00:35:45,935
Now, he tells me to wait until spring.

491
00:35:46,602 --> 00:35:49,021
That's our relationship.

492
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:52,608
In simpler terms?

493
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:54,068
May I?

494
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:59,574
Help me, friend.

495
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:01,659
Friend? Me?

496
00:36:01,742 --> 00:36:03,828
Our dads know each other,

497
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:07,790
we've talked this much,
and I've asked for help.

498
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:09,500
That makes us friends.

499
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:17,508
What do you need from me?

500
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:25,308
Play with me right now.

501
00:36:25,391 --> 00:36:27,351
Hurry over to the training center.

502
00:36:27,977 --> 00:36:29,854
What is it at this hour?

503
00:36:40,907 --> 00:36:42,742
Goodness.

504
00:36:43,409 --> 00:36:45,453
I thought you had a bad knee.

505
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:51,709
Cut it out.

506
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:54,921
Isn't Taeyang here?

507
00:36:56,589 --> 00:36:57,506
Why would she be?

508
00:36:58,090 --> 00:36:59,342
She told me to come here.

509
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,428
I'm leaving right away.

510
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,814
You were here together.

511
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:16,943
Why are you two together?

512
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:19,445
Taeyang wanted to play badminton.

513
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:23,741
We've decided to be friends.

514
00:37:27,828 --> 00:37:29,580
There are two of you too.

515
00:37:29,872 --> 00:37:31,832
Want to get some chicken and beer?

516
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:39,090
This isn't right.

517
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:45,221
Hey. Let's go.

518
00:37:45,304 --> 00:37:48,140
Why? Can't we hang out together? Hey.

519
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:11,872
-Hey. Can't we all--
-Hush.

520
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:20,381
What is it?

521
00:38:20,881 --> 00:38:23,092
You made Taeyang call me out, didn't you?

522
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:27,096
I didn't know you were there.

523
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:31,267
Sure, I bet you didn't. I'll believe you.

524
00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:44,447
Fine. I did it to see you.

525
00:38:44,905 --> 00:38:47,366
Must you say it out loud?

526
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:50,578
I only said it
because I thought it was cute.

527
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:52,413
Then why isn't it spring yet?

528
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:54,040
It should be spring if I'm cute.

529
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:56,542
Hey. I said I needed time--

530
00:38:59,378 --> 00:39:02,882
What's so special about spring?
It's spring in my life now.

531
00:39:14,101 --> 00:39:15,227
Hey.

532
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:20,107
I guess you didn't like it.

533
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:22,526
No.

534
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:26,030
So… Well… That's not it.

535
00:39:26,113 --> 00:39:28,074
Well… So…

536
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:30,951
While you get your thoughts in order,

537
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:32,912
I may move on from you.

538
00:39:33,412 --> 00:39:35,790
I guess that doesn't scare you one bit.

539
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:40,544
Hey.

540
00:39:55,851 --> 00:39:56,977
Taejun.

541
00:39:58,187 --> 00:39:59,271
Yes?

542
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:03,150
I have one last thing to say.

543
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:09,323
I hope you'll become happier

544
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:12,243
because I'm not with you.

545
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:16,330
So don't be hurt.

546
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:20,251
I let you go so you can be happy.
But if you have a hard time--

547
00:40:20,334 --> 00:40:21,585
Yes, it's hard for me.

548
00:40:23,629 --> 00:40:26,632
Seeing your face, hearing your voice,

549
00:40:26,715 --> 00:40:28,759
having to see you all the time,

550
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:33,389
ignoring how you act
like everything's fine,

551
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:35,599
all of that is too hard for me.

552
00:40:36,725 --> 00:40:38,060
But we broke up.

553
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:40,146
Who cares if it's hard for me?

554
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:43,983
How can I stop caring overnight
like we're complete strangers?

555
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,152
How can I not care?

556
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:48,946
Having to stop caring overnight
is what it means

557
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:50,906
to break up.

558
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:52,616
Don't you know that?

559
00:40:55,202 --> 00:40:57,580
Hey. Taejun.

560
00:40:57,872 --> 00:41:00,666
Are you mad at me?
Do you have to be this mean?

561
00:41:00,749 --> 00:41:02,626
I keep wavering.

562
00:41:04,378 --> 00:41:07,381
Every time our eyes meet, I waver.

563
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:10,259
That's why I'm avoiding you.
What more am I supposed to do?

564
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:15,723
Fine, I'll stop caring.

565
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:18,434
Whether or not you're hurting,
whether or not you avoid me,

566
00:41:18,517 --> 00:41:19,894
I won't give a damn!

567
00:41:40,789 --> 00:41:44,084
Everyone can do that much.
This is where training really begins.

568
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:50,466
Keep your shoulders wide.
Maintain your form.

569
00:41:50,549 --> 00:41:52,468
-Okay.
-Tighten your core.

570
00:41:52,968 --> 00:41:54,720
You can't start shaking already.

571
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:56,764
Another weight.

572
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:58,516
Ten seconds.

573
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:02,353
Ten, nine, eight, seven.

574
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:04,480
Maintain proper form.

575
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:06,649
Don't use your shoulders. Use your core.

576
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:11,111
Last ten seconds. Ten, nine,

577
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:13,113
eight, seven,

578
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:16,200
six, five, four…

579
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:27,795
Sungsil.

580
00:42:30,172 --> 00:42:32,841
If we give up here, we lose.

581
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:36,637
If we pull this off, we win.

582
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:39,682
Okay.

583
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:50,859
You're doing better than I expected.

584
00:42:51,443 --> 00:42:53,028
I thought you'd be a total wreck.

585
00:42:53,862 --> 00:42:55,114
Whatever.

586
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:00,035
Going to the supply room.

587
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:10,045
I have to do this alone?

588
00:43:35,112 --> 00:43:37,114
Junyoung, come out.

589
00:43:40,743 --> 00:43:44,413
What is it? I was in a groove.

590
00:43:44,496 --> 00:43:47,708
You sound like
you're studying for the bar exam.

591
00:43:48,542 --> 00:43:51,462
It's not like grad school
is easy to get into.

592
00:43:52,004 --> 00:43:55,424
-What is it?
-These are Taejun's favorites.

593
00:43:55,507 --> 00:43:57,426
Take them to him.

594
00:43:57,509 --> 00:44:00,554
Since when did I deliver food? You do it.

595
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:03,891
-No. You go.
-I don't want to.

596
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:05,768
Hey.

597
00:44:06,894 --> 00:44:07,728
What…

598
00:44:08,228 --> 00:44:09,521
Hey, Junyoung.

599
00:44:10,439 --> 00:44:11,815
I'll give you 30,000 won.

600
00:44:15,569 --> 00:44:17,446
Hello, this is Yook Junghwan.

601
00:44:17,529 --> 00:44:20,407
Today, I have three tips for beginners.

602
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:23,285
-I'll share them with you.
-I can't stand him.

603
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:24,620
JINCHEON TRAINING CENTER VLOG

604
00:44:26,455 --> 00:44:27,414
NATIONAL TEAM PARK JUNYOUNG

605
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:29,792
Hi, this is Park Junyoung.

606
00:44:30,376 --> 00:44:33,796
I have no idea
why they're making me do this.

607
00:44:34,129 --> 00:44:35,714
It is very awkward.

608
00:44:37,216 --> 00:44:40,052
I'm here for my morning exercise.

609
00:44:40,636 --> 00:44:43,514
First, I'll begin with a little warm-up.

610
00:44:47,726 --> 00:44:49,144
I love you, Junyoung!

611
00:44:49,728 --> 00:44:51,605
Junyoung, you're the best.

612
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:53,482
Stop that. Don't do things like that.

613
00:44:53,565 --> 00:44:56,944
Please show Junyoung lots of love.
Lots and lots.

614
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:59,321
Please show Park Taeyang lots of love too.

615
00:44:59,655 --> 00:45:01,573
Please love Park Junyoung
much more than me.

616
00:45:01,657 --> 00:45:03,409
Hey, Mom said to bring this to you.

617
00:45:03,492 --> 00:45:06,370
What the heck? You should call first.

618
00:45:06,453 --> 00:45:07,955
Or at least knock first.

619
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:09,707
It's a force of habit.

620
00:45:10,165 --> 00:45:11,750
Mom said to refrigerate this right away.

621
00:45:11,834 --> 00:45:14,628
Why'd you bring them all this way?
I can just buy them.

622
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:17,005
What were you watching?

623
00:45:20,426 --> 00:45:21,468
You.

624
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:26,640
I was looking for badminton videos,
and you popped up.

625
00:45:28,058 --> 00:45:29,560
From the national training center?

626
00:45:29,643 --> 00:45:30,811
Yes.

627
00:45:31,854 --> 00:45:34,773
Why were you watching that?
How old is that?

628
00:45:35,858 --> 00:45:38,777
Anyway, I don't even have the right
to be forgotten.

629
00:45:41,155 --> 00:45:42,281
How about a match?

630
00:45:45,367 --> 00:45:49,037
We haven't played together
since grade school.

631
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:10,976
How do you feel?

632
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:13,479
It's been a while
since you've held a racket.

633
00:46:14,396 --> 00:46:17,065
It's like seeing an ex-boyfriend.

634
00:46:19,276 --> 00:46:21,320
You're happy to see it,
but you want to avoid it.

635
00:46:22,321 --> 00:46:24,656
You feel like you need to let go
in case you want to keep it.

636
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,826
You're desperate,
and it's heart-wrenching.

637
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:31,288
But it seems unfamiliar at the same time.
Something like that?

638
00:46:32,915 --> 00:46:34,708
Did you really break up with Taeyang?

639
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:36,335
Because I gave you crap?

640
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:39,004
She says she likes you more.

641
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:42,966
She likes you too much

642
00:46:44,593 --> 00:46:46,178
to be with me.

643
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:50,265
I lost to you.

644
00:46:53,727 --> 00:46:55,229
I can't stand this.

645
00:46:57,940 --> 00:47:00,359
I feel like the bad guy.

646
00:47:00,901 --> 00:47:02,110
It's not your fault.

647
00:47:02,694 --> 00:47:04,154
Not this,

648
00:47:06,031 --> 00:47:08,325
nor the inferiority complex
I've had because of you.

649
00:47:09,868 --> 00:47:12,287
It's not your fault.
They're all my problems.

650
00:47:14,164 --> 00:47:17,125
I should've acknowledged it long ago
that you were gifted

651
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:19,795
and I was average.

652
00:47:19,878 --> 00:47:22,005
Or maybe I should've asked you
for pointers.

653
00:47:23,549 --> 00:47:25,634
We'd have been more comfortable
with each other then.

654
00:47:26,593 --> 00:47:28,136
The problem was me, the loser.

655
00:47:29,221 --> 00:47:31,557
It wasn't your fault. You're perfect.

656
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:34,518
What's gotten into you?

657
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:39,940
The truth is, I knew all along.

658
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:43,986
I didn't want to admit it, though.

659
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:46,321
But now,

660
00:47:47,781 --> 00:47:49,241
I can.

661
00:47:52,828 --> 00:47:53,829
Let's play.

662
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:56,290
Come on.

663
00:48:14,099 --> 00:48:15,475
I won't go easy on you.

664
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:17,853
Throw it.

665
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:21,690
The leg is off.

666
00:48:23,775 --> 00:48:24,818
Does it hurt?

667
00:48:25,402 --> 00:48:26,528
No. You.

668
00:48:27,988 --> 00:48:29,364
Something's off with your leg.

669
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:34,745
Let's go to the hospital.

670
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:51,303
Okay.

671
00:48:51,386 --> 00:48:52,596
-Here.
-Okay.

672
00:48:53,013 --> 00:48:54,389
Are you okay?

673
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:56,767
Why aren't you doing anything?

674
00:48:57,476 --> 00:48:58,936
I'm hot, that's why.

675
00:48:59,519 --> 00:49:01,521
Don't make a face. You'll get wrinkles.

676
00:49:04,524 --> 00:49:07,861
Hold on. My stomach.

677
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:11,615
I'm cramping up. Hey. I'm cramping up.

678
00:49:11,698 --> 00:49:13,116
What's wrong with him?

679
00:49:14,117 --> 00:49:17,955
Your abs are cramping up just from that?

680
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:21,208
Are you cramping?

681
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:23,168
You too? Darn it.

682
00:49:23,251 --> 00:49:25,087
Goodness. Are you okay?

683
00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:26,630
Hold on.

684
00:49:27,923 --> 00:49:29,007
Where's Coach?

685
00:49:29,091 --> 00:49:31,551
Mr. Sibong. He hasn't come yet.

686
00:49:31,718 --> 00:49:34,096
But they're all cramping up.

687
00:49:34,179 --> 00:49:35,722
Can you take a look?

688
00:49:36,223 --> 00:49:38,433
I see. They got cramps.

689
00:49:38,517 --> 00:49:40,060
Taejun's been hospitalized.

690
00:49:41,853 --> 00:49:42,729
What?

691
00:49:42,813 --> 00:49:44,398
There's a problem with his knee.

692
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:00,080
Hello.

693
00:50:00,789 --> 00:50:04,835
Doctor. It's not too serious, is it?

694
00:50:05,127 --> 00:50:08,422
He'll still be able to play badminton.
That was what you wanted to know, right?

695
00:50:08,505 --> 00:50:10,549
Yes. Thank you.

696
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:13,427
You're good. You're okay.

697
00:50:14,261 --> 00:50:15,262
Is it patellar tendinitis?

698
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:17,681
Yes, according to the X-ray.

699
00:50:18,306 --> 00:50:20,017
But he should stay for three days

700
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:23,061
and get an MRI and a full checkup.

701
00:50:23,145 --> 00:50:24,855
It's better to be thorough.

702
00:50:27,441 --> 00:50:29,276
There's a lot of fluid in there.

703
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:32,279
Didn't it hurt?
It must've been excruciating.

704
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:34,531
I didn't know it hurt.

705
00:50:36,533 --> 00:50:38,118
Do I have to be hospitalized?

706
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:41,621
If it ruptures later,
your career will be over

707
00:50:42,497 --> 00:50:43,957
even with surgery.

708
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:46,334
Let's focus on resting it for now, okay?

709
00:50:47,127 --> 00:50:48,712
It must've hurt a lot,

710
00:50:49,212 --> 00:50:51,423
but you didn't know it hurt?

711
00:50:51,882 --> 00:50:53,133
How is that possible?

712
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:54,801
Rest up.

713
00:50:56,678 --> 00:50:58,555
If my brother's career ends too,

714
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:00,140
you're a real quack.

715
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:01,475
Don't worry.

716
00:51:17,407 --> 00:51:21,661
Why are you following me?
Go back and lie down.

717
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:23,789
I can walk this much.

718
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:36,384
I'm really okay.

719
00:51:37,803 --> 00:51:39,012
Goodness.

720
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:42,349
My thoughtful son.

721
00:51:44,643 --> 00:51:46,728
Thank you for making that hard decision.

722
00:51:49,481 --> 00:51:50,732
Taejun.

723
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:57,280
You're still young.

724
00:51:58,031 --> 00:52:02,369
I know you'll meet
plenty of nice girls in the future.

725
00:52:03,411 --> 00:52:04,454
Okay?

726
00:52:09,417 --> 00:52:10,544
Go home.

727
00:52:13,463 --> 00:52:14,548
Bye.

728
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:21,596
Get home safely.

729
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:22,931
Go in.

730
00:53:06,308 --> 00:53:08,268
JUNYOUNG

731
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:13,106
I'm coming.

732
00:53:27,454 --> 00:53:28,788
I was looking all over for you.

733
00:53:30,081 --> 00:53:32,959
I said I was coming.
I wanted some fresh air.

734
00:53:47,432 --> 00:53:48,516
Aren't you coming?

735
00:53:49,768 --> 00:53:50,810
I am.

736
00:54:02,197 --> 00:54:05,450
Go out and buy me a strawberry shake,
peaches, and some other snacks.

737
00:54:06,493 --> 00:54:07,535
Just go to sleep.

738
00:54:10,163 --> 00:54:13,416
You're here to take care of me.
Do you even know what that means?

739
00:54:14,167 --> 00:54:15,752
Are you alive?

740
00:54:28,890 --> 00:54:30,100
I'm glad you're here.

741
00:54:30,475 --> 00:54:33,019
Go to the convenience store together
and get me some snacks.

742
00:54:56,167 --> 00:54:57,836
How's Taejun doing?

743
00:54:59,254 --> 00:55:01,923
He won't even say it hurts. That idiot.

744
00:55:03,049 --> 00:55:04,592
I'm sure it's hard for him right now.

745
00:55:05,844 --> 00:55:09,222
I know. He and Taeyang
seemed to really care for each other.

746
00:55:10,807 --> 00:55:14,019
We're siblings,
but he's always been different from me.

747
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:23,320
What kind of a girlfriend was I?

748
00:55:26,614 --> 00:55:28,199
Was I that bad?

749
00:55:29,951 --> 00:55:31,286
Well…

750
00:55:33,913 --> 00:55:35,415
You were pretty sexy.

751
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:38,084
But…

752
00:55:38,918 --> 00:55:41,338
If you go out with someone else,

753
00:55:41,671 --> 00:55:45,300
I hope you'll love that person freely

754
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:47,802
and receive love freely.

755
00:55:48,928 --> 00:55:50,430
That's my hope for you.

756
00:55:52,307 --> 00:55:53,224
You too.

757
00:55:57,103 --> 00:55:58,021
Thanks.

758
00:56:56,454 --> 00:56:58,706
Taejun is alone in the hospital right now.

759
00:56:59,749 --> 00:57:00,917
If you want to go see him.

760
00:57:16,224 --> 00:57:17,392
Why'd you want to see me?

761
00:57:22,605 --> 00:57:23,773
I thought…

762
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:26,526
spring was here.

763
00:58:41,601 --> 00:58:43,102
I told you not to get hurt.

764
00:58:50,401 --> 00:58:52,987
Why must you worry me? Why?

765
00:58:55,156 --> 00:58:56,658
Don't worry about me.

766
00:58:57,450 --> 00:58:58,826
Don't care about me.

767
00:59:01,329 --> 00:59:03,706
What were you doing
until your knee got that bad?

768
00:59:04,499 --> 00:59:06,334
Until you had to be hospitalized?

769
00:59:06,417 --> 00:59:08,169
I didn't even know I was hurting

770
00:59:09,212 --> 00:59:10,338
because you weren't there.

771
00:59:13,675 --> 00:59:17,136
Because not having you with me
hurt more than anything else.

772
00:59:19,597 --> 00:59:20,765
Because…

773
00:59:23,643 --> 00:59:26,604
Because I…

774
01:01:01,949 --> 01:01:03,868
GOING TO YOU AT A SPEED OF 493KM

775
01:01:03,951 --> 01:01:05,078
Are you two going out?

776
01:01:05,578 --> 01:01:06,454
They got caught.

777
01:01:06,537 --> 01:01:08,956
Taejun and Taeyang are going out too.

778
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:10,249
-Hey.
-What?

779
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:12,001
Taejun says he wants to get married.

780
01:01:12,085 --> 01:01:14,420
-What?
-Get married?

781
01:01:14,504 --> 01:01:18,007
We're still submitting applications,
so let me know when you choose a partner.

782
01:01:18,091 --> 01:01:20,218
Sungsil and I want to compete
in an individual match.

783
01:01:20,301 --> 01:01:21,928
Skip this tournament.

784
01:01:22,011 --> 01:01:25,264
Telling me not to compete
is like telling me to give up on life.

785
01:01:25,348 --> 01:01:27,225
Taejun's been doing great these days.

786
01:01:27,809 --> 01:01:29,018
Mixed doubles? With whom?

787
01:01:29,102 --> 01:01:31,020
Just please don't tell my family.

788
01:01:42,532 --> 01:01:43,574
GOING TO YOU AT A SPEED OF 493KM

789
01:01:43,658 --> 01:01:45,660
