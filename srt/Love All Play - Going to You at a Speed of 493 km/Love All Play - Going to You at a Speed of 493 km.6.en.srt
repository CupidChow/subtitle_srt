1
00:00:37,787 --> 00:00:40,790
GOING TO YOU AT A SPEED OF 493KM

2
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,586
THE PLACES, PEOPLE, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTIONAL

3
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:58,975
Park Taeyang…

4
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:02,062
I drove her away, so--

5
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:05,315
This bastard drove her away
from our team, so please save her.

6
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:08,068
Please, Coach.

7
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:09,402
Please.

8
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:11,780
I already said no.

9
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:14,616
You punk. Is this company a joke to you?

10
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:17,368
-You little…
-It will be difficult,

11
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:20,080
but if you could just please try…

12
00:01:21,122 --> 00:01:23,333
You'd be rescuing
an athlete with a bright future.

13
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:24,918
You won't turn a blind eye, will you?

14
00:01:26,377 --> 00:01:28,046
You're a true mentor.

15
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:29,380
You have my respect in advance!

16
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:35,178
Thank you in advance.
I knew we could count on you.

17
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:38,056
You kids are both leading me on.

18
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:40,850
-Who said I'd help--
-I'll do anything you say.

19
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:44,187
Move.

20
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,730
I won't video chat with the CEO.

21
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:47,982
-Do you mean it?
-Yes.

22
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:49,317
I love you.

23
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:55,156
-I love you too.
-Huh?

24
00:01:56,407 --> 00:01:57,408
What…

25
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:49,794
Did you wait long?

26
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:58,845
You must be very busy.
You didn't contact me once.

27
00:03:00,054 --> 00:03:03,641
You try being rejected.
It's not easy to reach out first.

28
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:11,232
Anyway, did you decide to join Somang?

29
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:12,734
Are the teammates nice?

30
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:14,944
Oh, that?

31
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:20,491
I've had a change of heart.

32
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:24,329
I may remain at Yunis.

33
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:27,832
Really?

34
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:29,876
That's good.

35
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:35,506
Should I go to Somang?

36
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,092
Should I sign the contract?

37
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,220
Up to you. You're not back for me.

38
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:46,017
Wait. Did you come back for me?

39
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:48,186
I may leave again because of you.

40
00:03:48,686 --> 00:03:50,438
What's with the reaction? Are you unhappy?

41
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:53,775
I guess your feelings have changed

42
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:56,319
in the past few days.

43
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:58,363
What feelings?

44
00:04:00,698 --> 00:04:01,991
What?

45
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:08,498
That…

46
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:11,251
That what?

47
00:04:12,126 --> 00:04:13,628
That…

48
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:18,091
That… which both you and I know.

49
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:24,055
-Why are you laughing?
-Because you're cute.

50
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:27,392
-Why'd you hit me?
-You're annoying.

51
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,605
Why are you laughing again?

52
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:34,065
Because I'm happy.

53
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:37,694
-Why do you keep hitting me?
-In case I start liking you.

54
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:58,840
Taeyang, know something?
This is the first snowfall.

55
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,157
I'm glad it's snowing.

56
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:28,244
I'm even happier

57
00:05:30,204 --> 00:05:31,372
that you're back.

58
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:36,878
I'm so very happy!

59
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,857
EPISODE 6

60
00:05:58,149 --> 00:05:59,484
I'm the one who sent her away.

61
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:05,156
So when Taeyang comes back,
try to be nice to her.

62
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:12,705
You chase her away, then bring her back.

63
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:15,166
Gosh. What nonsense.

64
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,711
Seriously, what's with you guys?

65
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:23,591
Hey, be honest.

66
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:26,803
She didn't bribe anyone
three years ago, did she?

67
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:32,517
It's just weird for you to be doing this
because of that.

68
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:38,398
You, Junyoung, and Taeyang.
The three of you were so close.

69
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,150
Let's not talk about the past.

70
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:43,361
Taeyang…

71
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:46,364
Why did she run away?

72
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:51,411
Did something happen
between the three of you?

73
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:54,455
Anyway, it's not bribery.
She wouldn't stoop so low.

74
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:56,290
Then what's the reason?

75
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,337
Yuk Junghwan! Just come clean!

76
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:02,463
It's just…

77
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:05,842
We had an issue.

78
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:07,510
I have to go. I've got plans.

79
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:46,507
YOU HAVE RECEIVED AN EMAIL

80
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:00,563
What's with him?

81
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:02,190
Hey.

82
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:08,029
Hey!

83
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:10,490
Hey!

84
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:14,410
Gosh.

85
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:17,538
Hey, Yuk Junghwan!

86
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:19,415
Yuk!

87
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:24,253
Sorry.

88
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:28,090
Why were you spacing out?
You couldn't even hear me.

89
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:30,885
I was hungry.

90
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,180
I'm hungry.
Let's go. I made a reservation.

91
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:37,975
Nice. A restaurant
that requires reservations.

92
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:54,492
Is something wrong?

93
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:57,787
Are you listening to me?

94
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:01,958
Is there something wrong?

95
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:05,503
I got an email.

96
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:08,381
An email? What about it?

97
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:10,841
Nothing. It's nothing.

98
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:24,855
You said you were going home today.

99
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:26,941
Then you'll need
some basic items for survival.

100
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:30,027
Can you honestly call your place a home?

101
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:33,447
Hey, let's get a cup.

102
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:36,325
Look how you're thinking of me.

103
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:38,119
Let's get the green ones.

104
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:39,912
One for me and one for you.

105
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:42,290
Is this a green light
for our relationship?

106
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:51,507
How about this for you?
Isn't it cute? It's even got a rabbit.

107
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,551
We're buying stuff for your house.

108
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:55,261
But my house is your house.

109
00:09:56,887 --> 00:09:58,180
Well, why don't you get one then?

110
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:00,099
Okay.

111
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:03,436
It's lemon-scented. Rated A. Eco-friendly.

112
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:06,981
This one's good.
Since your hands are precious.

113
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:08,649
Wait, should I get you rubber gloves?

114
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:09,734
No, I'll do the dishes.

115
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:11,652
As if we're moving in together.

116
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:13,613
Just bring yourself.
You can move in right away.

117
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:14,864
Anytime is fine.

118
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,784
But don't be too late.

119
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,245
Get everything you need.

120
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:25,166
He's trying to seduce me.

121
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:29,128
I have to come to my senses.

122
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:31,714
Hurry up.

123
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:33,132
I'm coming.

124
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:41,390
So you just want to go home?

125
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:43,726
I have to get ready for work tomorrow.

126
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:47,897
I also need to pack
to move back into the dorm.

127
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:50,524
And toughen up to brace myself.

128
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:52,735
I'm returning after betraying the team.

129
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:55,112
How much do you think I'll be bullied?

130
00:10:55,696 --> 00:10:58,324
Can I openly be
your knight in shining armor?

131
00:10:58,407 --> 00:11:00,618
So no one can get to you?
I know I'd do a great job.

132
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:03,079
No. Never.

133
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:05,247
That makes me want to do it even more.

134
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:12,672
What are we going to end up being?

135
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,257
Why are you doing this?

136
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:17,635
Is that even a question?
We'll keep dating.

137
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:19,845
I know you like me.

138
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:23,224
I have no idea what my future holds.

139
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:25,101
Please stop messing with me.

140
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:28,145
Sorry. Was I too charming?

141
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:31,524
I'll wait in front of your house
tomorrow morning to charm you.

142
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:33,442
You'll come to pick me up?

143
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:35,403
Yes, let's go to work together.

144
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:37,405
See you in nine hours.

145
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,762
YOU HAVE RECEIVED AN EMAIL

146
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:10,104
FROM PARK JUNYOUNG

147
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:11,897
Hi. It's Junyoung.

148
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:14,108
You haven't changed at all.

149
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:17,528
I saw the clip where you were drunk.

150
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:20,322
It was so funny
that I wanted to get in touch.

151
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:24,452
I laughed a lot, thanks to you. Take care.

152
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:39,383
If you wanted to treat me to a meal,
you should've just had it delivered to me.

153
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:42,261
I'm right here,
and yet you're not saying a word.

154
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:45,181
Right. I'm sorry.

155
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:47,725
Did you get penalized again?

156
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:49,560
For that clip where you're wasted?

157
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:51,854
So you've seen it too.

158
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:54,565
I wasn't penalized.

159
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:56,275
That's a relief.

160
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:02,907
By the way, who's that girl?

161
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:05,242
In that clip,

162
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:08,120
you said you missed her,
and you even sang.

163
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:11,999
By any chance…

164
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,338
-Is it me?
-My first love.

165
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:22,134
She contacted me. Today.

166
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:28,140
That email before?

167
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:31,769
Is that why you were spacing out?

168
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:34,939
One of the silliest things I've done is

169
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:38,567
go on social media,
that annoying thing, for her.

170
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:41,237
So she could see how I was doing
if she looked me up.

171
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:45,783
For three years. Every Monday.

172
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:48,786
I always sent her an email.

173
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:54,250
I did that out of missing her,
because I was worried about her,

174
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:56,377
and just as a habit.

175
00:13:57,419 --> 00:13:58,462
But…

176
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:02,883
she never once replied

177
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:04,927
until now, after seeing the video clip.

178
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:08,472
She said it was funny.

179
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:12,893
Like a joke.
As if nothing had ever happened.

180
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:16,063
What a ridiculous person.

181
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:18,023
Yes, she's ridiculous.

182
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:19,942
Not her, you.

183
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:24,113
You made the effort to call me

184
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:26,949
and made reservations
at a nice place like this.

185
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:29,577
Doesn't that mean
you had some feelings for me too?

186
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:32,288
You already know how I feel about you.

187
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:38,335
My heart skipped a beat
when you asked me out to dinner.

188
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,755
I was excited the whole way here.

189
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:45,134
But here you are,
talking to me about another girl.

190
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:48,429
What is this?

191
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:52,558
Don't follow me out.

192
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:54,602
You're annoying.

193
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:58,689
-Eat before you leave.
-Did I ask you to treat me?

194
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:08,073
Four-hundred-ninety-eight.

195
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:14,663
Four-hundred-ninety-nine.

196
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:24,673
One thousand!

197
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:29,762
Wait, It's 500.

198
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:34,141
I'm done with my practice for today!

199
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:39,605
Did you see all of it?

200
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:46,070
Why do I have to watch this at this hour?

201
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:53,953
Because I want to be complimented?

202
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:58,958
Did you see how well I did?
I'm doing my best, right?

203
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:01,669
Seriously, you're out of your mind.

204
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:05,422
Gosh.

205
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:21,230
YOU HAVE A NEW MESSAGE

206
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:23,607
She's alive.

207
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:28,445
I'm alive.

208
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:33,701
"I'll spend all the money I've earned
from working hard before I die."

209
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:36,078
It's already been
three years since I said that and left.

210
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:39,164
Die, my foot.
I'm going to make sure I stay alive.

211
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,167
I'll be back when I run out of money.
See you soon.

212
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:47,715
By the way,
are you very close with Park Taeyang?

213
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:49,550
PRODIGY PARK TAEYANG MAKES A COMEBACK

214
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:51,343
They're partners.

215
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:57,391
That complicates things.

216
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:08,402
Were they close
when they were on the national team?

217
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:14,324
No way. Given Junyoung's personality,
I doubt she had any friends.

218
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:30,799
Dad! I'll come back on the weekend.

219
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:38,557
Right. Make sure you don't skip any meals!

220
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:52,613
She should've eaten first.

221
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:07,544
He said he'd come
pick me up in the morning.

222
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:12,841
-Guess who.
-Oh, my God!

223
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:15,552
You startled me.

224
00:18:16,553 --> 00:18:19,181
Did you have to make me
call out to God for help in the morning?

225
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:20,766
Can't you take a joke?

226
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:24,394
Do your muscles hurt if you go a day
without pulling a prank? You're childish!

227
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:25,938
Childish?

228
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:27,856
I'm a manly man.

229
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:32,778
What is it?

230
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:38,450
All right.

231
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:39,868
Are you going to take your bike?

232
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:43,163
Alone? I didn't bring anything
with wheels.

233
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:44,832
Why don't you follow me then?

234
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,876
You need more exercise.

235
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:51,630
I hit 500 shuttlecocks this morning.

236
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:56,593
Wait for me, my sun!

237
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:59,096
That's cheesy. You're crazy.

238
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:04,852
How do you feel about your first day?

239
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:07,521
Taeyang!

240
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:10,357
Are you ready to be humble?

241
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:18,949
I'm ready to be humble.

242
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:22,244
I betrayed you and came back!

243
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:37,426
Well, we heard from Youngsim
that it was because of Junghwan.

244
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:41,805
I don't care if you're back or not.

245
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:44,308
We're not happy to see you.

246
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:47,060
We're not taking you back,
so don't get the wrong idea.

247
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:50,564
You weren't a part of the team
to begin with.

248
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:54,318
You're still the one
who ruins the team spirit.

249
00:19:57,988 --> 00:19:59,406
Park Taeyang.

250
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:02,409
Let's go organize the supply room.

251
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:05,871
Okay!

252
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:08,582
What's with her?

253
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:27,935
I don't think I can do this.
You can organize it by yourself.

254
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:31,146
Okay. But that's the way
to the supply room.

255
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:33,148
I know.

256
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:35,275
-Youngsim.
-Yes?

257
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:40,155
I know you're looking out for me.

258
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:43,367
Thank you.

259
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:48,205
Well, it's not that
I'm going to cover for you.

260
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:49,206
It's just that…

261
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:51,959
I don't know what your story is.

262
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:57,506
It's up to you to make it work.
Good luck, Taeyang.

263
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:01,051
Thanks.

264
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:43,635
Are you done looking?

265
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:45,512
Gosh, you scared me!

266
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:51,727
-You were staring for a long time.
-How did you know?

267
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:53,353
I saw you in the mirror.

268
00:21:58,358 --> 00:21:59,943
There are a lot of mirrors here.

269
00:22:10,787 --> 00:22:12,539
Did you get scolded a lot today?

270
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:14,207
No.

271
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:17,252
I've got a really good feeling about this.

272
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:18,879
I think I'm going to do well.

273
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:21,465
You've always done well.

274
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:24,259
You've done good work so far.

275
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,596
Things will get even better from now on.

276
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:32,100
Taejun.

277
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:34,186
Yes?

278
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:37,439
I was going to hold back if I could,

279
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:42,319
but I can't resist you anymore.

280
00:22:49,242 --> 00:22:53,121
Here. I wrote this for you
on the day I moved out.

281
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:55,791
I'm giving it to you now.

282
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:58,502
Can I read it here?

283
00:22:58,585 --> 00:23:00,295
No. Read it once I'm gone.

284
00:23:03,423 --> 00:23:05,092
I want to since you told me not to.

285
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:07,844
Hey, can you just--

286
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:16,228
LET'S GO OUT

287
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:27,989
Read it quickly.

288
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:31,284
The words are like gems.

289
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:36,456
I'm taking in every single letter.

290
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:40,669
I knew it.

291
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:42,504
You like me.

292
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:44,381
Yes.

293
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:46,842
I like you a lot.

294
00:23:55,183 --> 00:23:56,518
I like you more.

295
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:31,303
Why did you do that?

296
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:33,388
A selection match.

297
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:36,099
In the best-case scenario,
you would break even.

298
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:40,312
Taken for granted if you're picked.
An embarrassment if you aren't.

299
00:24:48,361 --> 00:24:50,655
Let's get this for Hana. I'll buy it.

300
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:53,533
Do you think
it will put me on Hana's good side?

301
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:57,162
Why would you need to be on her good side?

302
00:24:57,662 --> 00:24:58,663
What?

303
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:00,916
Right.

304
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:04,002
Hey, answer my question.

305
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:07,088
Why did you ask for a selection match?

306
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:10,050
A FEW DAYS AGO

307
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:11,551
Preparing well for the competition?

308
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:13,470
-Yes, sir.
-Hello, Coach.

309
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:16,890
The brackets for the team match…
Shouldn't he be doing special training?

310
00:25:16,973 --> 00:25:17,974
Coach.

311
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:21,353
Please exclude me from those sessions.

312
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:24,773
But the competition is
right around the corner.

313
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:28,985
How about we have a selection match
to select the players for the team match?

314
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:30,820
National and non-national athlete,

315
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:32,948
senior and junior.
We can put all that aside.

316
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:36,576
It'd be good to have a match
to select the players fair and square.

317
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:39,246
Then everyone will get a fair shot.

318
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:42,874
That sounds great.

319
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:45,377
That's a great idea.

320
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:48,964
But realistically speaking, it'll be hard
to get the national athletes to play.

321
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:50,924
They're still teammates
who should do their part.

322
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:52,259
I agree with him 100%.

323
00:25:52,842 --> 00:25:55,011
It's always
the same lineup for the team match.

324
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:56,763
There needs to be a change.

325
00:25:56,846 --> 00:25:59,307
And… it sounds like fun.

326
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:01,601
-Coach Joo. What have you got to say?
-It does sound fu--

327
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:04,563
Selection match!

328
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:07,148
-Selection match!
-Selection match!

329
00:26:12,153 --> 00:26:14,364
-Go on and practice.
-Yes, sir.

330
00:26:14,447 --> 00:26:16,157
I need some time to think.

331
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:17,784
-Okay.
-You come with me.

332
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:22,038
Hey, shake this.

333
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:24,207
So it mixes well.

334
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:28,628
Seungwoo, you could've just let it be.

335
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:30,630
Why did you turn it into a big deal?

336
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:34,634
Honestly, even with a selection match,
the national athletes will be picked.

337
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:37,512
That will be the case
if they're more skilled.

338
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:41,641
It's obvious. There's no point
in doing this. What a hassle.

339
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:43,184
Dongwan.

340
00:26:47,647 --> 00:26:48,857
Mind your manners.

341
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:51,901
Seungwoo.

342
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:53,987
You're also a senior now.

343
00:26:55,363 --> 00:26:56,531
The juniors are watching.

344
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:12,797
All right, listen.

345
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:15,675
For this team competition,

346
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:20,347
we'll have a selection match
with everyone on equal footing.

347
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:26,394
Either, I'm in the way of my juniors

348
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:28,480
or the juniors aren't better than me.

349
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:30,273
I want to find out.

350
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:35,403
Gosh. Do you have the time
to worry about that? Lucky you.

351
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:40,533
I'm going to do whatever it takes

352
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:43,036
to complete a Grand Slam before I retire.

353
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:47,540
Later, when Hana asks what I did
instead of raising her, I'll tell her,

354
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:53,254
"I tried my best
so you wouldn't be ashamed of your mom."

355
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:56,966
I should at least be able to say that.

356
00:27:58,593 --> 00:28:01,429
It's enough that I've lost custody.

357
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:08,478
Look at that. This is perfect for you.

358
00:28:08,561 --> 00:28:11,022
Let me get you this. A bulldozer.

359
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:13,441
Then

360
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:16,528
let me buy you this.

361
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:19,698
A dump truck
that is blocking the juniors' way.

362
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:21,449
A dump truck?

363
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:24,452
Okay. Go, dump truck!

364
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:26,371
Why do you care about the juniors?

365
00:28:26,454 --> 00:28:28,623
You should play as long as you want.

366
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:33,753
Look how lonely we are now
because we didn't have seniors like that.

367
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:36,297
You're right.

368
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:39,968
Let's totally stand
in the way of our juniors.

369
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:41,261
Go, bulldozer!

370
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:44,139
Go, dump truck.

371
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:06,119
Hang in there.

372
00:29:53,666 --> 00:29:55,043
I knew it.

373
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:57,045
You like me.

374
00:29:57,879 --> 00:29:58,713
Yes.

375
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:01,090
I like you a lot.

376
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:06,971
I like you more.

377
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:19,400
Come a little later.

378
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:27,283
We're in front of our dorm.
We have to be careful.

379
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:29,285
"We"?

380
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:31,287
I like that. "We."

381
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,082
"We" have to enjoy the thrill.

382
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:36,543
"We" have to pluck up our courage.

383
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:39,629
"We" should think of this
as mental training.

384
00:30:39,712 --> 00:30:41,589
I'm already mentally tough.

385
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:43,675
A sense of stability is what matters most.

386
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:48,012
Still, let's hold hands.

387
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:49,848
I like you way too much.

388
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:53,810
Let's go.

389
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:00,692
-Hey!
-Is that how it is?

390
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,843
-Where are you going this time?
-To wash my hair.

391
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:29,220
How many times has it been?

392
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:34,267
Taeyang, how many times
are you going to wash your hair?

393
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:35,643
Sorry.

394
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:39,272
I'm almost done. Really.

395
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:44,110
Who is it? Damn it.

396
00:31:44,193 --> 00:31:46,863
Hurry up and get out!
I need to use the bathroom.

397
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:13,222
Did… you sleep well?

398
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:15,141
Of course, I did.

399
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:20,271
-Good morning.
-Hurry up.

400
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:21,230
Morning.

401
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,274
Come on.

402
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:40,708
The national athletes are
coming today, right?

403
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:41,751
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

404
00:32:41,834 --> 00:32:43,127
Let's go for it, everyone.

405
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:44,712
Let's not get pushed around.

406
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:45,922
Let's do this!

407
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:48,508
-Let's do this!
-Let's do this!

408
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:50,635
-Let's go!
-We can do this!

409
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:14,575
As you all know,

410
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:17,578
we'll choose who participates
in the team competition

411
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:20,123
based purely on the test.

412
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:24,877
When our team performs well,
we gain a competitive edge,

413
00:33:25,211 --> 00:33:28,423
and that, in turn, is your worth.

414
00:33:29,882 --> 00:33:32,051
The individual match is also important,

415
00:33:32,468 --> 00:33:34,804
but since you're wearing our uniform…

416
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:38,641
As long as you're wearing
the Yunis uniform,

417
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,812
please do your best for Yunis.

418
00:33:42,895 --> 00:33:44,814
Let's win the team competition!

419
00:33:44,897 --> 00:33:46,399
-Let's win!
-Let's go for it!

420
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:53,614
We're here today for an interim check
to select the players,

421
00:33:54,073 --> 00:33:56,075
so you can show what you've got.

422
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:57,744
-Okay?
-Yes, Coach.

423
00:33:57,827 --> 00:33:59,495
Yes! Let's do this!

424
00:34:17,805 --> 00:34:18,973
Don't be intimidated.

425
00:34:19,348 --> 00:34:21,350
They're just people who own a few medals

426
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:23,561
from world championships,
like how you own credit cards.

427
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:25,730
They're just former legends,

428
00:34:25,813 --> 00:34:27,690
current legends,

429
00:34:29,108 --> 00:34:31,027
favorites to win the gold
at the next Olympics,

430
00:34:32,653 --> 00:34:34,197
or legendary monsters.

431
00:34:35,531 --> 00:34:37,241
Did you turn 21 this year?

432
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:39,744
Yes.

433
00:34:40,536 --> 00:34:41,788
You've improved even more.

434
00:34:41,871 --> 00:34:44,248
It's an honor to play with you.

435
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:47,960
Let's have a good game.

436
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:49,003
Yes.

437
00:34:50,713 --> 00:34:53,466
A genius who's even polite? How annoying.

438
00:34:56,636 --> 00:34:57,678
Let's go.

439
00:35:05,311 --> 00:35:08,314
-Everyone's in position. Let's start.
-Yes, sir.

440
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:00,491
That's just…

441
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:03,619
I guess this is more pressure
than the actual match

442
00:36:03,703 --> 00:36:05,371
since their pride is at stake.

443
00:36:05,454 --> 00:36:09,083
They're too intimidated
to show even half of what they've got.

444
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:11,627
Today's test seems pointless.

445
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:13,880
There's one though.

446
00:36:15,631 --> 00:36:18,676
Someone who is playing
without getting shaken at all.

447
00:36:22,471 --> 00:36:24,849
She has experience
competing in world championships.

448
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:53,961
Did you know your eyes are
on their faces instead of the shuttlecock?

449
00:36:55,254 --> 00:36:56,339
I'm sorry, Taeyang.

450
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:59,008
Being a national athlete isn't a big deal.

451
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:02,261
The players who are in good shape
during the selection match

452
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:03,763
win the Korean flag.

453
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:08,100
Doesn't matter if you're
a national athlete or a Joe Schmoe.

454
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:11,354
Keep your eyes on the birdie.

455
00:37:13,272 --> 00:37:14,273
Okay.

456
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:29,789
Good.

457
00:37:53,312 --> 00:37:54,939
Darn it.

458
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:58,234
You're bleeding. Are you okay?

459
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:03,114
Hey, I'm sorry. Are you all right?

460
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:06,325
It's nothing. I'm fine.

461
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:07,535
Did you get a cut?

462
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:09,996
I guess you've got baby soft skin.

463
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:11,872
So you're not only mentally immature.

464
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:14,458
Hey, what's wrong with you? Come here.

465
00:38:25,177 --> 00:38:26,679
Clean it up and apply some ointment.

466
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:29,849
-Don't make a fuss. It's okay.
-That must hurt a lot.

467
00:38:29,932 --> 00:38:32,059
I said I'm fine.

468
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:34,812
Why is he taking it out on me?

469
00:38:34,895 --> 00:38:36,689
-Should we wrap it up? Okay.
-Yes.

470
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:42,987
Game's over.

471
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:44,697
Good work, everyone.

472
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:46,866
Nice work.

473
00:38:46,949 --> 00:38:48,576
-Good work.
-Good work.

474
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:51,954
Great job.

475
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:04,508
Hey, Taejun!

476
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:07,845
-Gosh, this is embarrassing.
-Taejun!

477
00:39:08,262 --> 00:39:09,472
Taeyang. Long time no see.

478
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,848
Hi, Hyukbong.

479
00:39:10,931 --> 00:39:13,100
I was so out of it
I didn't even get to say hi.

480
00:39:13,642 --> 00:39:14,935
Same here.

481
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:16,562
-Have you been doing well?
-Yes.

482
00:39:16,645 --> 00:39:18,064
You should have called.

483
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:19,815
I should have.

484
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:22,860
Right. Are you in touch with Junyoung?

485
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:27,114
Oh… no.

486
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:30,076
I see you've lost touch with her too.

487
00:39:31,285 --> 00:39:33,037
How about we go grab a bite today?

488
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:36,332
That sounds great. How about dinner?

489
00:39:36,415 --> 00:39:38,626
-Sure. Is your number still the same?
-Yes.

490
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:40,252
-See you later.
-See you.

491
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:48,677
Where did he go?

492
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,729
Taejun was furious.

493
00:39:59,313 --> 00:40:01,190
That hurt his ego.

494
00:40:02,149 --> 00:40:03,901
When he glowered at me,
that look was just…

495
00:40:03,984 --> 00:40:05,444
Gosh. He's got a temper.

496
00:40:06,278 --> 00:40:09,949
When it comes to temper,
I think Taejun and Junghwan are similar.

497
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:11,951
It's just that one loses his temper
with a smile

498
00:40:12,034 --> 00:40:14,120
while the other one does it with a glare.

499
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:17,623
Seriously. And I just get caught
in the crossfire.

500
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:20,292
Do you know how tough
they're making things for me?

501
00:40:23,379 --> 00:40:26,090
What's on your mind?
I said I'm having a tough time.

502
00:40:27,299 --> 00:40:29,552
You look as if
you're thinking about another guy.

503
00:40:31,178 --> 00:40:32,596
I'm thinking about another girl.

504
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:34,181
Who?

505
00:40:35,182 --> 00:40:36,142
Taeyang.

506
00:40:37,643 --> 00:40:40,062
She was supportive of me back there.

507
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:43,691
That made me realize
why she's Park Taeyang.

508
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:47,570
She wasn't intimidated at all
in front of those great national athletes.

509
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:49,363
She was so cool.

510
00:40:49,905 --> 00:40:50,865
Cooler than me?

511
00:40:51,991 --> 00:40:53,200
Yes.

512
00:40:54,368 --> 00:40:55,494
Too bad I lost.

513
00:40:55,953 --> 00:40:58,873
But to me, you're the coolest.

514
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:00,708
You're the prettiest.

515
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:02,376
I only see you.

516
00:41:02,668 --> 00:41:04,044
So don't be intimidated.

517
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:08,132
I promise to earn a lot of money

518
00:41:08,215 --> 00:41:09,758
so you can live unemployed.

519
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:11,135
-Really?
-Yes.

520
00:41:11,218 --> 00:41:13,220
-I love you.
-I love you more.

521
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:14,597
No, I love you more.

522
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:23,814
Youngsim. Are you okay?

523
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,442
I saw how you kept tripping.

524
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:32,031
Hwang Sieun.

525
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:34,575
She's a real monster.

526
00:41:35,534 --> 00:41:39,121
She's very kind and polite too.

527
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:40,664
She's going to be a great player.

528
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:44,585
Got it.

529
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:48,797
How does it feel
when a junior outperforms you?

530
00:41:50,132 --> 00:41:52,468
Aren't you glad?
Then you can leave without any worries.

531
00:41:53,093 --> 00:41:54,303
Hey.

532
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:57,640
Are you trying to send me off?

533
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:00,309
Why the hell would I leave?

534
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:04,730
Youngsim, what's wrong?
What is it this time?

535
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:07,691
What are you doing?

536
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:09,944
Is it already time for snacks?

537
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:12,738
We just had a practice match,
so we need to get some rest.

538
00:42:12,821 --> 00:42:15,157
You should. You should also eat. Go ahead.

539
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:19,537
But why aren't the national athletes
who played with you here?

540
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:21,872
Why aren't they?

541
00:42:30,005 --> 00:42:31,215
Enjoy.

542
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:42,142
It's snack time.
Come and have a hamburger.

543
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:48,107
Junghwan.

544
00:42:50,317 --> 00:42:51,527
Please eat first.

545
00:43:11,922 --> 00:43:14,425
No one's here. Don't worry.

546
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:18,762
Still, it's better to be careful.

547
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:22,975
What is it?

548
00:43:26,186 --> 00:43:28,647
You come over here.
Don't tell me to come and go.

549
00:43:30,482 --> 00:43:31,567
Yes, ma'am!

550
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:39,992
-Gosh, that hurts!
-What is it? Are you okay?

551
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:41,368
Here.

552
00:43:42,202 --> 00:43:43,454
I think I got seriously injured.

553
00:43:43,537 --> 00:43:45,623
Who told you
to go around getting beaten up?

554
00:43:45,706 --> 00:43:47,333
This is an injury.

555
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,711
Don't bring it up if the injury
takes less than three months to heal.

556
00:43:56,216 --> 00:43:58,385
Let's not be like that between us.

557
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:10,481
What? What's with that look?

558
00:44:11,607 --> 00:44:14,443
You have such a pretty face
from this angle.

559
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:20,824
But you know what?

560
00:44:25,871 --> 00:44:26,914
Never mind.

561
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:34,129
What is it?
You're making me curious. Tell me.

562
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:37,007
Your legs are as hard as a rock.

563
00:44:38,008 --> 00:44:39,718
I can feel your passion and effort.

564
00:44:39,802 --> 00:44:42,012
Hey, get up.

565
00:44:42,096 --> 00:44:44,306
-Hey.
-Were you close with Park Junyoung?

566
00:44:53,857 --> 00:44:56,610
I noticed earlier.

567
00:44:58,987 --> 00:45:02,074
She used to be a top star.

568
00:45:04,159 --> 00:45:06,870
We were close back when we were
in the National Training Center.

569
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:12,292
Were you very close?

570
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:17,548
Well, it's not something I'd brag about.

571
00:45:19,675 --> 00:45:20,676
I see.

572
00:45:23,929 --> 00:45:26,473
I heard she has a terrible personality.

573
00:45:27,641 --> 00:45:28,892
That's not true.

574
00:45:30,853 --> 00:45:35,566
She was the most awesome athlete
I had ever met.

575
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:42,656
I realized what a beautiful sport
badminton could be,

576
00:45:43,365 --> 00:45:45,200
thanks to her.

577
00:45:54,209 --> 00:45:55,961
I'd also like to meet her.

578
00:46:10,476 --> 00:46:12,186
Let's go head-to-head.

579
00:46:12,519 --> 00:46:15,022
Dongwan. Don't cry after you lose.

580
00:46:16,273 --> 00:46:18,692
The losers have to do
ten laps around the track

581
00:46:18,776 --> 00:46:20,360
piggybacking the winners!

582
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:22,863
Deal?

583
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:24,281
Deal.

584
00:46:33,415 --> 00:46:34,416
Jeez.

585
00:46:37,169 --> 00:46:38,128
Double unders.

586
00:46:38,212 --> 00:46:40,631
You must do exactly two rotations
per jump, not one and a half.

587
00:46:40,714 --> 00:46:41,882
It must be double unders.

588
00:46:42,716 --> 00:46:43,550
Tournament-style.

589
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:46,136
Did you all get that?

590
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:48,222
Let's do this!

591
00:46:48,305 --> 00:46:49,556
-Let's do it!
-Let's do it!

592
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:50,724
Let's go.

593
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:57,940
All right.

594
00:47:00,234 --> 00:47:01,610
Ready.

595
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:04,321
-Set--
-Just a minute.

596
00:47:04,404 --> 00:47:06,657
I need to use the bathroom. Sorry!

597
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:08,742
Why, that little…

598
00:47:08,909 --> 00:47:10,994
-Wait.
-Hey!

599
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:12,454
Watch it!

600
00:47:18,544 --> 00:47:19,461
Get out of my way.

601
00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:25,467
What's going on?

602
00:47:26,176 --> 00:47:27,261
Hey!

603
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:37,855
Eat.

604
00:47:41,817 --> 00:47:45,404
-What are you doing?
-Hurry and eat. Just gulp it down.

605
00:47:45,612 --> 00:47:48,824
You have a spoiled burger in your stomach.
So what do you need to do?

606
00:47:48,907 --> 00:47:50,158
You have to poop it out.

607
00:47:50,242 --> 00:47:51,785
Come on. Eat up.

608
00:47:52,578 --> 00:47:54,496
Then my stomach will explode and I'll die.

609
00:47:54,913 --> 00:47:56,832
Are you okay? You had two burgers.

610
00:47:56,915 --> 00:48:00,294
I have a stomach blessed by the gods.
I can even digest garbage.

611
00:48:00,377 --> 00:48:01,920
So you just keep on eating.

612
00:48:02,379 --> 00:48:04,590
Trust in my wisdom of life and eat.

613
00:48:06,508 --> 00:48:08,719
-Doctor!
-Help…

614
00:48:09,928 --> 00:48:11,179
Please save me.

615
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:12,389
Doctor.

616
00:48:12,472 --> 00:48:13,515
Doctor…

617
00:48:22,107 --> 00:48:23,066
Sir.

618
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:25,110
Let's say ten means

619
00:48:25,193 --> 00:48:27,738
your stomach hurts so badly
that you want to roll around the floor.

620
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:29,656
What's your pain level?

621
00:48:30,032 --> 00:48:31,617
Seven… Wait.

622
00:48:32,117 --> 00:48:33,785
-Eight.
-I see. Eight.

623
00:48:33,869 --> 00:48:35,370
No… Doctor.

624
00:48:35,871 --> 00:48:36,997
T… Ten.

625
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,249
-Ms. Kim.
-Yes?

626
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:43,462
They all seem to have food poisoning.
Please run the labs first.

627
00:48:47,341 --> 00:48:49,343
Excuse me, sir.

628
00:48:54,514 --> 00:48:55,515
Look.

629
00:48:56,975 --> 00:48:59,645
-Please take care of the athletes first.
-All right, sir.

630
00:49:01,521 --> 00:49:05,400
Wait. Out of the athletes,
give the national athletes priority.

631
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:10,906
National athletes should be
given priority, no questions asked.

632
00:49:10,989 --> 00:49:12,449
Goodness.

633
00:49:13,033 --> 00:49:16,036
The national athletes are
the ones with the Korean flag.

634
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:17,245
Didn't you hear him?

635
00:49:17,746 --> 00:49:20,082
We're not supposed to get sick!

636
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:22,918
We're different from those ordinary folk!

637
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:26,296
-What took you so long?
-What is that lunatic blabbering about?

638
00:49:27,589 --> 00:49:28,674
Hey!

639
00:49:36,682 --> 00:49:40,018
Does this mean your life doesn't matter
if you're not wearing a Korean flag?

640
00:49:40,602 --> 00:49:41,853
That's harsh.

641
00:49:44,314 --> 00:49:46,608
Let me go and fix this. Okay?

642
00:49:46,692 --> 00:49:48,527
I'm going to make a strong complaint.

643
00:49:48,735 --> 00:49:50,278
Let me show you how I can throw a fit.

644
00:49:53,323 --> 00:49:54,408
Excuse me. Nurse?

645
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:55,575
Good luck.

646
00:49:56,076 --> 00:49:58,662
This is unfair. He…

647
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:04,418
He is…

648
00:50:09,214 --> 00:50:10,173
the best.

649
00:50:10,632 --> 00:50:13,093
He's like our best hope for a gold medal.

650
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:15,846
He's famous worldwide.
I guess you didn't know.

651
00:50:15,929 --> 00:50:17,264
Oh, I see.

652
00:50:17,347 --> 00:50:18,807
And…

653
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:26,523
It's been sorted.

00:50:37,993 --> 00:50:41,580
I'm sorry
but we have incoming emergency patients,

656
00:50:41,788 --> 00:50:44,541
and we're short on beds.
Could you please wait in the chairs?

657
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:47,627
-What?
-Excuse me.

658
00:50:48,628 --> 00:50:51,757
-So we have to get an IV sitting up?
-No. You can lie down, sir.

659
00:50:53,091 --> 00:50:54,843
Could you please hurry?

660
00:50:58,013 --> 00:51:00,140
I should've become
a soccer player instead.

661
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:05,937
National athletes get a bed

662
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:08,440
while we get a chair.

663
00:51:09,149 --> 00:51:10,984
The general and the cannon fodder.

664
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:14,029
Jjajangmyeon and pickled radish.
The leads and the extras.

665
00:51:15,614 --> 00:51:18,742
We're the cannon fodder,
pickled radish, and extras.

666
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:26,500
Captain.

667
00:51:27,209 --> 00:51:28,668
Are you going to talk to Coach?

668
00:51:33,006 --> 00:51:34,341
My gosh. Hey.

669
00:51:34,424 --> 00:51:35,884
I need to go to the restroom.

670
00:51:37,677 --> 00:51:40,055
You're the captain.
Why don't you act like--

671
00:51:41,306 --> 00:51:42,265
I have to go too.

672
00:51:43,141 --> 00:51:44,184
Me too.

673
00:51:44,267 --> 00:51:45,644
Coming through.

674
00:51:55,403 --> 00:51:56,571
You too?

675
00:51:56,947 --> 00:51:58,073
Mom.

676
00:52:00,367 --> 00:52:03,370
We were so shocked when we heard the news.

677
00:52:03,453 --> 00:52:05,372
I'm glad you're okay.

678
00:52:06,581 --> 00:52:10,794
Do the others know
you're Junyoung's younger brother?

679
00:52:11,378 --> 00:52:13,130
Have I ever gone around talking about it?

680
00:52:13,213 --> 00:52:15,257
You're good too.

681
00:52:15,882 --> 00:52:18,301
Not everyone can get on a company team.

682
00:52:18,426 --> 00:52:21,555
You don't have to do this
if things get too rough.

683
00:52:22,097 --> 00:52:25,600
After what happened to Junyoung,
we've learned our lesson.

684
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:28,228
Did you just figure that out?

685
00:52:30,564 --> 00:52:32,232
I already knew that.

686
00:52:32,315 --> 00:52:35,068
That's why I stop just short of
the point where it becomes taxing.

687
00:52:37,112 --> 00:52:39,781
Oh, right. Junyoung is doing well.

688
00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:42,284
She said she'll be back soon.

689
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:45,745
Really? Did she call? Is she doing well?

690
00:52:46,746 --> 00:52:48,832
When? Where is she now?

691
00:52:48,915 --> 00:52:51,376
You should've told her to call me.

692
00:52:52,752 --> 00:52:55,046
Mom. Ask one question at a time.

693
00:52:57,507 --> 00:53:00,093
-I feel awful.
-I'm so exhausted.

694
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:02,304
We can go in now. The beds are ready.

695
00:53:02,387 --> 00:53:04,681
Jiho, can you lend me some cash?

696
00:53:04,764 --> 00:53:06,057
I forgot to bring my wallet.

697
00:53:06,892 --> 00:53:07,809
What for?

698
00:53:11,229 --> 00:53:13,773
I'm tired of you doing this.

699
00:53:17,068 --> 00:53:20,906
Seeing the players
makes me miss her so much.

700
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:23,700
My poor daughter.

701
00:53:23,783 --> 00:53:25,827
That's just her fate.

702
00:53:28,705 --> 00:53:30,540
If it had been Taejun instead,

703
00:53:31,124 --> 00:53:33,793
he would have moved on
and lived his own life.

704
00:53:38,924 --> 00:53:40,800
Here's money for gas.

705
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:47,724
Why are you crying here? Let me see.

706
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:51,686
Oh, dear. You cried a lot.

707
00:53:53,605 --> 00:53:55,899
Why? Are you worried about me?

708
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:01,071
I'm sorry.

709
00:54:04,366 --> 00:54:05,617
Don't be.

710
00:54:06,534 --> 00:54:09,329
Gosh. You're always like a baby.

711
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:16,044
-Here. This is for gas.
-No.

712
00:54:16,419 --> 00:54:17,671
Come on. Use it for gas.

713
00:54:19,339 --> 00:54:21,299
I'll call you once I hear from her.

714
00:54:21,967 --> 00:54:24,219
Mom. Don't cry.

715
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:29,015
I should go.

716
00:54:45,156 --> 00:54:46,533
This is it.

717
00:54:46,616 --> 00:54:49,369
They got sick because they always
eat ramyeon among themselves.

718
00:54:57,711 --> 00:54:59,296
Gosh, this is so good.

719
00:55:02,882 --> 00:55:03,967
Who could it be?

720
00:55:05,468 --> 00:55:06,928
Yes. Coming!

721
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:20,734
Hey. Are you the only one
to get discharged?

722
00:55:20,817 --> 00:55:23,987
No. I came because I missed you so much.

723
00:55:24,779 --> 00:55:26,614
You should've just called me.

724
00:55:27,866 --> 00:55:29,284
Look, you're sweating.

725
00:55:30,618 --> 00:55:31,911
Let's get back to the hospital.

726
00:55:31,995 --> 00:55:33,788
I'll just grab my phone and jacket--

727
00:55:48,386 --> 00:55:49,804
I'm all better now.

728
00:55:57,270 --> 00:55:58,313
Oh, my gosh. Taejun.

729
00:55:59,731 --> 00:56:00,815
Hey.

730
00:56:34,849 --> 00:56:36,434
How long do I have to stare at your back?

731
00:56:39,270 --> 00:56:40,855
What are you drawing?

732
00:56:43,191 --> 00:56:45,193
Ta-da. This is your grave.

733
00:56:46,277 --> 00:56:49,656
I looked up and found out
that you can die from hamburger disease.

734
00:56:50,657 --> 00:56:51,574
You're sending me off?

735
00:56:52,826 --> 00:56:54,494
We have so much left to do together.

736
00:56:57,455 --> 00:56:59,290
"Fight till the end to live."

737
00:56:59,374 --> 00:57:01,501
"I'm not going in there yet."

738
00:57:01,835 --> 00:57:03,545
I want you to have that kind of resolve.

739
00:57:06,881 --> 00:57:08,675
Here, you can keep it.

740
00:57:11,845 --> 00:57:14,389
-Come and lie down.
-We're in a dorm.

741
00:57:14,472 --> 00:57:16,516
-It's just the two of us.
-Go sleep in your room.

742
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:17,642
Let's share a bed.

743
00:57:18,893 --> 00:57:19,978
I won't even hold your hand.

744
00:57:31,489 --> 00:57:32,574
Gosh.

745
00:57:39,664 --> 00:57:40,832
We can't go further than this.

746
00:57:44,169 --> 00:57:45,336
We'd be crossing the line.

747
00:58:15,783 --> 00:58:17,702
Didn't you say you wouldn't hold my hand?

748
00:58:19,078 --> 00:58:22,165
I wanted to thank you
for drawing me a place to be buried.

749
00:58:23,833 --> 00:58:25,752
I have nothing to worry about
even if I die.

750
00:58:28,755 --> 00:58:30,715
And you'd be there by my side,

751
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:35,553
so I won't be lonely anymore.

752
00:58:40,183 --> 00:58:41,559
Were you lonely?

753
00:58:42,727 --> 00:58:44,187
From time to time.

754
00:58:46,397 --> 00:58:47,524
What about you?

755
00:58:48,441 --> 00:58:50,902
I was lonely too.

756
00:58:53,363 --> 00:58:54,405
Sometimes.

757
00:58:56,282 --> 00:58:57,575
Every once in a while.

758
00:59:12,131 --> 00:59:15,051
Don't get sick from now on.

759
00:59:16,678 --> 00:59:18,137
And don't be lonely.

760
00:59:22,183 --> 00:59:24,143
I'm still getting to know

761
00:59:25,019 --> 00:59:26,813
what kind of person you are,

762
00:59:28,231 --> 00:59:29,357
but I think

763
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,318
you deserve to be happier.

764
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:44,956
Will you please love me?

765
01:00:04,684 --> 01:00:05,935
I do

766
01:00:07,437 --> 01:00:08,479
already.

767
01:01:19,342 --> 01:01:21,260
GOING TO YOU AT A SPEED OF 493KM

768
01:01:21,344 --> 01:01:24,305
As many of us better make it
to the roster for the team match.

769
01:01:24,389 --> 01:01:26,933
We used to be great athletes too!

770
01:01:27,016 --> 01:01:28,351
Let's chant! It's been a while.

771
01:01:28,434 --> 01:01:30,228
-Let's smash!
-Let's smash!

772
01:01:34,023 --> 01:01:35,066
It's my chance.

773
01:01:35,650 --> 01:01:37,944
Taeyang, you're the only one
who can make the cut.

774
01:01:38,027 --> 01:01:39,195
Thank you.

775
01:01:39,821 --> 01:01:42,657
The last member to participate
in the women's team match is…

776
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:44,575
I envy how relaxed you are.

777
01:01:44,742 --> 01:01:47,203
I envy how passionate you are.

778
01:01:59,048 --> 01:02:00,174
GOING TO YOU AT A SPEED OF 493KM

779
01:02:00,258 --> 01:02:02,260
