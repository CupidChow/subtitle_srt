1
00:00:37,787 --> 00:00:40,790
GOING TO YOU AT A SPEED OF 493KM

2
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,586
THE PLACES, PEOPLE, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTIONAL

3
00:00:46,254 --> 00:00:48,256
EPISODE 15

4
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:54,345
How could you do that?

5
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:56,389
What the heck?

6
00:00:56,848 --> 00:00:57,974
What did I do?

7
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:00,518
Not you.

8
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:03,480
He seriously has some screws loose.

9
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:08,651
How could you say that?

10
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:11,404
I didn't mean anything by it.

11
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:13,740
Did we…

12
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:17,827
really love each other?

13
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:22,582
What?

14
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:24,584
I can't believe it.

15
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:32,050
Hey. No. Don't believe it. No.

16
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:36,429
Let's be partners.

17
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:41,017
I'm dying to play with you.

18
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:58,034
Sorry, but no.

19
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:01,079
-What?
-I'm in the team competition.

20
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:03,706
I have to play with Sungsil.

21
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,750
I can't handle mixed doubles
on top of it all.

22
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:08,628
That's your reason?

23
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:12,674
I feel bad for you,
but I need to save my energy.

24
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:15,343
Mixed doubles are too much.

25
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,558
I'd understand
if there were another reason,

26
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:25,478
but you and I have a history together.

27
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:30,859
Do you think it was easy for me
to ask you to be my partner?

28
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:35,321
I had to muster up
a lot of courage to ask you.

29
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:39,242
But you reject me right off the bat--

30
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:43,079
Sorry, but what can I do?
My body is too weak.

31
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:45,123
Did you forget already?

32
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:48,793
When you first came to Yunis
and were unable to find a partner,

33
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:50,503
I was nice and played with you.

34
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:54,716
You begged really desperately.

35
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:56,843
Oh. Did I?

36
00:02:59,804 --> 00:03:01,139
"Did I?"

37
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:03,641
How could you forget?

38
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:07,187
Have you always been this forgetful?

39
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,939
Anyway, I can't play with you.

40
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:22,994
She says…

41
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:27,081
she forgot.

42
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:31,377
I had no idea.

43
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:52,565
Obviously, I want to play with you.

44
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:55,526
Let's be partners.

45
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,197
I'm dying to play with you.

46
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:05,703
I'm dying here too.

47
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:34,148
Yes, hello?

48
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:38,820
Hi, Junyoung. Did I wake you?

49
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:42,573
Sorry. I'll call you tomorrow then.

50
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:44,951
It's fine. What is it?

51
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:49,497
Well, so… The thing is…

52
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,624
What is it at this hour?

53
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:55,003
So… We have a tournament.

54
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:57,046
We have a tournament, you see.

55
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,423
So…

56
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:02,427
I was wondering if I could play
mixed doubles at the tournament…

57
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:06,723
with Taejun. Is that okay?

58
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,559
Is that why you called?

59
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:14,063
Why'd you wake me up about nothing?

60
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:14,981
Go ahead.

61
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,358
Seriously.

62
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:18,985
Junyoung.

63
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:21,112
Oh, my gosh.

64
00:05:24,782 --> 00:05:27,994
What the heck? Junyoung, you're so cool.

65
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:33,624
What the heck? It was so simple.

66
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:37,211
Sorry I'm late!

67
00:05:37,962 --> 00:05:39,881
Let's be punctual, okay?

68
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:42,592
We're just waiting for Seungwoo, right?

69
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,554
He's gone.

70
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:51,142
It feels empty without him, doesn't it?

71
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:52,810
What?

72
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:55,104
It does.

73
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:03,237
How do you feel?

74
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:05,281
What does it matter?

75
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:08,534
This body is useless.
It can't even compete in the tournament.

76
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:11,746
I see. You don't feel that great.

77
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:13,498
Worry about yourself.

78
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:16,667
You're entering two events.

79
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:18,878
No, I'm not. I'm entering three.

80
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:21,714
I see, you're entering three.
You're so popular.

81
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,552
Three… Three events?

82
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:33,935
-Let's get to work, guys.
-Okay.

83
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:36,187
So, you need to take care of your body.

84
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,688
It's very useful.

85
00:06:38,272 --> 00:06:40,316
I said not to be obvious
that you're dating.

86
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,069
I may just tell the coach about you.

87
00:06:43,861 --> 00:06:44,737
Sorry,

88
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:48,366
but I'll be obvious
about dating right now.

89
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:50,034
What? Hey!

90
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:52,453
You punk.

91
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:56,165
Let's go. I don't want to see it.

92
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:09,804
I said I'd play mixed doubles with you,
not get back together with you.

93
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:13,433
Whatever. You'll really play with me?

94
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:17,603
Yes.

95
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:20,440
Why'd you change your mind?

96
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:27,780
I couldn't stop thinking about you.

97
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:33,244
No matter how hard I tried,

98
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:36,497
I couldn't forget.

99
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:07,862
The semifinals! We can get the bronze!

100
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:09,989
Great job, Park twins!

101
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:17,955
PARK TAEJUN

102
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:19,999
What are you doing?

103
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:22,376
We just won.

104
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:28,049
I was the happiest when I played with you.

105
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:34,222
I'm saying I'll play badminton with you.
That's all.

106
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:36,057
Very innocently. Just badminton.

107
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,686
Shall we go play?

108
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:54,158
Seriously.

109
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:57,745
You want to be captain?

110
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:05,711
Well… Sure, Dongwan is great.

111
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:08,047
But still, Youngsim should be captain.

112
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:11,050
-Yes, Youngsim.
-She's the most senior player.

113
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:12,385
That's right.

114
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:14,595
I see. Youngsim.

115
00:09:20,476 --> 00:09:21,811
Captain?

116
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:26,399
You do it.

117
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:33,698
Yuri! Isn't Yuri your year too?

118
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:36,617
-I bet she'll want to be captain.
-That's right.

119
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:39,120
She's not interested at all.

120
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:41,455
I'll make the sacrifice.

121
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:44,917
-Okay.
-Okay.

122
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:49,714
But hey. Don't try to do too much, okay?

123
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:53,050
Just wing it, okay? Wing it.

124
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:56,137
A captain doesn't need to do anything,
am I right?

125
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:59,098
Of course not. Don't do anything, okay?

126
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:00,725
That's the best for the team.

127
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:02,351
I'll take it upon myself

128
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:04,687
to discipline Yunis.

129
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:11,193
Hey.

130
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,321
You may go.

131
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:16,907
Hey… You… Don't do anything out there.

132
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:22,705
Work hard.

133
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:26,709
What the heck?

134
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:28,377
I'm very worried.

135
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:30,671
Seriously.

136
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:33,507
Okay, what is it?

137
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:35,760
I want to enter mixed doubles
with Taeyang.

138
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:39,347
Hey. Is your knee okay?

139
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,894
-It's fine.
-Yeah?

140
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:48,856
Okay. You should play
in at least one match if you can.

141
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:52,943
So… There's one more thing.

142
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:55,738
I wanted

143
00:10:57,406 --> 00:10:58,491
to discuss something.

144
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:00,242
Okay.

145
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:07,750
This time, we engraved the design
into the handle.

146
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:11,045
We made the leaves wider.

147
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:13,923
So this is the previous model,

148
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:17,134
and this is the new product?

149
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:20,179
Yes, sir.
We came up with a brand new design.

150
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:24,141
Wow. I can't see the difference at all.

151
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:27,478
-Pardon?
-Nothing.

152
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:30,189
Please pack up some samples
to give our buyers.

153
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:31,857
-Yes, sir.
-Okay.

154
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:39,407
I feel weak.

155
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:41,409
Everyone's working hard.

156
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:46,163
You, Loverboy. What are you going to do
this afternoon for training?

157
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:49,166
It's free training,
so I'm going to work on my footwork.

158
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,668
I feel like my feet got slower.

159
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:54,422
Who said you could decide
what training you do?

160
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:55,881
What do you know?

161
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:59,093
Free training means
the captain decides what you do.

162
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:01,971
Listen. As long as I'm captain,

163
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:03,931
you'd better stay on your toes.

164
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:07,184
I can't stand people
who aren't disciplined.

165
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:08,519
-You know that, right?
-Yes, sir.

166
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:14,400
Gosh. I miss Seungwoo.

167
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:17,778
This is so dusty. Dang it.

168
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:20,156
That's not good for my bronchial tubes.

169
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:21,699
Bronchial tubes, my butt.

170
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:22,950
Hey. Move it.

171
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:26,078
Darn it. Captain? Give me a break.

172
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:34,295
SEUNGWOO

173
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:46,098
I was planning to stop by today.

174
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:49,894
I'll bring samples of our new product.

175
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,979
Yes. Thank you.

176
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:09,830
If you feel any pain
when you climb the stairs or sit down,

177
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:13,959
or while doing any regular activities,
you have to come right away.

178
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:16,545
Straighten your leg and sit
whenever you're resting.

179
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,422
-Use heat packs before--
-I know.

180
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:21,926
Heat packs before playing
and ice packs afterward.

181
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:24,094
I'll tape it up and wear knee pads,

182
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:26,222
so please go home.

183
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:28,641
Why did I have to run into you
in the elevator?

184
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:31,018
I'm worried, that's why!

185
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:32,686
What do you mean you'll play?

186
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:35,064
Forget that. Don't play. Please?

187
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:37,316
Doctor. Go home.

188
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:41,111
Don't run! Spare your knee!

189
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:50,412
TAEYANG

190
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,377
Hey, I'm on my way.

191
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:57,670
Where are you?

192
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:00,798
I met up with a friend.

193
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:02,758
Are you there already?

194
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:05,636
Yeah. I came first…

195
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:09,348
But it's not suitable for training.

196
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:11,851
What's wrong with them?

197
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:15,855
Anyway, get over here.

198
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:20,734
Hey, let's go eat.

199
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:22,987
Aren't you here to train?

200
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,738
We need to eat to have energy to play.

201
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:27,491
You two go ahead.
It'll be nice and romantic.

202
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,878
All right. Let's do our best
and meet at the finals.

203
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:42,923
I wonder if the brackets
will work out that way.

204
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:44,842
What if we meet in the round of 16?

205
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:47,094
Then they'll be eliminated.

206
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:51,932
Even if they get lucky with their brackets
and avoid us,

207
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:54,435
it's not like
just anyone can make it to the finals.

208
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:57,563
It's true.

209
00:14:57,646 --> 00:15:00,941
Sure. You've never played
in a tournament together, and yet,

210
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:02,318
you expect to reach the finals.

211
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:03,903
Wow. Talk about confidence.

212
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:06,822
Right. You played
in the Yook Junghwan Tournament.

213
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,825
Yes. It's a part of my past
that I want to erase. What a joke.

214
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:12,620
Hey. What was wrong with the tournament?

215
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:16,206
I crushed them. That's why.

216
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:21,712
It was our first time playing together,
so we had no teamwork.

217
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:23,213
It won't be easy for you either.

218
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:24,882
But a couple going out…

219
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:27,676
Here. There you go.

220
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,428
Is better than exes.

221
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:36,685
Go out if you're jealous.
Although it'll be hard.

222
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:39,063
Whoa.

223
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,899
Are you two…

224
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:46,612
But you're still partners?
That's so cool of you guys.

225
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:50,616
Why'd you two break up?

226
00:15:52,242 --> 00:15:53,911
-Why?
-Just eat.

227
00:15:57,665 --> 00:15:58,707
Eat.

228
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:02,711
It's good. Eat before it gets cold.

229
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:09,385
I'm so annoyed.

230
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:13,681
Let's crush Junghwan.

231
00:16:14,431 --> 00:16:18,185
Let's crush him like ice
and make a cocktail out of him.

232
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:21,730
He won't get crushed that easily.

233
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:26,902
What? Have you no faith in us?
Have you lost already?

234
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:29,989
Why are you getting excited?
You're getting me excited.

235
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:44,211
I don't want to lose my composure.

236
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:47,673
Or be unreasonable.

237
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:50,926
But I don't want to give up

238
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:54,388
or avoid anything either.

239
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:02,688
I want to try my best till the end.

240
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:09,903
Let's give it our all
and leave no regrets.

241
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:42,186
Okay, that's good. Stop.

242
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:52,112
Stop. You'll explode.

243
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:17,221
What do you mean?
It hit the line and bounced out.

244
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,183
-It was in.
-It was in.

245
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:23,685
-It was out.
-It hit the line.

246
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:24,603
It was out.

247
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:26,772
-Don't you see that.
-It's out.

248
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:27,731
Didn't you see?

249
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:29,942
-I did see it.
-Then what's your problem? It's in.

250
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:31,318
-It's in.
-I saw it go out!

251
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:32,903
Shut it, Green Head.

252
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:34,738
-It's blue.
-How is that blue?

253
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:36,198
-It's blue!
-It's blue!

254
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:37,866
Look in the mirror. How is that blue?

255
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,827
I did! I looked 15 times today.

256
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:42,162
-Stop looking at the mirror.
-He's cute!

257
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:43,455
You call this cute?

258
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:45,707
-Yes!
-You need glasses.

259
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:48,502
How is that cute?
This is what you call cute--

260
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:49,878
-Let's play.
-Really?

261
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,463
-Hey.
-Nope.

262
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:53,549
2022 KOREA BADMINTON GRAND FINAL

263
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:54,967
That's it!

264
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:03,642
2022 KOREA BADMINTON GRAND FINAL

265
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:04,643
LEE YOUNGSIM

266
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:12,317
YUNIS WOMEN'S TEAM COMPETITION, CHAMPIONS

267
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:17,030
The great Yunis!

268
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:20,576
The women's team is the champions!

269
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:22,578
Champions!

270
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:33,881
-Champions!
-Champions!

271
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:38,385
The women's team made up
for the men's team choking!

272
00:19:40,053 --> 00:19:42,389
I swear you shaved
ten years off of my life.

273
00:19:42,472 --> 00:19:43,682
-Coach!
-What?

274
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:45,517
Third place isn't choking.

275
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,186
Fine. Whatever.

276
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:51,773
-Champions!
-Champions!

277
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:54,151
-Champions!
-Champions!

278
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:56,361
-Coach.
-What?

279
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:58,113
What time are the men's doubles?

280
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,409
It's in about two hours.

281
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:06,079
Seungwoo will come, won't he?

282
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:08,916
Let's wait and see.

283
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:10,542
Okay.

284
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:28,393
So… There's one more thing.

285
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:30,938
I wanted to discuss something.

286
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:33,815
Okay.

287
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:37,778
It's about Seungwoo.

288
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:42,866
His career ended too abruptly.

289
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:49,331
If he'll allow it,
I'd like to play with him.

290
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:57,798
I appreciate Taejun's offer, but--

291
00:20:57,881 --> 00:21:00,175
Your retirement
hasn't been officially processed yet.

292
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:01,426
You can compete.

293
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:04,596
I've stopped training.
I can't compete in the tournament.

294
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:07,933
Plus, I've made up my mind.

295
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:09,935
I know how that feels.

296
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:14,523
I quit at the end of my career
just like you.

297
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:18,151
I retired without playing my final match.

298
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:21,113
You're an Olympic gold medalist.

299
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:22,489
So what?

300
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:25,575
The end was pathetic just the same.

301
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:28,120
I fell from even higher up, so…

302
00:21:28,203 --> 00:21:29,955
So, I was more pathetic and it hurt more.

303
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:31,540
And more eyes were on me.

304
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:36,086
Seungwoo. You know,

305
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:39,047
I can't remember my final match.

306
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:42,551
Because I didn't know it would be my last
when I played.

307
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:46,013
Do you know what thoughts I still have
whenever I get drunk?

308
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:48,765
I should've played just one more match.

309
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:51,435
I really want to play just one more match.

310
00:21:53,061 --> 00:21:56,189
You can't play anymore
even if you want to.

311
00:21:56,857 --> 00:21:58,400
This is really your last chance.

312
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:01,862
Will I feel lighthearted
if I play one more match?

313
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,450
When I wake up in the morning,
I'll still feel like I'm all alone

314
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:07,909
in another world regardless.

315
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,586
Seungwoo, the match will begin soon.

316
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:20,380
-I won't play.
-Don't be like that.

317
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:24,676
End your career like an athlete.
On the court.

318
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:48,867
KOO HYUKBONG, YOOK JUNGHWAN

319
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,911
-He didn't call you guys either, right?
-No.

320
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:56,249
We will now begin the round of 16

321
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:58,126
for the men's doubles.

322
00:22:58,293 --> 00:23:01,546
Yunis, Park Taejun, Yeon Seungwoo.
Yunis, Koo Hyukbong, Yook Junghwan.

323
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:04,633
-Please go to court three.
-Sorry, but they'll be right here.

324
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:06,176
They're stuck in traffic.

325
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:09,179
He has to come.

326
00:23:16,978 --> 00:23:19,773
Still no word?
I don't think we can stall any longer.

327
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:33,412
Oh, my gosh! Darn it.

328
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:35,831
-Hey. You guys. Go!
-Coach! Are you okay?

329
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:38,250
-Just go. Leave me! Just go!
-Coach!

330
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:41,044
-Sorry. I'll go on ahead!
-Go!

331
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:44,047
I gotta quit smoking.

332
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:50,053
Out of our way! Move!

333
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:51,179
Excuse us!

334
00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:57,310
He's here!

335
00:24:02,899 --> 00:24:04,109
I'm not too late, am I?

336
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:09,614
Go change.

337
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:11,450
SEUNGWOO

338
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:15,871
Change quickly. Taejun, let's go in.

339
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:19,291
Okay. Who are we playing against, anyway?

340
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,877
Us.

341
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:23,295
What?

342
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:26,882
I thought you'd refuse to play
if I said we were going up against them.

343
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:30,677
I won't go easy on you
even if it's your last match.

344
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:33,722
Seungwoo. I'll do my best to beat you.

345
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:37,100
Regardless, I'm on your side.

346
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:38,602
Good luck!

347
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:45,984
Let's go.

348
00:25:39,454 --> 00:25:41,039
-My bad.
-It's okay.

349
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:43,124
It's okay.

350
00:25:44,584 --> 00:25:47,003
Let's go, captain!

351
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:49,256
-Captain!
-Let's go, captain!

352
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:28,253
Sorry.

353
00:26:28,336 --> 00:26:29,629
You can do it!

354
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:55,071
He did it.

355
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:58,325
-All right!
-That was awesome!

356
00:26:58,825 --> 00:27:00,076
Go, captain!

357
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:25,185
-All right!
-Nice!

358
00:27:25,268 --> 00:27:27,228
-Come on!
-You can do it!

359
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,787
You were disappointed
with today's match, weren't you?

360
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:47,791
No.

361
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,711
It was nice that the best players
in the nation

362
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:54,547
were my opponents in my final match.

363
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,300
And that I played with you.

364
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:05,016
Sorry. I should've been better.

365
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:08,144
I'm grateful.

366
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:11,439
I'm glad I played today.

367
00:28:12,732 --> 00:28:13,983
It feels cathartic.

368
00:28:19,447 --> 00:28:20,365
You're cool.

369
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:25,245
You do what you like
simply because you like it.

370
00:28:25,995 --> 00:28:27,622
Liking something without weighing anything

371
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:30,125
takes courage.

372
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:33,503
Your sweet talk has improved.

373
00:28:34,587 --> 00:28:36,005
Since it's the last time.

374
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:40,176
Let me say some nice words too.

375
00:28:41,636 --> 00:28:42,971
Taejun.

376
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:45,598
Become a player…

377
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:50,687
that someone who gave his all at badminton

378
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,898
wants to play against at his final match.

379
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:59,654
A player that other players respect.

380
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:33,688
We haven't reached the end
of our story yet. Don't you agree?

381
00:29:41,404 --> 00:29:42,572
I'll wait.

382
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:48,036
Until Hana turns 10, 20,

383
00:29:48,828 --> 00:29:50,038
or 30.

384
00:29:54,417 --> 00:29:56,711
Until you can come to me
without feeling bad.

385
00:30:00,423 --> 00:30:01,966
You know I'm good at waiting.

386
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:09,724
Seungwoo.

387
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:17,899
Take your time.

388
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:21,361
As long as you come eventually.

389
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:45,385
Hello, listeners.

390
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:47,762
I have shocking news.

391
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:52,267
We are expecting a meteor shower tonight.

392
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:53,726
It's what you call shooting stars.

393
00:30:54,602 --> 00:30:56,980
Since there will be
a lunar eclipse covering the moon,

394
00:30:57,063 --> 00:30:59,566
it'll be the best space show of the year.

395
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:03,820
If you can't sleep tonight,
why don't you go out and make a wish?

396
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:07,282
-Hey. Should we go stargazing later?
-Especially with family.

397
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:09,826
-Okay. Sounds good.
-Or with your significant other.

398
00:31:09,909 --> 00:31:11,452
You should sleep,

399
00:31:11,911 --> 00:31:13,705
not go stargazing.

400
00:31:13,788 --> 00:31:15,039
You need to stay in shape.

401
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:17,542
-I'll be going.
-Yes, sir.

402
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:19,002
-With my love.
-Let's go.

403
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:21,504
-Okay.
-I can't wait.

404
00:31:22,505 --> 00:31:27,051
I hope tonight will be a special night
for all of us.

405
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:39,314
Dang it.

406
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:41,691
Why are you bowing?

407
00:31:42,108 --> 00:31:43,359
-Stars--
-Where are you going?

408
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:45,778
Roof. You need to see the sky
to see the stars.

409
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:49,407
Must we do all this just to make a wish?

410
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:50,491
Yes, we do.

411
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:54,203
We have a tournament to win,
so it can't hurt.

412
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:58,166
-Let's go.
-Junghwan and Taejun aren't out yet.

413
00:31:58,249 --> 00:32:01,336
Junghwan said he'd kill anyone
who wakes him,

414
00:32:01,502 --> 00:32:03,504
and Taejun is down because he lost today.

415
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:05,048
-Let's go.
-Okay.

416
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:06,883
I see.

417
00:32:13,222 --> 00:32:14,390
Darn it.

418
00:32:31,407 --> 00:32:32,367
You're still up.

419
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:34,369
Why are you barging into the men's dorm?

420
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:36,496
Everyone went to make a wish.

421
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:38,414
Let's go.

422
00:32:39,874 --> 00:32:43,294
Forget it. Why would a shooting star
grant me my wish?

423
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:50,468
I wanted to go stargazing alone with you.

424
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:56,265
Well… I thought we could watch it together
in the field or something.

425
00:32:57,058 --> 00:33:00,561
But if you don't want to,
we don't have to…

426
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:01,688
Let's go.

427
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:12,115
Are you sure there will be shooting stars?

428
00:33:13,032 --> 00:33:14,450
Did we miss them?

429
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:21,416
I don't see anything sparkling. Do you?

430
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,044
Forget shooting stars.
There are no stars, period.

431
00:33:27,463 --> 00:33:28,631
Yes, there are.

432
00:33:29,882 --> 00:33:31,509
We just can't see them.

433
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:35,263
Why is it so hard to make a wish?

434
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:38,182
What do you want to wish for?

435
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:45,023
What is it?

436
00:33:48,651 --> 00:33:49,736
Nothing much.

437
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:53,489
That I'll be cheered on.

438
00:33:56,743 --> 00:33:58,578
The reason it's hard for someone

439
00:33:58,661 --> 00:34:00,872
who lived on the court to leave it.

440
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:04,751
For me, it was people cheering me on.

441
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:09,797
-Park Taeyang!
-Park Taeyang!

442
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:13,217
-You can do it!
-Park Taeyang!

443
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:15,428
-Park Taeyang!
-Park Taeyang!

444
00:34:15,511 --> 00:34:18,765
They were screaming my name
at the top of their lungs.

445
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:22,852
When else would I have people
cheer me on like that?

446
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:25,688
I realized

447
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:28,566
I needed those cheers.

448
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:32,737
And I want to keep receiving them.

449
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:34,781
As the person Park Taeyang.

450
00:34:36,824 --> 00:34:38,034
Congrats.

451
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:42,872
You finally found your reason
for coming back.

452
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:46,042
I did.

453
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:51,339
The problem is,
there are no shooting stars.

454
00:34:58,137 --> 00:35:00,056
Wow. This is so comfy.

455
00:35:00,807 --> 00:35:01,808
Lie down.

456
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:12,568
We should've brought a microscope.

457
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,364
You mean telescope.

458
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:18,449
It doesn't even surprise me anymore.

459
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:23,246
Didn't you find my ignorance funny?

460
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:25,581
Are you sick of it now?

461
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:28,835
What do you want me to say?

462
00:35:30,878 --> 00:35:34,757
I don't know either… how I feel.

463
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:39,303
You probably don't want to know.

464
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:45,351
Because you don't think you can handle it.

465
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:55,444
What would be your wish?

466
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:00,741
To win?

467
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:02,577
No.

468
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,123
Wealth?

469
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:09,333
Success?

470
00:36:10,626 --> 00:36:11,794
Happiness?

471
00:36:13,796 --> 00:36:15,798
To kiss you right now.

472
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:28,019
Was that thunder?

473
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,396
I think it's going to rain.

474
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:35,151
What the heck?

475
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:40,990
I'm speechless.

476
00:36:41,991 --> 00:36:44,160
We should blow up the Weather Service.

477
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:49,373
Should we go tomorrow?

478
00:36:53,836 --> 00:36:56,339
Hey. I just felt a raindrop.

479
00:36:58,466 --> 00:36:59,425
Me too.

480
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:04,972
-Look!
-Dang it!

481
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:07,600
-Run!
-Get inside!

482
00:37:07,683 --> 00:37:09,018
Run!

483
00:37:26,285 --> 00:37:30,164
What meteor shower? It's a rain shower.

484
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:38,422
If you're so desperate for that wish,
make it come true yourself.

485
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:42,593
Just do it.

486
00:37:45,554 --> 00:37:47,098
Even if it rains.

487
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:50,017
Even if someone tries to stop you.

488
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,108
I'll just do it myself.

489
00:38:53,122 --> 00:38:54,415
So,

490
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:58,419
will that wish that I desperately wanted
to make that night

491
00:38:59,211 --> 00:39:01,172
not come true?

492
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:08,304
Hey. Who is that?

493
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:10,056
Isn't she a student?

494
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:12,308
Hey, Junghwan. She must be your fan.

495
00:39:15,561 --> 00:39:16,896
How cute.

496
00:39:17,229 --> 00:39:19,732
Junghwan, take a selfie with her.

497
00:39:19,815 --> 00:39:22,777
Nice, Junghwan. You've still got it.

498
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:25,196
It's such a pain to be popular.

499
00:39:47,843 --> 00:39:49,011
Want an autograph?

500
00:39:57,937 --> 00:39:59,897
-Let's go in.
-Yes, sir.

501
00:40:00,189 --> 00:40:02,400
-Okay.
-Hey, Taeyang.

502
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:11,492
PARK TAEYANG
GOOD LUCK

503
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:15,496
Hey.

504
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:19,166
PARK TAEYANG
GOOD LUCK

505
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:27,049
CAFE, SUNSHINE

506
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:29,093
Who are you?

507
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:35,683
What is this?

508
00:40:36,016 --> 00:40:37,726
Just take it.

509
00:40:38,894 --> 00:40:41,730
I came to cheer you on. Good luck!

510
00:40:45,526 --> 00:40:47,445
You even have a fan.

511
00:40:49,196 --> 00:40:51,699
She's my little sister.

512
00:41:03,335 --> 00:41:05,463
You're a knucklehead too, aren't you?

513
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:13,471
I guess

514
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:16,640
there were shooting stars that night.

515
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:21,103
They were just hidden behind the clouds,
that's all.

516
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:28,444
FIRST DAY OF MIXED DOUBLES

517
00:41:28,527 --> 00:41:29,820
-Is it?
-Passing through.

518
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:31,780
-Hey.
-Right? I have a good feeling about it.

519
00:41:31,864 --> 00:41:33,282
Especially this week.

520
00:41:33,365 --> 00:41:34,992
-I'm going to the bathroom.
-Be quick.

521
00:41:35,075 --> 00:41:36,368
-Hurry up.
-Okay.

522
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:57,556
Oh, no. I have a high fever.

523
00:41:59,975 --> 00:42:03,521
Yikes. That's the ladies' room.

524
00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:09,944
Yumin! Are you inside?

525
00:42:11,403 --> 00:42:12,696
Come out…

526
00:42:14,657 --> 00:42:17,576
Hey. Are you very sick?

527
00:42:19,495 --> 00:42:20,412
It's 39 degrees.

528
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:33,092
You okay?

529
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:35,469
I didn't know you had a sister.

530
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:38,264
Don't ask about my past.

531
00:42:38,347 --> 00:42:39,807
What about your present?

532
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:43,102
It didn't seem bad
from what I saw earlier.

533
00:42:44,186 --> 00:42:45,145
If you're down--

534
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:46,522
Let's do well today.

535
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,233
My bloodline is watching.

536
00:42:56,115 --> 00:42:57,074
Let me see.

537
00:42:59,034 --> 00:43:00,327
You're burning up.

538
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:01,620
Are you really okay?

539
00:43:04,206 --> 00:43:05,958
Actually, I scammed you.

540
00:43:07,459 --> 00:43:08,544
What?

541
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:11,547
I'm always like this before a big match.

542
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:15,676
Catching a cold or the flu,
having stomachaches

543
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:17,720
and appendicitis are the norm.

544
00:43:18,053 --> 00:43:20,598
I once fell on the bus and broke my nose.

545
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:23,058
I even sprained my finger
while squeezing a ketchup packet.

546
00:43:23,142 --> 00:43:25,769
-Anytime I have a big match--
-Take this.

547
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:27,938
It'll bring your fever down.

548
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:31,817
I had a 40-degree fever last time,
and this got rid of it.

549
00:43:32,401 --> 00:43:33,277
Sorry.

550
00:43:34,236 --> 00:43:37,740
We need to crush those who bad-mouth you
for getting kicked off the national team.

551
00:43:38,532 --> 00:43:39,658
But because of me…

552
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:43,537
You're not cursed.

553
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:45,497
You get sick before big matches.

554
00:43:45,581 --> 00:43:47,166
This is only the round of 32.

555
00:43:47,249 --> 00:43:48,917
I've made it to the Olympics.

556
00:43:49,001 --> 00:43:52,713
Still. It's our first tournament together.

557
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:56,175
It's very important to me.

558
00:43:57,468 --> 00:43:58,594
I really am cursed.

559
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:01,013
It's over.

560
00:44:03,223 --> 00:44:04,475
Yumin.

561
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:06,685
Look at me.

562
00:44:07,353 --> 00:44:09,146
-Why?
-Come on.

563
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:14,818
I'm stronger than your curse.

564
00:44:14,902 --> 00:44:17,863
How much do you want to win by today?
Say the word. I'll do it.

565
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:55,567
We got this.

566
00:45:01,824 --> 00:45:04,118
Hey. I feel better now.

567
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:07,454
What I gave you was a vitamin.

568
00:45:08,038 --> 00:45:09,206
What?

569
00:45:09,289 --> 00:45:11,041
It was a vitamin, not medicine.

570
00:45:11,625 --> 00:45:12,876
You never had a fever.

571
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:21,051
You're lying, right?

572
00:45:21,844 --> 00:45:22,886
Whatever.

573
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:44,241
Awesome! Park Taeyang!

574
00:45:45,868 --> 00:45:49,079
He used to be with Seoul City Hall, right?
Park Taejun.

575
00:45:50,497 --> 00:45:52,040
I don't remember.

576
00:45:52,791 --> 00:45:54,918
He's pretty good though. He's got power.

577
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:57,880
He wasn't very memorable, but…

578
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:01,842
Coach Lee Taesang trained him well.

579
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:04,595
Taeyang stands out too.

580
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:07,473
Wow. They play so well together.

581
00:46:13,145 --> 00:46:14,271
They're okay, I guess.

582
00:46:30,579 --> 00:46:32,873
Hey! Guys!

583
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:36,794
You two played well together today.

584
00:46:37,669 --> 00:46:40,130
Stay as focused as you were today.

585
00:46:40,214 --> 00:46:41,215
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

586
00:46:42,966 --> 00:46:44,468
Go for the win.

587
00:46:45,886 --> 00:46:47,930
Put some pressure on yourselves.

588
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:51,058
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

589
00:46:51,141 --> 00:46:52,017
Good.

590
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:54,478
-Dad!
-Hey. Slow down.

591
00:46:54,561 --> 00:46:55,729
Of all the…

592
00:46:56,647 --> 00:47:00,442
I said to separate yourselves
when you're off the court!

593
00:47:00,526 --> 00:47:02,986
We're partners. We should be as one.

594
00:47:04,321 --> 00:47:06,698
Did you see our match?
We played as if we were one.

595
00:47:06,782 --> 00:47:08,700
Hey, Yumin… A pro…

596
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:10,536
A pro needs to be professional.

597
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:12,371
-I--
-Once the match is over, that's it.

598
00:47:12,454 --> 00:47:14,248
Your match is over,
so go your separate ways.

599
00:47:14,331 --> 00:47:15,958
-Get away from her.
-Coach.

600
00:47:16,041 --> 00:47:19,086
-What?
-I need to get going.

601
00:47:19,169 --> 00:47:20,629
-Okay. Go.
-See you later.

602
00:47:21,046 --> 00:47:23,423
Hey! Walk! You should go too.

603
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:28,470
I need to discuss the match with her.

604
00:47:29,054 --> 00:47:30,055
Let go of her hand.

605
00:47:30,556 --> 00:47:32,766
How dare you grab her hand?

606
00:47:34,643 --> 00:47:36,478
I'll do my best.

607
00:47:37,604 --> 00:47:39,147
-You'll do your best on what?
-Well…

608
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:41,358
You'll do your best on what, you punk?
Hey!

609
00:47:41,441 --> 00:47:43,861
-Step out of the way. Move.
-Dad. I love you.

610
00:47:43,944 --> 00:47:45,153
-Get over here.
-Dad.

611
00:47:45,737 --> 00:47:47,155
-Dad.
-You punk.

612
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:54,037
Did she leave already?

613
00:47:59,835 --> 00:48:01,670
KIDDO

614
00:48:06,592 --> 00:48:09,303
Hey. Where are you? Let's meet up.

615
00:48:09,386 --> 00:48:12,723
I may cut school,
but I never skip my academy.

616
00:48:13,307 --> 00:48:15,225
It's money that can't be wasted.

617
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:16,935
I'm at the bus stop.

618
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:19,146
I see. You left already.

619
00:48:20,272 --> 00:48:21,857
Get back safely.

620
00:48:21,982 --> 00:48:25,235
Don't cut school either next time.

621
00:48:25,944 --> 00:48:27,529
Anyway, you know something?

622
00:48:27,613 --> 00:48:30,574
Mom went to the temple today
when she heard you were playing.

623
00:48:32,409 --> 00:48:34,578
She goes often because of you.

624
00:48:35,078 --> 00:48:36,538
To pray you do well.

625
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:41,168
She should just use that time to call you.

626
00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:43,754
She makes no sense.

627
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:47,883
But I wanted to tell you regardless.

628
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:51,803
I'll take you

629
00:48:53,013 --> 00:48:54,473
out to eat next time.

630
00:48:55,182 --> 00:48:56,600
Call me.

631
00:48:56,683 --> 00:48:58,894
I will. My bus is here.

632
00:48:58,977 --> 00:49:01,772
One more thing. You were super cool today.

633
00:49:16,411 --> 00:49:17,412
Here.

634
00:49:18,956 --> 00:49:20,499
Do you feel better?

635
00:49:20,916 --> 00:49:23,293
Yes. That placebo was awesome.

636
00:49:24,044 --> 00:49:26,254
How did a vitamin bring down my fever?

637
00:49:26,713 --> 00:49:29,257
It really is mind over matter.

638
00:49:29,341 --> 00:49:31,009
It really was medicine.

639
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:33,345
What?

640
00:49:33,929 --> 00:49:36,139
You kept stressing about being cursed.

641
00:49:37,265 --> 00:49:38,517
"It's no big deal.

642
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:41,520
Even a vitamin can bring down a fever
if I think it's medicine."

643
00:49:41,603 --> 00:49:42,479
So you'd think that.

644
00:49:46,775 --> 00:49:49,569
You know that once you break a curse,
it's gone forever, right?

645
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:53,031
Your curse was broken today.
Don't forget that.

646
00:49:57,828 --> 00:49:59,413
This will make sure I don't forget.

647
00:50:14,344 --> 00:50:15,429
Let's…

648
00:50:17,514 --> 00:50:18,724
never forget.

649
00:50:50,756 --> 00:50:51,798
What?

650
00:50:53,508 --> 00:50:56,470
He's playing mixed doubles with that girl?

651
00:50:56,553 --> 00:50:57,512
Yeah.

652
00:51:01,308 --> 00:51:02,934
Are they still together?

653
00:51:03,852 --> 00:51:05,187
How would I know?

654
00:51:06,646 --> 00:51:10,358
They wanted to play together,
so I told them to do as they pleased.

655
00:51:14,196 --> 00:51:15,322
Taeyang and I…

656
00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:18,533
made up?

657
00:51:19,993 --> 00:51:21,328
Is that the right term?

658
00:51:21,536 --> 00:51:22,746
Anyway, we're cool now.

659
00:51:25,123 --> 00:51:27,250
How can you get past it?

660
00:51:28,293 --> 00:51:29,669
I thought I couldn't,

661
00:51:29,878 --> 00:51:32,047
but I realized it was nothing once I did.

662
00:51:38,512 --> 00:51:40,097
You should watch Taejun play.

663
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:41,515
Are you…

664
00:51:41,598 --> 00:51:44,643
How can I watch him play with the girl
who did this to you?

665
00:51:45,435 --> 00:51:48,980
Gosh. You may have gotten past it,

666
00:51:49,064 --> 00:51:50,482
but I haven't.

667
00:51:50,565 --> 00:51:51,817
Mom.

668
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:54,319
What's wrong with me?

669
00:51:57,656 --> 00:52:00,075
I retired a little early, that's all.

670
00:52:01,368 --> 00:52:02,869
My life isn't ruined.

671
00:52:06,623 --> 00:52:09,793
Because you keep feeling sorry for me,

672
00:52:11,503 --> 00:52:13,046
I feel like

673
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:15,841
I'm a failure.

674
00:52:20,387 --> 00:52:22,430
If you keep hurting because of me,

675
00:52:23,098 --> 00:52:25,684
I'll never be able
to move on from what happened.

676
00:52:28,311 --> 00:52:30,355
"You're doing great."

677
00:52:31,773 --> 00:52:33,066
Just cheer me on.

678
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:35,110
That way, I can be strong and do better.

679
00:52:37,946 --> 00:52:40,240
Here. Eat this and be strong too.

680
00:52:40,907 --> 00:52:42,742
Gosh. No.

681
00:52:42,909 --> 00:52:44,035
Eat it.

682
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:48,206
Isn't it yummy?

683
00:52:50,584 --> 00:52:51,626
It's sweet.

684
00:52:52,419 --> 00:52:53,420
Is it?

685
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:02,304
You started eating without me?
That's messed up.

686
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:03,638
There's a slice left.

687
00:53:03,722 --> 00:53:05,348
Freeze! Don't move!

688
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:08,351
I haven't eaten yet either.
Is it me or Taejun?

689
00:53:10,979 --> 00:53:11,938
It's you, of course.

690
00:53:13,773 --> 00:53:15,317
But it's first come, first served.

691
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,402
Nice. You've got principles.

692
00:53:19,279 --> 00:53:21,364
You didn't get here first. You're cutting.

693
00:53:22,157 --> 00:53:25,243
This is worse than "Who do you love more,
Mommy or Daddy?"

694
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:31,124
Nothing gets done without a captain.

695
00:53:33,919 --> 00:53:36,171
Your captain will decide for you.
Come with me.

696
00:53:43,637 --> 00:53:46,264
Ready? Go!

697
00:53:52,687 --> 00:53:54,773
You and Taeyang lucked out
with the brackets.

698
00:53:54,856 --> 00:53:56,608
You don't meet us until the finals.

699
00:53:56,942 --> 00:53:58,109
Really?

700
00:53:58,193 --> 00:54:00,403
We didn't even check.
We must make you nervous.

701
00:54:00,487 --> 00:54:03,031
We'll breeze our way to the finals,

702
00:54:03,114 --> 00:54:04,991
so work your butt off to catch up.

703
00:54:05,075 --> 00:54:07,869
We'll see you at the finals then.

704
00:54:07,953 --> 00:54:09,329
Okay. Fine.

705
00:54:21,258 --> 00:54:24,177
You two are too provocative.
You almost kissed.

706
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:28,598
Dang it. Forget this.

707
00:54:28,682 --> 00:54:30,809
Hey. Our lips didn't touch.

708
00:54:30,892 --> 00:54:32,435
It's gross just thinking about it.

709
00:54:34,854 --> 00:54:35,981
Help yourself.

710
00:54:36,731 --> 00:54:39,276
Why that… You disgusting jerk.

711
00:54:44,823 --> 00:54:47,325
Hey, doesn't it look like he's limping?

712
00:54:47,409 --> 00:54:48,743
He must be tired.

713
00:55:13,184 --> 00:55:14,728
I'll treat you better.

714
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:18,773
Hang on a little longer.

715
00:56:04,527 --> 00:56:06,821
I watched Park Taejun closely.

716
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:11,534
He's pretty good. How is he?

717
00:56:11,618 --> 00:56:12,827
Why? You want him?

718
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:16,289
You may not know
since you only work with athletes

719
00:56:16,373 --> 00:56:19,084
that are premade at the training center,

720
00:56:19,167 --> 00:56:24,839
but discovering a raw gem
takes real special talent.

721
00:56:26,174 --> 00:56:29,219
Coach Kim, Taejun and Taeyang
stood out to you too, I guess.

722
00:56:29,928 --> 00:56:34,057
Don't get me started. My phone
is ringing off the hook because of them.

723
00:56:35,016 --> 00:56:38,561
I didn't do anything.
They did it all themselves.

724
00:56:39,062 --> 00:56:40,563
Yes, that's correct.

725
00:56:41,314 --> 00:56:44,901
It's rare for someone to improve
so dramatically like this.

726
00:56:44,984 --> 00:56:47,862
Our kids are persistent.

727
00:56:47,946 --> 00:56:50,532
They remind me of myself back in the day.

728
00:56:52,617 --> 00:56:53,993
Yes.

729
00:56:54,786 --> 00:56:57,455
You're publishing an article already?
They haven't even won yet.

730
00:56:58,081 --> 00:57:00,959
Please pick a nice picture of them.

731
00:57:01,376 --> 00:57:04,003
Do you need one of me? No, right?

732
00:57:05,213 --> 00:57:06,339
Of course not.

733
00:57:06,923 --> 00:57:08,633
Well, if you do…

734
00:57:09,217 --> 00:57:11,386
MIXED DOUBLES TAEJUN AND TAEYANG,
A MUST-WATCH! WILL THEY TURN IT AROUND?

735
00:57:11,469 --> 00:57:12,595
Let me see.

736
00:57:16,641 --> 00:57:19,602
Nice, Park twins.
You even have an article about you.

737
00:57:20,478 --> 00:57:21,980
"A must-watch! Will they turn it around?"

738
00:57:22,647 --> 00:57:24,441
You've finally made it to the finals.

739
00:57:25,859 --> 00:57:27,318
What are we supposed to do?

740
00:57:27,902 --> 00:57:30,655
Are we supposed to root for Junghwan
or the two of you?

741
00:57:31,406 --> 00:57:35,034
On their side, Yumin's from Somang Bank.

742
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:38,329
Of course, you have to root for us. Right?

743
00:57:39,205 --> 00:57:42,041
-Let's go. I'm tired.
-Taejun isn't here yet.

744
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:43,585
Let's just leave him.

745
00:57:44,127 --> 00:57:46,671
-Let's go! Let's go.
-Let's go.

746
00:57:47,672 --> 00:57:49,340
Hey! You'd better wait!

747
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:58,850
It's finally the finals tomorrow.

748
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:01,019
The finals that I've been dreaming of.

749
00:58:02,353 --> 00:58:05,398
Please let us do well. Please.

750
00:58:45,188 --> 00:58:47,148
The swelling is bad.

751
00:58:48,566 --> 00:58:49,776
And it feels hot.

752
00:58:52,028 --> 00:58:53,279
Try flexing.

753
00:58:56,783 --> 00:58:57,992
Again.

754
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:13,424
No matches. I prohibit it.

755
00:59:14,926 --> 00:59:16,719
I just need to play one more match.

756
00:59:36,489 --> 00:59:40,660
However, life never goes my way.

757
00:59:52,714 --> 00:59:59,721
MIXED DOUBLES FINALS

758
01:00:08,813 --> 01:00:10,189
AMBULANCE

759
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:21,576
Taejun.

760
01:00:21,909 --> 01:00:25,413
Do you think…
the shooting stars fell that night?

761
01:01:00,281 --> 01:01:02,241
GOING TO YOU AT A SPEED OF 493KM

762
01:01:02,325 --> 01:01:05,286
Can't you give me a chance just this once?

763
01:01:05,411 --> 01:01:06,537
I don't think I can do that.

764
01:01:06,621 --> 01:01:09,332
No matches. I prohibit it.

765
01:01:09,415 --> 01:01:12,877
I'm going to do well in the match
and tell you how I feel.

766
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:14,504
Be honest. It's really bad, isn't it?

767
01:01:15,004 --> 01:01:17,006
I'm fine. Do you want it to hurt?

768
01:01:18,508 --> 01:01:20,134
-Coach.
-What's wrong? An injury?

769
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:22,637
Don't forget even for a second

770
01:01:23,179 --> 01:01:24,514
that you are loved.

771
01:01:25,181 --> 01:01:28,101
Because I'll love you
without stopping for a single second.

772
01:01:40,196 --> 01:01:41,280
GOING TO YOU AT A SPEED OF 493KM

773
01:01:41,364 --> 01:01:43,366
