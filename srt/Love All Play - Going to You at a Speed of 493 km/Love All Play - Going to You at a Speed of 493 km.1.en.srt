1
00:00:37,787 --> 00:00:40,790
GOING TO YOU AT A SPEED OF 493KM

2
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,586
THE PLACES, PEOPLE, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTIONAL

3
00:00:52,802 --> 00:00:54,220
Become sashimi.

4
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:57,140
And be born as a human in your next life.

5
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:00,018
Don't live like me.

6
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:15,158
EPISODE 1

7
00:01:29,672 --> 00:01:31,132
Thank you for everything.

8
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:34,511
Now that I know how to make sashimi,

9
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:36,971
I won't starve to death.

10
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:39,557
I have nothing to fear thanks to you.

11
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:45,355
You said you'd do anything
if I provided food and housing.

12
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:49,484
Do you remember? You showed up
in a tracksuit carrying a single bag.

13
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:51,528
And you were weeping.

14
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:56,533
I was quite naive, wasn't I?

15
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:58,993
Hey.

16
00:01:59,994 --> 00:02:01,871
Get your act together and make money.

17
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:03,873
You're 25. That's not that young.

18
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:06,209
You'll be 30 in no time.

19
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:10,547
I'm going in order to make money.

20
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,216
I got a job.

21
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:15,718
You did? Where?

22
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:19,264
That's not right, you punk.

23
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:21,474
Where is it? Which sushi place?

24
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:24,269
Well… So…

25
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:35,029
THE 25TH KOREAN BADMINTON CHAMPIONSHIP

26
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:36,531
SEOUL CITY HALL BADMINTON CLUB
YUNIS BADMINTON CLUB

27
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:20,450
THE 25TH KOREAN BADMINTON CHAMPIONSHIP

28
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:23,328
Taejun, you bastard.
Where are you? Get over here.

29
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:26,122
The tournament starts in an hour.
What's wrong with you?

30
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:30,585
What? Your uncle passed away?

31
00:03:30,668 --> 00:03:33,338
Does your uncle pass away every month?
Do you have 12 uncles?

32
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:35,131
Does your aunt have 12 husbands?

33
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:38,301
Who cares if you're on the national team?

34
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:40,178
I've been on it too!

35
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:42,347
I won a gold medal in my prime…

36
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,057
All you've ever won is silver.

37
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:47,393
You punk.
We have to submit the player list.

38
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:49,312
Are you trying to screw me over?

39
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:56,277
-Get your butt here now.
-This is a team competition.

40
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:58,363
The others are waiting for you.

41
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:00,365
Get over here.

42
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:05,286
I guess Yuk Junghwan isn't here yet.

43
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:08,039
He can't get back into it
after becoming a star Olympian, can he?

44
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,334
What are you doing there?

45
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:13,044
Is there a problem with your team?

46
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:15,129
We're like a well-oiled machine.

47
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:17,298
It's like the military in there.

48
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:18,591
I see. Like the military.

49
00:04:19,842 --> 00:04:22,887
Then how can the military
defeat the national team?

50
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:27,225
No one on your team
is on the national team, right?

51
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:28,977
I'm here, Coach!

52
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:34,023
His uncle passed away.

53
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:36,776
The grief must be unbearable.

54
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:39,112
-I'm sorry.
-He's suddenly grieving.

55
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:40,196
Let's go.

56
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:43,408
Why were you cursing so much
into the phone?

57
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:46,035
How can I play
after being cursed out like that?

58
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:48,037
I'm upset enough about winning silver.

59
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:49,914
Get in here.

60
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:05,305
YUNIS

61
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:07,807
Okay. Will you lose to
the pathetic City Hall team?

62
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:10,018
Let's win this team competition easily.

63
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:12,228
We play on the people's tax money.

64
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:14,897
Pride and a sense of duty. Okay?

65
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,190
Win.

66
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:17,984
I'll win too.

67
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:20,236
Let's end it in three matches!

68
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:22,488
Win.

69
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,032
You win too.

70
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:26,659
Don't let it get to my turn.
I need to rest.

71
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:27,952
Let's go, Seoul City Hall!

72
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:29,829
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

73
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:31,164
Okay! Let's go, Yunis!

74
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:33,124
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

75
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:35,043
-All right!
-Let's do this!

76
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,929
PARK TAEJUN
SEOUL CITY HALL

77
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:58,149
-Yes!
-Nice!

78
00:05:58,232 --> 00:06:00,234
-That's right!
-Awesome!

79
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:01,277
-My bad.
-It's fine.

80
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:21,756
Yes!

81
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:25,134
Seungwoo. Cut it from the front.

82
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:26,344
Yes, sir.

83
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:27,428
Let's do this!

84
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:49,117
-Come on!
-Come on.

85
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:53,287
Come on.

86
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:28,990
That's right!

87
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:33,744
You can do it.

88
00:07:37,915 --> 00:07:40,710
That Park Taejun's pretty good.

89
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:46,007
Hey. If you can't do that much,
you should pay to play,

90
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:47,341
not be paid.

91
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:50,803
Why are you worried?
We won the first two matches,

92
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:52,346
and Junghwan's up next.

93
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,848
Junghwan, warm up.

94
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:55,808
Looks like you'll have to play.
Where did he go?

95
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:01,230
He's sleeping.

96
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:02,940
Give me that.

97
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:06,235
-I'm going to kill him. You bastard!
-Coach.

98
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:08,779
Hey. Don't worry.

99
00:08:09,363 --> 00:08:11,115
You know
I play well the day after I drink.

100
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,492
Was the funeral a lie?

101
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:15,036
I knew it. You rat.

102
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:16,913
As long as we win.

103
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:18,581
Let's do this.

104
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,627
There are a lot of girls in the stands.

105
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:24,670
Yup. All Yuk Junghwan fans.

106
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:32,637
LET'S GO TEAM YUNIS

107
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:45,983
YUK JUNGHWAN

108
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,819
Hey. Are you okay?

109
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,573
Can you play?

110
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:34,865
I can.

111
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:36,200
Are you sure?

112
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:37,660
I twisted it a little, that's all.

113
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:39,662
Good. Hang in there. It's almost over.

114
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:40,621
Yes, sir.

115
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:43,291
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

116
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:46,294
You can't play.

117
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:47,878
Hey! Taejun!

118
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:51,007
He can't continue.
It's the same spot he tore before.

119
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:53,551
-He barely recovered--
-He says he can play.

120
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:56,220
If we forfeit now,
we lose the team competition.

121
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:59,307
If he reinjures it,
his career as an athlete is over.

122
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:01,142
He'll need surgery.

123
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:05,771
I'll ask the ref to continue.

124
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:07,106
He's injured.

125
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:08,858
That's not right. Wait.

126
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:11,861
Hey, Taejun. Let's play.

127
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:15,448
Wipe your sweat first.

128
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,701
-Do you want to retire after today?
-I can deal.

129
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,202
Don't you trust me?

130
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:22,204
Come on.

131
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:23,372
-Good. Hang in there.
-Okay.

132
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,127
LEE JAESIK
SEOUL CITY HALL

133
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:36,594
Please.

134
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:40,306
Let's not throw down
our lives for a sport.

135
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:46,062
I forfeit.

136
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:54,195
I'm too tired to play.

137
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:55,237
Hey, Tae…

138
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:04,038
I forfeit.

139
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:07,541
Hey.

140
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:11,003
Taejun.

141
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:13,172
Hey, Park Taejun!

142
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:15,508
-Taejun.
-Taejun.

143
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:17,009
Dang it.

144
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:20,930
Come on.

145
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,239
Excuse me.

146
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:22,450
Aren't you Park Taeyang?

147
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:26,162
It's been so long.
It's so good to see you.

148
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:29,707
It's been so long.

149
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:32,209
How have you been… miss?

150
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:33,919
You look the same.

151
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:37,590
I guess you stay young and look the same
since you're an athlete and work out.

152
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:39,175
We don't know each other.

153
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:42,094
Only I know you. Since you're so famous.

154
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:45,514
I see. Okay.

155
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:49,393
Exactly.

156
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:51,812
No wonder.

157
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:55,858
But it's nice being back.

158
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:57,777
There are people who recognize me.

159
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:01,280
Okay, then. Good luck.

160
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:07,495
She's back?

161
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:09,580
To the sport?

162
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:10,915
No way.

163
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:12,666
Hey. What's up?

164
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:15,294
Is she famous?

165
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:17,171
You're seriously clueless.

166
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,715
Don't you know the prodigy Park Taeyang?

167
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:22,718
For real?

168
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:28,891
She used to be a child prodigy.
The Olympic hopeful.

169
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:30,392
The future of Korean badminton.

170
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:32,978
She owned every good nickname out there.

171
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:36,899
Her fastest hit clocked in
at over 320 kph.

172
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:40,277
Anyway, I bet she set an unofficial record
in women's badminton.

173
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:44,198
She had the most amazing smash.

174
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:47,868
Why did she quit?

175
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:50,663
She was caught bribing the association.

176
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:52,915
She ran away from the training center.

177
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:56,919
It was like three years ago.

178
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:00,714
Dang it. Did I seem
really happy to see her?

179
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:05,177
I forgot about the bribery incident.

180
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:08,389
I regret it.

181
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:11,725
That's so disgusting.

182
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:15,437
It's Junghwan!

183
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:20,025
-Excuse us.
-Coming through.

184
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,903
-Can we get through?
-Hey.

185
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:24,113
Can I get a picture?

186
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:26,574
Thank you.

187
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:30,035
May I get your autograph?

188
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:40,212
It's a six since Yuk sounds like six.

189
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:42,756
You're not my fan, are you?

190
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:44,758
Hold on.

191
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:53,559
Oh, my gosh. Hey.

192
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:56,353
Check the group chat.

193
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:59,023
-Park Taeyang showed up.
-Really?

194
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:00,357
-Park Taeyang?
-Yes.

195
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:06,530
I thought she left Korea.
Why do you think she's back?

196
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:11,493
Let me see that.

197
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:24,798
Park Taeyang.

198
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,509
Why did you show up here?

199
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:41,065
I ended up coming back.

200
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:57,122
DANDONG GYMNASIUM

201
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:00,960
Again!

202
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,128
Stretch farther!

203
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:04,463
Get lower. Here.

204
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:07,883
Good. Lower your stance.

205
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,510
Here. Good.

206
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:11,428
Good.

207
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:13,305
Hey! Stretch all the way!

208
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:17,643
I missed it.

209
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:19,728
Good going.

210
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:23,023
Why are you following the shuttlecock?
Move your body first.

211
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:24,525
Dang it.

212
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,905
How are you such a mess
in just three years?

213
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:31,740
Just toss the birdie.

214
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,409
Are you proving a point?

215
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:35,202
It's been an hour. Here.

216
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:37,663
It's the least I can do.

217
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:40,666
What is this, kid?

218
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:45,004
Not a single professional team wanted you,
so you went to the one I hate.

219
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:47,131
For dirt cheap too!

220
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:49,133
The mighty Park Taeyang…

221
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:53,345
Dang it. I'm burning up inside.

222
00:16:57,933 --> 00:16:58,892
Shoot.

223
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:12,322
Park Taeyang's smash!

224
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:13,907
It's in!

225
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:17,036
It's 20 to 19. Match point.

226
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,996
One point for the win.

227
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:20,914
Park Taeyang is receiving the serve.

228
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:39,141
Park Taeyang's point!

229
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:42,561
They did it. What a dramatic match.

230
00:17:42,644 --> 00:17:45,773
It's Korea's win. Korea wins.

231
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:52,029
Park Taeyang is moved to tears.

232
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:54,531
The gold medal

233
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:59,411
goes to Park Taeyang and Kim Juyung.

234
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,747
The future of Korean badminton.

235
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:05,751
Yes, but my career was completely ruined.

236
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:16,762
PARK TAEYANG BADMINTON

237
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:34,363
Cramp!

238
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:39,451
How am I cramping just from that?

239
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:48,877
That hurts.

240
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:53,924
But it's so yummy.

241
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:01,598
Hey. What's wrong with you?

242
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:04,685
Why are you quitting?
Join another team at least.

243
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:07,688
I just don't want to do it.
I'm sick of it.

244
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:09,064
It's not because of you.

245
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:12,985
Fine. We always get hurt left and right.

246
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:14,153
It's either the dorm

247
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:16,113
or the training center.

248
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:17,906
You started when you were eight--

249
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,700
-Seven.
-Sev…

250
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:26,248
Anyway. It makes sense
that you're sick of it.

251
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:28,417
But why now? Why?

252
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:30,169
Why do I need a reason?

253
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:32,796
Do you have a reason
for not liking your ex anymore?

254
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:34,590
-No.
-What the heck?

255
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:35,549
See?

256
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:37,676
What more will I get if I stay here?

257
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:40,888
My athletic career
won't turn around in my twenties.

258
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:43,974
You little…

259
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,809
Let's go drink.

260
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:50,731
-Taeyang? Training starts Monday,
-Yes?

261
00:19:50,814 --> 00:19:54,067
so you should get to know each other
and become friends.

262
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:55,402
You're all family now.

263
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:00,532
Bye.

264
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:03,285
-Good night.
-Good night.

265
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:06,163
If we come here--

266
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:09,541
Hey.

267
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:13,086
Wasn't that Yunis's…

268
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:18,675
This is why I hate bars
that athletes go to.

269
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:21,094
Let's go elsewhere.
Why Yunis, of all teams?

270
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:22,721
-Let's drink here.
-What?

271
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:25,682
I guess it wasn't an injury.

272
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:28,060
So why did you forfeit?

273
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:32,940
You looked mad cool
walking calmly off the court.

274
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:35,567
-Hey--
-Don't.

275
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:37,736
-Let's go.
-Let's go over there.

276
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,155
Let's go.

277
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:44,826
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

278
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,708
With specs like mine,
I'll make lots of money giving lessons.

279
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:53,460
Enough to buy a foreign car
in a few years.

280
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:56,213
You know, I'm glad I played badminton.

281
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:58,048
There are lots of options after retiring.

282
00:20:58,131 --> 00:21:01,551
I still can't believe it.

283
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:02,970
That you're quitting.

284
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:05,722
That's right. Hey.

285
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:08,892
You know this, right? My other half.

286
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:11,728
I'm dumping this here today.

287
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:13,146
-Hey.
-Will you believe it then?

288
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:15,899
-Stop that.
-Darn it.

289
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:19,236
If it bothers you so much,
set me up with a girl.

290
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,531
I'll be able to have dinner
and watch movies

291
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:24,283
with a girlfriend after work now.

292
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:25,617
Unlike all of you.

293
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:28,537
-I'm suddenly jealous.
-Want to quit with me?

294
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:31,248
No thanks. But I'll set you up.
What's your type?

295
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:32,582
She just can't be an athlete.

296
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:34,042
Someone who hates to even walk.

297
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:36,086
Someone too weak to carry her purse.

298
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:38,422
Someone too frail to walk in the wind.

299
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,340
Someone who gets pale in the cold.

300
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:45,429
Shoot. I've only dated athletes,
so it's a fantasy to date the opposite.

301
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:46,972
I know someone.

302
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:49,933
My granny. She's 78 and divorced.

303
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:51,935
She's rich and has a pretty name.
Kim Kkotbun.

304
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:54,855
-You punk.
-Hold on. Granny!

305
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:57,607
-You punk.
-My granny's pretty.

306
00:21:57,691 --> 00:21:59,276
Shut it.

307
00:22:00,777 --> 00:22:02,863
Okay, let's all have a drink.

308
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:05,782
The mood is so…

309
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:09,036
Well, no one's talking,

310
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:10,871
so I'll start it off.

311
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:13,957
Taeyang. Let's lay it all on the table.

312
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:16,960
Okay. Go ahead.

313
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:18,712
Your bribery issue.

314
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:22,549
I heard you took off
before it could blow up.

315
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,176
Well…

316
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:31,308
Was that the rumor that went around?

317
00:22:31,391 --> 00:22:32,934
Yes, it was.

318
00:22:33,935 --> 00:22:34,853
Is it not true?

319
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:38,648
It's true.

320
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:40,901
Sorry.

321
00:22:40,984 --> 00:22:43,070
Hey. Look at us when you apologize.

322
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:45,655
I'm too humiliated to make eye contact.

323
00:22:45,989 --> 00:22:49,701
I'll etch this feeling into my heart
and never forget it.

324
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:52,329
Hey. Are you being sarcastic?

325
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:53,914
Not at all.

326
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,171
Focus.

327
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:03,215
What's with the mood here?

328
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:07,052
Since I'm in a really good mood,
I'm picking up your tab.

329
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:09,888
So please drink as much as you want!

330
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:11,264
My friend's paying!

331
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:12,599
-Cheers--
-Why you…

332
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:16,269
You… You're so cool!

333
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:18,230
-Yes!
-What a man!

334
00:23:18,313 --> 00:23:19,815
-What a man!
-Cheers!

335
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:20,857
I'm ordering everything.

336
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:23,777
-Excuse me. The menu, please.
-Youngsim.

337
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:25,946
Here. Have a seat.

338
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:29,032
-Anyway, I'm a senior.
-Oh, a senior?

339
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:32,119
-Hello.
-It's Ko Dongwan. Nice to meet you.

340
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:34,496
Let's drink. Hey, order everything.

341
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:40,710
Youngsim.

342
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:42,587
I retired from the national team.

343
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:47,426
I read the article.

344
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:50,303
I wanted to contact you.

345
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:56,476
How's married life?

346
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,103
I got a divorce.

347
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:00,147
I guess you missed that article.

348
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:04,276
But you have a daughter.

349
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:06,987
-How's Hana doing?
-I lost custody.

350
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:12,200
It must've been hard.

351
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:18,665
It'll be harder for you.

352
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:23,253
You'll have to live with me in the dorm.

353
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:30,844
Listen.

354
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:33,263
It'll be a war between us.

355
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:35,891
Either be prepared

356
00:24:37,058 --> 00:24:38,310
or give up.

357
00:24:50,071 --> 00:24:50,906
Fine.

358
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:54,075
I'm a piece of trash that bribes people.

359
00:24:57,787 --> 00:25:01,458
-I wish I had the money to bribe people…
-Your form is good, but your score is bad.

360
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:05,837
I'm a rich girl? What a nice image.

361
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:09,174
Then I'll act the part.

362
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:18,850
Your form is good, but your score is bad.

363
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:21,811
Shoot. What's with the crappy score?

364
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:26,525
-Hey--
-Oh, my gosh!

365
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:29,027
You even got a bonus.

366
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:30,820
Were you in line?

367
00:25:31,404 --> 00:25:32,239
I'm Park Taejun.

368
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:34,366
You know me, right?

369
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:37,410
Are you mad you didn't break the record?

370
00:25:39,829 --> 00:25:40,747
You know me.

371
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:43,333
Right… No, I don't.

372
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:52,634
Dang it. I've lost all my muscles.

373
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:56,846
You must not remember.

374
00:25:57,847 --> 00:25:58,723
Sorry.

375
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:01,142
We're the same age.

376
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:03,812
So we can speak casually.

377
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:09,526
You got something to say?

378
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:11,570
-Want some?
-No.

379
00:26:12,153 --> 00:26:13,405
Want this?

380
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:15,365
Leave it here. You seem drunk.

381
00:26:16,157 --> 00:26:18,118
You're so cool. You didn't even ask why.

382
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:21,454
You're dumping your racket
out of anger and quitting.

383
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:22,914
Who hasn't done that before?

384
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:25,875
Don't regret it later. I'll leave it
at the counter. Pick it up tomorrow.

385
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:27,544
I really retired.

386
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:33,550
Do you know what 493 km is?

387
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:34,926
The unofficial world record.

388
00:26:36,886 --> 00:26:39,222
That's the racket I used back then.

389
00:26:44,227 --> 00:26:46,229
Most people don't know
the unofficial record.

390
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:49,816
That's right. You set the unofficial
women's record in Korea, right?

391
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,818
At 323 km.

392
00:26:51,901 --> 00:26:54,779
Does the unofficial record holder
acknowledges an unofficial record holder?

393
00:26:55,405 --> 00:26:56,865
I know who you are.

394
00:26:57,616 --> 00:27:00,327
I wouldn't dump my other half
with someone who doesn't know it.

395
00:27:03,913 --> 00:27:06,875
Are you really giving this to me? Why?

396
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:09,878
Because I've rooted for you
since I was 12.

397
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:16,051
Who am I? Curious, right?

398
00:27:18,428 --> 00:27:19,638
I'm glad you're back.

399
00:27:24,934 --> 00:27:27,646
Taejun! Let's go!

400
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:28,813
-Hey!
-Come on!

401
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:32,317
Hey!

402
00:27:32,942 --> 00:27:35,528
I got rid of my racket!

403
00:27:36,237 --> 00:27:37,197
See that?

404
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:46,247
Why that… Dang it!

405
00:27:47,248 --> 00:27:51,294
Where's that bastard Park Taejun?

406
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:53,963
You're drunk. Sit back down.

407
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:56,216
Let go. That tickles.

408
00:27:56,299 --> 00:27:58,802
That guy Park Taejun said
he'd pick up the tab,

409
00:27:58,885 --> 00:28:00,512
so Dongwan ordered all of that.

410
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:02,847
-Shoot.
-But he bailed.

411
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:07,018
Shoot. What do I do? Dang it.

412
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:09,437
Why did you order whiskey?

413
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:12,524
-He said he'd pick up our tab. Dang it.
-Ouch! That hurts!

414
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:16,736
Hey, guest of honor. What do we do?

415
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:25,578
I'll pick up the tab.

416
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:27,247
Nice!

417
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:30,375
What a woman.

418
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:43,263
They need to look sweaty.

419
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:45,432
That's good.

420
00:28:49,936 --> 00:28:52,814
Is this necessary, Coach?

421
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:53,940
Spray more.

422
00:28:54,023 --> 00:28:57,402
Make it look like beads of sweat
are dripping off her chin.

423
00:28:57,485 --> 00:28:59,195
-That's what I want--
-Coach.

424
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,156
This is a company. It's a company team.

425
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:03,408
Who feeds you? The person who pays you.

426
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:07,620
The person who takes a loss every year
to keep us going is our master.

427
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:11,416
Let's give our all today
and secure our bread and butter.

428
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:16,045
Even athletes need to know
how to survive in a company.

429
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:18,590
Give me that.

430
00:29:21,676 --> 00:29:23,219
I hate doing this too.

431
00:29:23,344 --> 00:29:24,804
See our captain holding his breath?

432
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:26,681
-Surviving in a company.
-Look at that.

433
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:28,933
-Here. You too.
-I can't do stuff like that.

434
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:30,852
Stand straight. Come on.

435
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:33,021
I'm exhausted.

436
00:29:34,355 --> 00:29:36,608
The national team members,
including Junghwan,

437
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:38,943
are in the training center.

438
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:42,489
They get paid by us
but train at the training center.

439
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:46,659
Oh, my gosh. Look at you sweating.

440
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:50,747
You are truly the symbols of passion.

441
00:29:51,706 --> 00:29:53,541
Since the CEO came in person--

442
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:55,919
Thank you very much
for cheering on the athletes.

443
00:29:56,002 --> 00:29:56,961
Oh my.

444
00:29:59,255 --> 00:30:02,967
My goodness. You look strong-willed.

445
00:30:03,843 --> 00:30:05,136
I've been watching your matches.

446
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,846
-You're doing well. Right?
-Yes.

447
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,349
Please keep it up.

448
00:30:09,432 --> 00:30:10,934
-Yes, ma'am.
-Thank you.

449
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:16,397
I've never received such invigorating
support in my entire athletic career.

450
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:19,526
I'm so sad I didn't record it
so I could listen to it over and over.

451
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:22,320
Oh, my gosh. You're sweet too.

452
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:24,614
You're going to do well. I can feel it.

453
00:30:25,281 --> 00:30:26,282
Ma'am.

454
00:30:26,866 --> 00:30:30,203
I'm getting so full from your praise
that I won't be able to eat lunch.

455
00:30:30,286 --> 00:30:33,414
But I'll save your beef-like words

456
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:35,500
forever in my stomach.

457
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:41,047
You're so funny.

458
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:44,592
That's right. I should take you all out
for some beef sometime.

459
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:46,511
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

460
00:30:47,387 --> 00:30:50,181
Your words aren't like just any beef,
they're like ribeye.

461
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:51,391
Give it a rest.

462
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:55,311
I hope you like it.

463
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:04,070
Do you v-chat with the athletes?

464
00:31:04,153 --> 00:31:05,280
V-chat?

465
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,824
Do you want me to create a chat room?

466
00:31:07,907 --> 00:31:09,367
Video chat.

467
00:31:10,076 --> 00:31:13,621
Of course. Video chat. Yes, of course.

468
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,374
Junghwan v-chatted me.

469
00:31:16,457 --> 00:31:18,751
It was my first time.

470
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:22,213
He did? Why?

471
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:23,715
Hi, Junghwan.

472
00:31:24,757 --> 00:31:27,719
I'm v-chatting you
to tell you something face-to-face.

473
00:31:27,802 --> 00:31:29,971
I didn't think it was something to say
over the phone.

474
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:33,975
Either get a new coach or fire me.

475
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:35,894
Please choose.

476
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:40,231
What?

477
00:31:40,815 --> 00:31:42,400
"Come to tournaments. Come to training."

478
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:44,944
I heard you nagged him,
knowing he was busy.

479
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:46,404
I did?

480
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:49,198
Why would he say that?

481
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:50,867
Who is Junghwan?

482
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:56,456
Would this badminton team
have any value whatsoever without him?

483
00:31:56,539 --> 00:32:01,085
Who's promoting this unpopular sport
that no one cares to even watch?

484
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:06,507
I don't act like the company president.
I even answered his v-chat.

485
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:09,761
So don't you act like a coach, okay?

486
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:16,351
Hey.

487
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:20,480
Junghwan. Hi there.

488
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:22,440
Hi, Junghwan.

489
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:32,325
Hey, Junghwan.

490
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:36,204
Let's be men and speak frankly.

491
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:40,124
Let's talk it out.

492
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:43,252
My mission is to win an Olympic medal.

493
00:32:43,836 --> 00:32:46,089
I can't be on a team
that doesn't care about my condition.

494
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:48,758
It's hard to have a body
that belongs to the nation.

495
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,135
I can't do with it as I want.

496
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:54,931
How far must we accommodate you?

497
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:58,267
I'll only compete
in tournaments that I choose.

498
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:01,312
I'll also train when I want,
which will be never.

499
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:03,106
Even if I do, I'll choose what I do

500
00:33:03,189 --> 00:33:04,983
and with whom I practice.

501
00:33:05,066 --> 00:33:06,401
I won't receive any training.

502
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:08,069
-What?
-And…

503
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:11,572
I can't remember the rest.

504
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:12,907
Can I just text you?

505
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:14,367
Text?

506
00:33:16,577 --> 00:33:18,788
That's more convenient for me too.

507
00:33:20,248 --> 00:33:23,584
It's awkward and embarrassing
to meet in person.

508
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,426
So how dare you mess with me?
You're just a lowly coach.

509
00:33:55,783 --> 00:33:57,118
Why are you here?

510
00:33:57,994 --> 00:34:00,163
-Long time no see, Junghwan.
-Whatever.

511
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:02,331
Why are you on my team?

512
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,335
They were the only ones
willing to take me.

513
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:07,670
Willing to take you?

514
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:09,464
I hope we get along.

515
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:22,018
I'll only play badminton, nothing else.
So cut me some slack.

516
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:24,520
If you have a conscience,
you shouldn't have come back.

517
00:34:24,604 --> 00:34:27,065
I never had a conscience. You know that.

518
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:31,527
People think it was bribery, don't they?

519
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:34,405
That was the ridiculous rumor
that spread about you.

520
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:37,116
It's been hard enough for me too.

521
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,827
Did you forget whose life you ruined?

522
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:42,330
You'll get off easily
with a bribery scandal?

523
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:47,168
I'll tell everyone the truth.

524
00:34:47,543 --> 00:34:49,587
One text in the team's chat room will do.

525
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:55,760
"The reason Park Taeyang quit
three years ago."

526
00:35:06,729 --> 00:35:08,272
Look at my reflexes.

527
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:16,989
What was that?

528
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:19,492
I don't care if you tell everyone,

529
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:21,828
but ask Junyoung first.

530
00:35:21,994 --> 00:35:24,038
Because she wanted it
to remain a secret forever.

531
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:25,623
That lame excuse again?

532
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:27,792
Are you actually worrying about her?

533
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:31,254
I told myself to avoid you

534
00:35:33,172 --> 00:35:34,590
and to lower my head to you

535
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:37,009
if I ran into you.

536
00:35:38,761 --> 00:35:41,639
But no. I've changed my mind.

537
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:43,975
I'll shove you aside instead.

538
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:47,019
Because that's who I am.

539
00:35:57,697 --> 00:36:02,326
Taejun. My poor Taejun.

540
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:07,707
Granny Kkotbun's grandson.
What's your problem?

541
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:14,130
Hey!

542
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:16,757
You know what's so great about me?

543
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:19,343
I used all of my connections

544
00:36:20,094 --> 00:36:23,723
and got a list of everyone
hiring instructors.

545
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:26,601
I even went to an internet cafe
and printed it out.

546
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:32,273
Move it.

547
00:36:36,986 --> 00:36:39,155
Which is the closest to home?

548
00:36:39,238 --> 00:36:41,616
Are you looking for a grade school?
Why must it be close?

549
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:44,827
I'm seriously worried about you.

550
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:48,164
Hey. I didn't want to say this,

551
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:50,041
but a lot of teams want me.

552
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:52,668
Even Yunis called yesterday.

553
00:36:58,549 --> 00:36:59,759
That annoying Yunis?

554
00:36:59,842 --> 00:37:01,802
Yes, that annoying Yunis.

555
00:37:03,137 --> 00:37:05,598
They wanted to meet. Why? To scout me.

556
00:37:09,518 --> 00:37:11,062
-You're tempted, right?
-No way.

557
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:13,940
You were tempted. You are tempted.

558
00:37:14,523 --> 00:37:15,942
You're bragging right now.

559
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:20,154
Hey. It's a company team,
which means awesome pay and benefits.

560
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:22,740
If you play for Yunis,
your rate will shoot up for lessons.

561
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:24,033
Shut up.

562
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:27,662
Not unless they pay me
like 60 million won.

563
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:29,705
Jeez…

564
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:32,625
What, 60 mints?

565
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:35,002
Why you… You jerk.

566
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:36,545
You're…

567
00:37:37,964 --> 00:37:38,798
Don't throw up.

568
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:40,883
You…

569
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:42,093
Throw up, and you die.

570
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:46,847
Go to the bathroom.

571
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:53,354
He keeps throwing up after drinking.

572
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,606
Give me something that'll kill him.

573
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:56,816
Pardon?

574
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:58,442
Please.

575
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,464
Concentrate!

576
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:22,216
Hey.

577
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:25,261
The instructor interview?

578
00:38:25,845 --> 00:38:26,721
Yes.

579
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:29,598
Is it time already?

580
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:30,558
Let's take a break.

581
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:41,485
Stop staring. She's my daughter.

582
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:43,321
Your daughter?

583
00:38:45,531 --> 00:38:48,034
Did you live in Chuncheon by any chance?

584
00:38:48,868 --> 00:38:50,703
You were a coach
at a grade school there, right?

585
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:55,624
I went all over the place.

586
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:58,961
Anyway, do you want to play against her?

587
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:01,213
-What?
-I need to see your skills.

588
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:04,717
Come on. You want me to try out?
I was on a company team.

589
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:07,303
I'll show you a video of a match.

590
00:39:07,386 --> 00:39:10,556
-Let's go.
-But… I'm good.

591
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:19,440
Okay. Whoever scores first wins.

592
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:22,401
I don't know why I have to do this.

593
00:39:23,819 --> 00:39:26,447
Don't go easy on me because I'm a girl.
Play for real.

594
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:29,450
I wouldn't go easy on you.
My livelihood is at stake.

595
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:31,202
Serve.

596
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:37,041
You serve.

597
00:39:37,124 --> 00:39:39,418
It's better to be served than to serve.

598
00:39:41,462 --> 00:39:43,047
I'm not into serving others.

599
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:46,384
Badminton isn't a game of words.

600
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:48,260
Serve nicely.

601
00:39:48,761 --> 00:39:50,638
I can get nasty too.

602
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:17,331
I served nicely.

603
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:19,166
You lost on purpose.

604
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:20,167
No.

605
00:40:21,293 --> 00:40:22,128
Congrats.

606
00:40:36,016 --> 00:40:37,059
Hey.

607
00:40:39,186 --> 00:40:40,688
Why did you let me win?

608
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:42,690
Your livelihood was at stake.

609
00:40:46,402 --> 00:40:48,904
I'll buy lunch
since you were protecting my livelihood.

610
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:51,365
Sure. Next time--

611
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:53,367
No. Right now.

612
00:41:07,339 --> 00:41:11,218
Hey. Wouldn't it have been better
to order another one after finishing one?

613
00:41:11,927 --> 00:41:13,220
Must you order them together?

614
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:15,598
I didn't think of that.

615
00:41:15,681 --> 00:41:17,850
I don't think much.
I use my body, not my brain.

616
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:19,977
Same here. Nice to meet you.

617
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:21,854
Nice to meet you.

618
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:27,067
I'll buy beer too.

619
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:30,946
-I've already bought a lot of drinks.
-What?

620
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:33,199
I had to pay last time after you bailed.

621
00:41:33,407 --> 00:41:35,117
I hope you remember that.

622
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:36,494
That's what happened?

623
00:41:36,577 --> 00:41:39,455
Sorry. How much was it?
I'll send you the money.

624
00:41:40,122 --> 00:41:42,958
Forget it. You gave me your racket.

625
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:44,668
You're making me look bad.

626
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:46,378
So why did you do that?

627
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:49,131
Anyway, forget it.

628
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:52,259
You're my savior too.

629
00:41:55,429 --> 00:41:58,349
I didn't help you and your livelihood
for no reason.

630
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:04,021
I know who you are, Taejun.

631
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:08,234
Do you still live in Chuncheon?

632
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:14,031
I knew when I first saw you.
I just pretended not to.

633
00:42:14,281 --> 00:42:15,407
Things are…

634
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:18,118
kind of complicated for me.

635
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:21,997
It was humiliating too.

636
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:25,376
I stole your bike, remember?

637
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:12,256
Hey, bike thief!

638
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:28,814
I'll let you go
if you score even one point.

639
00:43:29,982 --> 00:43:32,234
If I win,
I'm taking you to the dean's office.

640
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:34,945
You'd better keep your word.

641
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:35,506
It went past the line, so it's out.

642
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:38,258
-Says who?
-That's the rule.

643
00:44:40,052 --> 00:44:42,179
Anyway, is it really your first time?

644
00:44:42,262 --> 00:44:45,307
If you send Taejun here,

645
00:44:45,391 --> 00:44:47,142
I'll train him well.

646
00:44:47,267 --> 00:44:48,894
Thank you for taking him in.

647
00:44:49,144 --> 00:44:50,813
We'll think about it.

648
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:53,440
She's gifted!

649
00:44:53,899 --> 00:44:55,859
I mean it! She's a genius!

650
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:04,660
Wasn't that coach from back then your dad?

651
00:45:06,245 --> 00:45:09,748
Yes, the coach was like a dad to me
back then.

652
00:45:10,332 --> 00:45:12,418
He came to my class the next day.

653
00:45:13,168 --> 00:45:16,130
He said he'd feed me three meals a day
if I joined the badminton team,

654
00:45:16,422 --> 00:45:18,674
so I started playing to get free food.

655
00:45:19,466 --> 00:45:23,011
I lived with my grandma until then.

656
00:45:27,349 --> 00:45:28,767
Were you adopted?

657
00:45:30,144 --> 00:45:33,355
Yes. Mom and Dad had no kids.

658
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:36,483
Our last names were both Park too.

659
00:45:37,693 --> 00:45:40,696
I won a spot in their family
because I played badminton well.

660
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:45,075
What? Then I really am your savior.

661
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:47,077
How will you ever repay me?

662
00:45:47,286 --> 00:45:48,454
I don't know.

663
00:45:49,955 --> 00:45:51,707
Everyone cries when they hear my story.

664
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:53,250
Is that all you have to say?

665
00:45:53,333 --> 00:45:54,209
Whatever.

666
00:45:54,793 --> 00:45:57,045
Give me your number.
And text me your account number.

667
00:45:57,755 --> 00:45:59,298
I really can't take your money.

668
00:45:59,381 --> 00:46:02,301
Forget it. I was much more successful
than you after that.

669
00:46:02,384 --> 00:46:03,844
Give me your digits.

670
00:46:04,553 --> 00:46:05,763
Don't get so close.

671
00:46:06,638 --> 00:46:10,476
I've been practicing all day long
and couldn't shower, so I stink.

672
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:17,733
There's no need to go that far.

673
00:46:22,738 --> 00:46:23,697
Here's my number.

674
00:46:32,539 --> 00:46:33,582
Darn it.

675
00:46:36,668 --> 00:46:40,088
How are you an athlete if you hate
the smell of sweat that much?

676
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:42,883
Hey, rude punk! Come here and take it!

677
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:45,344
-You come here!
-What?

678
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:47,846
I'll throw it.

679
00:46:49,556 --> 00:46:50,808
I'll really throw it.

680
00:46:55,187 --> 00:46:56,522
Is it fully paid off?

681
00:46:57,606 --> 00:46:58,482
Dang it.

682
00:47:02,611 --> 00:47:05,072
Here. I have to get back to the dorm.

683
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:07,449
Hold on. Wait just ten seconds.

684
00:47:07,533 --> 00:47:09,201
For what? I'm busy.

685
00:47:13,247 --> 00:47:14,289
What are you doing?

686
00:47:14,748 --> 00:47:16,416
Just 0.3 seconds.

687
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:19,253
It's how long national team members take
to react to light and sound.

688
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:21,421
You were never on the team.

689
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:24,341
You know so much about me.
You must've been interested.

690
00:47:25,634 --> 00:47:28,470
Anyway. My reflexes are as good
as a national team member.

691
00:47:29,096 --> 00:47:30,097
Test me.

692
00:47:43,443 --> 00:47:44,778
Stop that!

693
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:45,821
So that you can wash up.

694
00:47:46,613 --> 00:47:47,489
Wait a little longer.

695
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:03,714
That's cold!

696
00:48:03,922 --> 00:48:06,466
What's wrong with you? You're so immature!

697
00:48:06,758 --> 00:48:08,385
What? It's nice and refreshing.

698
00:48:09,803 --> 00:48:11,054
Where are you going?

699
00:48:12,055 --> 00:48:13,098
You can't go.

700
00:48:14,516 --> 00:48:15,642
-Let go.
-No.

701
00:48:16,476 --> 00:48:18,312
Stop that.

702
00:48:20,022 --> 00:48:22,107
Hey. You need to wash up.

703
00:48:29,489 --> 00:48:31,491
People will think we're crazy.

704
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:32,576
No, they won't.

705
00:48:41,293 --> 00:48:44,212
You've only played badminton
all your life, right? Like a machine.

706
00:48:45,923 --> 00:48:47,466
I'm sure you had no choice.

707
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:51,511
I want you to have fun today.

708
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:01,563
You're dead.

709
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:18,121
Are you cold?

710
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:20,207
It's nice and cool.

711
00:49:23,502 --> 00:49:24,586
I'll push it.

712
00:49:25,837 --> 00:49:27,381
What? What is it?

713
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:30,175
This is too awkward.

714
00:49:31,301 --> 00:49:34,638
I'm not dragging a tire or anything.
I don't need your help.

715
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:39,351
Okay. If it's awkward for you,

716
00:49:39,851 --> 00:49:40,894
we can split here.

717
00:49:41,561 --> 00:49:42,646
Later.

718
00:49:43,271 --> 00:49:45,524
What? Okay.

719
00:49:46,358 --> 00:49:50,612
You look really cold. Your lips are blue.

720
00:49:51,196 --> 00:49:53,115
Yes, well…

721
00:49:54,616 --> 00:49:56,827
Let's meet up now and then.

722
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:00,789
It's cold.

723
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:03,125
It's crazy cold!

724
00:50:06,712 --> 00:50:07,963
Hey, Taejun!

725
00:50:11,174 --> 00:50:12,843
Are you really retiring?

726
00:50:16,138 --> 00:50:17,139
Yes.

727
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:20,350
Don't be so sure.

728
00:50:20,767 --> 00:50:23,562
It's not as easy as it sounds
for someone who has lived on the court

729
00:50:23,645 --> 00:50:25,272
to leave that court.

730
00:50:28,358 --> 00:50:29,317
Also,

731
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:32,863
I've rooted for you since I was 12 too.

732
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:36,199
Later.

733
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:02,142
It's so cold.

734
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:27,834
Hello?

735
00:51:29,586 --> 00:51:33,256
So… Did I pass the interview?

736
00:51:34,049 --> 00:51:37,177
No. I don't think it's time yet
for you to come to me.

737
00:51:38,762 --> 00:51:40,347
Play competitively for five more years.

738
00:52:10,627 --> 00:52:14,131
Junghwan. Why do you keep coming?
I said you didn't have to come anymore.

739
00:52:14,673 --> 00:52:15,924
Do you like me that much?

740
00:52:16,007 --> 00:52:19,010
Mother. Don't be like that.

741
00:52:19,594 --> 00:52:22,973
-Hey.
-I have a mental block and can't compete.

742
00:52:23,181 --> 00:52:25,183
You know it's easy to reinjure
the same spot again.

743
00:52:25,267 --> 00:52:28,186
Then say you need rehab
until your injury is fully healed

744
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:30,522
and ask to sit out some tournaments.

745
00:52:30,897 --> 00:52:33,441
You should see a therapist
during that time.

746
00:52:34,025 --> 00:52:35,360
I'm not stupid.

747
00:52:35,944 --> 00:52:38,238
Too many people want to get rid of me.

748
00:52:39,072 --> 00:52:41,992
They'll all think my weakness
is an opportunity for them.

749
00:52:42,784 --> 00:52:44,619
It's so cutthroat.

750
00:52:44,828 --> 00:52:45,829
Bye.

751
00:52:51,334 --> 00:52:53,920
That's because you're a rude bastard.

752
00:52:56,381 --> 00:52:58,091
Why are you back, Yumin?

753
00:52:58,175 --> 00:53:00,468
It's awesome skipping training
to come here instead.

754
00:53:00,552 --> 00:53:03,847
You jerks. Do you think
our hospital is a spa?

755
00:53:04,431 --> 00:53:05,307
Yes.

756
00:53:06,433 --> 00:53:07,475
"Yes"?

757
00:53:09,561 --> 00:53:11,396
I'll get right to it.

758
00:53:11,479 --> 00:53:13,690
Yuk Junghwan must be traumatized
by some injury.

759
00:53:13,773 --> 00:53:15,775
That's why he's asking
to skip tournaments--

760
00:53:15,859 --> 00:53:17,861
I'm Yuk Junghwan. Who are you?

761
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:19,946
Yuk Junghwan?

762
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:24,409
Why are you with my daughter?

763
00:53:25,827 --> 00:53:26,870
Coach?

764
00:53:28,663 --> 00:53:29,706
She's your daughter?

765
00:53:31,917 --> 00:53:33,919
Why is she pretty if she's your daughter?

766
00:53:35,503 --> 00:53:37,589
She's pretty because she's my daughter…

767
00:53:37,672 --> 00:53:40,091
Why do you think my daughter's pretty?
Why?

768
00:53:40,175 --> 00:53:43,011
Hey! Why do you think she's pretty?
Why are you together?

769
00:53:43,094 --> 00:53:45,180
Why are you together? What's going on?

770
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:50,060
What's your deal?

771
00:53:53,605 --> 00:53:54,689
Can't you tell?

772
00:53:55,774 --> 00:53:57,192
I'm my dad's daughter!

773
00:54:03,531 --> 00:54:04,574
What the heck?

774
00:54:05,158 --> 00:54:06,910
What's Junghwan's deal?

775
00:54:07,744 --> 00:54:08,745
What did Junghwan do now?

776
00:54:08,828 --> 00:54:12,457
Why are they together? Why did they meet?

777
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:14,334
-Why is he with her?
-Why--

778
00:54:14,417 --> 00:54:15,794
-Where are they?
-Where--

779
00:54:15,877 --> 00:54:18,672
No, no, no. That's not it!
It's nothing like that.

780
00:54:18,755 --> 00:54:20,674
-Hold on. Give me my cell phone.
-Okay.

781
00:54:20,757 --> 00:54:23,218
-But… Your phone…
-Give it to me!

782
00:54:23,301 --> 00:54:25,303
-I don't have it. Here it is.
-Here…

783
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:30,392
You're here.

784
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:34,729
You're very punctual.

785
00:54:35,647 --> 00:54:36,982
Sorry I'm late.

786
00:54:38,441 --> 00:54:39,985
I see. You're late.

787
00:54:48,827 --> 00:54:53,665
So… I've been watching your matches.

788
00:54:54,624 --> 00:54:58,169
It's a waste. You can do well.

789
00:54:58,461 --> 00:54:59,379
Right?

790
00:54:59,963 --> 00:55:01,923
I'm definitely talented.

791
00:55:02,507 --> 00:55:04,718
Look how I've made a living
without trying hard.

792
00:55:06,553 --> 00:55:08,138
What a tiring day.

793
00:55:08,805 --> 00:55:10,849
So, let's get to the point.

794
00:55:12,392 --> 00:55:15,395
Our team has decided to accept you.

795
00:55:16,354 --> 00:55:18,148
Come play with us.

796
00:55:20,567 --> 00:55:21,693
I say 99%.

797
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:24,404
And 1%.

798
00:55:25,071 --> 00:55:26,489
Do you mind speaking up?

799
00:55:27,032 --> 00:55:28,616
To be honest,

800
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:30,493
99% of me doesn't want to do sports

801
00:55:31,453 --> 00:55:32,287
anymore.

802
00:55:33,663 --> 00:55:36,333
But the 1% won't let go
and is holding me back.

803
00:55:36,875 --> 00:55:40,003
I think it's become a habit
to have sports latch onto me.

804
00:55:40,086 --> 00:55:41,421
What about it?

805
00:55:42,255 --> 00:55:44,674
Can't you simply say yes or no?

806
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:48,303
You said you'd think about it.

807
00:55:48,970 --> 00:55:50,764
You must've thought about it
before you came.

808
00:55:51,806 --> 00:55:53,099
The sport is no fun.

809
00:55:55,894 --> 00:55:57,896
It's not like I excel at it.

810
00:55:57,979 --> 00:56:00,190
Sports are fun
only for people who excel at them.

811
00:56:00,273 --> 00:56:02,025
He's a nutjob too.

812
00:56:03,026 --> 00:56:06,321
Hey, punk! An athlete
doesn't do sports for fun!

813
00:56:06,821 --> 00:56:09,991
Who am I? I'm Lee Taesang,
an Olympic gold medalist.

814
00:56:10,075 --> 00:56:12,410
But it has never once been fun for me.

815
00:56:12,494 --> 00:56:14,871
Every day was like torture.

816
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:18,041
But I overcame it and beat it!

817
00:56:18,124 --> 00:56:20,085
Then even more so… No.

818
00:56:20,585 --> 00:56:21,711
That's meaningless.

819
00:56:21,795 --> 00:56:24,297
Like heck. Don't give me that crap.

820
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:28,676
Are you scared?

821
00:56:29,761 --> 00:56:32,138
You don't want to be among the 99%,
but you don't think

822
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:33,681
you'll make the top 1%.

823
00:56:33,765 --> 00:56:35,975
Does that scare you?

824
00:56:36,726 --> 00:56:39,479
Is that why you're acting cool
and giving up?

825
00:56:41,564 --> 00:56:43,608
I don't get scared.

826
00:56:46,152 --> 00:56:47,404
You don't know me.

827
00:56:47,487 --> 00:56:49,239
-You'll get 60 million.
-Pardon?

828
00:56:49,447 --> 00:56:51,783
A salary of 60 million won
plus a performance-based bonus.

829
00:56:52,367 --> 00:56:54,702
The reason you have to do sports
regardless of meaning.

830
00:56:55,286 --> 00:56:58,039
What do you say? Is it fun now?

831
00:57:07,257 --> 00:57:10,009
Doesn't anyone want this money?

832
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:11,678
Next is Yuri.

833
00:57:11,761 --> 00:57:14,514
Let's see how well you aim
and if you practiced.

834
00:57:14,597 --> 00:57:15,682
Here!

835
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:19,102
It's too far.
Are we trying to set a world record?

836
00:57:20,186 --> 00:57:23,314
Hey. That was his bad. Don't you agree?

837
00:57:24,941 --> 00:57:28,486
Shoot. Hold on. I crossed the line--

838
00:57:28,611 --> 00:57:30,738
-Dang it.
-Oh. Youngsim.

839
00:57:31,239 --> 00:57:33,199
I'm counting on our ace.

840
00:57:33,783 --> 00:57:34,784
Toss it.

841
00:57:34,868 --> 00:57:37,078
Here it goes, Youngsim. You can do it.

842
00:57:37,412 --> 00:57:38,621
Here!

843
00:57:42,542 --> 00:57:44,419
So close.

844
00:57:44,502 --> 00:57:46,171
-That was good.
-How was that good?

845
00:57:46,254 --> 00:57:47,922
I want to try it too.

846
00:57:58,016 --> 00:57:59,017
Let's go.

847
00:57:59,517 --> 00:58:01,519
Let's call it a day.

848
00:58:02,896 --> 00:58:03,730
Let's go.

849
00:58:28,296 --> 00:58:29,839
I thought she'd be here.

850
00:58:40,934 --> 00:58:42,644
Are you really retiring?

851
00:58:44,604 --> 00:58:46,314
Don't be so sure.

852
00:58:46,814 --> 00:58:49,609
It's not as easy as it sounds
for someone who has lived on the court

853
00:58:49,692 --> 00:58:51,486
to leave that court.

854
00:59:20,306 --> 00:59:21,599
It's okay.

855
00:59:21,683 --> 00:59:23,643
-I'll take it.
-It's really okay.

856
00:59:23,726 --> 00:59:25,395
It's fine.

857
00:59:25,478 --> 00:59:27,480
We live together.

858
00:59:28,147 --> 00:59:29,691
I'll wash yours with mine.

859
00:59:29,774 --> 00:59:32,527
Still, it's my job
to wash the older girls' laundry.

860
00:59:33,861 --> 00:59:34,862
But…

861
00:59:36,114 --> 00:59:37,949
This is laundry too.

862
00:59:38,283 --> 00:59:39,492
Give it to me.

863
00:59:39,701 --> 00:59:41,244
I really shouldn't.

864
00:59:41,327 --> 00:59:42,203
Thanks.

865
00:59:48,001 --> 00:59:51,087
Why is she thanking me?
She's making me feel bad.

866
01:00:07,103 --> 01:00:08,271
I sent the money.

867
01:00:10,523 --> 01:00:12,108
He's so precise.

868
01:00:14,152 --> 01:00:17,071
Are sports fun for you?

869
01:00:24,787 --> 01:00:26,914
Why did you come back?

870
01:01:00,239 --> 01:01:01,199
Goodness.

871
01:01:18,007 --> 01:01:18,841
Trying to be cute?

872
01:01:20,301 --> 01:01:21,636
Who said to touch my clothes?

873
01:01:25,932 --> 01:01:27,433
Who said to do my laundry?

874
01:01:29,435 --> 01:01:30,937
-Youngsim.
-Listen.

875
01:01:31,938 --> 01:01:35,483
Don't even mess
with the air that I breathe. Got that?

876
01:01:38,069 --> 01:01:40,655
You used to like me.

877
01:01:49,038 --> 01:01:50,039
Shoot.

878
01:01:52,458 --> 01:01:54,585
Was that why you ran away
without saying a word to me?

879
01:02:19,026 --> 01:02:19,861
Hey.

880
01:02:20,945 --> 01:02:21,988
Do you know why…

881
01:02:22,905 --> 01:02:25,908
I'm still here even after I retired
from the national team?

882
01:02:26,993 --> 01:02:30,371
Because money and connections
are useless on the court.

883
01:02:30,455 --> 01:02:34,083
And it doesn't matter
whether you're rich or poor.

884
01:02:34,167 --> 01:02:38,004
It's because you can fight
fair and square with just your body.

885
01:02:39,881 --> 01:02:42,800
Although the world is disgustingly unfair,

886
01:02:44,635 --> 01:02:48,222
it's fair and honest here.
It's because I believe that.

887
01:02:49,724 --> 01:02:51,684
You, dirtbag,

888
01:02:53,019 --> 01:02:54,729
tainted this place by coming here.

889
01:02:58,191 --> 01:02:59,233
Got that?

890
01:03:03,863 --> 01:03:04,864
Yes.

891
01:03:06,115 --> 01:03:07,450
I admit it.

892
01:03:07,909 --> 01:03:10,620
Good. You do, right?

893
01:03:11,954 --> 01:03:13,956
That's why I can't accept you.

894
01:03:19,086 --> 01:03:20,129
Okay.

895
01:03:21,422 --> 01:03:22,632
I understand.

896
01:03:59,794 --> 01:04:01,420
Answer me, will you?

897
01:04:02,004 --> 01:04:03,965
I wonder why you came back.

898
01:04:12,265 --> 01:04:13,307
I…

899
01:04:14,767 --> 01:04:16,561
I don't know either.

900
01:04:34,579 --> 01:04:36,372
Why did I come back?

901
01:04:44,422 --> 01:04:45,673
Do it, Youngsim.

902
01:05:00,688 --> 01:05:04,317
How could I, after what I did to Junyoung?

903
01:05:06,068 --> 01:05:07,695
Take this and get lost.

904
01:05:08,195 --> 01:05:11,324
If you have a conscience at all,
you should quit badminton too.

905
01:05:19,540 --> 01:05:22,293
Junyoung. It's me. Junyoung!

906
01:05:25,796 --> 01:05:27,757
Why did I come back here

907
01:05:29,050 --> 01:05:30,551
where no one is glad to see me?

908
01:05:58,079 --> 01:06:02,667
PARK TAEYANG

909
01:06:07,421 --> 01:06:08,798
Why did I come back?

910
01:06:09,423 --> 01:06:11,425
Because I didn't get to end it right.

911
01:06:14,136 --> 01:06:15,638
Because although I was away,

912
01:06:17,932 --> 01:06:19,809
I wasn't happy.

913
01:06:21,769 --> 01:06:23,854
Because I was never at peace
for a single day,

914
01:06:24,438 --> 01:06:28,317
like I was procrastinating
and not doing what I had to.

915
01:06:31,278 --> 01:06:32,154
Because…

916
01:06:35,366 --> 01:06:38,869
I'm a badminton player.

917
01:06:48,587 --> 01:06:50,006
I didn't feel that way.

918
01:07:08,065 --> 01:07:09,525
What are you doing here?

919
01:07:10,401 --> 01:07:11,652
I'm going to play here.

920
01:07:12,570 --> 01:07:14,530
You said you were quitting.

921
01:07:15,364 --> 01:07:16,699
They offered a lot of money.

922
01:07:17,867 --> 01:07:21,537
And I think it may be fun
if it's with you.

923
01:07:25,374 --> 01:07:26,500
Nice to meet you.

924
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:26,560
GOING TO YOU AT A SPEED OF 493KM

925
01:08:26,644 --> 01:08:29,313
We'll see each other later
since we're on the same team.

926
01:08:29,396 --> 01:08:30,689
Yunis is the best! We rock!

927
01:08:31,190 --> 01:08:33,776
Park Taeyang, Park Taejun…
Your names are alike. Like twins.

928
01:08:35,027 --> 01:08:35,903
The rules are tough.

929
01:08:35,986 --> 01:08:39,406
No dating teammates.
If caught, one will be kicked out.

930
01:08:39,490 --> 01:08:41,492
Taejun. I want to have you easily.

931
01:08:41,575 --> 01:08:43,077
How many times did she write my name?

932
01:08:43,202 --> 01:08:45,955
You'll have to find
your own doubles partner.

933
01:08:46,038 --> 01:08:48,999
Does anyone here
want to play with Taeyang?

934
01:08:49,083 --> 01:08:50,376
Let's be partners.

935
01:08:52,419 --> 01:08:53,587
You're a hot potato.

936
01:09:04,098 --> 01:09:05,266
GOING TO YOU AT A SPEED OF 493KM

937
01:09:05,349 --> 01:09:07,351
