1
00:00:37,787 --> 00:00:40,790
GOING TO YOU AT A SPEED OF 493KM

2
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,586
THE PLACES, PEOPLE, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTIONAL

3
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:53,762
Junyoung.

4
00:00:57,682 --> 00:01:00,101
I've missed you a lot.

5
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:08,151
When did you come to Korea?

6
00:01:09,652 --> 00:01:10,862
This morning.

7
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:18,495
I had to meet someone,
so I came here without even eating.

8
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:21,372
But I ran into you first.

9
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:24,584
So you came today.

10
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:34,552
Are you okay?

11
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,262
In what way?

12
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:43,103
Let's not exchange pleasantries.

13
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:46,022
It's ridiculous.

14
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:48,316
Junyoung.

15
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:53,238
I've been waiting for you.

16
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:00,411
Junyoung.

17
00:02:00,703 --> 00:02:01,788
Don't touch me.

18
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:11,297
Let's make this clear.

19
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:16,594
Let's not run into each other again.

20
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,933
Still, Junyoung…

21
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:26,479
Still, let's meet.

22
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:30,984
I know you hate me,
but let's see each other!

23
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,008
EPISODE 9

24
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:57,802
Taejun, did you see Junyoung?

25
00:02:58,803 --> 00:03:01,556
I woke up this morning, and your sister

26
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:04,309
was sleeping in the living room.

27
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:08,396
My heart leaped out of my chest
and back in again!

28
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:11,774
Give me 2,000 won's worth of bean sprouts.

29
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:12,901
Okay, 2,000 won.

30
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:15,195
We didn't call you
in case you were in a match.

31
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:18,114
Anyway, you have to come home tonight.
Let's have dinner together.

32
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:21,576
Your mom is on cloud nine.

33
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:25,496
-Please hurry.
-Okay, I'll be there.

34
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:40,011
Coffee…

35
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:42,222
Strawberry milk…

36
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:51,189
Why do you look like that
after winning your match?

37
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:55,068
Was it a given that you'd win? Is that it?

38
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:57,028
You arrogant punk.

39
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:01,366
"What's wrong with her?
Does she plan to eat all of that?"

40
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:02,742
That's the face I made.

41
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:08,373
You look like you plan to eat and die.

42
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:15,171
What is it? Is something wrong?

43
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:18,549
Why would anything be wrong? I'm happy.

44
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:23,096
This looks good too.

45
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:25,765
How is nothing wrong?
Something huge happened.

46
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:27,475
What?

47
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:30,979
How is it that I like you
more and more every day?

48
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:33,398
This is serious.

49
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:36,526
There was no heart in that statement.

50
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:39,779
I've been too good to her.

51
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,824
Must I open my wallet
for you to see that I'm sincere?

52
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:47,328
It's on me.

53
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,164
Get everything here.

54
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:54,335
Is there enough heart in it now?

55
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:59,882
I'll open my wallet. You open your heart.

56
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:06,681
I'm here if you ever need to talk.

57
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:14,063
Stop smiling.

58
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:17,817
I'll wait outside.

59
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:19,527
Okay.

60
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:46,721
What great weather.

61
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,059
Don't avoid it.

62
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,064
Don't be a coward.

63
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:05,907
I hope there will be younger players
better than me.

64
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:12,872
People said you were the best player
to come out in at least 50 years.

65
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:14,082
It won't be easy.

66
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:17,126
And don't say things you don't mean.

67
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,378
It's not like you.

68
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:20,505
I mean it.

69
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:24,675
If there's someone really amazing,
people will forget me.

70
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:30,098
That's why I want to train players.

71
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:33,351
I want to be a coach
for the national team.

72
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:35,978
-Shape up.
-Isn't that Junyoung?

73
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:38,147
-What? Junyoung!
-Junyoung!

74
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:40,108
-It's her, right?
-Junyoung!

75
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:44,237
-Hello.
-Hey.

76
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,240
-It's Junyoung, right?
-It is.

77
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:48,658
It is!

78
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:51,077
How long has it been? This is awesome.

79
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,871
You're trying to drop the honorifics
as always.

80
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:55,665
Come on, in front of the kids?

81
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,043
When did you come, ma'am?

82
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:01,129
Have you seen Junghwan yet?

83
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:16,352
Are you really going to go out with me?

84
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:18,521
You don't know me that well.

85
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,523
How could I?

86
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:22,900
My mom lived with my dad for 30 years,

87
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:25,319
and she still says
she has no idea what he's thinking.

88
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:29,657
Do you need to know each other to go out?

89
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:32,118
You go out to get to know each other.

90
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:39,834
That makes sense.

91
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:41,961
It's oddly persuasive.

92
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,880
Are you a robot?

93
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:48,593
Relax. You're making me uncomfortable too.

94
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:51,471
Anyway, it's very rational.

95
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:53,514
So give me some time.

96
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:55,433
I need time to get my feelings in order.

97
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:57,226
You need time?

98
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:00,563
Hey. Am I not good enough?

99
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:04,484
I'm skilled…

100
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:10,406
My skills are slightly imperfect.
That's my only flaw.

101
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:14,452
If not for that, I would've had it all.

102
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:17,121
God didn't give me everything,

103
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:19,207
because life is annoyingly fair.

104
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:22,835
That's why you're so pushy…

105
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:25,963
Anyway, it's awkward…

106
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:28,508
And you're scary…

107
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:30,343
You've got mad high standards.

108
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:32,929
Is your dream girl Kim Yuna?

109
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:34,388
Or Park Junyoung?

110
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,768
Seriously.

111
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:42,104
It went up my nose.

112
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:43,356
Forget it.

113
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:49,320
Junghwan. I'm canceling my order!

114
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:57,745
Hold on. Wait.

115
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,540
No exchanges or returns
because you change your mind.

116
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:03,793
Can't you think of it like this?

117
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:07,338
Your order was shipped,
but it'll take time to reach you.

118
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:10,049
Consider me an international shipment.

119
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,052
How can you joke right now?
How are you so clueless?

120
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:25,523
Hey. Why are you crying?

121
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:27,858
Because my pride is hurt!

122
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:31,028
Hey. Do you think I'm stupid?

123
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:33,823
I know it's because of your first love!

124
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:40,746
Bring her here.

125
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:42,832
I'll tell her

126
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:45,960
to give you another chance
because you're still desperate for her!

127
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:49,046
I can't bring her. She's not here.

128
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:53,301
Did she die?

129
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:57,972
That's why
you're so brooding and handsome.

130
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:01,976
No. She's not in Korea.

131
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:04,186
You're so annoying.

132
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,147
Let's stop talking about the past.

133
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:07,773
I've never considered

134
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:11,110
the possibility of going out
with someone else.

135
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:13,946
You came much sooner than I anticipated.

136
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:17,658
That's right.
That's why you missed your chance.

137
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:20,786
I left my bag in the bar.

138
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,038
Let's go in.

139
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:23,623
Get your own bag!

140
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:24,874
Excuse me.

141
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:27,501
I never let myself miss a chance.

142
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:30,713
What are you doing?

143
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:32,340
I have no clue.

144
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:35,760
Hey! Put me down, you freak!

145
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:39,430
Hey! Junghwan! Hey!

146
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,391
I'm home.

147
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:47,396
Why did you mess with my room?

148
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:56,197
Hey.

149
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:59,325
Is that how you greet your sister
whom you haven't seen in three years?

150
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:01,786
What's with her?

151
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:03,204
It's because we moved her things.

152
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:07,208
Seriously. Should we have left the room
unattended for three years?

153
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:08,751
Your room isn't a museum.

154
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:15,841
Let her throw a fit.

155
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:18,844
She's at it already.

156
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:22,306
What is it?

157
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:26,227
What did you do with my trophies
and medals?

158
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:27,853
I put them in a box.

159
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,647
Why'd you put them away?

160
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:31,941
I worked so hard to win them.

161
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:34,276
-Sorry.
-Don't do that again.

162
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:37,113
Hey. Bring them.

163
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:44,203
I… I wasn't thinking.

164
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:48,374
I thought it would be too painful for her
to see the trophies and stuff.

165
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:51,252
Junyoung's a tough girl.
She must've shaken it off.

166
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:52,670
She seems okay, right?

167
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:56,882
Don't be so timid.

168
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:58,676
It'll bother her more.

169
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,428
Storage room, right?

170
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:55,357
Sorry, but Junyoung isn't home.

171
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:59,653
She did come back to Korea,

172
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:01,363
but she went out.

173
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:05,826
I see.

174
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:10,748
When she comes home,
would you please tell her that I came by

175
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:12,708
and that my number's the same,

176
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:15,002
and to please call me?

177
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:16,253
Sure.

178
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:19,924
I wish I could invite you in for dinner,

179
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:23,844
but we've had such a hectic day.

180
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:25,930
It's fine. Thank you.

181
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:28,641
-I'll go now.
-Okay.

182
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:31,852
You don't have to come out.

183
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:32,937
Okay.

184
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:35,856
Wait.

185
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:41,695
Your name was Taeyang, right?

186
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:44,698
Yes.

187
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:52,331
Thank you.

188
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:58,045
Thank you for remembering Junyoung
and coming to see her.

189
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:01,257
Thank you.

190
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:06,512
No.

191
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:10,266
No. Please don't thank me.

192
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:14,395
Junyoung

193
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:19,358
may not be ready to see her colleagues
from badminton yet.

194
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:22,945
But if her friends keep contacting her

195
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:26,407
and treat her like nothing happened,

196
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:28,200
it may help.

197
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:32,705
Would you mind doing that?

198
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,543
Sure.

199
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:42,006
Gosh. Thank you so much.

200
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:46,760
Hold on. Use this for cab fare.

201
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:49,179
Come over for dinner sometime.

202
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:51,223
No, it's really okay.

203
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:53,392
No, no. Take it. Go.

204
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:54,935
See you again.

205
00:14:56,937 --> 00:14:58,188
You're so pretty.

206
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:00,691
Thanks.

207
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,340
I'm sorry.

208
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:28,260
I'm sorry.

209
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:32,264
I'm sorry.

210
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,774
CHUNCHEON HOTEL

211
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:44,610
Hey. Junghwan's not in. What's up?

212
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:47,071
Did you hear the rumor

213
00:15:47,154 --> 00:15:48,739
that Junyoung is back?

214
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:49,907
Junyoung?

215
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:53,535
Yes. I saw her at the arena earlier.

216
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:54,995
I wonder if Junghwan knows.

217
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:57,081
That's what you came to tell him?

218
00:15:57,748 --> 00:16:00,000
Why do you care whether or not he knows?

219
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:02,711
I don't care, but…

220
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:06,256
Hey, you know, don't you?

221
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:08,425
That they went out.

222
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:13,597
You play us in the finals tomorrow, right?

223
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:14,556
Yes.

224
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,725
Don't say a word to Junghwan
until after the finals.

225
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,062
Don't spread rumors either.

226
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:22,940
You'd be a real jerk if you did.

227
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:25,734
What are you doing by my room?

228
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:28,696
Hey. He wanted to talk to me
about something.

229
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:29,738
You should go.

230
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:34,076
Okay, then. See you at the match tomorrow.

231
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:35,577
Go.

232
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:50,551
Hey. Put that one in the corner.

233
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:51,802
It's a lame one.

234
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:57,057
The National Sports Festival
gold medal is lame.

235
00:16:57,641 --> 00:16:59,268
Are you dissing our country?

236
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:02,730
And yet you wore the flag on your chest
and acted like a daughter of Korea.

237
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,902
Don't open your eyes so wide.
It looks scary.

238
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:12,865
-Keep organizing.
-I am.

239
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:21,498
I'm going to be good now.

240
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:23,375
Sis.

241
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:26,378
Let's stop fighting.

242
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:30,549
What's wrong with you? Are you high?

243
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:33,635
Look at these trophies.

244
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,596
This is insane.

245
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:39,600
Good job.

246
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:44,313
I've never said that to you before.

247
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,483
Sorry about that.

248
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:51,737
Hey.

249
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,823
Do you really want to get along with me?

250
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,241
I have some conditions.

251
00:17:58,619 --> 00:17:59,536
What conditions?

252
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:03,582
One. Send me to grad school.

253
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:06,418
I used everything I had
to pay for my flight back.

254
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:07,503
I'm dirt broke.

255
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:08,796
Two.

256
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:12,549
I'll use your apartment
whenever I go to Seoul.

257
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:14,176
I'll send you to grad school.

258
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:17,513
But not my apartment. That's way too much.

259
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:18,931
That's up to me.

260
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:20,891
-Three.
-It's my home. It's not up to you.

261
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:23,393
Don't get close to Park Taeyang.

262
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:29,274
She must not know I'm your sister

263
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:31,360
if she's partnering with you.

264
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:33,529
Are you two close?

265
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:36,281
Sort of. We're partners after all.

266
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:38,909
Don't be her partner either.
Don't ask why.

267
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:49,169
You have too many conditions.

268
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:51,004
You want my home, my money…

269
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:54,174
Excessive demands kill negotiations.

270
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:58,595
Tell me about your trip.
Where was your favorite place?

271
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:05,561
You don't need to give me money
or your place,

272
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:08,772
but don't be friends with Taeyang.

WOMEN'S TEAM MATCH FINALS
YUNIS 1, SOMANG BANK 1

275
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:40,804
-Hey.
-Hi.

276
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:44,099
-Nice.
-All right.

277
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,602
-Nice work.
-Hey.

278
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,020
Good work.

279
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:49,980
-Nice!
-Yes!

280
00:19:50,063 --> 00:19:51,273
All right!

281
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:54,193
-Nice.
-Nice!

282
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:58,906
You're burning a hole in my face.

283
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:02,326
What? Do I look pretty
even when I cheer now?

284
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:05,621
You're getting bolder and bolder.

285
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:07,122
For today,

286
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:10,500
love Junghwan instead of me.

287
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:14,421
Tell yourself that Junghwan is Taeyang.

288
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:18,550
I'll share you with him just for today.

289
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:19,843
No thanks.

290
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:24,598
Junyoung's back.

291
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:29,770
I hope Junghwan doesn't find out
until after his match.

292
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:34,775
If he hears the rumor,
he'll be in bad shape.

293
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:37,152
So check on him.

294
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:40,489
See whether he can focus on the match
and play well,

295
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:43,242
and cover for him.

296
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:47,454
Are you okay?

297
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:52,167
It's okay! Let's catch up!

298
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,669
It's okay.

299
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:55,087
You can do it!

300
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:02,636
Jisoo, you feel okay, right?

301
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:04,513
-Sungsil, you too?
-Yes.

302
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:07,057
Good. Don't feel too pressured.

303
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,892
It's all on you. You can do it, right?

304
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:10,769
-We can do it.
-Good!

305
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:13,981
If you lose, it'll be over.
The next match won't even happen.

306
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:15,232
Got that?

307
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:17,567
Okay, let's do this! Go get them!

308
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:19,486
-Okay.
-Let's go.

309
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,947
-You can do it!
-We can do it.

310
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:33,667
Hey, Sungsil. You okay?

311
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:35,127
Yes.

312
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:37,254
Give me a chance, okay?

313
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:40,215
If you catch up with your match,
I'll finish it.

314
00:21:41,341 --> 00:21:42,968
You'll win for sure,

315
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:45,721
so I'll do whatever it takes to tie it
to let you play.

316
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:52,185
Yumin is underappreciated

317
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:54,438
because she's been unlucky,
but she's good.

318
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,275
Be on your toes.

319
00:21:58,775 --> 00:21:59,609
Okay.

320
00:22:11,204 --> 00:22:14,082
Must be awkward for you again.

321
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:16,585
Your team or your daughter?

322
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:19,588
I need to make money to marry her off.

323
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:22,466
Whatever. I need to survive first.

324
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:24,343
Hey. Let's cheer them on!

325
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:26,178
Let's go, Yunis!

326
00:22:26,261 --> 00:22:28,638
-Let's go, Yunis!
-Let's go, Yunis!

327
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:47,199
Why are you all standing here?

328
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:50,535
Well…

329
00:22:50,994 --> 00:22:54,039
I know you're disappointed,
but you did well.

330
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:58,418
It's okay! Coming in second isn't so bad.

331
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:01,838
Sungsil, you okay? You look pale.

332
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:06,259
I'm fine.

333
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:09,471
I'm really okay.

334
00:23:12,307 --> 00:23:15,143
You're burning up.

335
00:23:16,269 --> 00:23:18,230
I'm really okay.

336
00:23:18,313 --> 00:23:19,356
Hey.

337
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:22,567
Did you hide being sick
so you could play? Tell me.

338
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:25,695
I'm sorry.

339
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:30,575
How long were you sick?

340
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:34,287
It's not your singles match.
How selfish could you be?

341
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:36,748
Sungsil--

342
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:39,167
I'll take her to the hospital.

343
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:49,344
HANWOONG ELECTRONICS

344
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:53,348
Shoot. This is so much pressure.

345
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:55,892
Why do we have to play Yook Junghwan?

346
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:59,438
Hey. Don't worry.

347
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:02,232
I'll make him crack today.

348
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,193
He'll crack like an egg.

349
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:09,990
Junghwan's a has-been.

350
00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:12,325
He's hanging on because of his fame.

351
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:14,619
Let's crush him so he can't get up.

352
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:21,084
What a great attitude. Awesome confidence.

353
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:22,335
Please be quiet.

354
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:25,422
We need to get some intel.
Why did you follow me?

355
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:27,799
-I was curious.
-Oh, come on.

356
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:30,677
Anyway. Park Taejun? Park Taehoon?

357
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:32,679
He's not a concern, right?

358
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:35,098
-Who?
-Park Taehoon?

359
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:38,643
Oh! Park Taehoon, the tall guy.

360
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:41,646
He's a nobody. He looks easy.

361
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:45,942
Hey. Do something about your hair.

362
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:48,570
-Why?
-We'll crush Junghwan

363
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:51,031
and make the news today.

364
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:55,911
Hey!

365
00:24:56,953 --> 00:24:58,038
What the heck?

366
00:24:58,538 --> 00:25:00,499
-You!
-What?

367
00:25:03,126 --> 00:25:04,294
For today,

368
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,130
love Junghwan instead of me.

369
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:13,386
Do you think you can compare
to our Junghwan?

370
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:17,015
The heck? Did I just say "our Junghwan"?

371
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:20,769
Our Junghwan isn't playing
because he's famous!

372
00:25:20,977 --> 00:25:22,771
He's just famous!

373
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,775
What, were you eavesdropping?

374
00:25:28,401 --> 00:25:30,237
Are you Junghwan's minions or something?

375
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:33,448
That's right, we're his minions. So, what?

376
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:34,866
I am not.

377
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:38,286
One more thing!
Watch how you speak about Junghwan.

378
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:40,997
-He's our almighty--
-Almighty?

379
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:43,625
-Is this a religion?
-Yes!

380
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:45,502
I'm a Junghwanian.

381
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:48,797
I'm not.

382
00:25:50,131 --> 00:25:51,466
Hey. Let's just go.

383
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:52,801
Seriously.

384
00:25:55,762 --> 00:25:57,430
Get lost.

385
00:26:03,436 --> 00:26:05,146
Minions, right?

386
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:06,398
Yes!

387
00:26:08,358 --> 00:26:10,735
What do you mean, minions?

388
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:12,779
I did good, didn't I?

389
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:15,991
They looked afraid of me.

390
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:25,959
Did you hear the rumor

391
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:27,502
that Junyoung is back?

392
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:29,671
-Junyoung?
-Yes.

393
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:32,090
I saw her at the arena earlier.

394
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:33,883
I wonder if Junghwan knows.

395
00:26:45,812 --> 00:26:48,273
It's me. Did you see Junyoung?

396
00:26:55,363 --> 00:26:57,449
Yes, I did see her.

397
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:02,454
She's the same.

398
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:07,959
Her temper too, right?

399
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:12,339
Why won't she call me?

400
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:15,717
She's been here for a day.

401
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,552
I heard she came here yesterday.

402
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:20,013
She must've watched me play.
She must've seen me.

403
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:23,350
Come on. We're about to start.

404
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:25,268
I'll be right there.

405
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:28,480
I'm coming.

406
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:43,703
So he knew.

407
00:27:48,249 --> 00:27:51,169
-Let's go!
-You can do it!

408
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:13,233
You seem worked up.

409
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:15,151
Worry about yourself.

410
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:05,493
-All right!
-Once more!

411
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:06,703
Hey, Junghwan.

412
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:09,164
I saw Junyoung yesterday.

413
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:11,040
Did you see her?

414
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:15,420
I guess she hasn't called you yet.

415
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:17,505
She'll call soon.

416
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:21,384
I told her yesterday
that she should call you.

417
00:29:23,136 --> 00:29:24,387
Just play.

418
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:26,890
Another thing.

419
00:29:29,225 --> 00:29:31,311
I know you two have a long history.

420
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:34,731
It's okay. It happens.

421
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:38,693
Why are you talking so much?

422
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:41,029
Minion?

423
00:29:42,655 --> 00:29:43,656
Let's continue.

424
00:29:46,576 --> 00:29:49,329
-Let's go!
-All right!

425
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:53,750
-You can do it!
-Let's do this!

426
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:31,162
Out.

427
00:30:38,127 --> 00:30:39,337
It's out.

428
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:42,632
Yes! Out.

429
00:30:42,715 --> 00:30:43,842
In.

430
00:30:46,594 --> 00:30:48,596
How was that in?

431
00:30:52,475 --> 00:30:55,812
What? How was that in?

432
00:30:56,062 --> 00:30:58,606
I was right there. I saw
that the shuttlecock head went out.

433
00:30:58,690 --> 00:30:59,899
It was in.

434
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:01,860
What…

435
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:03,778
Okay, fine.

436
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:10,201
Don't let it get to you. Be calm.

437
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:11,327
It's okay.

438
00:31:18,334 --> 00:31:21,337
-Come on!
-All right!

439
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:24,340
-Let's play!
-You can do it!

440
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:27,886
You should use your eyes to see.

441
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,554
Hey.

442
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:32,307
What did you just say?

443
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:36,769
Nothing. Honestly, you're bothered
about Junyoung, aren't you?

444
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:40,940
I have her new number. So?

445
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:43,276
Want it? Sir?

446
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,862
This bastard…

447
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:51,868
He's pissed off.

448
00:31:57,123 --> 00:31:59,500
Ignore him.
You know he's trying to egg you on.

449
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:01,794
Just get ready.

450
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,091
Come on!

451
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:35,286
Nice netplay!

452
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:42,585
Net touch.

453
00:32:43,836 --> 00:32:45,463
Are you kidding me?

454
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:47,674
What's wrong with the ump today?

455
00:32:48,257 --> 00:32:49,759
-He's being so unfair.
-What the heck?

456
00:32:49,842 --> 00:32:50,969
Shouldn't we protest?

457
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:53,054
-Sir.
-What's wrong with him?

458
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:55,431
It was
after the shuttlecock hit the floor.

459
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:56,975
Junghwan!

460
00:32:57,058 --> 00:32:59,769
The racket hit the net first. Go back.

461
00:32:59,852 --> 00:33:01,479
Go back. I'll talk to him.

462
00:33:01,688 --> 00:33:02,939
This wasn't a net touch--

463
00:33:03,022 --> 00:33:06,442
The shuttlecock fell first
before the racket hit the net.

464
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:07,735
I said to calm down.

465
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:10,154
-Go back to your position.
-You were wrong!

466
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:11,698
Forget it. Let's go.

467
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:13,449
I can't accept it.

468
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:14,784
Keep it up. You'll get a warning!

469
00:33:14,867 --> 00:33:17,412
Pay attention, will you?
The shuttlecock fell first.

470
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:25,461
Go back or I'll pull out the black card.

471
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:29,090
Does being an umpire make you a thug?

472
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:30,508
Cut it out now!

473
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:33,553
Yook Junghwan, what did you just say?

474
00:33:36,764 --> 00:33:40,560
I'm sorry. Sorry. Sir. Your hand. Come on.

475
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:44,605
A man puts his hand in his pocket
only to pull out a credit card.

476
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:48,484
We're sorry. Sorry. Sorry again.

477
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:54,866
Are you high?

478
00:33:55,825 --> 00:33:57,535
Get a doping test once we're done.

479
00:33:57,618 --> 00:33:59,746
How many wrong calls is he making?

480
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:01,539
Two. That was his second.

481
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:03,499
Hold it in until he makes his third.

482
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:06,377
The umpire is human too.
Wrong calls are part of the game.

483
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:11,090
Must I teach you this crappy truth
at the age of 25?

484
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:12,800
I'm stunned.

485
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:14,427
Everything's a joke to you.

486
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:17,055
It's better than taking it out on him.

487
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:18,931
Be honest.

488
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:21,768
Are you really angry at the ump right now?

489
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:28,149
You vent off on the umpire.
You really are on a different scale.

490
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:29,984
But you know,

491
00:34:30,985 --> 00:34:34,781
someone of your caliber
should earn his keep.

492
00:34:35,364 --> 00:34:37,241
Think of how much you get paid to play.

493
00:34:41,662 --> 00:34:43,539
But you let that runt get in your head.

494
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:45,750
Are you really a has-been?

495
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:48,044
Don't be full of yourself.

496
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:52,048
Don't you see…

497
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:56,219
that punk laughing at you?

498
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,474
He's laughing at you right now.

499
00:35:02,141 --> 00:35:03,476
That runt over there.

500
00:35:05,394 --> 00:35:06,854
That bastard

501
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:09,857
is toying with you!

502
00:35:29,168 --> 00:35:31,254
I wonder
how the men's team match is going.

503
00:35:31,337 --> 00:35:32,547
I hope they win.

504
00:35:34,715 --> 00:35:38,094
Darn it. How will I face
our teammates now?

505
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:40,012
What was wrong with me?

506
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:42,807
I should've said I was sick,

507
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:45,393
but I really wanted to play
in the team match.

508
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:48,312
Make it up to everyone in the next match.

509
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:50,648
You still have a chance.

510
00:35:51,732 --> 00:35:53,568
Use this to wipe your tears.

511
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:54,652
There's water here.

512
00:35:54,735 --> 00:35:56,487
The bathroom is outside to the right.

513
00:35:57,446 --> 00:36:00,158
Jiho said he'd come right after
his match, so rest until then.

514
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:01,159
You're leaving?

515
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:04,203
I'm not even halfway through the IV.

516
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:07,248
Do you hate me too now?

517
00:36:10,918 --> 00:36:12,086
No.

518
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:17,300
To be honest, I don't know what to say
since you're overreacting over nothing.

519
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:20,553
Make up for it later.

520
00:36:20,636 --> 00:36:23,347
It's not like you made a mistake
you can't undo.

521
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:25,433
You didn't destroy someone's life.

522
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:28,811
Still. We lost because of me.
How is that nothing?

523
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:29,979
It's huge.

524
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:33,399
I feel so guilty I can't handle it.

525
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:36,277
Sungsil.

526
00:36:37,486 --> 00:36:38,654
The thing is,

527
00:36:39,405 --> 00:36:41,824
if you're truly overwhelmed by guilt,

528
00:36:42,158 --> 00:36:43,951
you can't even say that you are.

529
00:36:44,827 --> 00:36:46,954
Because you'd feel shameless
for complaining.

530
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:51,459
You'd just laugh instead.

531
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:55,504
Why? Because it's better to be criticized
for being shameless.

532
00:36:57,715 --> 00:36:58,925
What are you talking about?

533
00:37:01,135 --> 00:37:04,013
You're just sorry and humiliated.

534
00:37:04,096 --> 00:37:05,681
Take a nap and shake it off.

535
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:07,016
You have your singles match.

536
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:10,061
-Later.
-Oh…

537
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:15,483
Dang it.

538
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:20,279
-Taeyang! Hey!
-Hey.

539
00:37:20,863 --> 00:37:22,907
-How's Sungsil?
-They say it's fatigue.

540
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:24,700
She'll be better once she finishes her IV.

541
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:26,661
Thank goodness. I'll go up then.

542
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:30,539
Wait. Jiho. How did the match go?

543
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:55,815
What the--

544
00:37:56,315 --> 00:37:57,483
What the heck?

545
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:07,243
Let's get beef!

546
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:17,295
Hey. Did you see Junghwan?

547
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:19,046
Yes. No.

548
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:22,842
I just got this text.
I sent it to you. Read it.

549
00:38:22,925 --> 00:38:24,135
Did he cause trouble again?

550
00:38:29,765 --> 00:38:31,475
What the heck?

551
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:35,980
-Come on.
-Let's go.

552
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:40,901
Hey.

553
00:38:42,069 --> 00:38:44,780
Junghwan. There's a rumor about you.

554
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,325
What is it this time?

555
00:38:47,908 --> 00:38:49,869
Forget it. Cut it out.

556
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:55,458
Junghwan, did you go out
with the great Park Junyoung?

557
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:58,836
My gosh. You truly are amazing.

558
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:00,421
Let me see that.

559
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:06,302
Oh, my gosh. Park Junyoung's back.

560
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:09,930
What's bigger news
is that she used to go out with Junghwan.

561
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:11,766
He blew up at the ump today

562
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:14,060
and acted up
because his ex-girlfriend came back.

563
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:23,694
False rumors spread so quickly,
don't they?

564
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:25,029
Whatever, it's true.

565
00:39:25,946 --> 00:39:27,865
You can drop the act in front of me.

566
00:39:27,948 --> 00:39:29,367
Thanks for keeping it up until now.

567
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:44,298
-We need to talk.
-Some other time.

568
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:56,435
It must be true. I'm speechless.

569
00:39:57,019 --> 00:40:00,189
Park Junyoung? I don't even compare.

570
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:05,569
That punk Yideun must be the one
spreading the rumor, right?

571
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:08,364
I won't just take it this time.

572
00:40:08,447 --> 00:40:12,076
-I'll get evidence and smash his skull--
-Hyukbong.

573
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:14,870
Give it a rest.

574
00:40:27,633 --> 00:40:31,011
Be thorough.
Don't forget your knees and arms.

575
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:34,140
It's my body. I'll handle it.

576
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:35,891
Yeah, right.

577
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:39,603
You endure pain and pretend you're fine.
You call that handling it?

578
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:42,273
You're hurting.

579
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:44,859
What a nag.

580
00:40:47,194 --> 00:40:49,071
I should smile though, right?

581
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:51,115
Since you're worrying about me?

582
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:56,996
If you're in pain, please just rest.

583
00:40:58,205 --> 00:41:00,624
Whatever the reason,
if you're in pain, you're in pain.

584
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:02,793
If things are tough, things are tough.

585
00:41:03,502 --> 00:41:04,753
Don't pretend to be strong.

586
00:41:05,754 --> 00:41:07,298
Why do you smile when things are tough?

587
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:12,094
You should scowl
so that I can help or something.

588
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:14,930
You said before not to cry.

589
00:41:15,764 --> 00:41:17,308
Why are you flip-flopping?

590
00:41:21,103 --> 00:41:22,229
I know

591
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:25,816
you're doing this in case
I'm struggling because of Junyoung.

592
00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:28,527
Just tell me

593
00:41:29,111 --> 00:41:32,615
to take whatever she dishes out
and to beg her for forgiveness.

594
00:41:32,698 --> 00:41:35,451
Tell me not to run away
or whine about feeling guilty,

595
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:39,330
and that you won't stand for it
if I'm all moody.

596
00:41:39,413 --> 00:41:40,706
That would be much better.

597
00:41:40,789 --> 00:41:42,333
You'll do that with me too?

598
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:45,711
Are you alone?

599
00:41:50,466 --> 00:41:52,968
Are you alone? Tell me.

600
00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:54,261
Are you alone?

601
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,519
I was alone.

602
00:42:07,566 --> 00:42:08,984
When I was little,

603
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:12,530
when the other kids cried
for their mommies,

604
00:42:12,655 --> 00:42:14,156
I just sucked it up.

605
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:17,451
Because I had no one to cry for.

606
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:22,998
Even if I was in a slump

607
00:42:23,332 --> 00:42:26,335
and couldn't breathe
because of the weight on my shoulders,

608
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:30,256
I never thought of talking to anyone.

609
00:42:32,132 --> 00:42:33,217
It was just

610
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:35,803
natural

611
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:38,180
that I was alone.

612
00:42:43,018 --> 00:42:46,063
I know I started to whine after I met you,

613
00:42:47,273 --> 00:42:49,483
but it's more comfortable for me
to deal with it alone.

614
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:04,290
I'm crazy for you, so all I see is you.

615
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:05,749
So…

616
00:43:06,875 --> 00:43:08,335
You need to change too.

617
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:11,505
Whoever you are, however you've lived,

618
00:43:13,382 --> 00:43:15,259
just go crazy for me.

619
00:43:22,308 --> 00:43:24,101
Junyoung's mom

620
00:43:25,185 --> 00:43:26,895
gave me money.

621
00:43:27,896 --> 00:43:28,981
She gave me 30,000 won.

622
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:32,026
She thanked me for coming by.

623
00:43:32,901 --> 00:43:34,570
She didn't even know who I was.

624
00:43:36,363 --> 00:43:37,406
She…

625
00:43:39,241 --> 00:43:41,452
probably lived for her daughter
her entire life.

626
00:43:43,245 --> 00:43:45,998
I may have destroyed her family.

627
00:43:50,836 --> 00:43:53,047
But I took the 30,000 won from her.

628
00:43:56,592 --> 00:44:00,137
What? Should I have run to you
and cried about it?

629
00:44:02,264 --> 00:44:05,559
What could I possibly do?

630
00:44:12,775 --> 00:44:14,610
If I let you console me,

631
00:44:16,862 --> 00:44:20,741
I'd feel like I've become
even more despicable.

632
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:24,620
So…

633
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:29,958
So let me act tough, Taejun.

634
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:43,847
Where are we headed?

635
00:44:44,765 --> 00:44:48,394
WOMEN'S DOUBLES
ROUND OF 64

636
00:44:54,733 --> 00:44:56,944
We don't know where we're headed.

637
00:44:57,569 --> 00:44:58,987
WOMEN'S DOUBLES
ROUND OF 32

638
00:44:59,071 --> 00:45:01,198
We fight to stay alive day by day.

639
00:45:02,324 --> 00:45:04,952
We run while dreaming
of a seemingly impossible future.

640
00:45:06,829 --> 00:45:08,747
Once this tournament is over,

641
00:45:08,831 --> 00:45:11,291
we're having a welcome back party
for Park Junyoung.

642
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:15,212
Everyone who trained with her
in the training center, please come.

643
00:45:16,755 --> 00:45:18,173
You should come too.

644
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:22,428
At times, it's chaotic.

645
00:45:28,016 --> 00:45:31,645
At times, you know it isn't the right way,

646
00:45:32,187 --> 00:45:33,188
but you go recklessly.

647
00:45:40,946 --> 00:45:42,448
If you ask why…

648
00:45:43,031 --> 00:45:44,032
Who knows?

649
00:45:46,952 --> 00:45:49,329
Because we're 25.

650
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,042
WOMEN'S DOUBLES
ROUND OF 8

651
00:45:54,126 --> 00:45:55,627
We're too young to stop

652
00:45:56,211 --> 00:45:57,963
and too clumsy to do well.

653
00:46:00,632 --> 00:46:02,217
Because we're 25.

654
00:46:02,551 --> 00:46:03,594
It's okay.

655
00:46:04,887 --> 00:46:07,723
However, I always…

656
00:46:10,517 --> 00:46:12,603
To be honest, I'm disappointed.

657
00:46:14,396 --> 00:46:15,439
This is way too hard.

658
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:17,566
You'll do better next time, right?

659
00:46:18,901 --> 00:46:20,194
I have faith in you.

660
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:26,074
Yes. I'm sorry.

661
00:46:26,158 --> 00:46:28,452
I can't see you out though.

662
00:46:28,535 --> 00:46:29,912
I have to clean up.

663
00:46:30,412 --> 00:46:32,873
That's fine. Get back inside.

664
00:46:46,762 --> 00:46:47,846
Thank you.

665
00:47:00,776 --> 00:47:02,528
It'll leave in 30 minutes.

666
00:47:04,363 --> 00:47:06,073
You didn't need to do this.

667
00:47:07,074 --> 00:47:10,702
Well… A colleague's father
is a father to me too.

668
00:47:10,786 --> 00:47:11,995
That's how it is.

669
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:13,914
Are you very close to Taeyang?

670
00:47:16,708 --> 00:47:18,293
We're partners after all.

671
00:47:18,377 --> 00:47:21,213
-Nothing more?
-Definitely not.

672
00:47:23,715 --> 00:47:27,261
But… I saw a little earlier,

673
00:47:27,344 --> 00:47:28,262
and you were…

674
00:47:29,721 --> 00:47:32,391
To be honest,
making it to the quarterfinals

675
00:47:32,474 --> 00:47:33,976
so soon after returning is amazing.

676
00:47:34,059 --> 00:47:35,686
It means she worked herself to death.

677
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:38,021
Everyone on the team was shocked.

678
00:47:38,605 --> 00:47:41,149
It's fine. She's a tough girl.

679
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:46,572
I can't tell you all the details,

680
00:47:47,739 --> 00:47:49,783
but Taeyang did not have an easy life.

681
00:47:51,243 --> 00:47:55,664
Even still, she never complained
and always smiled.

682
00:47:55,831 --> 00:47:56,832
She's a tough girl.

683
00:48:09,386 --> 00:48:10,929
Get on, guys.

684
00:48:16,727 --> 00:48:19,313
Gosh. Good work, everyone.

685
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:22,441
Okay. Attention.

686
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:25,485
Once we get to the hotel, pack your bags

687
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:27,571
and gather in the lobby by 7 p.m.

688
00:48:27,654 --> 00:48:29,740
I'll dismiss you once we all reach Seoul.

689
00:48:29,823 --> 00:48:32,618
One more thing. One week vacation.

690
00:48:34,036 --> 00:48:36,371
-Thank you.
-We love you.

691
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:40,792
Whoever's going
to Junyoung's party, stay behind.

692
00:48:41,043 --> 00:48:42,753
I posted the address in the chatroom.

693
00:48:42,836 --> 00:48:46,214
-Those cliquey punks.
-Good game, everyone.

694
00:48:46,298 --> 00:48:49,009
It's like we don't exist
if we're not on the national team.

695
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:53,180
You won't go, will you?

696
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:56,099
Don't go.

697
00:48:57,267 --> 00:49:00,395
I won't. Don't worry.

698
00:49:18,956 --> 00:49:20,540
Nothing looks good.

699
00:49:29,716 --> 00:49:31,051
Don't go.

700
00:49:32,094 --> 00:49:33,512
Don't go.

701
00:49:34,054 --> 00:49:37,015
I don't want to see you ditch me
to run over to your first love.

702
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:40,936
Stay with me today, jerk.

703
00:49:48,944 --> 00:49:49,987
Sorry.

704
00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:53,115
My…

705
00:49:55,492 --> 00:49:57,160
My brain has stopped working.

706
00:49:57,995 --> 00:49:59,287
I can't see anything.

707
00:50:00,914 --> 00:50:02,082
Sorry.

708
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:19,266
Taejun! Where are you going?

709
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:20,851
Hey!

710
00:50:22,102 --> 00:50:24,021
Taeyang's going
to the national team gathering.

711
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:33,530
Taeyang.

712
00:50:36,283 --> 00:50:37,534
Why are you here?

713
00:50:43,373 --> 00:50:46,668
Why are you here?
You're making me uncomfortable.

714
00:50:48,962 --> 00:50:50,088
Junyoung.

715
00:50:51,506 --> 00:50:52,966
What's with you two?

716
00:50:54,968 --> 00:50:58,096
I heard she bribed people
and ran away in the middle of the night.

717
00:50:58,180 --> 00:50:59,347
Junyoung.

718
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:02,309
That's the rumor.

719
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:04,603
Gosh.

720
00:51:06,354 --> 00:51:07,397
Is it true?

721
00:51:09,107 --> 00:51:12,152
Junyoung. Look me in the eye.

722
00:51:14,404 --> 00:51:15,614
What for?

723
00:51:16,281 --> 00:51:17,449
Must you do this?

724
00:51:18,784 --> 00:51:19,868
I'm fine

725
00:51:21,161 --> 00:51:22,704
with telling the truth.

726
00:51:22,996 --> 00:51:25,248
-Whatever you want--
-Now?

727
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:30,295
You shouldn't have come here.

728
00:51:31,379 --> 00:51:33,423
How shameless can you be?

729
00:51:37,636 --> 00:51:38,804
I'm…

730
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:41,181
very sorry.

731
00:51:44,351 --> 00:51:45,602
Sorry?

732
00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:49,856
You're sorry?

733
00:51:54,069 --> 00:51:55,195
You're sorry…

734
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:14,089
Taeyang. Where are you going?

735
00:52:15,298 --> 00:52:17,884
Hey. What's with you two? Get up.

736
00:52:17,968 --> 00:52:19,136
I…

737
00:52:20,887 --> 00:52:22,139
It was my fault.

738
00:52:23,056 --> 00:52:24,057
I'm sorry.

739
00:52:25,058 --> 00:52:26,393
I'm very sorry.

740
00:52:26,726 --> 00:52:27,936
I'm so…

741
00:52:31,106 --> 00:52:32,399
sorry.

742
00:52:33,191 --> 00:52:34,568
Who says you can apologize?

743
00:52:35,902 --> 00:52:37,404
I don't need it now.

744
00:52:39,364 --> 00:52:40,532
Get up.

745
00:52:42,117 --> 00:52:43,326
Get up.

746
00:52:45,704 --> 00:52:47,998
Are you starting up with me?

747
00:52:50,208 --> 00:52:51,293
I'm not.

748
00:52:51,376 --> 00:52:53,128
You want to have it out with me

749
00:52:53,837 --> 00:52:55,881
so that you can feel better.

750
00:52:56,298 --> 00:52:59,050
Hey. Could you forgive what happened
if you were me?

751
00:52:59,134 --> 00:53:02,053
Do you think begging on your knees
makes it forgivable?

752
00:53:02,637 --> 00:53:04,139
I wanted you to vent.

753
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:08,351
I wanted you to vent at me

754
00:53:09,978 --> 00:53:11,813
while I'm on my knees.

755
00:53:14,274 --> 00:53:15,901
I didn't want to vent.

756
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:21,364
It's so difficult with you.

757
00:53:23,408 --> 00:53:25,869
You make it so difficult on others.

758
00:53:28,246 --> 00:53:29,706
I really hate you.

759
00:53:39,883 --> 00:53:42,385
DANOA BAR

760
00:53:42,469 --> 00:53:44,179
Why won't she pick up?

761
00:53:45,597 --> 00:53:46,806
What is she doing?

762
00:53:48,183 --> 00:53:49,517
Junyoung.

763
00:53:52,896 --> 00:53:53,980
Junyoung.

764
00:53:56,149 --> 00:53:57,692
Are you really just leaving?

765
00:53:58,693 --> 00:54:01,279
Seungwoo, let's meet up another time.

766
00:54:01,988 --> 00:54:04,074
Sorry for killing the mood.

767
00:54:05,867 --> 00:54:07,869
You know I'm forcing a smile
because I feel bad.

768
00:54:09,537 --> 00:54:10,497
Later.

769
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:11,498
Junyoung.

770
00:54:11,581 --> 00:54:14,668
Stop calling out my name.
I'll have to run away if you don't.

771
00:54:15,168 --> 00:54:16,336
Bye for real!

772
00:54:27,389 --> 00:54:29,015
What happened
between Taeyang and Junyoung?

773
00:54:29,516 --> 00:54:30,892
Does Taeyang owe her money?

774
00:54:31,268 --> 00:54:33,186
Does it look like something
money can resolve?

775
00:54:33,937 --> 00:54:35,814
Taeyang got on her knees.

776
00:54:35,897 --> 00:54:39,359
Gosh. I'm going to leave first.

777
00:54:40,026 --> 00:54:41,403
Take care of the others.

778
00:54:41,486 --> 00:54:43,571
-Okay. Bye.
-Bye.

779
00:54:43,822 --> 00:54:46,074
-Get home safely.
-See you tomorrow.

780
00:54:46,157 --> 00:54:47,158
Wait for me.

781
00:55:22,277 --> 00:55:24,571
Taeyang, let's go.

782
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:26,489
Get up.

783
00:55:26,573 --> 00:55:27,991
You go first.

784
00:55:28,533 --> 00:55:30,243
I'll leave after a bit.

785
00:55:31,494 --> 00:55:33,705
I don't know what to say
since I don't know what happened.

786
00:55:35,373 --> 00:55:36,499
Dang it.

787
00:55:40,295 --> 00:55:42,964
It looks like you did something huge
to upset Junyoung.

788
00:55:44,090 --> 00:55:47,510
But it looks to me
like you're being obstinate.

789
00:55:48,386 --> 00:55:51,389
You should apologize
when the other person wants to hear it.

790
00:55:59,647 --> 00:56:02,400
Hey. Junyoung! Sis!

791
00:56:06,488 --> 00:56:09,032
What's this? Why are you here?

792
00:56:09,324 --> 00:56:10,867
To take you home.

793
00:56:32,806 --> 00:56:35,183
-Sis.
-What?

794
00:56:35,975 --> 00:56:38,603
Can't you forgive her? Park Taeyang.

795
00:56:42,065 --> 00:56:44,859
She told me everything.
About what happened.

796
00:56:46,069 --> 00:56:47,320
While snowboarding.

797
00:56:48,738 --> 00:56:50,573
You should've told your family.

798
00:56:50,782 --> 00:56:52,367
Why did you keep it from us?

799
00:56:52,575 --> 00:56:54,327
Is she going around telling people?

800
00:56:54,994 --> 00:56:56,704
No, she only told me.

801
00:56:57,831 --> 00:56:58,915
Does that matter?

802
00:57:02,335 --> 00:57:05,171
Anyway, you're going to start over too.

803
00:57:14,639 --> 00:57:16,558
This is hard for me to say too,

804
00:57:17,350 --> 00:57:20,395
but I think you should shake off the past.

805
00:57:21,604 --> 00:57:24,065
-It's hard for you too--
-Enough with the nonsense.

806
00:57:24,649 --> 00:57:27,402
So, you know what happened
between Taeyang and me,

807
00:57:27,944 --> 00:57:29,696
but you're still close.

808
00:57:34,951 --> 00:57:36,035
It was an accident.

809
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:39,289
What was that?

810
00:57:40,415 --> 00:57:43,209
You're my brother.
Shouldn't you be giving her hell?

811
00:57:44,502 --> 00:57:46,671
Do you know…

812
00:57:47,505 --> 00:57:50,425
how many lip glosses I tried on
for the gathering?

813
00:57:51,009 --> 00:57:52,802
I was seeing colleagues
who were still playing,

814
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:54,929
but nothing hid how pathetic I was.

815
00:57:56,723 --> 00:57:58,266
It's in the past? What is?

816
00:58:01,728 --> 00:58:02,729
Sorry.

817
00:58:05,273 --> 00:58:06,316
My trip?

818
00:58:08,776 --> 00:58:10,278
Where was my favorite place?

819
00:58:12,572 --> 00:58:14,491
I wanted to return every day,

820
00:58:14,574 --> 00:58:15,742
but I had nowhere to go.

821
00:58:17,911 --> 00:58:20,538
That's not a trip.
That's wandering about lost.

822
00:58:22,957 --> 00:58:25,043
What exactly is in the past?

823
00:58:25,585 --> 00:58:27,504
It's not in the past for me.

824
00:58:28,296 --> 00:58:29,422
But how

825
00:58:30,381 --> 00:58:31,925
can you forgive her?

826
00:58:32,008 --> 00:58:33,510
Who says you can?

827
00:58:33,593 --> 00:58:35,553
How can you forgive Taeyang?

828
00:58:42,477 --> 00:58:43,603
Sis.

829
00:59:41,202 --> 00:59:42,787
Why do you smile when things are tough?

830
00:59:44,664 --> 00:59:47,458
You should scowl
so that I can help or something.

831
00:59:59,137 --> 01:00:00,305
Are you alone?

832
01:00:04,684 --> 01:00:06,519
Are you alone? Tell me.

833
01:00:08,062 --> 01:00:09,188
Are you alone?

834
01:00:18,031 --> 01:00:19,032
Taejun.

835
01:00:22,243 --> 01:00:23,661
Taejun.

836
01:00:26,456 --> 01:00:27,749
Taejun.

837
01:00:31,252 --> 01:00:32,462
She's my sister.

838
01:00:44,724 --> 01:00:46,059
Taejun.

839
01:01:30,436 --> 01:01:32,355
GOING TO YOU AT A SPEED OF 493KM

840
01:01:32,438 --> 01:01:35,191
Why did Park Junyoung
have to be my sister?

841
01:01:35,274 --> 01:01:37,110
-Are you living with a girl?
-Are you at my place?

842
01:01:37,193 --> 01:01:39,570
Let's see that girlfriend of yours.

843
01:01:39,654 --> 01:01:40,571
Is she an athlete too?

844
01:01:40,655 --> 01:01:42,448
What? Say that again.

845
01:01:42,532 --> 01:01:45,451
I'll stop the additional training
and take a break.

846
01:01:45,535 --> 01:01:47,036
I can't breathe.

847
01:01:47,245 --> 01:01:48,246
Let Taeyang go.

848
01:01:48,329 --> 01:01:50,039
Please do the interview.

849
01:01:50,123 --> 01:01:52,458
Should I tell the truth?

850
01:01:53,084 --> 01:01:56,003
Why did you thank me?

851
01:01:57,797 --> 01:01:58,965
Don't you remember?

852
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:12,186
GOING TO YOU AT A SPEED OF 493KM

853
01:02:12,270 --> 01:02:14,272
