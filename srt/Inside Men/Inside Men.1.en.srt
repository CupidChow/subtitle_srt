SHOWBOX presents

2
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:08,152
Shall we begin?

3
00:01:08,903 --> 00:01:10,112
Why did you do that?

4
00:01:10,446 --> 00:01:13,365
I assume you had a reason
for doing this.

5
00:01:16,911 --> 00:01:18,579
Reporter, you like movies?

6
00:01:24,794 --> 00:01:27,004
I loved watching
old movies.

7
00:01:27,546 --> 00:01:30,508
I used to love this music...

8
00:01:30,966 --> 00:01:32,593
Have you seen "Chinatown"?

9
00:01:33,177 --> 00:01:35,721
Jack Nicholson acts
as a private investigator

10
00:01:36,639 --> 00:01:38,933
working as a detective agency...

11
00:01:40,017 --> 00:01:44,188
A lady comes in and
hires him to tail her husband

12
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:47,232
but the husband gets killed
and the wife was a fake.

13
00:01:47,233 --> 00:01:48,566
Then, the real wife shows up...

14
00:01:48,567 --> 00:01:52,238
Anyways, it's complicated, you know
the conspiracy and twist...

15
00:01:52,404 --> 00:01:55,866
The truth that comes at the end
is ugly and dirty...

16
00:01:56,534 --> 00:01:59,036
So, don't you want to know
the truth?

17
00:01:59,245 --> 00:02:02,164
Hey, pay attention here.

18
00:02:02,498 --> 00:02:05,543
Was it for justice or revenge?

19
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:08,003
I'll come to that later...

20
00:02:09,171 --> 00:02:11,631
Bad guys beat up
Jack Nicholson, you know.

21
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:13,884
We can talk about
the movie later...

22
00:02:14,218 --> 00:02:16,428
I'm not here to watch
a movie.

23
00:02:18,055 --> 00:02:21,892
Don't cut me off
and listen to me.

24
00:02:23,269 --> 00:02:24,895
I'll get to the point now.

25
00:02:27,022 --> 00:02:31,110
So, anyways...

26
00:02:34,238 --> 00:02:36,574
God damn it, fuck.

27
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:41,745
Jack Nicholson's nose was wacked

28
00:02:43,455 --> 00:02:47,334
but he goes to the wife
and says

29
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:52,047
It looks like half the city

30
00:02:52,089 --> 00:02:54,048
is trying to cover it all up

31
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:56,093
which is fine with me.

32
00:02:56,302 --> 00:02:57,678
But Mrs. Mulwray,

33
00:02:58,762 --> 00:03:01,098
I goddam nearly lost my nose.

34
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:02,766
And I like it.

35
00:03:03,434 --> 00:03:05,059
I like breathing through it.

36
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,354
So why the hell are you doing this?

37
00:03:07,438 --> 00:03:09,899
You must have a reason
for doing all this.

38
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:28,500
For justice? Revenge?

39
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,629
I don't care about any of that.

40
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:34,256
But, Mr. Reporter...

41
00:03:34,757 --> 00:03:36,967
Damn it, I lost my hand.

42
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,303
I like my hand.

43
00:03:39,929 --> 00:03:41,305
I like eating with it...

44
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:43,432
wiping my ass with it...

45
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:45,768
and jerking off with it...

46
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:06,579
Yes.

47
00:04:07,498 --> 00:04:10,584
It seems a prosecutor's investigation
is inevitable.

48
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:18,842
Yes, we need to find a way
to quiet down the public.

49
00:04:20,344 --> 00:04:21,387
Yes.

50
00:05:12,396 --> 00:05:15,733
I got this from Moon Il-seok,
former accountant at Mirae Motors.

51
00:05:16,567 --> 00:05:20,738
It shows Mirae made a slush fund
with 3 billion from Hangyul Bank

52
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:26,285
and gave 30 million to Congressman Jang
for his election campaign.

53
00:05:27,161 --> 00:05:30,664
Is it true that sex favors were
offered at Oh's villa?

54
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:33,082
Who were the women
forced into it?

55
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:36,003
You claimed Oh and Jang
retaliated against you.

56
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:37,838
Could you specify?

57
00:06:10,788 --> 00:06:13,874
How did you meet Oh and Jang?

58
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:17,544
Through Lee Kang-hee,
editor-in-chief of Nation Daily.

59
00:06:17,753 --> 00:06:20,964
And what's your relationship
with Lee?

60
00:06:21,256 --> 00:06:23,425
That's a long story.

61
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:25,969
So let me reveal it
to the prosecutor.

62
00:06:26,845 --> 00:06:28,597
Can you tell us anything more?

63
00:06:35,604 --> 00:06:38,856
Ahn, president of a talent agency,
revealed today at press conference

64
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:42,193
that Mirae Motors set up
a slush fund of $3 billion

65
00:06:42,194 --> 00:06:45,114
via an illegal loan
from Hangyul Bank.

66
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:48,658
Congressman Jang Pil-woo,
the New Party's presidential candidate

67
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:53,330
exerted pressure behind
the scenes, according to Ahn.

68
00:06:53,664 --> 00:06:58,919
Sex favors were also allegedly offered
at Mirae Motors Chairman Oh's villa.

69
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:02,131
Mirae Motors and
Congressman Jang's office

70
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:04,425
have denied all allegations,

71
00:07:04,508 --> 00:07:07,136
and said they are more than
willing to take legal action.

72
00:07:08,846 --> 00:07:13,017
My conscience is clear before
the people of this country.

73
00:07:13,392 --> 00:07:19,857
I have never received
money or favors from Mirae Motors.

74
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:23,444
I can stake my political life on it.

75
00:07:23,861 --> 00:07:28,782
I will continue on my path,
alone but proud as always

76
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:35,914
never yielding
to any political maneuvering

77
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:39,251
or malicious target investigations.

78
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:49,511
INSIDE MEN
THE ORIGINAL

79
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:57,019
2 YEARS AGO

80
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,103
Mr. Editor,

81
00:07:58,395 --> 00:07:59,813
it's almost deadline.

82
00:08:00,189 --> 00:08:01,399
Close the door.

83
00:08:01,565 --> 00:08:04,860
Director wants it done soon.

84
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:06,737
Close the door.

85
00:08:23,045 --> 00:08:25,673
You're making me come in again.

86
00:08:26,715 --> 00:08:31,512
Which word are stuck with this time?

87
00:08:34,515 --> 00:08:38,227
With intentions
or "doubts with intentions".

88
00:08:45,943 --> 00:08:47,528
Obviously it's "with intentions".

89
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:50,696
There's no acting as a group.

90
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:53,742
The context and the facts
tell you that.

91
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:58,038
I need to know more
to say "with intentions".

92
00:08:58,622 --> 00:09:00,374
It's still rough at the moment.

93
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:04,419
We stick with "with intentions".

94
00:09:08,632 --> 00:09:09,967
We...

95
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,719
Our newspaper's view...

96
00:09:15,514 --> 00:09:16,848
Right?

97
00:09:17,516 --> 00:09:18,642
That's right.

98
00:09:26,275 --> 00:09:27,484
It's done.

99
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:31,989
You're really...

100
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:36,743
No chief editor discusses
over a word.

101
00:09:36,827 --> 00:09:38,579
It's not a nice habit.

102
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:42,457
I can't write something
that goes against the company.

103
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:45,002
Let's go and eat something.

104
00:09:45,836 --> 00:09:49,006
People should respect you
for that, you know.

105
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:02,644
Congressman Kim Seok-woo
New Party

106
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:20,829
The people were wise.
Kim's predictable defeat.

107
00:10:20,871 --> 00:10:22,511
Lee Kang-hee
Editor-in-chief, Nation Daily

108
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:27,711
Call Lee at Nation Daily
and invite him to dinner.

109
00:10:27,753 --> 00:10:29,379
Yes, sir.

110
00:10:29,713 --> 00:10:32,591
Is this an article
or a piece of shit?

111
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:48,857
Have you heard of the relations
between Mirae Motors and Jang?

112
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:52,861
We've kept it quiet
as he's from our party.

113
00:10:54,363 --> 00:10:59,409
But I can feel that
the bomb is about to explode.

114
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:03,955
What do you mean by that?

115
00:11:04,206 --> 00:11:09,127
It's quiet with Hangyul's president
hiding out overseas.

116
00:11:10,462 --> 00:11:14,007
But rumor says
he's returning to Korea.

117
00:11:14,466 --> 00:11:19,262
Then the prosecution will at least
pretend to take action.

118
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:35,278
Today's phrase.
"Station for transfer."

119
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:40,075
It means it's time
to change your ride.

120
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:47,666
I'm just a journalist.
What can I do?

121
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:52,713
You picked Jang
and him brought into politics.

122
00:11:52,963 --> 00:11:55,465
Backing him up
with Mirae Motors.

123
00:11:56,633 --> 00:12:00,512
All part of your
master plan, right?

124
00:12:04,141 --> 00:12:10,731
How about throwing me
a line like this,

125
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:12,983
is what I mean.

126
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:22,159
Does that matter at this stage?

127
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:23,367
Not so much...

128
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:26,036
He's the setting sun.
Chief Prosecutor
Seoul District Office
Senior Secretary
Civil Affairs President's Office

129
00:12:26,037 --> 00:12:27,371
He can't rise again, can he?
Chief Prosecutor
Seoul District Office
Senior Secretary
Civil Affairs President's Office

130
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:30,000
Nope... only a year left in his term.

131
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,168
Right!
What's important is who's next.

132
00:12:32,169 --> 00:12:34,963
The opposition party already
threw in the towel...

133
00:12:36,882 --> 00:12:39,885
so it's either Kim Seok-woo
or Jang Pil-woo.

134
00:12:40,218 --> 00:12:42,971
I was on bad terms with Jang
at the Supreme Prosecutors' Office.

135
00:12:43,013 --> 00:12:46,183
If that bastard gets in,
he'll never leave me in peace.

136
00:12:46,224 --> 00:12:47,517
He sure wouldn't.

137
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:50,562
Isn't Kim your high school alumni?

138
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:51,896
Elementary school, sir.

139
00:12:51,897 --> 00:12:55,691
Kim and I went to the same university.
He could be the perfect match for us!

140
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:57,194
Not bad at all, sir.

141
00:12:57,569 --> 00:13:01,281
Get something dirty on Jang.
I'll take care of the rest.

142
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:03,200
Yes, sir.

143
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:05,702
Who's the sniper for this?

144
00:13:06,203 --> 00:13:08,537
A guy called Woo Jang-hoon
at Special Investigations.

145
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:09,664
Whose line is he from?

146
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:13,209
No one's. He's from a regional college.
But as a matter of fact...

147
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:14,336
Is he a nut?

148
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:17,380
No, he's a former cop.

149
00:13:18,632 --> 00:13:19,883
Cop?

150
00:13:20,592 --> 00:13:21,635
Yes.

151
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:26,932
He had his days on the force
with awards.

152
00:13:27,808 --> 00:13:29,601
But he had a temper

153
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:32,312
and was a loner and
didn't get along.

154
00:13:32,687 --> 00:13:33,687
A loner?

155
00:13:35,857 --> 00:13:38,235
He didn't get along with
the police academy graduates.

156
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:49,246
Then, he went on and
took the bar exam

157
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:51,248
and quit being a police.

158
00:13:51,915 --> 00:13:54,751
How did he end up at
the Seoul District Prosecutor's Office?

159
00:13:54,793 --> 00:13:58,004
You remember the Busan Savings Bank
corruption case 4 years ago?

160
00:13:58,088 --> 00:13:59,339
That was him?

161
00:13:59,965 --> 00:14:01,424
He received the president prize.

162
00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:04,469
After that, he started working there.

163
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:06,721
What an interesting guy.

164
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:08,389
Yes, he is.

165
00:14:17,607 --> 00:14:18,607
Yes.

166
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:24,197
How do you do, sir?
I'm Woo Jang-hoon.

167
00:14:24,281 --> 00:14:26,615
This is Mr. Oh Myung-hwan,
from 17th year.

168
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:28,158
Senior Secretary to President
for Civil Affairs.

169
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:29,244
Honor to meet you.

170
00:14:29,286 --> 00:14:30,829
- Sit, sit.
- Yes, sir.

171
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:35,499
Which year are you?

172
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:37,544
38th, sir.

173
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:39,629
- You were a cop?
- Yes, sir.

174
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:42,966
Why become a prosecutor?
Being a cop isn't bad.

175
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:49,639
I wanted to be an excellent prosecutor
just like you, sir.

176
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:52,142
You're a role model to me, sir.

177
00:14:53,435 --> 00:14:54,810
He has guts, I like him.

178
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:55,979
He sure has.

179
00:14:59,149 --> 00:15:00,400
Have a drink.

180
00:15:14,748 --> 00:15:18,209
Mr. Secretary!
What's up at this hour?

181
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:21,463
I'm having dinner
at Okryu-dang.

182
00:15:23,298 --> 00:15:24,507
Really?

183
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:28,845
Sure, no problem.

184
00:15:33,808 --> 00:15:37,520
Damn son of a bitch!
How dare he order me to come!

185
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:40,023
Who was it?

186
00:15:45,195 --> 00:15:48,365
I'll have to drop by the next room.
Won't be long, eat first.

187
00:15:59,167 --> 00:16:00,669
I expect a lot from you.

188
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:02,045
Thank you, sir.

189
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:06,174
Take care, sir.

190
00:16:08,969 --> 00:16:12,180
My stomach still hurts.
Why should I always drink for work?

191
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:16,142
Have this, sir.
It'll relieve the hangover.

192
00:16:16,226 --> 00:16:18,937
You're better than my wife.

193
00:16:19,521 --> 00:16:21,356
How's the Mirae Motors case?
Driving smooth?

194
00:16:21,606 --> 00:16:24,234
Seok Myung-kwan went off the grid.

195
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:26,695
It'll take more time
than we thought.

196
00:16:27,028 --> 00:16:27,946
He's in the States?

197
00:16:27,947 --> 00:16:30,323
Right, put him on the wanted list,

198
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:32,741
but it's a damn big country.

199
00:16:32,742 --> 00:16:34,702
This case is all about timing.

200
00:16:34,703 --> 00:16:37,622
You can't get him
if timing's not right.

201
00:16:37,706 --> 00:16:41,251
Don't you trust me?

202
00:16:41,543 --> 00:16:43,837
Sure, I do.
I should.

203
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:48,299
Oh, regarding this year's
personnel realignment...

204
00:16:48,883 --> 00:16:51,011
Yang was promoted to the
Supreme Prosecutors' Office.

205
00:16:51,845 --> 00:16:56,099
Sorry about that.
I pushed real hard for you...

206
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:02,480
Just between you and me,

207
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:06,109
is there anyone more loyal
to the office than me?

208
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:08,194
- Of course not.
- Then this Yang...

209
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:11,196
son of a bitch got better results
as a prosecutor?

210
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:14,284
You're the ace
when it comes to results.

211
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:18,038
But that bastard's father-in-law
pulled strings at The Blue House.

212
00:17:18,288 --> 00:17:20,582
He's close to the CID director...

213
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,041
So you're saying...

214
00:17:22,834 --> 00:17:26,795
a loser like me
with no connections

215
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:29,591
should just accept
this shitty situation?

216
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:34,804
What can we do?
This country is all about connections.

217
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:37,057
That's why without fail,

218
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:41,853
you need to get Jang.

219
00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:45,440
Then fuck connections and lines.

220
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:47,400
You'll be on the fast track.

221
00:17:53,114 --> 00:17:55,408
Even a fly has its spleen?

222
00:17:55,742 --> 00:17:57,077
Bullshit.

223
00:17:57,786 --> 00:17:59,746
I'm a shooter.

224
00:17:59,913 --> 00:18:01,247
I'm a scorpion.

225
00:18:01,664 --> 00:18:05,043
That's why you killed
the woman you loved?

226
00:18:06,044 --> 00:18:08,046
To become Daehan Group's
son-in-law?

227
00:18:09,464 --> 00:18:10,840
Is that a threat?

228
00:18:11,091 --> 00:18:14,302
No, I will kill you!

229
00:18:14,677 --> 00:18:19,432
I won't forgive you
for ruining my sister!

230
00:18:20,892 --> 00:18:21,892
Cut!

231
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:25,146
How was it?

232
00:18:26,064 --> 00:18:29,359
You really have to ask?

233
00:18:33,696 --> 00:18:35,865
- You really want to act?
- Yes.

234
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:40,537
Everyone knows you have
a strong will for acting.

235
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:46,042
Okay.

236
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:48,211
Send him in a minute.

237
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:52,173
The Director's here.

238
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:05,145
Loosen up.

239
00:19:06,396 --> 00:19:07,730
Please, loosen up.

240
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:32,964
Damn.

241
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:34,382
Good evening, sir.

242
00:19:34,716 --> 00:19:36,759
He's still hesitating.

243
00:19:36,801 --> 00:19:39,345
Keeps drinking...
Using up our expense money.

244
00:19:39,596 --> 00:19:43,099
Damn bastard only picks
expensive places.

245
00:19:43,266 --> 00:19:44,475
Sons of bitches.

246
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:51,900
I'm fine being a Joan of Arc
for the sake of justice.

247
00:19:52,192 --> 00:19:55,444
But when I think about my family,
I'm not quite sure...

248
00:19:55,445 --> 00:19:57,321
But when I think about my family,
I'm not quite sure...
Moon Il-seok
Accounting Manager at Mirae Motors

249
00:19:57,322 --> 00:19:58,114
This is driving me
damn crazy.
Moon Il-seok
Accounting Manager at Mirae Motors

250
00:19:58,115 --> 00:20:00,950
This is driving me
damn crazy.

251
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:04,579
Shit, this squid is tough.

252
00:20:05,622 --> 00:20:08,249
Who the fuck are you, blockhead?

253
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:12,545
I'm a Republic of Korea
prosecutor, asshole.

254
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,017
Sit up straight, fucker.

255
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:29,979
How much did you pocket?

256
00:20:32,774 --> 00:20:33,858
Hundred thousand?

257
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:37,820
A million?

258
00:20:38,905 --> 00:20:41,157
What are you talking about?

259
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:45,912
Do you think this is a goddamn joke?

260
00:20:47,205 --> 00:20:50,833
You want to rot behind bars
the rest of your life?

261
00:21:00,468 --> 00:21:01,886
Listen to me carefully.

262
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:06,891
Mirae Motors got 3 billion from
Hangyul Bank to set up a slush fund.

263
00:21:07,058 --> 00:21:09,851
And 30 million got parked into
Jang's campaign fund.

264
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:12,020
You pocketed, let's say,

265
00:21:12,021 --> 00:21:14,439
one million
while managing the slush fund.

266
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,234
Then got caught and fired.

267
00:21:16,484 --> 00:21:18,695
You came to me
to get back at them, right?

268
00:21:19,028 --> 00:21:23,366
If so, you should start
talking about the deal

269
00:21:24,492 --> 00:21:28,162
that we're gonna make
instead of drinking, stupid.

270
00:21:30,123 --> 00:21:31,707
You wanna go to the prosecutor's

271
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:35,211
or you wanna hand me the file
and go home?

272
00:21:38,298 --> 00:21:42,719
First, the men's room...
I need to pee.

273
00:21:45,054 --> 00:21:46,514
Sure, take your time.

274
00:21:54,689 --> 00:21:57,233
Maybe you were a bit
too harsh on him.

275
00:21:57,317 --> 00:21:59,152
You can never be harsh enough...

276
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:00,611
You don't get it...

277
00:22:01,529 --> 00:22:02,864
Oh, I see.

278
00:22:03,114 --> 00:22:04,907
Why didn't you stop me?

279
00:22:05,074 --> 00:22:07,535
Bring him back here.
I'll go easy on him.

280
00:22:07,994 --> 00:22:09,912
Bring in the girls as well then...

281
00:22:10,204 --> 00:22:12,373
We have the expenses,
let's have some fun today.

282
00:22:12,415 --> 00:22:14,751
Prosecutors in Korea
are all just puppets.

283
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:16,753
We are all pawns.
Let them come.

284
00:22:17,003 --> 00:22:18,379
- Sir...
- Let everyone come.

285
00:22:18,546 --> 00:22:19,547
Sir...

286
00:22:21,257 --> 00:22:22,383
I'm sorry.

287
00:22:23,551 --> 00:22:25,178
- Mr. Bang.
- Yes, sir.

288
00:22:26,387 --> 00:22:28,264
Pull yourself together.

289
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:31,225
If you don't want to
treat others like a puppet

290
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:34,354
and wipe their asses
you should get a grip.

291
00:22:34,437 --> 00:22:35,437
Yes, sir.

292
00:22:36,439 --> 00:22:41,194
But how did you know
he messed with the slush fund?

293
00:22:41,277 --> 00:22:47,450
Even though they clean up nice
the dirty ones will always stink.

294
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:51,829
But that asshole talks about justice?

295
00:22:51,913 --> 00:22:54,040
Fuck him, asshole.

296
00:22:54,665 --> 00:22:57,251
Damn it, I'm screwed.

297
00:22:57,794 --> 00:23:00,088
That little prick,
how dare he throw squid...

298
00:23:15,853 --> 00:23:19,148
Good god, let's talk
after you've seen the script.

299
00:23:19,232 --> 00:23:20,232
Oh, Mr. Ahn.

300
00:23:22,443 --> 00:23:25,363
I'm always on the actor's side.

301
00:23:25,988 --> 00:23:28,491
My guests have arrived.
I'll talk to you soon.

302
00:23:29,492 --> 00:23:31,285
Okay, sure.

303
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:34,330
Director Park's nagging me.

304
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:36,874
Which Director Park?

305
00:23:36,958 --> 00:23:40,962
You know, the one that received
the Director's Award...

306
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:42,290
It's a pleasure to meet you.

307
00:23:42,338 --> 00:23:43,422
This is Director Kang Minho.

308
00:23:43,423 --> 00:23:45,341
- I'm Ahn Sang-goo
- I'm Kang Min-ho.

309
00:23:45,383 --> 00:23:46,342
Nice to meet you.

310
00:23:46,384 --> 00:23:48,511
What did director Kang want?

311
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:51,722
Well you know,
he wants to meet our star, Ms. Kim.

312
00:23:51,848 --> 00:23:53,683
She can't meet him
with script you know.

313
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,642
We need toilet paper
to wipe our asses.

314
00:23:55,643 --> 00:23:57,812
Of course, you need the script first.

315
00:23:58,646 --> 00:24:00,356
You've seen our script, right?

316
00:24:01,983 --> 00:24:04,110
Even a fly has its spleen?

317
00:24:04,318 --> 00:24:05,570
Bullshit.

318
00:24:05,862 --> 00:24:08,156
I'm a shooter.
I'm a scorpion.

319
00:24:08,239 --> 00:24:11,868
That's why you killed
the woman you loved?

320
00:24:12,285 --> 00:24:14,162
To become Daehan Group's
son-in-law?

321
00:24:14,662 --> 00:24:15,872
Is that a threat?

322
00:24:15,913 --> 00:24:19,167
No, I will kill you!

323
00:24:19,459 --> 00:24:23,921
I won't forgive you
for ruining my sister!

324
00:24:27,008 --> 00:24:28,676
Yes, we've seen the script.

325
00:24:28,718 --> 00:24:32,054
Please, let me introduce
my actor here.

326
00:24:34,265 --> 00:24:36,184
Nice to meet you.
It's Seo Hye-jin.

327
00:24:36,309 --> 00:24:38,728
Well, I can see you have talent...

328
00:24:39,145 --> 00:24:42,064
So, when's our star coming?

329
00:24:42,273 --> 00:24:44,513
Oh, Ms. Kim will be here shortly.
She's stuck in traffic.

330
00:24:44,734 --> 00:24:46,068
- Mr. Kang.
- Yes.

331
00:24:47,403 --> 00:24:48,654
How about Hye-jin here?

332
00:24:52,533 --> 00:24:54,118
Leave us alone now.

333
00:24:55,077 --> 00:24:57,038
See you next time.

334
00:25:06,797 --> 00:25:09,800
She studied acting in Russia

335
00:25:09,884 --> 00:25:12,595
so, her acting style is
a bit different.

336
00:25:13,095 --> 00:25:16,265
But that could be her take, right?

337
00:25:17,475 --> 00:25:20,144
She also has a good heart
unlike other actors.

338
00:25:21,771 --> 00:25:23,147
Her parents are teachers.

339
00:25:30,404 --> 00:25:33,032
Well, I'm not putting
any pressure on you.

340
00:25:33,741 --> 00:25:37,452
I'm not saying I'll accept Ms. Kim
if you cast Hye-jin.

341
00:25:37,453 --> 00:25:39,705
How could I think like that?

342
00:25:40,665 --> 00:25:42,124
But, what if that's what I mean?

343
00:25:42,375 --> 00:25:45,294
Oh my, you really...

344
00:25:45,836 --> 00:25:49,590
have a unique sense of humor, right?

345
00:26:01,644 --> 00:26:02,687
You find that funny?

346
00:26:04,647 --> 00:26:06,190
Did I say something funny?

347
00:26:09,318 --> 00:26:11,320
Just because I talk
with a smile on my face...

348
00:26:12,321 --> 00:26:14,323
you think I'm a joke?

349
00:26:18,244 --> 00:26:22,707
You'll take me seriously
if I make you see your own guts?

350
00:26:23,833 --> 00:26:26,419
Come on, I didn't mean to...
Don't get me wrong...

351
00:26:26,502 --> 00:26:28,420
I really didn't mean...

352
00:26:28,421 --> 00:26:31,507
Chill, I'm just messing with you.

353
00:26:33,593 --> 00:26:34,719
What I meant was...

354
00:26:34,802 --> 00:26:37,680
that I'm asking you politely.

355
00:26:38,222 --> 00:26:41,642
For you to consider my proposal
for your movie.

356
00:26:42,143 --> 00:26:46,522
Hye-jin depicts a femme fatale
like Lauren Bacall.

357
00:26:46,689 --> 00:26:48,316
You know Lauren Bacall, don't you?

358
00:26:48,399 --> 00:26:51,736
You know, Humphrey Bogart's wife.

359
00:26:52,278 --> 00:26:56,115
Oh my, she was awesome in
"The Big Sleep".

360
00:26:56,365 --> 00:26:58,618
You know a lot of movies.

361
00:26:58,701 --> 00:27:00,452
- You seem like an expert.
- No, I'm not.

362
00:27:00,453 --> 00:27:02,246
- You studied movies?
- Nothing like that.

363
00:27:02,622 --> 00:27:06,334
The thing is...
Excuse me.

364
00:27:10,379 --> 00:27:11,505
How did it go?

365
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:16,177
I'm in a meeting right now.
Get the tools ready.

366
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:24,393
He's gone,
what shall we do?

367
00:27:26,562 --> 00:27:29,440
We sowed and
they reaped... fuckers.

368
00:27:41,619 --> 00:27:43,496
Good evening, boss!

369
00:27:53,172 --> 00:27:54,172
You got the stuff?

370
00:27:55,591 --> 00:27:58,052
I'm sorry.
We did our best, but...

371
00:27:59,178 --> 00:28:00,262
I'm sorry.

372
00:28:05,059 --> 00:28:07,520
Don't go home empty handed
on your wife's birthday.

373
00:28:08,562 --> 00:28:10,731
I put some cash in the box

374
00:28:10,898 --> 00:28:12,857
so get her some flowers with it.

375
00:28:12,858 --> 00:28:14,652
Thank you, boss!

376
00:28:14,819 --> 00:28:16,862
If you're thankful, do better.

377
00:28:17,113 --> 00:28:18,572
I could die for you.

378
00:28:18,614 --> 00:28:20,950
Damn.
I don't need your life.

379
00:28:21,283 --> 00:28:22,868
Just get your job done cleanly.

380
00:28:22,952 --> 00:28:23,952
Yes, boss.

381
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:47,435
You left me in spring rain,
and came back in spring rain.

382
00:28:49,645 --> 00:29:00,197
We parted with smiles
on that day.

383
00:29:01,115 --> 00:29:07,329
But today we are in sorrow

384
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:11,792
at this minute, at this hour.

385
00:29:12,501 --> 00:29:18,632
We are looking out the window
all in tears.

386
00:29:25,306 --> 00:29:31,270
You came back to me
as spring rain...

387
00:29:46,702 --> 00:29:48,579
Goddamn nail...

388
00:29:55,294 --> 00:29:57,671
Nation Daily

389
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:15,189
You should quit
smoking at your age.

390
00:30:17,066 --> 00:30:20,152
You ought to get
married at your age.

391
00:30:20,236 --> 00:30:23,697
What's the use?
So I can live alone, like you?

392
00:30:26,075 --> 00:30:29,495
Tell your wife and kids
to move back to Korea.

393
00:30:30,454 --> 00:30:32,748
Don't live like an old widower
when you're not one.

394
00:30:32,832 --> 00:30:36,418
Live alone,
life is all about solitude.

395
00:30:36,794 --> 00:30:37,878
By the way,

396
00:30:38,754 --> 00:30:41,090
you shouldn't just drop in here.

397
00:30:41,465 --> 00:30:44,301
You know there are eyes
watching you.

398
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:47,930
Let a hundred eyes watch me...
I ain't scared.

399
00:30:48,472 --> 00:30:50,266
Why are you so excited?

400
00:30:55,229 --> 00:30:56,647
Well, what shall I call it?

401
00:30:59,441 --> 00:31:01,819
Expandability?
Or compatibility?

402
00:31:01,944 --> 00:31:03,195
What is it?

403
00:31:03,696 --> 00:31:08,284
Useful materials for you in
politics, finance or academia...

404
00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:11,912
and for my expansion
in entertainment or gambling...

405
00:31:12,788 --> 00:31:17,209
Or shall I just go into politics?

406
00:31:17,293 --> 00:31:18,919
So what is it?

407
00:31:19,003 --> 00:31:21,797
They got 3 billion
from Hangyul Bank

408
00:31:21,881 --> 00:31:24,132
and 3 million of that went to
Congressman Jang.

409
00:31:24,133 --> 00:31:25,134
What?

410
00:31:27,511 --> 00:31:30,472
The file on the slush fund
of Mirae Motors' chairman.

411
00:31:42,568 --> 00:31:44,194
You keep it for me.

412
00:31:44,486 --> 00:31:46,071
This is a copy I've made.

413
00:31:47,197 --> 00:31:49,909
We'll see what good
it might bring us.

414
00:31:50,993 --> 00:31:53,495
Don't release it
without my consent, got it?

415
00:31:57,958 --> 00:32:00,336
What a foxy bear.

416
00:32:06,634 --> 00:32:11,513
You left me in spring rain,

417
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:17,353
and came back in spring rain.

418
00:32:19,521 --> 00:32:25,486
We parted with smiles

419
00:32:26,028 --> 00:32:30,324
on that day.

420
00:32:32,368 --> 00:32:38,832
But today we are in sorrow,

421
00:32:40,042 --> 00:32:43,712
at this minute, at this hour.

422
00:32:45,798 --> 00:32:51,595
We are looking out the window
all in tears.

423
00:32:58,185 --> 00:33:04,400
You came back to me
as spring rain...

424
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:09,446
you're raining on my heart, too.

425
00:33:11,657 --> 00:33:15,119
Stop staring at them.

426
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:19,915
I only brought first class gals,
so don't worry.

427
00:33:21,291 --> 00:33:23,126
Hurry inside.
You'll get soaked.

428
00:33:28,424 --> 00:33:30,592
Moon tried to leak it,

429
00:33:32,094 --> 00:33:34,930
but he gave in
even before I touched him.

430
00:33:38,058 --> 00:33:41,645
I got something to say.

431
00:33:42,938 --> 00:33:48,027
I've been in business long enough
and am pretty busy with other stuff...

432
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:53,615
I can't take care of Mr. Jo's shit forever.
Why don't you do it yourself?

433
00:33:54,283 --> 00:33:57,786
I'm not a pimp or anything.

434
00:33:59,329 --> 00:34:00,581
See you.

435
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:16,889
Fuck.

436
00:34:21,602 --> 00:34:24,480
Mirae Motors'
temporary employees' union

437
00:34:24,897 --> 00:34:30,944
has long been considered
a danger to the state economy.

438
00:34:31,028 --> 00:34:34,489
Rife with North Korean sympathizers,

439
00:34:34,490 --> 00:34:38,160
it has begun to do serious damage
to the nation's industry and economy.

440
00:34:38,702 --> 00:34:41,830
These comma bastards...
Mirae Motors
Chairman Oh Hyun-soo

441
00:34:43,499 --> 00:34:46,668
This is why you need to

442
00:34:47,336 --> 00:34:50,756
provide them just enough to live on.

443
00:34:51,423 --> 00:34:53,342
So, they don't do something stupid.

444
00:34:53,675 --> 00:34:58,013
Don't mind them,
time will solve everything.

445
00:34:58,472 --> 00:34:59,681
What are you talking about?

446
00:35:00,015 --> 00:35:02,810
The public are dogs and hogs.

447
00:35:03,644 --> 00:35:07,272
Why worry about them?

448
00:35:08,857 --> 00:35:13,570
Let them bark for a while,
then it'll die away.

449
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,200
Is it so?

450
00:35:24,414 --> 00:35:27,251
Anyway, it's a desirable match.

451
00:35:27,543 --> 00:35:31,922
The media and a corporation,
in a marketing partnership.

452
00:35:33,298 --> 00:35:38,470
I'll look forward to
your excellent writing.

453
00:35:39,847 --> 00:35:40,848
Sure.

454
00:35:43,225 --> 00:35:46,436
I'm terribly sorry
for being late, sir.

455
00:35:46,562 --> 00:35:49,898
No, you're on time.

456
00:35:50,274 --> 00:35:53,068
It wasn't too bothersome
for you to come out here?

457
00:35:54,319 --> 00:35:55,863
Play is never bothersome.

458
00:35:58,323 --> 00:36:00,951
How's the temporary employees'
protection bill?

459
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:04,454
Don't worry, I'm blocking
its passage with my life.

460
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:07,583
It will end up in tatters.

461
00:36:08,959 --> 00:36:10,586
- Rags and tatters.
- That's right!

462
00:36:11,753 --> 00:36:13,796
- Why don't we celebrate then?
- I'm all up for it!

463
00:36:13,797 --> 00:36:14,673
Let's go!

464
00:36:14,674 --> 00:36:15,883
Let's go, buddy.

465
00:36:27,978 --> 00:36:29,771
Alright, way to go.
All set.

466
00:36:31,607 --> 00:36:34,943
Alright, now for the ninth hole!

467
00:36:36,278 --> 00:36:39,948
Look at his club!
It's so solid and strong.

468
00:36:41,074 --> 00:36:42,450
It's a driver!

469
00:36:42,451 --> 00:36:44,620
It's a presidential club, sir.

470
00:36:45,662 --> 00:36:47,330
Let me swing it!

471
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:55,797
- Damn it.
- It didn't reach the pin!

472
00:36:56,632 --> 00:37:01,428
Let me substitute in.
My club is quite solid, too.

473
00:37:07,643 --> 00:37:08,936
Way to go, buddy!

474
00:37:11,146 --> 00:37:14,608
Let me see what you got.

475
00:37:17,236 --> 00:37:18,779
Albatross!

476
00:37:21,031 --> 00:37:23,116
It's an albatross!

477
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,825
We should celebrate it!

478
00:37:24,826 --> 00:37:26,161
Sure we should!

479
00:37:26,453 --> 00:37:28,372
To Lee's albatross!

480
00:37:40,509 --> 00:37:41,843
Mr. Ahn Sang-goo.

481
00:37:43,053 --> 00:37:46,181
Do you think you're
in the same league as us?

482
00:37:47,683 --> 00:37:49,351
You should know your size.

483
00:37:49,851 --> 00:37:53,980
Why do you steal garbage
when asked to clean it?

484
00:37:56,775 --> 00:37:59,653
They got 3 billion
from Hangyul Bank

485
00:37:59,736 --> 00:38:01,862
and 3 million of that went
to Congressman Jang.

486
00:38:01,863 --> 00:38:02,614
What?

487
00:38:02,615 --> 00:38:05,409
The file on the slush fund
of Mirae Motors' chairman.

488
00:38:09,204 --> 00:38:10,288
You bugged me?

489
00:38:10,289 --> 00:38:11,748
You have another copy?

490
00:38:13,208 --> 00:38:14,209
Bring it out.

491
00:38:16,211 --> 00:38:17,254
Cut it here...

492
00:38:17,838 --> 00:38:18,672
Here?

493
00:38:18,673 --> 00:38:20,215
I said here, you blockhead!

494
00:38:21,049 --> 00:38:23,927
You'll have to live
as an idiot from now on.

495
00:38:24,678 --> 00:38:25,720
Jo!

496
00:38:25,721 --> 00:38:29,558
Cut it off and send him
to a psychiatric hospital.

497
00:38:29,641 --> 00:38:33,228
You damn motherfucker!

498
00:38:42,279 --> 00:38:43,488
Hey, hey!

499
00:38:46,575 --> 00:38:49,328
Jo! Stop it!
Please stop it!

500
00:38:49,411 --> 00:38:51,288
Please stop! Please!

501
00:38:55,292 --> 00:38:56,418
Stop it!

502
00:39:05,093 --> 00:39:06,928
How long were you admitted?

503
00:39:07,596 --> 00:39:09,765
I was confined a year and a half.

504
00:39:10,015 --> 00:39:11,850
They administer medicine twice a day.

505
00:39:12,934 --> 00:39:14,436
If you take them

506
00:39:14,686 --> 00:39:16,688
you don't feel hungry
even if you don't eat.

507
00:39:17,606 --> 00:39:19,566
And it makes you sleep all day long.

508
00:39:23,028 --> 00:39:25,072
I thought it was making me an idiot

509
00:39:25,447 --> 00:39:26,907
so I didn't take it anymore.

510
00:39:37,626 --> 00:39:39,336
Goddam fuckers.

511
00:39:39,586 --> 00:39:41,129
How did you escape?

512
00:39:41,421 --> 00:39:43,715
The hospital closed
due to financial difficulties.

513
00:39:43,799 --> 00:39:45,079
So, I walked out the front door.

514
00:39:45,967 --> 00:39:48,512
Are you doing this for revenge?

515
00:39:48,762 --> 00:39:54,309
If this is insinuated as something
sweet like revenge...

516
00:39:55,352 --> 00:39:57,104
it seems a bit too emotional.

517
00:39:59,272 --> 00:40:02,317
What I want is justice.

518
00:40:08,156 --> 00:40:09,741
3 MONTHS AGO

519
00:41:45,045 --> 00:41:47,797
Hey!
Did you wash up the men's room?

520
00:41:49,758 --> 00:41:52,094
Make my golf clubs shine!

521
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:56,098
And don't forget
to clean up the office!

522
00:42:12,822 --> 00:42:13,489
Hey!
Did you wash up the men's room?

523
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:16,326
Hey! Did you wash up the men's room?
Seoul Jungbu Police Station

524
00:42:18,203 --> 00:42:21,039
Make my golf clubs shine!

525
00:42:22,082 --> 00:42:25,294
And don't forget
to clean up the office!

526
00:42:27,712 --> 00:42:29,297
Send

527
00:42:31,591 --> 00:42:34,886
Just e-mailed Ahn's files, sir.

528
00:42:49,985 --> 00:42:52,862
Wow, how about some hot guys?

529
00:42:52,988 --> 00:42:54,155
I'm available, too.

530
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:56,366
I need to pee.

531
00:43:07,877 --> 00:43:08,878
Hey.

532
00:43:09,963 --> 00:43:13,300
I'm in hurry but
the ladies' room is full.

533
00:43:13,675 --> 00:43:15,969
I'll give you a nice tip.
Thank you!

534
00:43:37,949 --> 00:43:39,200
You still look hot.

535
00:43:40,577 --> 00:43:42,954
Well, sure I am.

536
00:43:45,332 --> 00:43:47,375
Do you really have to do that?

537
00:43:48,418 --> 00:43:51,046
If they want me to be an idiot,
I have to be one.

538
00:43:51,171 --> 00:43:52,422
No other options.

539
00:43:52,714 --> 00:43:53,798
Scary.

540
00:43:53,882 --> 00:43:57,344
They took your hand
and now they eavesdrop?

541
00:43:57,427 --> 00:44:00,805
If I'd known, I wouldn't have
ended up like this.

542
00:44:01,222 --> 00:44:02,557
Why did you want to see me?

543
00:44:03,808 --> 00:44:05,225
Let's make a movie.

544
00:44:05,226 --> 00:44:06,186
What's the genre?

545
00:44:06,227 --> 00:44:08,355
Vengeance drama.
Hard boiled.

546
00:44:08,438 --> 00:44:09,731
The target?

547
00:44:12,025 --> 00:44:13,568
Jang Pil-woo.

548
00:44:18,448 --> 00:44:19,658
100,000 in advance.

549
00:44:20,075 --> 00:44:21,408
200,000 balance.

550
00:44:21,409 --> 00:44:23,452
200,000 in advance,
100,000 balance.

551
00:44:23,453 --> 00:44:25,997
Shit... alright then.

552
00:44:27,248 --> 00:44:31,044
Give your profile to Jung first.

553
00:44:31,252 --> 00:44:32,670
Then ask him to book you
at this party.

554
00:44:32,671 --> 00:44:34,004
Am I the only lead?

555
00:44:34,005 --> 00:44:35,674
You think one top would be enough?

556
00:44:35,715 --> 00:44:37,008
Who's my co-lead then?

557
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:39,928
Guy named Park...

558
00:44:40,261 --> 00:44:41,554
You've never met him.

559
00:44:41,846 --> 00:44:43,847
Don't we have to meet?

560
00:44:43,848 --> 00:44:45,600
He thinks he's the only lead.

561
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:48,561
He doesn't know about me?

562
00:44:49,646 --> 00:44:51,272
Who can you trust, anyway?

563
00:44:52,649 --> 00:44:55,402
And you trust me?

564
00:44:58,113 --> 00:45:00,865
You're not the same girl
that you once were.

565
00:45:01,408 --> 00:45:03,034
Take off your sunglasses.

566
00:45:03,076 --> 00:45:05,161
Let's look each other in the eye.

567
00:45:10,417 --> 00:45:14,337
You're dead if you betray me.

568
00:45:26,850 --> 00:45:28,210
How much information is out there?

569
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,185
According to the
Public Prosecutor's Office

570
00:45:30,186 --> 00:45:32,479
six people participated in the mess.

571
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,983
Five graduates and one professor.

572
00:45:35,066 --> 00:45:38,653
Public is criticizing on
issuing an arrest warrant.

573
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:41,406
Why did they have to draw a mouse?
Damn it.

574
00:45:43,158 --> 00:45:44,868
We have our own cover story, yes?

575
00:45:45,118 --> 00:45:48,621
Well, the perspective is somewhat
different with the prosecution office.

576
00:45:48,830 --> 00:45:52,667
Kill ours! Print the article
based on the prosecutor's data.

577
00:45:52,792 --> 00:45:55,169
This time,
we need to play nice with them.

578
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:56,879
You agree with me, don't you?

579
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:00,092
Absolutely.
Company policy is clear.

580
00:46:01,509 --> 00:46:06,263
I'm planning on writing about

581
00:46:06,264 --> 00:46:10,017
the history of creative
and artistic graffiti

582
00:46:10,018 --> 00:46:12,604
and graffiti that concerns
distortion and deception.

583
00:46:12,854 --> 00:46:14,856
That seems okay.

584
00:46:14,939 --> 00:46:16,524
Be on that topic for three papers.

585
00:46:17,484 --> 00:46:18,485
Next.

586
00:46:18,693 --> 00:46:21,821
Rumor is that Bank President Mr. Seok
who fled under embezzlement charges

587
00:46:21,863 --> 00:46:23,363
is coming back.

588
00:46:23,364 --> 00:46:28,536
I heard if he returns
someone will get hurt pretty bad.

589
00:46:29,579 --> 00:46:30,580
Hey.

590
00:46:31,289 --> 00:46:33,708
Get to the point.

591
00:46:33,958 --> 00:46:36,878
While Mr. Seok was the bank president
at Hangyeol Bank

592
00:46:37,170 --> 00:46:40,548
he illegally loaned money
to Mirae Motors.

593
00:46:40,799 --> 00:46:45,512
Also, Congressman Jang put some
pressure on the matter.

594
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:46,888
How did he take?

595
00:46:47,222 --> 00:46:50,016
Mirae Motors received 300 billion
from the bank

596
00:46:50,225 --> 00:46:54,187
and passed on 30 billion to Mr. Jang.

597
00:47:01,236 --> 00:47:02,362
Are you sure?

598
00:47:02,654 --> 00:47:06,825
It came from Congressman Kim's party.

599
00:47:07,534 --> 00:47:09,077
The election is coming up

600
00:47:09,118 --> 00:47:11,079
but his approval rate is decreasing

601
00:47:12,038 --> 00:47:14,415
so he's after anything he can.

602
00:47:14,541 --> 00:47:16,876
I think there's something to it.

603
00:47:17,335 --> 00:47:21,714
I heard reliable info is
posted on social network.

604
00:47:22,006 --> 00:47:24,425
Those keyboard warrior
will post anything

605
00:47:25,009 --> 00:47:26,928
on line without all the facts.

606
00:47:28,263 --> 00:47:31,641
Social network is their playground.

607
00:47:34,769 --> 00:47:37,105
What will become of this country...

608
00:47:40,108 --> 00:47:44,028
Newspaper is the public air.
Focus on the facts.

609
00:47:45,446 --> 00:47:47,740
Don't go crazy like those mad dogs

610
00:47:49,784 --> 00:47:51,452
who are worthless.

611
00:48:08,970 --> 00:48:11,139
The spear is pointing toward
the inner circle.

612
00:48:12,265 --> 00:48:15,185
Even Prosecutor's office seems to
take Mr. Kim's side.

613
00:48:15,810 --> 00:48:18,313
You want to switch rides?

614
00:48:19,522 --> 00:48:22,400
We've came till the end of the line
so why not?

615
00:48:24,152 --> 00:48:25,528
During that time

616
00:48:25,945 --> 00:48:29,156
we ran the red light, oversped
and the driver has no license.

617
00:48:29,157 --> 00:48:30,450
What's the problem?

618
00:48:33,661 --> 00:48:37,290
If Seok Myung-kwan comes back here
Congressman Jang won't have a choice.

619
00:48:41,127 --> 00:48:42,503
Hey, Reporter Kim.

620
00:48:43,671 --> 00:48:47,008
Who do you think put
you in that chair?

621
00:48:49,844 --> 00:48:53,973
You think I'm working for
Jang Pil-woo like an idiot?

622
00:48:54,933 --> 00:48:59,187
You won't be sitting there
with Mirae Motors.

623
00:48:59,896 --> 00:49:03,024
Nation Daily won't exist
without Mirae Motors commercials.

624
00:49:04,359 --> 00:49:05,944
Am I wrong?

625
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:13,660
If Jang Pil-woo is arrested
Mirae Motors is gone as well.

626
00:49:13,826 --> 00:49:18,414
Chairman Oh can always drive away
on a different engine.

627
00:49:18,748 --> 00:49:22,752
But who would drive a car
that's been wasted.

628
00:49:25,046 --> 00:49:28,383
We're not trying to
protect Jang's life

629
00:49:28,466 --> 00:49:32,220
we're saving Mirae Motors
for our sake.

630
00:49:33,930 --> 00:49:35,890
Is your little brain getting all this?

631
00:49:41,312 --> 00:49:42,480
I'm sorry.

632
00:49:42,814 --> 00:49:44,524
I should have thought deeper.

633
00:49:45,984 --> 00:49:48,778
Come on,
you're making me uncomfortable.

634
00:49:49,988 --> 00:49:54,742
This is for us both
so no hard feelings, okay?

635
00:49:56,244 --> 00:49:57,328
Good luck.

636
00:49:59,664 --> 00:50:00,915
No problem.

637
00:50:02,709 --> 00:50:05,712
Good luck to us both.
No problem at all.

638
00:50:10,216 --> 00:50:15,096
By the way,
Seok will come back soon enough.

639
00:50:15,263 --> 00:50:17,807
Oh my, what to do then?

640
00:50:18,224 --> 00:50:19,392
What other way is there?

641
00:50:19,434 --> 00:50:22,437
The guilty one should be
punished by the law.

642
00:50:23,521 --> 00:50:26,065
That's a just society, isn't it?

643
00:50:43,207 --> 00:50:46,669
My finish is poor.

644
00:50:47,462 --> 00:50:48,963
The ball won't go far.

645
00:50:49,005 --> 00:50:51,298
I see.
Maybe it's the golf club.

646
00:50:51,299 --> 00:50:54,469
Would you like to try my
Honma golf club set in my car?

647
00:50:54,552 --> 00:50:56,429
I own a Honma gold club as well.

648
00:50:57,221 --> 00:50:58,973
It's a five star...

649
00:51:02,143 --> 00:51:03,603
Five star?

650
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:07,315
So, how's working for Nation Monthly?

651
00:51:07,815 --> 00:51:09,692
I was better off at Nation Daily.

652
00:51:09,776 --> 00:51:12,153
Nation Monthly is just
Nation Daily's pawn.

653
00:51:12,612 --> 00:51:15,698
Then, why receive bribe money
for writing an article?

654
00:51:16,032 --> 00:51:18,493
No reporter writes
for nothing these days.

655
00:51:20,995 --> 00:51:21,996
I'm sorry, sir.

656
00:51:23,831 --> 00:51:25,499
You still have access to
the Public Prosecution's Office?

657
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:28,669
Of course. I make a living by
sucking up to them.

658
00:51:28,836 --> 00:51:30,463
Anything I can do for you?

659
00:51:31,172 --> 00:51:33,382
I heard they are targeting Jang?

660
00:51:33,466 --> 00:51:36,010
Yes, they don't have any proof.
They're just fishing.

661
00:51:36,177 --> 00:51:37,177
Who's fishing?

662
00:51:37,470 --> 00:51:39,847
Woo Jang-hoon, he belongs to
the Special Investigations.

663
00:51:39,972 --> 00:51:41,515
He's kind of an asshole.

664
00:51:41,516 --> 00:51:42,850
Who's in charge there?

665
00:51:42,934 --> 00:51:45,913
Chief prosecutor Choi Chung-sik.
He's on the District Chief Prosecutor's side.

666
00:51:45,937 --> 00:51:47,706
So he's on the President
for Civil Affairs line.

667
00:51:47,730 --> 00:51:49,482
Yes, he's on Kim Seok-woo's side.

668
00:51:49,816 --> 00:51:51,442
Where's Mr. Woo's hometown?

669
00:51:51,526 --> 00:51:52,735
He's from Gyeongsang-do.

670
00:51:52,985 --> 00:51:53,736
Is he a purebred?

671
00:51:53,737 --> 00:51:55,696
No, he's a mutt.

672
00:51:56,364 --> 00:51:59,534
He's quite competent
but he has no connections.

673
00:51:59,617 --> 00:52:00,617
What's he like?

674
00:52:00,618 --> 00:52:03,204
He's fucked up.

675
00:52:03,454 --> 00:52:05,014
He doesn't get along
with the Reporters.

676
00:52:05,039 --> 00:52:06,207
He's an arrogant asshole.

677
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:16,217
Oh, great...

678
00:52:16,384 --> 00:52:18,386
It's a five star.

679
00:52:19,095 --> 00:52:20,388
- Hey, Ko.
- Yes, sir.

680
00:52:20,721 --> 00:52:22,640
You should rejoin Nation Daily
shouldn't you?

681
00:52:22,974 --> 00:52:24,976
I'll do anything if you
take me back.

682
00:52:25,393 --> 00:52:28,812
So, that means I can ask you a favor?

683
00:52:28,813 --> 00:52:31,482
Yes, of course.
I'll do anything for you.

684
00:52:31,566 --> 00:52:35,111
Have a drink with Woo Jang-hoon.

685
00:52:35,361 --> 00:52:36,362
Pardon?

686
00:52:39,782 --> 00:52:40,782
Great!

687
00:52:44,579 --> 00:52:47,415
Park Jong-pal
Moon Sash

688
00:53:11,272 --> 00:53:12,648
These are all clean.

689
00:53:13,024 --> 00:53:15,108
You're contributing to a big cause.
Song Man-seop
Jang Pil-woo's Campaign Club

690
00:53:15,109 --> 00:53:17,903
I'm just doing what I enjoy.

691
00:53:23,784 --> 00:53:26,620
Song is Jang's Campaign Club president

692
00:53:26,662 --> 00:53:28,622
and also the Representative
of River Construction.

693
00:53:28,706 --> 00:53:31,292
Their main business is
redeveloping new towns.

694
00:53:32,126 --> 00:53:35,129
Jang's second brother-in-law
is a board member.

695
00:53:36,631 --> 00:53:37,882
Who is this guy?

696
00:53:38,257 --> 00:53:40,968
He's a representative at Moon Sash
which produces sash.

697
00:53:41,302 --> 00:53:42,845
They are meeting quite frequently.

698
00:53:44,305 --> 00:53:47,225
Look into this
Moon Sash company for now.

699
00:53:47,516 --> 00:53:50,353
I'm sure it has connections
with Jang Pil-woo.

700
00:53:50,645 --> 00:53:51,645
Okay.

701
00:53:53,231 --> 00:53:54,440
But...

702
00:53:56,317 --> 00:53:59,487
they're quite powerful people.
Can we really catch them?

703
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:02,156
We might take the fall
if we mess with them.

704
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:04,909
Our request for the expense
is being delayed.

705
00:54:05,534 --> 00:54:08,621
How on earth can we investigate?
Damn it!

706
00:54:09,121 --> 00:54:10,164
Mr. Bang.

707
00:54:10,665 --> 00:54:11,499
Yes?

708
00:54:11,540 --> 00:54:13,334
You think I'm a loser, don't you?

709
00:54:15,419 --> 00:54:18,339
I mean, I have no connections

710
00:54:18,631 --> 00:54:21,133
but shows up trying to do something
at my age...

711
00:54:22,426 --> 00:54:24,053
You like dogs?

712
00:54:25,096 --> 00:54:25,930
Yes, I do.

713
00:54:25,931 --> 00:54:27,765
Not when it's cooked.

714
00:54:28,933 --> 00:54:33,187
Why don't we quit this bull shit
and raise dogs in the countryside?

715
00:54:35,898 --> 00:54:37,525
You don't get it, do you?

716
00:54:38,317 --> 00:54:39,693
What I'm saying is

717
00:54:39,694 --> 00:54:43,239
go out there and try bringing back
something useful.

718
00:54:43,322 --> 00:54:45,866
If you don't wanna end up
cleaning dog shit!

719
00:54:46,075 --> 00:54:47,075
Okay...

720
00:55:01,882 --> 00:55:03,217
Why are you still here?

721
00:55:04,885 --> 00:55:05,928
Yes, anything useful...

722
00:55:25,239 --> 00:55:26,407
Did you have lunch?

723
00:55:27,033 --> 00:55:28,242
Not yet, boss.

724
00:55:28,534 --> 00:55:29,660
Come join me.

725
00:55:29,702 --> 00:55:31,537
No thanks, help yourself.

726
00:55:32,830 --> 00:55:35,833
You don't want to eat
something cooked by a cripple?

727
00:55:36,042 --> 00:55:38,502
Not at all, sir!
It's just...

728
00:55:39,045 --> 00:55:40,963
It doesn't seem enough for you.

729
00:55:41,088 --> 00:55:43,215
Food is meant to be shared.
Come on.

730
00:55:45,217 --> 00:55:46,217
Yes, boss.

731
00:55:52,850 --> 00:55:53,851
Take this.

732
00:55:55,102 --> 00:55:56,270
Thank you.

733
00:55:58,814 --> 00:55:59,982
Have some kimchi, too.

734
00:56:07,698 --> 00:56:08,699
How are things going?

735
00:56:08,866 --> 00:56:11,911
Gave them five big ones today.

736
00:56:12,203 --> 00:56:13,621
Try to meet up with Jang directly.

737
00:56:13,954 --> 00:56:16,082
Guess they must be
done poking around.

738
00:56:16,624 --> 00:56:20,461
They promised a meeting
with Jang soon.

739
00:56:22,671 --> 00:56:25,799
This is clean.

740
00:56:25,925 --> 00:56:27,301
Impossible to track down.

741
00:56:41,816 --> 00:56:45,611
Moon Sash wouldn't approach
Jang for a small bit of profit.

742
00:56:46,153 --> 00:56:50,491
And why would Jang be connected
to that small company for a few pennies?

743
00:56:51,283 --> 00:56:53,828
What are their connections?

744
00:56:58,916 --> 00:57:01,460
This is Ahn Sang-goo,
started from a small gang,

745
00:57:01,502 --> 00:57:03,421
and made it big enough
to be called 'president'.

746
00:57:03,671 --> 00:57:04,588
He's a mobster?

747
00:57:04,672 --> 00:57:05,423
Yes.

748
00:57:05,506 --> 00:57:06,858
Also I did some background checks.

749
00:57:06,882 --> 00:57:10,886
In 1996, he was jailed
for bribing TV producers.

750
00:57:10,928 --> 00:57:13,305
Does he have ties with
the entertainment business?

751
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:15,850
This is big.

752
00:57:15,975 --> 00:57:21,272
Everything from construction, loans,
talent agency, night clubs, to hostess bars.

753
00:57:21,647 --> 00:57:26,318
He's also suspected of
interfering in elections.

754
00:57:26,485 --> 00:57:29,864
So, his jail time for bribery
was to cover that up?

755
00:57:30,197 --> 00:57:32,074
Sure.

756
00:57:32,867 --> 00:57:35,453
Also, the Moon Sash guy
was Ahn's henchman.

757
00:57:35,953 --> 00:57:37,538
About No. 3 in the gang.

758
00:57:37,872 --> 00:57:41,750
Then how'd he become a cripple?

759
00:57:43,335 --> 00:57:46,255
For that, he must have
upset someone...

760
00:57:46,297 --> 00:57:47,548
quite a bit.

761
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:48,840
Who?

762
00:57:49,675 --> 00:57:56,223
Political thug who once rode high
reaches out to Jang through his henchman.

763
00:57:58,058 --> 00:57:59,935
Don't you smell something?

764
00:58:00,102 --> 00:58:01,228
Sure do.

765
00:58:02,897 --> 00:58:06,358
If it's normal business,
he can just bribe discreetly.

766
00:58:06,734 --> 00:58:09,487
His methods seem different.

767
00:58:10,237 --> 00:58:12,823
Why does everything
have to be so secret?

768
00:58:14,742 --> 00:58:16,243
You scumbags.

769
00:58:20,331 --> 00:58:22,333
They're setting a trap for Jang!

770
00:58:47,107 --> 00:58:49,527
In Korea the prosecutor,

771
00:58:49,944 --> 00:58:52,947
in order to serve justice,
should be solitary.

772
00:58:52,988 --> 00:58:54,281
Absolutely right.

773
00:58:54,406 --> 00:58:55,741
Extremely lonely.

774
00:58:57,451 --> 00:58:59,245
I was one of them.

775
00:58:59,787 --> 00:59:01,205
When was it...?

776
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:05,793
In 1990, when the president
declared the war against crime,

777
00:59:07,086 --> 00:59:09,380
I brought in tons of them!

778
00:59:10,673 --> 00:59:12,675
Gangsters who run casinos,

779
00:59:13,050 --> 00:59:16,136
and the sons of bitches
paid off by those fuckers...

780
00:59:17,054 --> 00:59:19,815
It turned out the head of our office
was one of those sons of bitches.

781
00:59:21,725 --> 00:59:23,477
So what did you do?

782
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:25,312
Fuck the title.

783
00:59:25,646 --> 00:59:29,358
I was a lone, righteous man.
I dragged him in, too!

784
00:59:30,568 --> 00:59:31,819
Of course, you did!

785
00:59:33,112 --> 00:59:34,738
Don't mix the drinks!

786
00:59:35,948 --> 00:59:37,157
Why did you call me?

787
00:59:37,491 --> 00:59:41,161
It's been a while
since we met and had a drink.

788
00:59:41,620 --> 00:59:43,496
You said you had
vital information,

789
00:59:43,497 --> 00:59:45,582
so why are you only drinking?

790
00:59:45,583 --> 00:59:49,253
If you just want to drink,
you should say, "Let's drink."

791
00:59:49,336 --> 00:59:52,256
Then you'd have gladly offered
to buy me a drink?

792
00:59:52,715 --> 00:59:57,135
What's gotten into you?
It's not like we never drink.

793
00:59:57,136 --> 00:59:58,512
Just drink up.

794
00:59:59,763 --> 01:00:03,684
But can you be a Supreme Prosecutor
with no connections?

795
01:00:04,143 --> 01:00:08,606
You should pass through there
to end your career in Seoul.

796
01:00:08,647 --> 01:00:10,357
Or you end up
in a remote province.

797
01:00:11,817 --> 01:00:17,364
So? Why are you explaining
shit that everybody knows?

798
01:00:17,448 --> 01:00:19,491
I worry about you, that's all.

799
01:00:19,908 --> 01:00:20,950
You have no connections...

800
01:00:20,951 --> 01:00:23,829
So you're explaining to me that
I'm a fucker with no connections?

801
01:00:24,038 --> 01:00:25,974
You're not a fucker,
you just have no connections.

802
01:00:25,998 --> 01:00:28,375
What the fuck
are you doing now?

803
01:00:28,417 --> 01:00:32,212
Take it easy, man...
Don't be so sensitive.

804
01:00:32,796 --> 01:00:33,796
It's pathetic.

805
01:00:33,797 --> 01:00:35,382
Goddamn it.

806
01:00:37,009 --> 01:00:39,136
Alright, here he comes.

807
01:00:40,095 --> 01:00:41,220
It's been a while, sir.

808
01:00:41,221 --> 01:00:45,893
This is Prosecutor Woo
from Seoul Prosecutors' Office.

809
01:00:46,185 --> 01:00:48,562
This is Mr. Jo, the owner of
Joyang Mirae Development.

810
01:00:48,604 --> 01:00:50,981
Nice to meet you,
I'm Jo Yang-sik.

811
01:00:51,065 --> 01:00:54,902
Sure, nice to meet you.
Have a seat.

812
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:02,743
Please give me a minute, sir.

813
01:01:07,414 --> 01:01:09,708
I know, I know, I know!

814
01:01:09,917 --> 01:01:12,502
Look at me,
it's not what you think.

815
01:01:12,503 --> 01:01:14,505
It's just a friendly drink together.

816
01:01:14,630 --> 01:01:16,798
No harm in knowing
a man like him.

817
01:01:16,799 --> 01:01:19,258
You can get an allowance,
then later...

818
01:01:19,259 --> 01:01:21,553
Maybe he can get you connected?

819
01:01:21,595 --> 01:01:23,263
You motherfucker!

820
01:01:23,472 --> 01:01:26,433
Hey Go Sang-chul, you got
fired from Nation Daily for bribery.

821
01:01:26,809 --> 01:01:31,438
Want to get fired from your life
for messing with a prosecutor?

822
01:01:31,897 --> 01:01:36,151
I paid for what I drank,
don't claim otherwise later.

823
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:39,613
Damn fucker.

824
01:01:42,825 --> 01:01:44,034
Take care!

825
01:01:45,285 --> 01:01:48,247
He really is a son of a bitch.

826
01:02:05,597 --> 01:02:06,432
Talk to me.

827
01:02:06,473 --> 01:02:08,891
They went into a building.
Place seems a bit suspicious.

828
01:02:08,892 --> 01:02:09,934
How long have they been there?

829
01:02:09,935 --> 01:02:13,063
About two hours?
And we have a new face tonight.

830
01:02:13,147 --> 01:02:14,398
A new face?

831
01:02:16,817 --> 01:02:19,319
So, what did you do then?

832
01:02:19,403 --> 01:02:22,114
They wanted me to quit,
so what could I do?

833
01:02:22,239 --> 01:02:24,867
I left without regret!

834
01:02:25,033 --> 01:02:29,163
And opened a private practice,
laying low... until that man there

835
01:02:29,371 --> 01:02:31,540
got me into Congress.
Welcome, my friend!

836
01:02:33,375 --> 01:02:36,295
Our Congressman
seems a bit soaked.

837
01:02:36,336 --> 01:02:38,172
I haven't had that much.

838
01:02:38,756 --> 01:02:39,922
Let me introduce you.

839
01:02:39,923 --> 01:02:43,927
This is Park Jong-pal,
president of Moon Sash.

840
01:02:44,011 --> 01:02:48,307
Same name as the old boxer
who had a strong hook.

841
01:02:48,515 --> 01:02:50,809
Honor to meet you, sir.
I'm Park Jong-pal.

842
01:02:59,026 --> 01:03:00,694
Did you take in a lot?

843
01:03:01,153 --> 01:03:02,863
A few bomb shots...

844
01:03:03,155 --> 01:03:04,406
I don't mean alcohol.

845
01:03:04,907 --> 01:03:07,534
I don't know.
Song takes care of it.

846
01:03:08,076 --> 01:03:11,622
Better be careful,
you could get in trouble.

847
01:03:13,624 --> 01:03:15,167
Then what should I do?

848
01:03:15,918 --> 01:03:18,045
A campaign sucks up money.

849
01:03:18,629 --> 01:03:22,800
Oh closed his wallet because of
Seok, that son of a bitch.

850
01:03:23,717 --> 01:03:25,677
How else do I get elected?

851
01:03:27,262 --> 01:03:29,139
Let's bring him in.

852
01:03:29,765 --> 01:03:31,141
And then?

853
01:03:31,725 --> 01:03:33,894
If there's something to settle,

854
01:03:34,061 --> 01:03:37,564
let's settle it before it's too late.

855
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:58,793
Seok Myung-kwan
Former President of Hangyul Bank

856
01:03:58,794 --> 01:04:03,590
I'm deeply sorry for causing
so much anxiety to the nation.
Seok Myung-kwan
Former Pres/dent of Hangyul Bank

857
01:04:05,300 --> 01:04:07,511
Any comments on
the charges against you?

858
01:04:08,804 --> 01:04:11,806
Former president of Hangyul Bank
was charged with embezzlement,

859
01:04:11,807 --> 01:04:15,017
malpractice, and
flight of capital abroad

860
01:04:15,018 --> 01:04:17,396
based on the Additional Law
on Specific Crimes.

861
01:04:17,437 --> 01:04:20,274
He reported to the
Prosecutors' Office at 9:30 am.

862
01:04:24,278 --> 01:04:26,280
Wake up.

863
01:04:27,614 --> 01:04:30,450
Call me in ten minutes, sharp.

864
01:04:34,121 --> 01:04:37,958
Mirae must've offered you
a position in the group.

865
01:04:38,125 --> 01:04:40,127
President of an affiliate company?

866
01:04:40,711 --> 01:04:47,134
Nope, a big chunk of land
under the name of your son.

867
01:04:48,135 --> 01:04:50,637
I got it right!

868
01:04:50,971 --> 01:04:52,097
Look.

869
01:04:53,307 --> 01:04:57,769
They offered a presidential
pardon in a year, right?

870
01:04:58,312 --> 01:05:04,318
But what if...
Jang doesn't win the primary?

871
01:05:05,402 --> 01:05:09,239
Oops, what'll you do then?
Did you think about that?

872
01:05:11,241 --> 01:05:12,993
Listen to me, Mr. Seok.

873
01:05:13,911 --> 01:05:17,247
I'm not pushing you into a corner.

874
01:05:17,497 --> 01:05:19,249
Shit, who's calling?

875
01:05:22,002 --> 01:05:23,002
Excuse me.

876
01:05:24,588 --> 01:05:25,756
How did it go?

877
01:05:25,964 --> 01:05:27,674
You wanted me to call you.

878
01:05:27,841 --> 01:05:28,884
Oh, yeah?

879
01:05:29,051 --> 01:05:31,762
Prepare the documents and
request a warrant right away.

880
01:05:32,012 --> 01:05:33,513
Whose warrant?

881
01:05:38,352 --> 01:05:41,063
If Jang loses the primary,

882
01:05:41,188 --> 01:05:43,607
naturally there'll be no pardon.

883
01:05:44,775 --> 01:05:49,154
Then you're fine with
spending 10 years in prison?

884
01:05:52,616 --> 01:05:54,701
You know Moon from Mirae Motors?

885
01:05:55,535 --> 01:05:57,788
He was their accounting manager?

886
01:05:59,247 --> 01:06:04,002
He was about to hand me
the slush fund files 2 years ago.

887
01:06:04,461 --> 01:06:09,216
But Jang and
Oh had a hunting dog

888
01:06:09,549 --> 01:06:11,593
to intercept it before I got it.

889
01:06:12,219 --> 01:06:17,224
So I sowed, and they reaped.
Motherfuckers...

890
01:06:18,225 --> 01:06:22,896
But you know what?

891
01:06:26,733 --> 01:06:31,071
Moon had another copy
of the files.

892
01:06:32,239 --> 01:06:34,574
That's what
that phone call was about.

893
01:06:35,075 --> 01:06:36,410
Most importantly...

894
01:06:37,494 --> 01:06:42,332
someone's going to
give me that copy. Why?

895
01:06:43,458 --> 01:06:46,420
He wants me
to get Jang and Oh,

896
01:06:47,587 --> 01:06:50,507
those sons of bitches.

897
01:06:55,345 --> 01:06:57,264
You must have
something to say now.

898
01:07:02,686 --> 01:07:03,770
Okay then...

899
01:07:05,439 --> 01:07:07,607
You can take the fall

900
01:07:07,941 --> 01:07:10,527
and spend the ten years...

901
01:07:10,694 --> 01:07:11,694
in prison.

902
01:07:14,406 --> 01:07:17,242
Bravo, bravo.

903
01:07:25,584 --> 01:07:28,128
Look, Mr. Seok Myung-kwan.

904
01:07:31,757 --> 01:07:33,633
If you cooperate

905
01:07:34,009 --> 01:07:35,177
I'll reduce your sentence

906
01:07:36,887 --> 01:07:38,972
into five years.

907
01:07:49,024 --> 01:07:50,692
He almost cracked.

908
01:07:57,949 --> 01:08:00,952
Hope this may help
your wise decision, sir.

909
01:08:25,602 --> 01:08:27,312
It's been delivered?

910
01:08:27,479 --> 01:08:30,899
Yes, I think he fully understood.

911
01:08:31,108 --> 01:08:36,029
He's such a softie,
must've been shocked.

912
01:08:38,198 --> 01:08:39,658
But what can we do?

913
01:08:40,283 --> 01:08:42,035
Someone must be held responsible.

914
01:08:51,419 --> 01:08:53,255
Deadline is coming up.

915
01:08:56,633 --> 01:09:00,470
When will you finish writing?

916
01:09:04,850 --> 01:09:06,268
You seem concerned.

917
01:09:06,434 --> 01:09:09,229
Obvious concerns my age men have.

918
01:09:10,730 --> 01:09:14,192
Concerns for children
and stock trading

919
01:09:17,237 --> 01:09:18,446
plus, lovers.

920
01:09:21,032 --> 01:09:22,826
Something is really bothering you.

921
01:09:23,160 --> 01:09:26,538
Since your kids are all married
and you don't have any stocks

922
01:09:26,872 --> 01:09:28,665
and also no lover.

923
01:09:31,626 --> 01:09:32,669
What are you working on?

924
01:09:32,752 --> 01:09:35,005
I haven't finished writing it yet.

925
01:09:36,590 --> 01:09:38,633
I'm getting hungry after writing a bit.

926
01:09:38,925 --> 01:09:42,721
Let's get something to eat.

927
01:09:43,513 --> 01:09:45,724
Oh my, an article isn't
like a weather forecast...

928
01:09:46,808 --> 01:09:47,892
No way...

929
01:09:54,524 --> 01:09:56,192
Former president of Hankyul Bank
Seok commits suicide!

930
01:09:56,193 --> 01:09:58,110
Prosecution's forced interrogation
caused the tragedy

931
01:09:58,111 --> 01:09:59,445
Around 9:30 am on the 17th

932
01:09:59,446 --> 01:10:01,846
while being questioned on
embezzlement, slush fund charges...

933
01:10:43,615 --> 01:10:47,452
Did you force him or threaten him
during interrogation?

934
01:10:48,745 --> 01:10:50,121
Answer the question.

935
01:10:58,838 --> 01:11:00,131
Prosecutor Wu.

936
01:11:00,340 --> 01:11:03,843
You've brought shame to
the whole office.

937
01:11:04,219 --> 01:11:05,887
You know what that means?

938
01:11:09,391 --> 01:11:12,936
Damn it.
You're really an arrogant bastard.

939
01:11:13,937 --> 01:11:17,190
Shouldn't you at least
feel sorry about this?

940
01:11:21,861 --> 01:11:25,365
Supreme Prosecutor's Office
is a joke to you?

941
01:11:25,657 --> 01:11:27,742
You wanna be targeted
and be stripped?

942
01:11:27,826 --> 01:11:32,122
Yes, I get it. Calm down.

943
01:11:36,376 --> 01:11:41,176
Seok commits suicide due to forced
interrogation from the Prosecutor's Office!
- Lee Kang-hee Nation Daily Editor in Chief

944
01:12:00,358 --> 01:12:01,735
It sucks, right?

945
01:12:05,363 --> 01:12:06,740
Have you eaten?

946
01:12:10,076 --> 01:12:12,495
Take a few days off.
Have something to eat.

947
01:12:13,955 --> 01:12:15,498
So you want to call it quits?

948
01:12:16,583 --> 01:12:17,917
What else can we do?

949
01:12:18,668 --> 01:12:20,962
Open the coffin and
cross-examine the dead?

950
01:12:23,423 --> 01:12:26,593
I begged to the Inspection Dept.
to save you from suspension.

951
01:12:27,677 --> 01:12:29,095
So take some days off.

952
01:12:31,014 --> 01:12:32,307
And then?

953
01:12:33,266 --> 01:12:36,811
You want to send me
to some provincial office?

954
01:12:37,145 --> 01:12:40,190
How convenient to blame
the guy with no connections!

955
01:12:40,774 --> 01:12:42,107
Are you rebelling against me?

956
01:12:42,108 --> 01:12:44,026
Have I ever done that?

957
01:12:44,027 --> 01:12:46,446
So just do what I tell you.

958
01:12:46,529 --> 01:12:47,530
Why?

959
01:12:47,739 --> 01:12:49,783
Did Jang offer you a position?

960
01:12:50,075 --> 01:12:51,701
The Prosecutor General?

961
01:12:56,414 --> 01:13:00,251
Korean prosecutors,
we do as we're told.

962
01:13:02,712 --> 01:13:05,882
It's time to let him go.

963
01:13:18,478 --> 01:13:20,397
Thank you for calling me, sir.

964
01:13:21,106 --> 01:13:23,108
You came a long way.

965
01:13:24,150 --> 01:13:25,610
Introduce yourselves.

966
01:13:29,823 --> 01:13:32,075
I'm Lee Gang-hee from Nation Daily.

967
01:13:32,325 --> 01:13:35,120
Big fan of your column.
I'm Oh Myung-hwan.

968
01:13:35,912 --> 01:13:38,873
It's been a while, Mr. Secretary.

969
01:13:39,374 --> 01:13:42,335
So you're done prying into me?

970
01:13:42,710 --> 01:13:43,837
How are you, sir?

971
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:47,257
No, it's a misunderstanding!
How could I dare do that?

972
01:13:47,841 --> 01:13:50,759
It turns out that some nobody
with no connections

973
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:53,721
caused all this trouble,
to make a name for himself.

974
01:13:54,013 --> 01:13:57,642
We're sending him to the provinces,
so he'll never bother you again.

975
01:13:59,561 --> 01:14:00,812
I'll count on you.

976
01:14:03,314 --> 01:14:05,525
Thank you, sir.
Anytime.

977
01:14:07,694 --> 01:14:10,697
Sir, you're still in action.

978
01:14:10,780 --> 01:14:12,782
You're always on the job.

979
01:14:13,867 --> 01:14:15,785
That's what politics is.

980
01:14:15,952 --> 01:14:18,037
You never grow old.

981
01:14:18,371 --> 01:14:19,372
That's right.

982
01:14:19,706 --> 01:14:21,624
All those hotshots in politics

983
01:14:21,708 --> 01:14:25,378
grow so old the moment they retire.

984
01:14:25,587 --> 01:14:27,005
It's quite interesting.

985
01:14:27,338 --> 01:14:30,467
Desire for power, honor and sex...

986
01:14:30,717 --> 01:14:33,178
Those desires are
what keeps you young.

987
01:14:33,386 --> 01:14:34,929
- Is that so?
- Yes!

988
01:14:35,638 --> 01:14:38,099
Lichtenberg said something like this.

989
01:14:38,766 --> 01:14:43,396
Less the desire
the happier you become...

990
01:14:44,898 --> 01:14:46,649
Which is total bullshit.

991
01:14:48,109 --> 01:14:49,402
I totally agree.

992
01:14:49,736 --> 01:14:54,157
Investigations done by those
who haven't had real power is bullshit.

993
01:14:54,574 --> 01:14:57,243
Yes, that's why we live young.

994
01:14:57,327 --> 01:14:58,411
You're right.

995
01:15:00,121 --> 01:15:01,039
Let's get started!

996
01:15:01,040 --> 01:15:03,415
Sure, let's drink!
Prepare your driver.

997
01:15:03,416 --> 01:15:07,712
We'll have to check
the newcomer's club first.

998
01:15:07,921 --> 01:15:10,590
Great! Well said!
Let's do that.

999
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:12,550
- Here, here.
- Let's go!

1000
01:15:14,260 --> 01:15:15,470
So the party is set?

1001
01:15:15,595 --> 01:15:16,930
This Saturday.

1002
01:15:17,055 --> 01:15:20,225
Park, it's time
to wind up the clock.

1003
01:15:20,892 --> 01:15:23,895
Excellent.
I'll make sure to deliver it to him.

1004
01:15:23,978 --> 01:15:24,771
Thank you.

1005
01:15:24,772 --> 01:15:26,022
Girls, take your seats.

1006
01:15:27,106 --> 01:15:31,736
His club is said to be the hardest
among the presidential staff.

1007
01:15:31,778 --> 01:15:35,573
Is it?
We'll definitely have to see that.

1008
01:15:35,990 --> 01:15:39,244
My friend should be turned on
very quickly tonight.

1009
01:15:39,577 --> 01:15:41,371
It's your jackpot day, buddy.

1010
01:15:50,380 --> 01:15:52,966
Why don't you get some sleep?

1011
01:15:55,134 --> 01:15:57,303
That's what I do at home.

1012
01:16:20,451 --> 01:16:21,451
Hello.

1013
01:16:21,661 --> 01:16:23,329
Sir, this is Go.

1014
01:16:23,371 --> 01:16:25,872
I dug into Moon Sash
as you asked.

1015
01:16:25,873 --> 01:16:27,333
What did you get?

1016
01:16:27,667 --> 01:16:30,336
The company is only 3 months old.

1017
01:16:30,461 --> 01:16:32,422
It's run by a former gangster.

1018
01:16:34,132 --> 01:16:35,258
A gangster?

1019
01:16:35,341 --> 01:16:38,469
He was the No. 3
in Ahn Sang-goo's gang.

1020
01:16:39,012 --> 01:16:40,513
Ahn Sang-goo's gang?

1021
01:16:41,681 --> 01:16:45,476
Park was Ahn's henchman?

1022
01:16:57,071 --> 01:16:59,866
This is Lee Kang-hee at Nation Daily,
the head of politics department.

1023
01:17:00,867 --> 01:17:02,076
I am Ahn Sang-goo.

1024
01:17:02,910 --> 01:17:05,246
There's a new gang
organization in town.

1025
01:17:05,538 --> 01:17:06,998
He's the boss.

1026
01:17:08,499 --> 01:17:09,876
He looks young.

1027
01:17:10,877 --> 01:17:12,795
He's a very smart kid.

1028
01:17:14,255 --> 01:17:17,759
If a gang is also smart

1029
01:17:18,217 --> 01:17:19,677
he may become trouble, no?

1030
01:17:19,719 --> 01:17:21,596
I'm not that smart.

1031
01:17:23,681 --> 01:17:27,727
I look forward some great help
from him on the presidential election.

1032
01:17:27,769 --> 01:17:29,437
It's a new beginning for me

1033
01:17:29,604 --> 01:17:31,314
so I will do my best.

1034
01:17:38,321 --> 01:17:39,405
Take it.

1035
01:18:39,632 --> 01:18:42,427
Loosen up and keep your head down.

1036
01:18:42,510 --> 01:18:43,803
Follow the ball.

1037
01:18:50,143 --> 01:18:51,978
I'm just warming up.

1038
01:19:14,459 --> 01:19:16,002
Address the ball...

1039
01:19:19,922 --> 01:19:23,092
This tiny ball is playing hard to get.

1040
01:19:24,927 --> 01:19:28,681
You need to loosen up
and look at the ball.

1041
01:19:29,015 --> 01:19:30,641
I think I see the ball.

1042
01:19:31,642 --> 01:19:35,062
Loosen your grip and watch the ball.

1043
01:19:36,314 --> 01:19:38,608
Only then,
you will get what you want.

1044
01:19:51,537 --> 01:19:55,208
Take the GED exam
and go to any college.

1045
01:19:57,585 --> 01:19:59,128
I'm far from studying.

1046
01:20:02,882 --> 01:20:04,383
Why did you become a gangster?

1047
01:20:04,801 --> 01:20:06,761
Well...

1048
01:20:07,512 --> 01:20:09,889
That's the road went
after I came to Seoul.

1049
01:20:09,931 --> 01:20:12,934
You will live like a punk?

1050
01:20:17,730 --> 01:20:20,566
You came to me to succeed, right?

1051
01:20:26,948 --> 01:20:31,869
You think you can do
whatever I tell you?

1052
01:20:34,038 --> 01:20:38,000
I'll follow you nicely
if you lead me well.

1053
01:21:01,315 --> 01:21:02,649
Bring in the girls after 10 minutes.

1054
01:21:02,650 --> 01:21:03,650
Yes, sir.

1055
01:21:15,121 --> 01:21:16,247
Sang-goo.

1056
01:21:17,957 --> 01:21:20,001
Prosecutor's Office is no joke.

1057
01:21:20,459 --> 01:21:24,881
They're after illegal election activities.

1058
01:21:25,131 --> 01:21:27,967
They'll know what we did for them.

1059
01:21:28,843 --> 01:21:30,887
I'm sure they won't arrest us.

1060
01:21:31,304 --> 01:21:33,973
The opposite party is the problem.

1061
01:21:34,140 --> 01:21:35,558
If I go to jail...

1062
01:21:36,309 --> 01:21:40,354
this party has a lot to lose as well...

1063
01:21:40,771 --> 01:21:44,942
Why don't you take the fall
for offering bribery.

1064
01:21:46,235 --> 01:21:47,778
Trust Jang Pil-woo.

1065
01:21:48,696 --> 01:21:51,407
He won't overlook you.

1066
01:22:02,668 --> 01:22:06,839
I don't give a shit about Jang.
I only work for you.

1067
01:22:12,511 --> 01:22:14,430
My connections are
also your connections.

1068
01:22:39,121 --> 01:22:40,163
How was the party?

1069
01:22:40,164 --> 01:22:42,041
Lee found out...

1070
01:22:44,168 --> 01:22:45,211
What?

1071
01:23:01,102 --> 01:23:02,561
I'm tired, Gang-hee.

1072
01:23:04,146 --> 01:23:06,732
Maybe I'm too old for this.

1073
01:23:07,608 --> 01:23:09,318
It's not like
we're saving this country.

1074
01:23:12,863 --> 01:23:14,156
You couldn't close the deal?

1075
01:23:24,291 --> 01:23:25,667
It's been a while, sir.

1076
01:23:27,253 --> 01:23:28,587
How are you?

1077
01:23:29,046 --> 01:23:30,423
Did you find out?

1078
01:23:34,260 --> 01:23:36,762
I'm waiting for an answer.

1079
01:23:37,096 --> 01:23:38,431
What game are you playing?

1080
01:23:38,806 --> 01:23:40,141
We should meet.

1081
01:23:44,270 --> 01:23:45,270
Who was it?

1082
01:23:46,439 --> 01:23:47,648
Someone I know.

1083
01:24:10,963 --> 01:24:12,006
Damn, it's cold.

1084
01:24:15,384 --> 01:24:17,053
You're still alive.

1085
01:24:18,220 --> 01:24:20,181
Didn't want to die alone.

1086
01:24:21,474 --> 01:24:25,436
Park from Moon Sash,
he's working for you, right?

1087
01:24:25,644 --> 01:24:29,148
That dumb-ass...
Is it obvious?

1088
01:24:29,815 --> 01:24:31,859
Stupid fella...

1089
01:24:32,359 --> 01:24:37,239
He could end up miserable
if he keeps up that scheme.

1090
01:24:39,325 --> 01:24:41,243
Do you still have what I gave you?

1091
01:24:41,744 --> 01:24:44,330
That almost cost me my life.

1092
01:24:44,413 --> 01:24:46,499
It didn't cost your hand though.

1093
01:24:46,832 --> 01:24:49,043
Do you think I betrayed you?

1094
01:24:51,170 --> 01:24:53,923
Well, are your family
still in the States?

1095
01:24:56,092 --> 01:24:59,595
I paid all their tuition,

1096
01:25:00,554 --> 01:25:03,224
I paid for your
fancy mansion in Bundang.

1097
01:25:06,852 --> 01:25:08,771
Are you blackmailing me?

1098
01:25:08,854 --> 01:25:12,900
Don't get me wrong.
We had a good time together once.

1099
01:25:13,484 --> 01:25:15,069
What do you want?

1100
01:25:15,277 --> 01:25:20,741
I'll give you a huge plot of land
in Gyeonggi if you help me.

1101
01:25:21,534 --> 01:25:23,035
Listen to me, Sang-goo.

1102
01:25:23,953 --> 01:25:25,830
Those guys are monsters.

1103
01:25:26,872 --> 01:25:29,083
The more you bite them,

1104
01:25:29,792 --> 01:25:32,253
the bigger and stronger
they become.

1105
01:25:32,837 --> 01:25:36,048
Don't you get it what it's like
to fight against them?

1106
01:25:36,132 --> 01:25:38,092
Shit, I don't know.

1107
01:25:39,343 --> 01:25:41,512
I will fight till the end.

1108
01:25:41,762 --> 01:25:43,389
You just stay out of this.

1109
01:25:47,309 --> 01:25:49,019
Do you have the copy?

1110
01:25:49,770 --> 01:25:54,733
I don't want blood to get
on your hands... so decide wisely.

1111
01:26:01,031 --> 01:26:02,074
Hey, bro.

1112
01:26:03,284 --> 01:26:04,368
I'll be back.

1113
01:26:31,437 --> 01:26:32,521
What the fuck?

1114
01:26:33,689 --> 01:26:35,691
Lee spilt champagne on it.

1115
01:26:35,983 --> 01:26:37,484
Goddamn... shit!

1116
01:26:49,038 --> 01:26:50,039
Yes, sir.

1117
01:26:51,081 --> 01:26:52,207
How did it go?

1118
01:26:52,208 --> 01:26:53,459
I confirmed his schedule.

1119
01:26:53,500 --> 01:26:56,128
He'll go to Royal Hotel sauna
after the climbing's done.

1120
01:26:56,253 --> 01:26:57,796
You gotta steal that,
by all means!

1121
01:26:57,880 --> 01:26:59,006
No problem, boss.

1122
01:27:01,342 --> 01:27:02,885
What did Lee tell you?

1123
01:27:03,886 --> 01:27:05,721
Think he'll tell Jang?

1124
01:27:05,804 --> 01:27:07,264
Not so easily...

1125
01:27:07,306 --> 01:27:08,933
He has a small guilty part in it.

1126
01:27:15,481 --> 01:27:16,649
Shit!

1127
01:27:19,235 --> 01:27:21,528
How should I catch this punk...

1128
01:27:21,987 --> 01:27:24,156
He seems to know something.

1129
01:27:24,490 --> 01:27:26,575
I can't just get rid of him.

1130
01:27:28,535 --> 01:27:30,162
My gosh, that bastard.

1131
01:27:33,540 --> 01:27:35,042
That's editor Lee Gang-hee

1132
01:27:35,334 --> 01:27:37,253
and he's a high school
alumni with Jang.

1133
01:27:37,836 --> 01:27:39,463
Lee Gang-hee at Nation Daily?

1134
01:27:39,546 --> 01:27:40,589
You know him?

1135
01:27:46,595 --> 01:27:49,014
How can I forget?
He made a fool out of me.

1136
01:27:49,932 --> 01:27:51,016
Wait a minute.

1137
01:27:52,226 --> 01:27:54,937
Mirae Motors is the biggest
advertiser for Nation Daily, right?

1138
01:27:55,020 --> 01:27:55,980
That's right.

1139
01:27:56,021 --> 01:27:58,501
The rich and the press for a candidate
funding for president...

1140
01:27:58,857 --> 01:28:01,110
Damn justice.

1141
01:28:01,860 --> 01:28:05,114
The press was all over Jang

1142
01:28:05,197 --> 01:28:07,037
when he was fired
from the Prosecutor's Office.

1143
01:28:07,658 --> 01:28:09,994
Nation Daily made Jang a star

1144
01:28:10,494 --> 01:28:13,622
and Lee was in charge of
the political department.

1145
01:28:13,789 --> 01:28:17,543
So, the man who made Jang
and arranged Mirae as a sponsor

1146
01:28:17,960 --> 01:28:19,044
was Lee Kang-hee?

1147
01:28:19,378 --> 01:28:20,796
It makes sense.

1148
01:28:20,879 --> 01:28:23,757
It's over when a star, money
and the press are involved.

1149
01:28:36,812 --> 01:28:40,733
By the way sir... what should
I tell the chief prosecutor?

1150
01:28:41,066 --> 01:28:45,404
Tell him that I'm fishing
in a remote village, very relaxed!

1151
01:28:45,946 --> 01:28:47,948
I know what you mean...

1152
01:28:48,741 --> 01:28:51,744
but I'm just an employee...

1153
01:28:53,704 --> 01:28:55,331
Let me out of this.

1154
01:28:56,498 --> 01:28:58,667
Really?
Suit yourself.

1155
01:28:59,835 --> 01:29:00,835
Thank you.

1156
01:29:01,086 --> 01:29:04,547
By the way, back when
Korea Steel was being investigated

1157
01:29:04,548 --> 01:29:07,426
didn't you have dinner with
its General Affairs manager?

1158
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:09,094
How was the dinner?

1159
01:29:09,595 --> 01:29:11,305
The dinner? It was good.

1160
01:29:14,099 --> 01:29:16,643
No sir, it's not like that!

1161
01:29:17,353 --> 01:29:19,563
He's a hometown friend.

1162
01:29:19,813 --> 01:29:22,775
We only had dinner.

1163
01:29:23,067 --> 01:29:26,987
I understand, it's hard
to say no to a friend.

1164
01:29:27,112 --> 01:29:30,115
So what's Ahn up to?

1165
01:29:30,866 --> 01:29:32,993
Not much yet.

1166
01:29:34,244 --> 01:29:37,623
But it really was only dinner!

1167
01:29:37,706 --> 01:29:39,708
Got it, got it.

1168
01:29:39,792 --> 01:29:42,336
I just mean that
we need to stick together.

1169
01:29:47,716 --> 01:29:50,719
Where have you been,
my dearest Sang-goo?

1170
01:30:35,931 --> 01:30:37,015
What?

1171
01:30:38,851 --> 01:30:40,018
You want money?

1172
01:30:40,811 --> 01:30:43,313
You should go out and work
if you need money, loser.

1173
01:30:43,939 --> 01:30:46,442
Extorting customers
with that ugly hook?

1174
01:30:50,696 --> 01:30:52,239
You know Moon Il-seok?

1175
01:30:53,615 --> 01:30:54,867
I was supposed to receive...

1176
01:30:55,534 --> 01:30:58,537
Are you okay?
You're not hurt?

1177
01:30:59,037 --> 01:31:00,789
You must've drunk too much.

1178
01:31:02,583 --> 01:31:03,834
What the hell are you?

1179
01:31:18,891 --> 01:31:19,933
Fucker!

1180
01:31:24,897 --> 01:31:25,981
Sir! Are you okay?

1181
01:31:27,941 --> 01:31:29,817
You should've gone
after him! Damn it!

1182
01:31:29,818 --> 01:31:31,862
It's because...

1183
01:31:33,405 --> 01:31:34,406
Are you okay?

1184
01:31:59,932 --> 01:32:01,141
Did you get anything?

1185
01:32:01,475 --> 01:32:05,437
Whew, it stinks here.
Please, clean up.

1186
01:32:05,562 --> 01:32:06,772
What did you dig up?

1187
01:32:08,315 --> 01:32:10,776
Woo Jang-hoon at the Seoul
Prosecutor's Office.

1188
01:32:10,859 --> 01:32:14,029
He was going to receive the bribery info
from Moon 2 years ago.

1189
01:32:14,279 --> 01:32:17,616
Damn, it won't be easy.

1190
01:32:21,286 --> 01:32:22,286
Shit!

1191
01:32:22,579 --> 01:32:24,873
- My god!
- Did you screw up?

1192
01:32:24,957 --> 01:32:27,251
Come on,
I'm not new at this thing.

1193
01:32:27,292 --> 01:32:29,711
Then how he find out?

1194
01:32:30,212 --> 01:32:32,548
I don't know how.

1195
01:32:37,052 --> 01:32:39,972
Will you be okay
with a prosecutor involved?

1196
01:32:44,184 --> 01:32:47,729
Nothing goes as planned.

1197
01:32:49,356 --> 01:32:50,816
It's all fucked up.

1198
01:32:59,157 --> 01:33:03,328
That punk got me, son of a bitch.

1199
01:33:07,207 --> 01:33:08,458
How long has it been?

1200
01:33:09,001 --> 01:33:11,336
It's been an hour since
he went in the hotel sauna.

1201
01:33:11,587 --> 01:33:13,714
He left Moon Sash and
came straight here.

1202
01:33:14,089 --> 01:33:15,674
Any contact with Ahn Sang-goo?

1203
01:33:16,091 --> 01:33:17,259
Not yet...

1204
01:33:19,344 --> 01:33:20,429
Shit.

1205
01:33:25,726 --> 01:33:27,060
What's he doing here?

1206
01:33:41,908 --> 01:33:43,327
You say

1207
01:33:44,328 --> 01:33:45,662
Ahn disappeared?

1208
01:33:52,669 --> 01:33:53,754
Sorry, sir.

1209
01:33:54,046 --> 01:33:57,382
Move your ass now
and get that son of a bitch!

1210
01:34:01,720 --> 01:34:02,971
Stupid jerk.

1211
01:34:05,098 --> 01:34:07,309
Damn useless bastard.

1212
01:34:44,930 --> 01:34:47,641
Hey, Mr. Park!
Champion!

1213
01:34:48,266 --> 01:34:49,267
Oh, my!

1214
01:34:51,186 --> 01:34:52,479
Are you a member here?

1215
01:34:52,521 --> 01:34:55,023
Yes, you are too?

1216
01:34:55,107 --> 01:34:56,733
Of course. I'm a regular.

1217
01:34:57,109 --> 01:34:58,485
They give good haircuts here.

1218
01:34:58,610 --> 01:35:00,195
Yes, I can see.

1219
01:35:00,445 --> 01:35:01,446
Excuse me for a sec.

1220
01:35:03,365 --> 01:35:04,365
Hello.

1221
01:35:07,619 --> 01:35:08,620
You sure?

1222
01:35:08,870 --> 01:35:11,998
Ahn owns a hotel in Gwangju.

1223
01:35:12,666 --> 01:35:15,293
Park used to run it for him.

1224
01:35:18,213 --> 01:35:19,214
Is that so?

1225
01:35:19,423 --> 01:35:22,968
Stay calm and do as I say
from now on.

1226
01:35:23,009 --> 01:35:24,469
Got it.
I'll take care of it.

1227
01:35:24,594 --> 01:35:26,430
Yes, okay.

1228
01:35:27,723 --> 01:35:30,267
You busy?
Let's have a beer.

1229
01:35:30,308 --> 01:35:32,602
- I'm a bit tied up...
- Just a sip.

1230
01:35:32,686 --> 01:35:33,979
Yes, sir.

1231
01:35:47,242 --> 01:35:48,326
Tell me.

1232
01:35:49,077 --> 01:35:50,287
He hasn't spilled yet.

1233
01:35:50,662 --> 01:35:51,830
You damn losers.

1234
01:35:52,956 --> 01:35:54,082
Bring it here!

1235
01:36:01,673 --> 01:36:02,716
First cut here.

1236
01:36:07,137 --> 01:36:09,765
And here.

1237
01:36:12,267 --> 01:36:13,393
And for here,

1238
01:36:13,894 --> 01:36:16,271
I guess we should cut
right above the ankle.

1239
01:36:16,605 --> 01:36:17,689
Wait!

1240
01:36:19,733 --> 01:36:20,733
What?

1241
01:36:24,196 --> 01:36:25,447
Anything to tell us?

1242
01:36:40,337 --> 01:36:41,797
Where is Ahn hiding?

1243
01:36:55,101 --> 01:36:55,936
How did it go?

1244
01:36:56,019 --> 01:36:58,396
I got the watch, boss.

1245
01:36:58,480 --> 01:37:00,774
Be careful.
Lots of eyes watching.

1246
01:37:01,233 --> 01:37:02,400
Bring it quick.

1247
01:37:08,031 --> 01:37:12,661
You bastards will be skeletons
by the time I die.

1248
01:37:19,918 --> 01:37:21,586
Seems like Park got busted.

1249
01:37:29,261 --> 01:37:30,762
Fucking morons.

1250
01:37:49,155 --> 01:37:50,949
Fuck, this is hot!

1251
01:38:29,863 --> 01:38:30,947
Boss.

1252
01:38:36,786 --> 01:38:37,786
Boss, it's me!

1253
01:39:12,072 --> 01:39:13,197
Damn it.

1254
01:39:13,198 --> 01:39:14,198
Get him!

1255
01:39:19,037 --> 01:39:20,080
Fuck!

1256
01:40:09,754 --> 01:40:10,755
Lift him up.

1257
01:40:13,425 --> 01:40:15,260
You cripple.

1258
01:40:27,147 --> 01:40:28,523
You fucking prick.

1259
01:41:35,673 --> 01:41:36,674
Yes, got him.

1260
01:41:38,635 --> 01:41:40,220
Dickhead.

1261
01:41:45,642 --> 01:41:47,018
Ahn got away.

1262
01:41:48,144 --> 01:41:49,813
How could you let him go?

1263
01:41:51,564 --> 01:41:53,108
Shut the fuck up!

1264
01:41:57,403 --> 01:41:59,572
Should've killed that fucker
when I had the chance.

1265
01:42:01,991 --> 01:42:05,661
You caused this shit,
so you should clean it up.

1266
01:42:11,084 --> 01:42:13,545
If things go wrong because of Ahn,

1267
01:42:13,795 --> 01:42:17,257
I won't go down alone.
You know that.

1268
01:42:17,841 --> 01:42:20,176
Of course I know.

1269
01:42:20,677 --> 01:42:23,930
That's why all along
I've been cleaning your shit

1270
01:42:24,097 --> 01:42:26,057
and wiping your ass, too.

1271
01:42:26,141 --> 01:42:27,433
So...

1272
01:42:28,893 --> 01:42:31,937
keep cleaning my shit
and wiping my ass.

1273
01:42:31,938 --> 01:42:35,108
Then you can be a cabinet member
or prime minister.

1274
01:42:37,318 --> 01:42:41,281
Everyone has a
pre-destined role in life.

1275
01:42:41,781 --> 01:42:45,785
You're destined to
clean my shit all your life.

1276
01:42:46,953 --> 01:42:49,247
Prime minister, Lee.
Okay?

1277
01:43:13,897 --> 01:43:16,524
Fucking constipation!

1278
01:43:19,360 --> 01:43:20,361
You're awake?

1279
01:43:25,617 --> 01:43:26,784
Hey, mobster!

1280
01:43:28,786 --> 01:43:31,580
Even if you lost a hand,
what kind of gangster

1281
01:43:31,581 --> 01:43:33,249
is so bad at fighting?

1282
01:43:33,666 --> 01:43:36,294
You'd be dead if not for me.

1283
01:43:37,003 --> 01:43:39,672
Watch your mouth,
you filthy little dog.

1284
01:43:40,131 --> 01:43:41,591
What do you expect?

1285
01:43:41,674 --> 01:43:44,802
A prosecutor to speak
respectfully to a fucking gangster?

1286
01:43:44,928 --> 01:43:47,639
Listen carefully
as I won't repeat this.

1287
01:43:47,847 --> 01:43:49,557
Okay?

1288
01:43:50,391 --> 01:43:52,268
You remember Moon Il-seok?

1289
01:43:52,685 --> 01:43:54,979
Ex-accounting manager
of Mirae Motors.

1290
01:43:55,355 --> 01:44:00,777
He was going to give me
the slush fund file 2 years back.

1291
01:44:00,985 --> 01:44:02,402
The records from Mirae Motors.

1292
01:44:02,403 --> 01:44:07,992
But a fucking rat intercepted it.
Who could that be?

1293
01:44:11,663 --> 01:44:12,956
You are asking me?

1294
01:44:14,749 --> 01:44:19,169
That's what you lost your hand for,
isn't it?

1295
01:44:19,170 --> 01:44:21,172
Playing games with those files.

1296
01:44:22,966 --> 01:44:26,344
Are you nuts? I must've hit you
too hard the other night.

1297
01:44:26,427 --> 01:44:27,762
Fuck.

1298
01:44:28,680 --> 01:44:31,391
Okay then how about this?

1299
01:44:33,351 --> 01:44:35,395
What is it that you want?

1300
01:44:36,521 --> 01:44:37,688
Revenge, isn't it?

1301
01:44:37,689 --> 01:44:41,734
You know what I want?
I want justice.

1302
01:44:42,860 --> 01:44:45,280
Because I'm a fucking
prosecutor of Korea.

1303
01:44:46,030 --> 01:44:50,285
I'd like to help
with your revenge,

1304
01:44:50,660 --> 01:44:52,704
you wanna work with me?

1305
01:44:53,329 --> 01:44:54,706
Good deal, isn't it?

1306
01:44:59,002 --> 01:45:02,588
You're quite funny,
Mr. Prosecutor.

1307
01:45:03,298 --> 01:45:07,093
You think you're John Wayne?

1308
01:45:10,221 --> 01:45:11,389
Justice?

1309
01:45:12,098 --> 01:45:15,226
Does a sweet thing like that
still exist in this country?

1310
01:45:16,769 --> 01:45:19,939
If you wanna play with that shit,
help yourself.

1311
01:45:20,273 --> 01:45:21,816
I'm not interested.

1312
01:45:24,235 --> 01:45:27,030
You thugs don't listen
when we talk nicely.

1313
01:45:29,032 --> 01:45:30,783
You listen carefully.

1314
01:45:31,826 --> 01:45:34,412
If you don't cooperate,

1315
01:45:34,871 --> 01:45:40,543
you'll be charged for
confinement and assault on Moon.

1316
01:45:44,422 --> 01:45:45,590
What'll it be?

1317
01:45:56,309 --> 01:45:58,269
I just got in.

1318
01:45:58,394 --> 01:45:59,937
See the light on the ceiling?

1319
01:46:00,605 --> 01:46:02,315
- The light.
- Pardon?

1320
01:46:09,947 --> 01:46:10,947
Okay!

1321
01:46:13,618 --> 01:46:14,786
Got it!

1322
01:46:15,078 --> 01:46:18,081
You did? Great job!
Bravo!

1323
01:46:18,539 --> 01:46:20,083
Tell him to get
a bottle of soju!

1324
01:46:20,833 --> 01:46:22,710
Buy a bottle of soju
on your way back.

1325
01:46:24,420 --> 01:46:26,422
Any brand is fine.

1326
01:46:26,506 --> 01:46:28,299
Tell him to buy 'Dew!'

1327
01:46:29,300 --> 01:46:30,551
Fresh.

1328
01:46:32,512 --> 01:46:33,638
Mr. Bang.

1329
01:46:34,972 --> 01:46:37,475
Mr. Dipshit Gangster
would prefer Dew.

1330
01:46:37,517 --> 01:46:40,478
Fresh!
Damn it.

1331
01:46:45,483 --> 01:46:47,318
That toilet is fucked up.

1332
01:46:53,324 --> 01:46:54,700
What the fuck.

1333
01:46:56,869 --> 01:46:59,372
Damn it you!

1334
01:47:01,124 --> 01:47:02,333
Cut the crap!

1335
01:47:07,839 --> 01:47:10,341
You think it'll do?

1336
01:47:10,758 --> 01:47:12,635
Oh's not in it.

1337
01:47:13,094 --> 01:47:15,471
Plenty of ways out for Jang.

1338
01:47:15,721 --> 01:47:18,974
This can only nail
the president of his campaign club.

1339
01:47:19,225 --> 01:47:21,060
Where's the file?

1340
01:47:21,144 --> 01:47:23,729
- I told you they took it!
- Fuck you!

1341
01:47:25,022 --> 01:47:26,607
You think I'll buy that shit?

1342
01:47:26,691 --> 01:47:28,985
You weren't listening
when I told you that?

1343
01:47:31,446 --> 01:47:35,658
You're saying you trusted
Lee that much?

1344
01:47:35,950 --> 01:47:38,161
Giving him the original
without making a copy?

1345
01:47:40,037 --> 01:47:42,081
You know there is something...

1346
01:47:44,041 --> 01:47:45,543
between him and me.

1347
01:47:46,169 --> 01:47:47,420
Fuck!

1348
01:47:47,712 --> 01:47:51,215
We have a special bond between us.
Like brotherhood.

1349
01:47:51,466 --> 01:47:54,885
Special bond between
a journalist and a gangster.

1350
01:47:54,886 --> 01:47:57,221
Got it!
Then how much did you give?

1351
01:47:57,263 --> 01:47:58,889
- Huh?
- Didn't you?

1352
01:47:58,890 --> 01:48:01,725
The fucking special bond of yours

1353
01:48:01,726 --> 01:48:05,730
is giving him something
to get something back.

1354
01:48:06,355 --> 01:48:10,276
Why'd you give the slush fund file
to Lee Gang-hee?!

1355
01:48:11,319 --> 01:48:14,780
We need insurance to survive
in this world.

1356
01:48:14,906 --> 01:48:20,661
Ah, you got insurance,
but no copy?

1357
01:48:21,287 --> 01:48:23,164
You think I'll buy that,
you son of a bitch!

1358
01:48:23,247 --> 01:48:25,333
I told you already
that they took everything!

1359
01:48:25,416 --> 01:48:27,668
He is a fucking loser.
A blockhead.

1360
01:48:27,752 --> 01:48:28,835
Prosecutor.

1361
01:48:28,836 --> 01:48:30,338
Fuck you!

1362
01:48:32,924 --> 01:48:35,967
I think we should move
to another place.

1363
01:48:35,968 --> 01:48:37,136
Why?

1364
01:48:40,014 --> 01:48:41,640
It's a bit weird for guys
to stay in a...

1365
01:48:41,641 --> 01:48:43,559
Why is it weird? Fuck!

1366
01:48:43,851 --> 01:48:47,063
And Jang's gang must
be searching for him everywhere.

1367
01:48:47,271 --> 01:48:49,774
Staying in Seoul
is too dangerous.

1368
01:48:50,566 --> 01:48:54,111
Hey, do you have any place
to hide in the countryside?

1369
01:48:57,448 --> 01:48:59,492
I have some bros
in Gwangju.

1370
01:49:00,284 --> 01:49:02,995
But damn Park knows them all.

1371
01:49:05,623 --> 01:49:06,832
Great!

1372
01:49:52,587 --> 01:49:53,796
Who is it?

1373
01:49:56,257 --> 01:49:57,883
What brings you here?

1374
01:50:12,690 --> 01:50:14,108
Bastard...

1375
01:50:15,234 --> 01:50:18,154
You're the only one
catching bad guys in Korea?

1376
01:50:20,489 --> 01:50:23,826
Couldn't you have at least
eaten regularly?

1377
01:50:25,494 --> 01:50:26,996
Bastard...

1378
01:50:27,455 --> 01:50:29,874
How's the food?
Sorry we don't have much.

1379
01:50:29,915 --> 01:50:31,167
It tastes good.

1380
01:50:33,127 --> 01:50:36,839
- Are you okay?
- Okay with what?

1381
01:50:37,381 --> 01:50:40,634
Are things cleaner at the prosecution,
compared to the police?

1382
01:50:47,475 --> 01:50:48,685
I'm full.

1383
01:50:49,894 --> 01:50:51,062
I'll get going.

1384
01:50:52,438 --> 01:50:56,567
- Leaving already?
- Got some early morning business.

1385
01:50:58,069 --> 01:51:00,071
Don't come out.
Night.

1386
01:51:07,161 --> 01:51:08,746
Damn... bastard.

1387
01:51:09,121 --> 01:51:11,957
- Careful with driving!
- Yes.

1388
01:51:19,090 --> 01:51:20,925
This was his room.

1389
01:51:21,133 --> 01:51:23,010
Make yourself at home.

1390
01:51:24,929 --> 01:51:26,764
I'm sorry to cause you trouble.

1391
01:51:26,806 --> 01:51:28,849
I'll pay back your kindness later.

1392
01:51:28,933 --> 01:51:31,686
It's nothing.
Never mind.

1393
01:51:32,103 --> 01:51:35,856
Just take care of my son.

1394
01:51:36,107 --> 01:51:40,194
He's still immature
and out of touch.

1395
01:51:40,277 --> 01:51:42,571
He's not immature.

1396
01:51:42,655 --> 01:51:47,409
A bit rude, but I'll take
care of that myself.

1397
01:51:47,410 --> 01:51:49,245
- You don't have to worry.
- Sure.

1398
01:51:49,286 --> 01:51:51,414
- Good night.
- Night, sir.

1399
01:52:05,970 --> 01:52:08,597
If you're walking in hell,
you should march on!

1400
01:52:10,433 --> 01:52:11,517
Fuck you.

1401
01:52:14,353 --> 01:52:16,605
This isn't enough.

1402
01:52:17,606 --> 01:52:20,025
We definitely
need the slush fund file.

1403
01:52:20,985 --> 01:52:22,611
You're saying there's no copy?

1404
01:52:22,987 --> 01:52:25,072
He says so but...

1405
01:52:25,906 --> 01:52:28,701
Professor, how are you doing?

1406
01:52:28,993 --> 01:52:29,785
What?

1407
01:52:29,827 --> 01:52:31,912
I'm a bit concerned...

1408
01:52:32,163 --> 01:52:35,750
a gentleman like you
engaged in politics...

1409
01:52:37,960 --> 01:52:40,045
When I first joined the congress

1410
01:52:40,129 --> 01:52:41,672
someone said to me...

1411
01:52:43,007 --> 01:52:44,091
the only goal

1412
01:52:44,633 --> 01:52:46,927
for a congressman...

1413
01:52:47,178 --> 01:52:49,722
is to be part of the ruling party.

1414
01:52:51,182 --> 01:52:53,642
Politics is survival
in a broad term.

1415
01:52:54,477 --> 01:52:57,146
Survival of the country
and the people.

1416
01:52:57,396 --> 01:52:59,774
And my survival.

1417
01:53:02,651 --> 01:53:03,736
It must be tough.

1418
01:53:04,987 --> 01:53:07,865
It's not easy especially
in the opposition party.

1419
01:53:09,867 --> 01:53:13,829
- I need something big.
- Professor.

1420
01:53:14,497 --> 01:53:15,706
Shall I...

1421
01:53:16,665 --> 01:53:20,878
make you an interesting proposal?

1422
01:53:21,253 --> 01:53:22,379
What is it?

1423
01:53:22,797 --> 01:53:26,342
Please prepare a press conference
for Ahn Sang-goo.

1424
01:53:26,801 --> 01:53:29,345
You want me to back that?

1425
01:53:29,470 --> 01:53:32,014
I'm sure it'll be a good
opportunity for you as well.

1426
01:53:32,389 --> 01:53:33,432
How about the file?

1427
01:53:33,516 --> 01:53:36,060
I'll take care of it.

1428
01:53:36,227 --> 01:53:39,188
Will Ahn himself show up?

1429
01:53:39,313 --> 01:53:40,940
If he doesn't...

1430
01:53:42,066 --> 01:53:43,359
We'll have to make him show.

1431
01:53:46,028 --> 01:53:47,028
Made a deal?

1432
01:53:47,279 --> 01:53:50,491
He gets Jang then join
the Supreme Prosecutor's Office.

1433
01:53:52,535 --> 01:53:55,162
So that's why he wanted to get
Jang so bad.

1434
01:53:55,913 --> 01:53:57,581
Can you trust him?

1435
01:53:57,790 --> 01:53:59,416
You want me to walk away?

1436
01:54:00,084 --> 01:54:03,379
I wonder if he'll stab you in the back.

1437
01:54:03,587 --> 01:54:05,296
Prosecutors in Korea are like that.

1438
01:54:05,297 --> 01:54:08,467
They suck up to those with power.

1439
01:54:08,926 --> 01:54:12,346
He needs to get Jang
for his own sake.

1440
01:54:12,721 --> 01:54:14,682
Still, don't trust him completely.

1441
01:54:15,099 --> 01:54:17,059
You can't be too careful.

1442
01:54:17,101 --> 01:54:19,728
He might stab you in the back.

1443
01:54:22,439 --> 01:54:23,607
You got a great car!

1444
01:54:24,900 --> 01:54:26,277
Is it a new one?

1445
01:54:26,735 --> 01:54:27,987
The balance?

1446
01:54:30,322 --> 01:54:32,241
You're the only one
raking it in,

1447
01:54:33,158 --> 01:54:35,286
when the film's
not even released.

1448
01:54:36,829 --> 01:54:40,165
It's not the actor's fault
but the director's.

1449
01:54:42,293 --> 01:54:45,004
Take to the hills for a while.

1450
01:55:03,105 --> 01:55:06,859
Sang-goo, how about
going away with me?

1451
01:55:07,818 --> 01:55:09,987
Who gives a damn about revenge?

1452
01:55:10,946 --> 01:55:14,909
We can drink Mojitos in the Maldives.
Like old times.

1453
01:55:16,952 --> 01:55:19,038
You should bury
memories in your heart

1454
01:55:19,496 --> 01:55:21,832
and keep no feelings for
buses that have left.

1455
01:55:29,632 --> 01:55:30,966
What's with you?

1456
01:55:34,386 --> 01:55:37,014
Take care, Mr. Chairman.

1457
01:55:38,390 --> 01:55:39,516
Bye-bye.

1458
01:56:15,552 --> 01:56:17,972
You must've studied hard
to become a prosecutor.

1459
01:56:18,555 --> 01:56:20,182
I had blood in my stool.

1460
01:56:20,391 --> 01:56:24,269
My ass couldn't take
sitting at a desk 24/7.

1461
01:56:24,853 --> 01:56:27,730
Most people are on their way up
once they become prosecutors...

1462
01:56:27,731 --> 01:56:29,400
getting married into rich families.

1463
01:56:29,900 --> 01:56:32,653
So will you be my matchmaker?

1464
01:56:39,243 --> 01:56:43,288
What is your reason to get Jang?
The real one.

1465
01:56:47,209 --> 01:56:49,378
When I was a policeman,

1466
01:56:50,087 --> 01:56:54,299
I caught a lot of bad guys.
I mean a lot!

1467
01:56:54,550 --> 01:56:57,636
- Especially thugs like you.
- You rude bastard!

1468
01:56:57,928 --> 01:57:00,680
But no point in arresting them...
Fuck.

1469
01:57:00,681 --> 01:57:02,766
I didn't graduate from
the police academy.

1470
01:57:02,975 --> 01:57:07,187
So I got stuck with
all the shitty work.

1471
01:57:07,688 --> 01:57:10,441
You know... one sows
and another reaps.

1472
01:57:11,066 --> 01:57:13,694
That's why you
became a prosecutor?

1473
01:57:13,944 --> 01:57:17,573
But now, the issue is
lines of influence.

1474
01:57:18,073 --> 01:57:20,451
What's the use of
an outstanding record?

1475
01:57:21,076 --> 01:57:24,663
Hicks like me
with no connections

1476
01:57:24,747 --> 01:57:29,835
can't get anywhere.
What a great country!

1477
01:57:32,921 --> 01:57:37,051
Now you've started, you need
some stars on your chest.

1478
01:57:37,134 --> 01:57:40,179
Did anyone ever become
Chief Prosecutor without connections?

1479
01:57:42,598 --> 01:57:47,685
Article 11, chapter 2 of the Constitution:
all men are created equal.

1480
01:57:47,686 --> 01:57:52,982
And shall not be discriminated
by gender, religion or social status,

1481
01:57:52,983 --> 01:57:56,945
in any areas including political, economic,
social and cultural life.

1482
01:57:58,864 --> 01:57:59,865
Damn fly!

1483
01:57:59,990 --> 01:58:01,241
Fuck it,

1484
01:58:01,992 --> 01:58:04,119
you gangster!

1485
01:58:05,329 --> 01:58:09,291
Don't you think our kids
should live in a country like that?

1486
01:58:09,333 --> 01:58:11,001
You're so fucking righteous.

1487
01:58:13,921 --> 01:58:16,006
You've got a copy of it,
don't you?

1488
01:58:17,257 --> 01:58:22,304
You might call each other bro
but you don't share the same blood.

1489
01:58:23,097 --> 01:58:27,768
You would've made a copy
before giving it to Lee.

1490
01:58:29,103 --> 01:58:31,855
Jang's popularity
has soared by 10 percent.

1491
01:58:32,189 --> 01:58:35,859
He could win the primary,
then go on to be president.

1492
01:58:35,943 --> 01:58:38,779
Can you watch that happen?

1493
01:58:39,780 --> 01:58:42,199
I can't.
A president like him.

1494
01:58:42,866 --> 01:58:45,035
I've had enough already,

1495
01:58:45,702 --> 01:58:47,704
now give me the copy.

1496
01:58:50,374 --> 01:58:53,127
Didn't you want to use me
to catch Jang?

1497
01:58:53,293 --> 01:58:56,338
Then use me!
If you don't take this chance now,

1498
01:58:57,047 --> 01:59:00,551
you'll hide all your life
like a fucking loser.

1499
01:59:00,801 --> 01:59:02,719
All your life.
Forever!

1500
01:59:09,852 --> 01:59:12,062
Before he died,
my father told me

1501
01:59:12,980 --> 01:59:15,732
'Sang-goo, you should behave

1502
01:59:16,525 --> 01:59:18,861
as if I'll be watching over you
from Heaven.'

1503
01:59:35,419 --> 01:59:39,047
This is the original
that I took from Moon.

1504
01:59:45,053 --> 01:59:46,430
I knew it.

1505
01:59:48,682 --> 01:59:52,352
Then why'd you need
a video from the villa?

1506
01:59:52,769 --> 01:59:55,897
Why do you think Kim Jong-il
developed a nuclear bomb?

1507
01:59:56,315 --> 01:59:59,193
If this file is
ground-to-air missiles,

1508
01:59:59,484 --> 02:00:01,236
what would the video clip be?

1509
02:00:01,904 --> 02:00:03,280
A nuclear bomb!

1510
02:00:06,867 --> 02:00:09,078
This wasn't my original plan,

1511
02:00:09,411 --> 02:00:11,914
but this should do for revenge.

1512
02:00:15,542 --> 02:00:22,049
I'll go to the Maldives
to sip Mojito.

1513
02:00:22,758 --> 02:00:27,262
You get the fuckers
and put them in jail.

1514
02:00:28,805 --> 02:00:30,474
You're telling me
to do it alone?

1515
02:00:34,186 --> 02:00:39,524
The file can be taken as evidence
only when the source is revealed.

1516
02:00:42,069 --> 02:00:43,486
You're telling me
to go to jail?

1517
02:00:43,487 --> 02:00:45,280
Arrest would be inevitable

1518
02:00:46,240 --> 02:00:49,326
but isn't it true that
you're not 100% innocent?

1519
02:00:49,534 --> 02:00:50,786
Fuck you!

1520
02:00:51,787 --> 02:00:54,414
I want revenge, not justice!

1521
02:00:54,498 --> 02:00:57,960
I'm sorry but that's the only
way to get them.

1522
02:00:58,377 --> 02:01:01,797
You think I'm that stupid?

1523
02:01:03,006 --> 02:01:04,508
Fuck justice.

1524
02:01:04,883 --> 02:01:07,469
I know you're doing this
to make your name.

1525
02:01:08,345 --> 02:01:10,930
You want to be on a roll
after arresting Jang!

1526
02:01:10,931 --> 02:01:12,975
What is wrong with that?

1527
02:01:13,016 --> 02:01:17,144
I want to go up by jailing bad guys
since I have no connections!

1528
02:01:17,145 --> 02:01:18,480
Is that so wrong?

1529
02:01:18,605 --> 02:01:21,692
Didn't you go to Lee
wanting to make it big!

1530
02:01:21,733 --> 02:01:24,151
And you are left out
like a deserted dog!

1531
02:01:24,152 --> 02:01:25,861
- Are you fucking crazy, bastard!
- Don't you get it?

1532
02:01:25,862 --> 02:01:28,156
You fucking don't get it yet?

1533
02:01:28,949 --> 02:01:31,034
It's Editor Lee, not Jang!

1534
02:01:31,201 --> 02:01:33,870
Lee was the one who set up
the slush fund...

1535
02:01:35,247 --> 02:01:37,581
and put Mirae Motors, Hangyul Bank
and Jang together!

1536
02:01:37,582 --> 02:01:39,376
And this!
Fucking this!

1537
02:01:40,294 --> 02:01:44,756
Lee is the one
who fucked up your hand, moron!

1538
02:01:47,968 --> 02:01:49,553
What are you talking about?

1539
02:01:54,391 --> 02:01:56,226
Want to change the lead?

1540
02:01:58,312 --> 02:02:02,190
He does whatever he wants
instead of following our direction.

1541
02:02:02,607 --> 02:02:06,194
Imagine what he would demand
once he gets there.

1542
02:02:06,278 --> 02:02:08,238
But will Jang go quietly?

1543
02:02:08,655 --> 02:02:11,533
Nothing serious to have
one more actor.

1544
02:02:11,742 --> 02:02:15,579
You want to proceed with two tops
rather than one?

1545
02:02:15,871 --> 02:02:17,748
He'll realize
when the film ends...

1546
02:02:18,248 --> 02:02:21,168
that he was only playing
the supporting role.

1547
02:02:27,257 --> 02:02:32,095
Editor, do you realize how much
I've already invested in him?

1548
02:02:32,721 --> 02:02:36,933
And you're saying I should invest in
Kim again without payback?

1549
02:02:37,392 --> 02:02:39,811
It's not how businessmen work.

1550
02:02:40,228 --> 02:02:46,526
And Jang's better at following
our instructions than Kim

1551
02:02:46,610 --> 02:02:48,904
since Jang stinks
as much as we do.

1552
02:02:49,363 --> 02:02:54,034
Isn't it better to fart
among those who stink?

1553
02:02:55,911 --> 02:02:56,995
Excuse me.

1554
02:03:05,629 --> 02:03:06,629
Hello.

1555
02:03:06,797 --> 02:03:08,048
It's me.

1556
02:03:10,258 --> 02:03:13,762
I'm feeling lonely
and thinking of you.

1557
02:03:14,763 --> 02:03:16,473
How have you been?

1558
02:03:21,603 --> 02:03:22,479
Where are you?

1559
02:03:22,480 --> 02:03:24,940
Get prepared,
the operation will start soon.

1560
02:03:25,273 --> 02:03:27,317
I warned you before...

1561
02:03:28,151 --> 02:03:30,821
you could get fucked up
if you keep licking Jang's ass.

1562
02:03:31,071 --> 02:03:32,572
You got a copy, do you?

1563
02:03:32,656 --> 02:03:34,741
You need a bullet
to load the gun.

1564
02:03:35,033 --> 02:03:37,827
I can help you
if you want revenge.

1565
02:03:37,828 --> 02:03:40,539
How much did you get
for raising the slush fund?

1566
02:03:41,206 --> 02:03:43,542
Did they promise you
the prime minister job?

1567
02:03:45,001 --> 02:03:47,754
Bro!

1568
02:03:49,005 --> 02:03:51,133
How could you do this to me?

1569
02:03:55,053 --> 02:03:58,014
You matched Mirae Motors
up with Hangyul Bank...

1570
02:03:59,641 --> 02:04:02,184
And it's you who got Jang
to put the pressure on the loan!

1571
02:04:02,185 --> 02:04:03,603
You motherfucker!

1572
02:04:08,191 --> 02:04:11,528
I was a damn fool

1573
02:04:12,487 --> 02:04:14,573
to give you the file...

1574
02:04:14,739 --> 02:04:16,741
No wonder I lost my hand.

1575
02:04:24,332 --> 02:04:26,001
You keep it for me.

1576
02:04:27,335 --> 02:04:29,880
We'll see what good
it might bring us.

1577
02:04:30,881 --> 02:04:33,383
Don't release it
without my consent, got it?

1578
02:04:36,303 --> 02:04:38,889
What a foxy bear.

1579
02:04:40,515 --> 02:04:46,605
You should know your place,
instead of coveting what's not yours.

1580
02:04:47,189 --> 02:04:51,401
Sang-goo, just follow my lead.

1581
02:04:53,778 --> 02:04:57,073
Take care, it's quite cold.

1582
02:05:45,956 --> 02:05:49,417
So you planned all this?
Using me?

1583
02:05:50,585 --> 02:05:52,671
You think you can
hide all your life

1584
02:05:53,797 --> 02:05:55,298
watching this bullshit?

1585
02:05:55,382 --> 02:05:57,342
What do you want me to do?

1586
02:05:58,802 --> 02:06:00,135
Go to jail?

1587
02:06:00,136 --> 02:06:04,307
It's the only way
to get that son of a bitch, Lee.

1588
02:06:06,101 --> 02:06:07,435
It's your call.

1589
02:06:08,144 --> 02:06:09,521
What do you want?

1590
02:06:26,329 --> 02:06:28,665
How will people remember me?

1591
02:06:30,375 --> 02:06:32,502
How do you want
to be remembered?

1592
02:06:34,754 --> 02:06:36,339
A gangster who loved...

1593
02:06:37,299 --> 02:06:40,677
No... stood by justice?

1594
02:06:46,683 --> 02:06:48,310
Don't smirk.

1595
02:06:48,685 --> 02:06:51,021
Damn, I should
go to the beauty salon...

1596
02:06:51,563 --> 02:06:54,608
and get a new suit too.
A nice one.

1597
02:07:05,535 --> 02:07:08,872
I got this from Moon Il-seok,
former accountant at Mirae Motors.

1598
02:07:09,706 --> 02:07:13,793
It shows Mirae made a slush fund
with 3 billion from Hangyul Bank

1599
02:07:14,377 --> 02:07:19,507
and gave 30 million to Congressman Jang
for his election campaign.

1600
02:07:20,383 --> 02:07:25,055
Today, the prosecution raided
Mirae Motors and Hangyul Bank.

1601
02:07:25,096 --> 02:07:26,389
According to a source...

1602
02:07:26,473 --> 02:07:29,141
Ahn who unveiled
Mirae Motors' slush fund

1603
02:07:29,142 --> 02:07:31,895
was arrested and imprisoned
in Seoul Detention Center.

1604
02:07:31,978 --> 02:07:35,273
Ahn is accused of abduction,
imprisonment and extortion.

1605
02:07:35,398 --> 02:07:39,694
Ahn claims he only followed the orders
of Chairman Oh and Congressman Jang.

1606
02:07:39,903 --> 02:07:43,615
The prosecution will
conduct a cross-examination.

1607
02:07:43,907 --> 02:07:46,241
Today at a press conference,
Congressman Jang said

1608
02:07:46,242 --> 02:07:49,287
he will defy the
prosecution's summons.

1609
02:07:50,455 --> 02:07:54,751
My conscience is clear before
the people of this country.

1610
02:07:55,001 --> 02:08:01,508
I have never received
money or favors from Mirae Motors.

1611
02:08:01,925 --> 02:08:04,718
I can stake
my political life on it.

1612
02:08:04,719 --> 02:08:07,304
In the evening today,
Oh, Chairman of Mirae Motors

1613
02:08:07,305 --> 02:08:09,808
was suddenly hospitalized
for a chronic disease.

1614
02:08:09,933 --> 02:08:11,809
Oh's attorney requested

1615
02:08:11,810 --> 02:08:14,604
the prosecution to postpone
the summons.

1616
02:08:14,854 --> 02:08:18,775
It's been reported that Mr. Jo
at Mirae Motors has left the country.

1617
02:08:18,900 --> 02:08:21,402
His actions has raised doubts

1618
02:08:21,403 --> 02:08:23,279
that he left in order to escape.

1619
02:08:23,571 --> 02:08:27,826
However, Mirae Motors announced that
this was scheduled for months.

1620
02:08:27,951 --> 02:08:31,955
And that Mr. Jo will voluntarily
appear at the Prosecution's Office.

1621
02:08:33,623 --> 02:08:37,794
Lord, shed me some insights.

1622
02:08:57,063 --> 02:09:00,734
Strong memories lack judgement

1623
02:09:06,865 --> 02:09:08,992
Then, shall we begin the show?

1624
02:09:35,518 --> 02:09:36,978
The water tastes okay?

1625
02:09:38,855 --> 02:09:41,816
Sorry, so many cases to handle.

1626
02:09:42,192 --> 02:09:44,110
Hope you feel comfortable here.

1627
02:09:44,694 --> 02:09:47,572
My ass hurts after
sitting for so long.

1628
02:09:47,697 --> 02:09:51,743
- Thank you for the article.
- Which article?

1629
02:09:52,035 --> 02:09:55,830
Prosecution's forced interrogation
caused Seok's suicide.

1630
02:09:57,123 --> 02:09:59,709
- I think it was here...
- Yes.

1631
02:10:00,877 --> 02:10:02,462
Why'd you kill him?

1632
02:10:04,255 --> 02:10:05,631
I know you killed him

1633
02:10:05,632 --> 02:10:08,802
by scratching a pen
with your right hand, didn't you?

1634
02:10:09,010 --> 02:10:10,804
You're out of line.

1635
02:10:11,554 --> 02:10:14,390
Please ask questions
based on facts only.

1636
02:10:14,766 --> 02:10:16,226
Enough fiction.

1637
02:10:16,309 --> 02:10:19,020
Only facts then.
No time anyway.

1638
02:10:19,687 --> 02:10:21,898
Are you happy to live

1639
02:10:24,734 --> 02:10:27,403
kissing the asses of Jang and Oh?

1640
02:10:27,946 --> 02:10:31,366
Fuck... who kisses whose ass?

1641
02:10:31,574 --> 02:10:33,910
Or not, whatever.

1642
02:10:35,578 --> 02:10:38,497
I saw you were quite active
in the democratic movement before...

1643
02:10:38,498 --> 02:10:39,916
Even went to prison.

1644
02:10:39,999 --> 02:10:44,629
How come you're here now?

1645
02:10:45,088 --> 02:10:47,757
And you?
Why are you here?

1646
02:10:49,509 --> 02:10:54,180
Why'd you come here
stringing along that idiot Ahn.

1647
02:10:55,598 --> 02:10:57,517
I guess it's the same reason.

1648
02:10:58,101 --> 02:11:02,397
We're both here because of
what we desire.

1649
02:11:07,235 --> 02:11:08,862
But I, at least,

1650
02:11:09,612 --> 02:11:11,573
am not as dirty as you.

1651
02:11:13,700 --> 02:11:15,451
Whatever.

1652
02:11:18,454 --> 02:11:21,833
You introduced Ahn
to Jang and Oh, didn't you?

1653
02:11:21,958 --> 02:11:23,459
No, I didn't.

1654
02:11:25,378 --> 02:11:30,466
Why would a conglomerate head
and a politician need to meet a thug?

1655
02:11:31,009 --> 02:11:33,511
Doesn't make sense.

1656
02:11:33,845 --> 02:11:35,513
No?

1657
02:11:36,389 --> 02:11:37,640
Then let me see...

1658
02:11:38,850 --> 02:11:44,606
'Errand men' were hired to suppress
the strike of Mirae Motors in 1995,

1659
02:11:44,689 --> 02:11:49,485
then for the campaign of New Party
in 1996's general election,

1660
02:11:49,569 --> 02:11:53,364
and for Mirae Motors' purchase
of a factory site in 1998.

1661
02:11:53,656 --> 02:11:56,951
Now does it make sense?

1662
02:11:57,869 --> 02:12:00,997
People often use the phrase,

1663
02:12:01,289 --> 02:12:03,166
It's hard to see it as...

1664
02:12:03,625 --> 02:12:06,544
They write this often
in interrogation dossiers

1665
02:12:06,669 --> 02:12:10,173
and in newspaper articles.

1666
02:12:10,548 --> 02:12:15,261
But do you realize
it's nothing but wordplay?

1667
02:12:15,970 --> 02:12:18,473
It's hard to see it as pre-planned.

1668
02:12:18,806 --> 02:12:20,725
Hard to see it as intentional.

1669
02:12:20,850 --> 02:12:22,726
Hard to see it as related.

1670
02:12:22,727 --> 02:12:25,063
And, "Hard to see it as a request."

1671
02:12:25,271 --> 02:12:30,860
But how would that be applied
to a gangster like Ahn?

1672
02:12:31,694 --> 02:12:33,528
It's possible to see it as pre-planned.

1673
02:12:33,529 --> 02:12:35,113
It's possible to see it as intentional.

1674
02:12:35,114 --> 02:12:36,865
It's possible to see it as related.

1675
02:12:36,866 --> 02:12:38,867
It's possible to see it as a request.

1676
02:12:38,868 --> 02:12:42,830
Or we might even say,
'highly' possible.

1677
02:12:44,415 --> 02:12:46,292
What the fuck
are you trying to say?

1678
02:12:48,086 --> 02:12:49,754
I'm saying,

1679
02:12:50,213 --> 02:12:52,714
what is "hard to see it as"
for one person can be

1680
02:12:52,715 --> 02:12:56,594
highly possible to see it as
for someone else.

1681
02:12:58,972 --> 02:13:01,057
Words are power.

1682
02:13:01,432 --> 02:13:04,394
What kind of crazy fuck
would believe a thug's words?

1683
02:13:10,483 --> 02:13:12,902
It's already time
for the morning paper.

1684
02:13:13,987 --> 02:13:16,280
Can I read it?

1685
02:13:24,747 --> 02:13:27,582
Ahn Sang-goo who revealed
Mirae Motors' slush fund

1686
02:13:27,583 --> 02:13:30,168
hired a hit man in 2001

1687
02:13:30,169 --> 02:13:33,297
to assassinate a member
of a rival gang.

1688
02:13:33,423 --> 02:13:37,051
A killer named Choi
who was hired for the job

1689
02:13:37,093 --> 02:13:39,095
is currently in Daejeon Prison.

1690
02:13:39,220 --> 02:13:42,764
This was revealed in testimony
by a man named Park

1691
02:13:42,765 --> 02:13:45,810
who used to be the manager
of Ahn's gang.

1692
02:13:45,893 --> 02:13:48,437
In addition, the suicide of
popular dance group member

1693
02:13:48,438 --> 02:13:51,148
Min Jia in 2004
was allegedly sparked

1694
02:13:51,149 --> 02:13:55,403
by repetitive sexual assaults by Ahn,
who was her agent at that time.

1695
02:13:55,486 --> 02:13:58,448
Members of the group
are quoted as sources.

1696
02:14:01,951 --> 02:14:04,120
Fucking assholes!

1697
02:14:06,289 --> 02:14:08,875
I told you the truth!
Nothing but the truth!

1698
02:14:08,958 --> 02:14:10,877
It's not the truth that matters.

1699
02:14:11,461 --> 02:14:13,463
Now, no one believes
what you say!

1700
02:14:15,214 --> 02:14:19,177
We need evidence or witnesses
to make people to believe you.

1701
02:14:21,471 --> 02:14:22,889
Now tell me.

1702
02:14:24,599 --> 02:14:26,434
Did you or didn't you
hire the killer?

1703
02:14:29,854 --> 02:14:31,647
I did not.

1704
02:14:32,982 --> 02:14:36,527
You go to Daejeon and ask Choi.

1705
02:14:36,861 --> 02:14:37,987
And the sexual assault?

1706
02:14:38,154 --> 02:14:42,658
Min Jia had
severe depression then.

1707
02:14:43,159 --> 02:14:45,495
Ask fellow group member
Joo Eun-hye.

1708
02:14:45,787 --> 02:14:47,663
She'll tell you the truth.

1709
02:14:49,165 --> 02:14:51,250
I did everything you told me to.

1710
02:14:52,085 --> 02:14:56,172
You said you wanted to get Jang
and I did everything.

1711
02:14:58,549 --> 02:15:00,509
As I disclosed at the prosecutor's

1712
02:15:01,010 --> 02:15:05,223
I never introduced Ahn
to Oh and Jang.

1713
02:15:05,932 --> 02:15:11,020
I met Ahn several times
when I was doing research.

1714
02:15:11,187 --> 02:15:13,314
Are you saying Ahn lied?

1715
02:15:13,356 --> 02:15:17,110
Ahn's past record of
contract killing

1716
02:15:17,401 --> 02:15:22,573
and sexual assaults on his talent
is revealed.

1717
02:15:23,449 --> 02:15:26,452
I'm beyond appalled that

1718
02:15:26,577 --> 02:15:29,246
the reputations of a respected
businessman, a politician

1719
02:15:29,247 --> 02:15:31,790
and me as a journalist

1720
02:15:31,791 --> 02:15:34,960
who has always fought for freedom
and fairness of speech

1721
02:15:34,961 --> 02:15:38,631
have been tarnished by
the word of a thug.

1722
02:15:39,215 --> 02:15:41,050
She's been dead
for a couple days.

1723
02:15:42,093 --> 02:15:44,554
Seems she killed herself
by carbon monoxide poisoning.

1724
02:15:45,721 --> 02:15:48,724
And I went to see Choi...

1725
02:15:49,642 --> 02:15:51,686
he said he was hired by Ahn
to kill Kim.

1726
02:15:53,813 --> 02:15:59,402
It is possible to see this
as political manipulation

1727
02:15:59,735 --> 02:16:03,738
by a certain group which
incited Ahn to cause controversy

1728
02:16:03,739 --> 02:16:07,910
just before
the presidential election.

1729
02:16:17,420 --> 02:16:21,591
Let me modify one sentence.

1730
02:16:22,842 --> 02:16:24,886
Instead of 'possible, '

1731
02:16:25,261 --> 02:16:27,972
write it as 'highly possible.'

1732
02:16:29,599 --> 02:16:34,227
Moon, ex-accounting manager
of Mirae Motors, now living in Canada

1733
02:16:34,228 --> 02:16:36,813
said in a recent press interview

1734
02:16:36,814 --> 02:16:38,732
that he's never met Ahn

1735
02:16:38,733 --> 02:16:42,111
and the slush fund that
Ahn describes

1736
02:16:42,278 --> 02:16:44,697
never existed in the first place.

1737
02:16:44,780 --> 02:16:49,659
If Moon is telling the truth
it seems Ahn's claims related to

1738
02:16:49,660 --> 02:16:52,955
Mirae Motors' slush fund
have all been proven false.

1739
02:16:53,039 --> 02:16:55,373
Therefore it's difficult to see

1740
02:16:55,374 --> 02:16:59,170
how Oh and Jang might be
related to the recent allegations.

1741
02:16:59,295 --> 02:17:00,962
Damn little punks.

1742
02:17:00,963 --> 02:17:04,258
Now all eyes have turned to who
is behind Ahn's false disclosure.

1743
02:17:04,550 --> 02:17:07,844
Joo Eun-hye, from the same
dance group as the late Min Jia

1744
02:17:07,845 --> 02:17:13,517
whose suicide was caused by Ahn's
sexual assault, was found dead today.

1745
02:17:13,726 --> 02:17:17,604
Police see the cause of death as
suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning,

1746
02:17:17,605 --> 02:17:20,650
and plan to investigate Ahn's
possible connection to the case.

1747
02:17:24,153 --> 02:17:26,864
Take care, Mr. Chairman.

1748
02:17:34,664 --> 02:17:38,626
Is there any way to save Ahn?

1749
02:17:38,709 --> 02:17:42,046
Why didn't you
check his record?

1750
02:17:42,255 --> 02:17:44,507
That record was fabricated
to get Ahn.

1751
02:17:44,590 --> 02:17:45,800
None of that is true.

1752
02:17:45,841 --> 02:17:48,094
The truth doesn't matter anymore.

1753
02:17:50,096 --> 02:17:53,266
I'm also losing ground
within the party.

1754
02:17:54,141 --> 02:17:57,353
Accepting your proposal
has completely ruined me.

1755
02:17:59,480 --> 02:18:00,648
Damn it.

1756
02:18:02,358 --> 02:18:04,110
I need to look out for myself.

1757
02:18:07,655 --> 02:18:12,159
Politics is the survival of the country
and the people.

1758
02:18:13,202 --> 02:18:14,870
And also my survival.

1759
02:18:16,122 --> 02:18:17,206
Sure.

1760
02:18:18,374 --> 02:18:20,501
Now I understand what it means.

1761
02:18:22,211 --> 02:18:26,507
Then, you should also
look our for yourself.

1762
02:18:53,242 --> 02:18:55,119
- Hello, this is Woo...
- This is Editor Lee.

1763
02:18:55,745 --> 02:18:57,163
Are you well?

1764
02:18:58,998 --> 02:19:00,166
Yeah...

1765
02:19:00,374 --> 02:19:02,417
I just got a tip-off

1766
02:19:02,418 --> 02:19:06,339
and am concerned
if I should write about it or not...

1767
02:19:07,173 --> 02:19:08,341
What is it now?

1768
02:19:08,507 --> 02:19:11,886
You know Jo, president of
Joyang Mirae Development, right?

1769
02:19:13,095 --> 02:19:14,597
Yes, so fucking what?

1770
02:19:14,680 --> 02:19:18,851
A source said your father
received favors and money from him.

1771
02:19:20,269 --> 02:19:23,522
You check about it
and call me back.

1772
02:19:26,859 --> 02:19:29,235
This is President Jo
at Joyang Mirae Development.

1773
02:19:29,236 --> 02:19:31,822
Nice to meet you.
I'm Jo Yang-shik.

1774
02:19:34,992 --> 02:19:36,118
What did he say?

1775
02:19:37,953 --> 02:19:39,163
Well...

1776
02:19:39,288 --> 02:19:40,873
What can he say?

1777
02:19:42,500 --> 02:19:43,834
D... dad.

1778
02:19:45,252 --> 02:19:48,631
- Did you take the money?
- Jang-hoon?

1779
02:19:48,881 --> 02:19:50,633
Did you or didn't you
take the money?

1780
02:19:51,008 --> 02:19:53,010
What money
are you talking about?

1781
02:19:53,302 --> 02:19:57,390
You met President Jo
at Joyang Mirae Development?

1782
02:19:59,350 --> 02:20:04,980
You never accepted money,

1783
02:20:05,856 --> 02:20:06,940
am I right?

1784
02:20:06,941 --> 02:20:10,486
I didn't accept it.
I just borrowed some.

1785
02:20:10,611 --> 02:20:13,030
Real estate agent Kim
introduced him...

1786
02:20:44,895 --> 02:20:47,148
The Supreme Prosecutors' Office
will take Ahn's case.

1787
02:20:47,481 --> 02:20:50,401
You're suspended for 6 months
so leave your ID and get out.

1788
02:20:50,734 --> 02:20:52,653
So you're laying
all the blame on me?

1789
02:20:52,820 --> 02:20:57,366
Then why did a prosecutor
fuck around with a gangster?

1790
02:20:58,200 --> 02:21:01,829
And did you pick up a sponsor?

1791
02:21:02,621 --> 02:21:06,417
You know President Jo
at Joyang Mirae Development?

1792
02:21:10,713 --> 02:21:12,006
Goddammit.

1793
02:21:12,423 --> 02:21:16,260
I should kill myself for
supporting a nobody like you.

1794
02:21:17,094 --> 02:21:18,637
Get your ass
out of here, fucker!

1795
02:21:20,556 --> 02:21:23,976
Chief, I can't leave like this.

1796
02:21:24,226 --> 02:21:27,313
You know how I struggled
to get this far.

1797
02:21:27,646 --> 02:21:30,608
I was a dog for our organization

1798
02:21:31,066 --> 02:21:35,696
doing whatever
I was told to do. Sir!

1799
02:21:38,157 --> 02:21:40,034
Please give me one more chance.

1800
02:21:48,792 --> 02:21:50,419
Then you should've done better.

1801
02:21:52,755 --> 02:21:54,840
Or been born better.

1802
02:23:05,828 --> 02:23:08,163
Ahn just escaped!

1803
02:23:10,291 --> 02:23:12,042
What are you doing, sir?

1804
02:23:12,209 --> 02:23:13,209
Sir!

1805
02:23:15,170 --> 02:23:16,255
Sir!

1806
02:23:26,432 --> 02:23:27,474
Sorry, boss.

1807
02:23:44,491 --> 02:23:48,037
Boss, please forgive me.

1808
02:23:50,873 --> 02:23:52,708
I... did it only to survive.

1809
02:23:54,877 --> 02:23:56,003
Sorry.

1810
02:24:03,886 --> 02:24:05,679
Who killed Joo Eun-hye?

1811
02:24:06,555 --> 02:24:08,307
It was Jo...

1812
02:24:09,266 --> 02:24:10,768
Editor Lee ordered him to do it.

1813
02:24:13,979 --> 02:24:15,314
Why!?

1814
02:24:16,315 --> 02:24:19,610
She went to Lee
and threatened him.

1815
02:24:22,071 --> 02:24:23,656
She wanted to get you
out of trouble.

1816
02:24:51,767 --> 02:24:52,976
Cigarette?

1817
02:25:18,877 --> 02:25:21,964
We'll talk care of Lee Kang-hee.

1818
02:25:24,091 --> 02:25:25,634
You guys stay out of it.

1819
02:25:27,052 --> 02:25:28,804
I'll meet him myself.

1820
02:25:29,346 --> 02:25:30,681
Are you sure?

1821
02:25:31,932 --> 02:25:33,350
Oh boy...

1822
02:25:36,645 --> 02:25:38,772
Life it tough, goddamn.

1823
02:25:50,534 --> 02:25:51,535
Smuggle?

1824
02:25:51,869 --> 02:25:54,830
It seems many smuggle into
the Philippines these days.

1825
02:25:54,913 --> 02:25:58,709
There are thousands of islands
so why not?

1826
02:25:58,917 --> 02:26:01,294
No one can find you
if you go into hiding.

1827
02:26:01,295 --> 02:26:03,504
Also, it's a poor country so...

1828
02:26:03,505 --> 02:26:06,508
You can live like a king
with a bit of money.

1829
02:26:06,800 --> 02:26:07,800
Not bad.

1830
02:26:09,344 --> 02:26:12,722
We used to want to live well
like the Philippines in the old days.

1831
02:26:12,723 --> 02:26:14,016
What happened to us?

1832
02:26:15,267 --> 02:26:16,351
Okay.

1833
02:26:16,852 --> 02:26:18,854
Let's get Ahn involved somehow
in the article.

1834
02:26:19,313 --> 02:26:22,191
Add murder, sexual assault
and fleeing out of the country.

1835
02:26:22,483 --> 02:26:23,692
The title will be...

1836
02:26:24,109 --> 02:26:26,695
Biggest swindler of our time!
A Twisted Life.

1837
02:26:27,112 --> 02:26:30,199
Be as provocative as you can.
So, he goes crazy.

1838
02:26:30,824 --> 02:26:32,493
You agree on this, don't you?

1839
02:26:32,785 --> 02:26:36,038
Sure, company policy is clear.

1840
02:26:38,207 --> 02:26:40,292
Yes, I saw the news.

1841
02:26:41,752 --> 02:26:45,672
It's not really important
whether Ahn is arrested or not

1842
02:26:46,048 --> 02:26:47,549
at this point.

1843
02:26:48,759 --> 02:26:50,010
Yes, Chairman.

1844
02:26:52,471 --> 02:26:56,099
Who on earth would believe
what Ahn says?

1845
02:26:58,143 --> 02:26:59,269
Yes.

1846
02:27:03,065 --> 02:27:04,858
I didn't do anything.

1847
02:27:05,275 --> 02:27:08,028
It was Ahn's one-man-show.

1848
02:27:12,950 --> 02:27:14,076
Right.

1849
02:27:18,247 --> 02:27:19,998
Is it that funny?

1850
02:27:21,750 --> 02:27:23,919
Me doing a one-man-show?

1851
02:27:25,170 --> 02:27:26,547
Well...

1852
02:27:27,965 --> 02:27:31,552
I'll call you later.
I have a guest.

1853
02:27:36,431 --> 02:27:37,808
What brings you here?

1854
02:27:38,308 --> 02:27:41,019
I thought I should show you
how to sword dance.

1855
02:27:43,939 --> 02:27:47,609
You can come here
or shall I go there?

1856
02:27:48,318 --> 02:27:50,404
Don't be intimidated.
Come here.

1857
02:27:50,696 --> 02:27:52,906
I have something to ask you
as a brother.

1858
02:28:06,336 --> 02:28:08,255
We've known each other
for 20 years.

1859
02:28:09,464 --> 02:28:12,759
I never believed in Oh and Jang
but I believed in you.

1860
02:28:13,510 --> 02:28:14,511
Why?

1861
02:28:14,928 --> 02:28:16,471
Because we are brothers.

1862
02:28:17,431 --> 02:28:19,349
We're living in a shitty world

1863
02:28:19,641 --> 02:28:21,661
but brothers don't stab
each other in the back, do they?

1864
02:28:21,685 --> 02:28:22,936
Sang-goo.

1865
02:28:24,521 --> 02:28:26,899
That's why I told you to quit.

1866
02:28:27,482 --> 02:28:30,818
Did you forget
that if you nurse a grudge,

1867
02:28:30,819 --> 02:28:34,156
the knife will be
aimed back at you?

1868
02:28:36,283 --> 02:28:38,994
You're getting off track.

1869
02:28:40,412 --> 02:28:43,123
You think I'm doing this
because you betrayed me?

1870
02:28:44,541 --> 02:28:45,959
What do you want?

1871
02:28:50,047 --> 02:28:51,298
Let me ask you...

1872
02:28:53,008 --> 02:28:55,177
Did you really have to kill Joo?

1873
02:28:55,969 --> 02:28:57,346
Wasn't me.

1874
02:28:57,679 --> 02:28:59,514
Did you buy Moon off?

1875
02:29:00,182 --> 02:29:02,601
And order him to
deny giving me the file?

1876
02:29:03,518 --> 02:29:05,354
I don't know
what you're talking about.

1877
02:29:05,687 --> 02:29:07,189
Let me ask you one last thing.

1878
02:29:08,690 --> 02:29:10,359
Biggest swindler of our time!

1879
02:29:10,901 --> 02:29:13,987
Scoundrel who does contract killing
and habitual sexual assault!

1880
02:29:17,074 --> 02:29:18,659
Did that come from you?

1881
02:29:24,247 --> 02:29:26,291
For what?
You want this?

1882
02:29:40,973 --> 02:29:42,391
You son of a bitch!

1883
02:29:42,724 --> 02:29:44,726
You think I'm so easy?

1884
02:29:45,394 --> 02:29:47,145
How dare you come here?

1885
02:29:47,437 --> 02:29:50,857
You motherfucking gangster!

1886
02:29:59,741 --> 02:30:00,741
Fuck!

1887
02:30:05,163 --> 02:30:06,164
You motherfucker!

1888
02:30:18,635 --> 02:30:20,429
It's Jang!

1889
02:30:20,971 --> 02:30:23,306
He ordered everything.

1890
02:30:23,974 --> 02:30:25,809
Killed Joo,

1891
02:30:26,393 --> 02:30:32,691
and made you into a killer
and sex criminal!

1892
02:30:33,275 --> 02:30:35,485
It was all Jang's idea!

1893
02:30:39,781 --> 02:30:41,742
Which hand do you use
to wipe your ass?

1894
02:31:00,177 --> 02:31:02,179
Use the one that you've got left.

1895
02:31:02,721 --> 02:31:04,473
Don't even think about writing.

1896
02:31:31,958 --> 02:31:33,627
Kim Jung-ho, Criminal Department.

1897
02:31:34,211 --> 02:31:35,337
Yes,

1898
02:31:36,171 --> 02:31:37,798
what is the location?

1899
02:31:40,050 --> 02:31:43,303
Excuse me...
I'm here to turn myself in.

1900
02:31:50,852 --> 02:31:52,896
Did you really have to kill Joo?

1901
02:31:53,688 --> 02:31:55,273
Wasn't me.

1902
02:31:55,524 --> 02:31:57,234
Did you buy Moon off?

1903
02:31:57,859 --> 02:32:00,027
And order him to
deny giving me the file?

1904
02:32:00,028 --> 02:32:01,780
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1905
02:32:06,034 --> 02:32:07,702
It's Jang!

1906
02:32:08,411 --> 02:32:10,413
He ordered everything.

1907
02:32:11,373 --> 02:32:13,166
Killed Joo and

1908
02:32:13,875 --> 02:32:20,215
made you into a killer
and sex criminal!

1909
02:32:20,674 --> 02:32:23,135
It was all Jang's idea!

1910
02:32:24,052 --> 02:32:25,053
Did you listen to it?

1911
02:32:26,221 --> 02:32:27,556
Should be enough

1912
02:32:29,432 --> 02:32:31,017
to catch them all, right?

1913
02:32:35,939 --> 02:32:37,232
Something's eating you?

1914
02:32:39,192 --> 02:32:43,864
I'll take care of it from now on,
so please take care of yourself.

1915
02:32:44,990 --> 02:32:48,076
Hey, did you say 'please' to me?

1916
02:32:50,912 --> 02:32:53,582
Treat me as usual.
It feels awkward.

1917
02:32:55,041 --> 02:32:56,501
You met your father?

1918
02:32:59,421 --> 02:33:01,089
Be a good son to him
while he's alive.

1919
02:33:02,132 --> 02:33:05,218
If not, you'll regret it later like me.
Okay?

1920
02:34:25,465 --> 02:34:27,801
He ordered everything.

1921
02:34:28,426 --> 02:34:30,345
Killed Joo and

1922
02:34:31,012 --> 02:34:37,185
made you into a killer
and sex criminal!

1923
02:34:37,727 --> 02:34:39,187
It's all Jang's...

1924
02:34:41,982 --> 02:34:45,193
That won't serve as evidence.

1925
02:34:45,485 --> 02:34:49,072
A confession made under
coercion in fear of one's life

1926
02:34:49,197 --> 02:34:50,991
of course cannot be
accepted as evidence.

1927
02:34:51,533 --> 02:34:54,035
Then why are you here?

1928
02:34:58,373 --> 02:35:01,793
What would happen
if Jang listened to it?

1929
02:35:02,377 --> 02:35:04,713
Can't imagine he'd be happy.

1930
02:35:06,965 --> 02:35:09,134
You know how
the human mind works.

1931
02:35:09,384 --> 02:35:12,512
A small doubt
grows into deep distrust.

1932
02:35:13,179 --> 02:35:17,267
And he'd never appoint
someone who betrayed him.

1933
02:35:18,852 --> 02:35:20,562
What did you come to say?

1934
02:35:20,770 --> 02:35:22,897
Would you be okay

1935
02:35:24,357 --> 02:35:27,319
if someone else takes
the position Jang promised you?

1936
02:35:27,861 --> 02:35:31,906
You wanna start all over again?

1937
02:35:32,073 --> 02:35:34,784
You think I am picking a fight?

1938
02:35:39,080 --> 02:35:42,417
First... send me to
the Central Investigation Division

1939
02:35:43,960 --> 02:35:45,587
at the Supreme Prosecutors' Office.

1940
02:35:46,379 --> 02:35:49,341
I think it's a must-position
for a prosecutor.

1941
02:35:50,759 --> 02:35:52,969
Friends or enemies,
only two options.

1942
02:35:57,474 --> 02:35:59,351
My service to you.

1943
02:36:04,564 --> 02:36:08,443
What the prosecution needs now is
true reform and renovation

1944
02:36:08,526 --> 02:36:10,362
for the nation and people,

1945
02:36:10,445 --> 02:36:14,616
rather than false change
to get past its crisis.

1946
02:36:15,116 --> 02:36:17,452
From now on, we won't submit
to any pressure...

1947
02:36:17,786 --> 02:36:21,790
- Promoted to Supreme Prosecution?
- Yes, Central Investigation Division.

1948
02:36:22,499 --> 02:36:24,959
What shall we do, boss?

1949
02:36:34,177 --> 02:36:37,639
No need to get nervous.
Take it as a blind date.

1950
02:36:38,390 --> 02:36:39,474
Yes, sir.

1951
02:36:39,766 --> 02:36:42,936
Isn't Hwang from
Gyeongbuk Province?

1952
02:36:43,144 --> 02:36:45,271
Yes, he's from Gyeongbuk High.

1953
02:36:45,688 --> 02:36:48,650
- Fellow alumni of Kim Seok-woo?
- Yes.

1954
02:36:49,818 --> 02:36:51,318
The primary is
just around the corner

1955
02:36:51,319 --> 02:36:54,656
but the two are within
the margin of error.

1956
02:36:57,117 --> 02:37:02,789
A scandal between Kim
and Hanwoo Development.

1957
02:37:06,334 --> 02:37:10,713
I did the plot summary.
You release it when the time is right.

1958
02:37:11,297 --> 02:37:13,216
Yes, sir.

1959
02:37:30,400 --> 02:37:33,486
Hi, Mr. Jo, long time no see.
When did you come back?

1960
02:37:33,695 --> 02:37:35,029
A few days ago.

1961
02:37:35,780 --> 02:37:38,199
You didn't have to bring the liquor.
We have plenty.

1962
02:37:38,324 --> 02:37:41,327
I didn't want to be empty-handed
as this is my first visit.

1963
02:37:41,995 --> 02:37:45,415
He prepared the Chairman's favorite.

1964
02:37:49,586 --> 02:37:51,671
Oh, here you all are.

1965
02:37:53,465 --> 02:37:57,427
- Old foes as new friends.
- Now in the same boat.

1966
02:37:58,845 --> 02:38:00,013
Woo Jang-hoon.

1967
02:38:02,140 --> 02:38:04,100
I knew we would meet here.

1968
02:38:05,310 --> 02:38:07,061
I said he and I are similar.

1969
02:38:09,230 --> 02:38:10,857
And you look good!

1970
02:38:11,232 --> 02:38:12,400
Thank you, sir.

1971
02:38:13,026 --> 02:38:14,027
Welcome.

1972
02:38:19,699 --> 02:38:20,742
Hello.

1973
02:38:20,950 --> 02:38:24,370
This is Detective Choi, sir.
Need to report to you...

1974
02:38:24,537 --> 02:38:26,289
Why report
after everything's done!

1975
02:38:26,915 --> 02:38:31,419
Who do you think you are
calling me directly?

1976
02:38:34,672 --> 02:38:36,716
Damn motherfucker.

1977
02:38:37,258 --> 02:38:40,386
Should change the number.
Damn moron.

1978
02:38:40,678 --> 02:38:41,721
Who was it?

1979
02:38:41,930 --> 02:38:43,765
Never mind.
Let's go in.

1980
02:38:43,848 --> 02:38:45,934
- Let's go, Woo.
- Yes, sir.

1981
02:38:51,105 --> 02:38:52,273
Let's party!

1982
02:38:53,775 --> 02:38:57,153
In the New Party's
primary election today,

1983
02:38:57,278 --> 02:38:59,906
Jang Pil-woo was selected
as his party's candidate

1984
02:39:00,031 --> 02:39:04,202
for the December presidential election,
beating Kim Seok-woo.

1985
02:39:04,577 --> 02:39:09,791
Ladies and gentlemen,
I hereby accept the candidacy

1986
02:39:10,542 --> 02:39:15,755
expressing my sincere respect
for your great choice.

1987
02:39:16,089 --> 02:39:19,801
From now on,
whether you voted for

1988
02:39:20,051 --> 02:39:21,678
or against me,

1989
02:39:22,220 --> 02:39:24,472
we are all one.

1990
02:39:25,807 --> 02:39:28,142
I love you all.

1991
02:39:28,810 --> 02:39:30,478
Love you!

1992
02:39:30,979 --> 02:39:34,691
Jang Pil-woo!
Jang Pil-woo!

1993
02:39:35,316 --> 02:39:38,027
I'll begin a new era

1994
02:39:38,945 --> 02:39:42,824
for a righteous Korea!

1995
02:39:49,706 --> 02:39:50,707
Yes, boss.

1996
02:39:50,748 --> 02:39:52,667
- You got it?
- Yes, boss.

1997
02:39:52,709 --> 02:39:55,837
- Can we see the actors?
- Clearly!

1998
02:39:56,588 --> 02:40:01,843
Sons of bitches!
Spread it far and wide!

1999
02:40:06,931 --> 02:40:08,683
It's you, Mr. Woo!

2000
02:40:09,225 --> 02:40:11,184
Sincere congratulations
on your honorary promotion.

2001
02:40:11,185 --> 02:40:14,647
What brings you here?
Are you stalking me?

2002
02:40:14,689 --> 02:40:17,567
I'm back at Nation Daily.
You didn't know?

2003
02:40:18,151 --> 02:40:19,735
Let's cooperate well.

2004
02:40:19,736 --> 02:40:20,820
Hold on.

2005
02:40:21,404 --> 02:40:25,783
Yes, Chief.
I'm in the lobby.

2006
02:40:29,412 --> 02:40:31,079
Render unto Caesar
the things that are Caesar's.
No, not at all.
Take your time.

2007
02:40:31,080 --> 02:40:32,280
No, not at all.
Take your time.

2008
02:40:36,002 --> 02:40:37,045
What's this?

2009
02:40:37,587 --> 02:40:41,758
Chairman, I'll pick up
your shit from now on!

2010
02:40:42,925 --> 02:40:46,846
- Yes, you get it and eat it!
- You eat it!

2011
02:40:47,513 --> 02:40:48,890
Nation Daily...

2012
02:40:54,896 --> 02:40:56,438
- What?
- No, it's...

2013
02:40:56,439 --> 02:41:00,651
- I'm sorry for Seok Myung-kwan.
- Sorry for what?

2014
02:41:00,652 --> 02:41:03,404
He got more than his share...

2015
02:41:03,529 --> 02:41:05,989
He must've been pissed off.

2016
02:41:05,990 --> 02:41:07,867
I've nothing to
be pissed about.

2017
02:41:07,909 --> 02:41:11,704
My job is to "do as I'm told."

2018
02:41:14,248 --> 02:41:19,295
How did you make Moon Il-seok
change his mind?

2019
02:41:19,587 --> 02:41:22,674
When I gave him money,
he said he'd do anything for me.

2020
02:41:22,882 --> 02:41:25,093
There's nothing money can't get.

2021
02:41:25,259 --> 02:41:28,262
Technically, it's the bank's money.

2022
02:41:29,389 --> 02:41:32,183
The bank's money is my money!

2023
02:41:32,475 --> 02:41:34,769
There's no one
who didn't use my money!

2024
02:41:34,977 --> 02:41:39,315
Lee, you write and eat
thanks to my money.

2025
02:41:39,649 --> 02:41:41,150
And fuck, too!

2026
02:41:44,862 --> 02:41:45,780
Breaking news.

2027
02:41:45,822 --> 02:41:50,327
A video clip was dispersed
among the public this afternoon.

2028
02:41:50,410 --> 02:41:52,953
After acquiring the video clip
which was spread

2029
02:41:52,954 --> 02:41:55,372
via mobile phones and emails,

2030
02:41:55,373 --> 02:41:57,374
police have started an investigation.

2031
02:41:57,375 --> 02:42:01,169
Shown naked in the clip,
to the nation's shock, are

2032
02:42:01,170 --> 02:42:05,758
Mirae Motors Chairman Oh Hyun-soo
and presidential candidate Jang Pil-woo.

2033
02:42:05,842 --> 02:42:09,010
Furthermore,
the clip provides evidence

2034
02:42:09,011 --> 02:42:13,390
that the discredited allegations
concerning Mirae Motors' slush fund

2035
02:42:13,391 --> 02:42:15,143
all appear to be true.

2036
02:42:15,268 --> 02:42:19,647
As attention focuses on
who spread the clip,

2037
02:42:19,731 --> 02:42:22,607
an inside man who
claims to be the source

2038
02:42:22,608 --> 02:42:26,111
will disclose further details
in a press conference,

2039
02:42:26,112 --> 02:42:28,156
which is likely to
release further controversy.

2040
02:42:30,158 --> 02:42:32,827
There's no information on him yet,
and he hasn't arrived.

2041
02:42:32,952 --> 02:42:35,072
Rumor says it's the president
of Jang's campaign club.

2042
02:42:35,371 --> 02:42:37,611
It's supposedly the man who
supplies girls to Oh's villa.

2043
02:42:37,707 --> 02:42:40,084
It's likely his enforcer
who carries out all the errands.

2044
02:43:07,028 --> 02:43:10,698
Would they believe me
if I had evidence?

2045
02:43:18,039 --> 02:43:21,209
Well, who on earth would
believe a gangster?

2046
02:43:22,960 --> 02:43:27,048
But they'd believe you,
don't you think, Mr. Prosecutor?

2047
02:43:34,388 --> 02:43:36,015
Let's make a film together.

2048
02:43:38,267 --> 02:43:40,311
Listen to me carefully.

2049
02:43:42,104 --> 02:43:44,065
I'll escape today.

2050
02:43:54,659 --> 02:43:56,410
It's all Jang's idea!

2051
02:43:56,953 --> 02:43:58,913
He ordered everything.

2052
02:43:59,080 --> 02:44:02,834
You wanna get Jang and Oh
with Lee's confession?

2053
02:44:02,917 --> 02:44:06,754
You think I am an idiot?

2054
02:44:07,588 --> 02:44:11,425
Don't you know that a confession
made under coercion

2055
02:44:11,634 --> 02:44:13,719
in fear of one's life
cannot be accepted as evidence?

2056
02:44:16,514 --> 02:44:18,558
When I get Lee's confession,

2057
02:44:18,808 --> 02:44:21,102
you go and make a deal with it.

2058
02:44:22,645 --> 02:44:23,813
A deal?

2059
02:44:25,439 --> 02:44:27,275
My good service to you.

2060
02:44:27,483 --> 02:44:29,776
Yes, you make a deal
and jump on their wagon.

2061
02:44:29,777 --> 02:44:31,571
Mr. Jo, it's been a while.

2062
02:44:32,029 --> 02:44:34,490
Didn't have to bring the liquor.
We've got plenty.

2063
02:44:44,750 --> 02:44:46,460
If you want to catch a tiger,

2064
02:44:46,794 --> 02:44:49,088
you have to go in its cave.

2065
02:44:51,632 --> 02:44:56,429
So you're telling
me to become an insider?

2066
02:44:56,554 --> 02:44:59,140
Either catch a tiger
as an insider,

2067
02:45:00,558 --> 02:45:05,271
or live like a loser
in the countryside.

2068
02:45:12,153 --> 02:45:14,572
It's your call.

2069
02:45:22,330 --> 02:45:25,374
I wanted to see for myself.

2070
02:45:25,541 --> 02:45:29,962
So I decided
to become an inside man.

2071
02:45:31,923 --> 02:45:33,841
Mirae Motors Chairman
Oh Hyun-soo,

2072
02:45:33,925 --> 02:45:36,260
presidential nominee
Jang Pil-woo,

2073
02:45:36,344 --> 02:45:39,847
and Lee Gang-hee,
Editor-in-chief of Nation Daily

2074
02:45:40,139 --> 02:45:43,184
deceived the entire nation

2075
02:45:43,309 --> 02:45:48,356
without hesitation or shame,
for nothing but their own benefit.

2076
02:45:49,148 --> 02:45:51,192
As you can see from the clip,

2077
02:45:51,275 --> 02:45:54,195
they made Ahn Sang-goo
who revealed their true nature

2078
02:45:54,278 --> 02:45:57,114
into the biggest swindler
of our time.

2079
02:45:57,323 --> 02:46:02,828
Ahn once did unforgivable things
working for them

2080
02:46:03,371 --> 02:46:07,583
but that doesn't mean
we can regard what he says as false.

2081
02:46:08,167 --> 02:46:10,628
Ahn regretted his actions,

2082
02:46:10,711 --> 02:46:13,005
took everything
he saw and heard,

2083
02:46:13,297 --> 02:46:17,259
and exposed it as the truth.

2084
02:46:18,177 --> 02:46:20,596
Shit... I'm fucked.

2085
02:46:20,680 --> 02:46:25,977
Oh bought off Moon,
ex-accounting manager of Mirae Motors

2086
02:46:26,227 --> 02:46:27,979
and ordered him to lie.

2087
02:46:28,354 --> 02:46:32,525
This is the slush fund file
that Ahn received from Moon.

2088
02:46:32,900 --> 02:46:38,114
And it is genuine.

2089
02:46:42,410 --> 02:46:44,162
You were also in the clip yourself.

2090
02:46:44,163 --> 02:46:46,330
Can you disclose your name
and occupation?

2091
02:46:49,417 --> 02:46:52,795
My name is Woo Jang-hoon.

2092
02:46:54,547 --> 02:46:55,881
Prosecutor of Korea.

2093
02:46:59,176 --> 02:47:02,053
When the insider turned out to be
prosecutor Woo Jang-hoon,

2094
02:47:02,054 --> 02:47:07,435
at CID of Supreme Prosecutors' Office,
it caused quite a stir.

2095
02:47:07,685 --> 02:47:11,229
Politicians are calling for
a thorough investigation of the agency.

2096
02:47:11,230 --> 02:47:13,106
Today's revelation by an inside man

2097
02:47:13,107 --> 02:47:15,734
disclosed the deep-rooted
back scratching relationship

2098
02:47:15,735 --> 02:47:17,653
between politics, industry
and the media.

2099
02:47:17,778 --> 02:47:21,698
Congressman Jang
is maintaining silence

2100
02:47:21,699 --> 02:47:24,784
while disobeying
the prosecution's summons.

2101
02:47:24,785 --> 02:47:26,703
The prosecution is said to be

2102
02:47:26,704 --> 02:47:29,123
considering putting
an all-points bulletin

2103
02:47:29,206 --> 02:47:31,082
on Jang, who is already

2104
02:47:31,083 --> 02:47:35,046
banned from leaving
the country.

2105
02:47:35,296 --> 02:47:36,881
I am so fucking lonely.

2106
02:47:38,924 --> 02:47:41,844
Jo, you son of a bitch!

2107
02:47:42,178 --> 02:47:45,389
You like this?
You want more?

2108
02:47:45,556 --> 02:47:48,100
You fucking asshole!

2109
02:47:48,684 --> 02:47:49,684
What?

2110
02:47:50,978 --> 02:47:53,564
What the fuck are you saying?
You bastard!

2111
02:47:53,647 --> 02:47:56,067
Whatever, empty that!

2112
02:47:56,150 --> 02:47:57,150
Yes, sir!

2113
02:47:59,028 --> 02:48:00,028
Go fuck yourself!

2114
02:48:01,530 --> 02:48:02,698
Asshole...

2115
02:48:04,825 --> 02:48:06,327
Good bye, asshole.

2116
02:48:39,860 --> 02:48:41,278
6 MONTHS LATER

2117
02:48:45,741 --> 02:48:48,410
Lawyer Woo's office,
how may I help you?

2118
02:48:50,204 --> 02:48:52,414
He's in court now.

2119
02:48:53,082 --> 02:48:56,210
Yes, when he gets back
I'll tell him to call you.

2120
02:48:59,880 --> 02:49:02,842
Excuse me, you're not
allowed to smoke here.

2121
02:49:07,179 --> 02:49:11,851
But adultery laws were abolished
early this year!

2122
02:49:13,269 --> 02:49:16,647
It's not me who abolished it.
Why yell at me?

2123
02:49:29,076 --> 02:49:30,536
Hey, gangster!

2124
02:49:32,079 --> 02:49:34,123
Damn rude bastard...

2125
02:49:39,461 --> 02:49:40,838
Very nice view.

2126
02:49:42,464 --> 02:49:45,718
I guess they fed you well
in prison. You look...

2127
02:49:46,093 --> 02:49:47,386
awful.

2128
02:49:49,805 --> 02:49:51,765
You still don't watch your mouth.

2129
02:49:53,517 --> 02:49:55,978
Having fun after quitting
the prosecutor's office?

2130
02:49:56,729 --> 02:49:58,355
Of course not.

2131
02:49:58,606 --> 02:50:01,442
I miss the days
I got my monthly pay.

2132
02:50:02,318 --> 02:50:05,778
You gonna stay here forever?
You need to groom a bit

2133
02:50:05,779 --> 02:50:07,907
and go there across the river.

2134
02:50:10,784 --> 02:50:12,870
You must've received
love calls from the congress.

2135
02:50:13,120 --> 02:50:15,789
Woo Jang-hoon,
lonesome hit man of justice.

2136
02:50:17,041 --> 02:50:19,001
You're saying I should
follow in Jang's footsteps?

2137
02:50:19,376 --> 02:50:23,839
To fail or to succeed.
You'll never know unless you start.

2138
02:50:25,424 --> 02:50:26,592
Are you scared?

2139
02:50:30,471 --> 02:50:31,805
If so, I can go myself.

2140
02:50:32,973 --> 02:50:34,225
Screw you.

2141
02:50:35,142 --> 02:50:37,978
Let me treat you
a decent meal.

2142
02:50:38,062 --> 02:50:39,480
I liked the food I had in prison.

2143
02:50:40,147 --> 02:50:41,899
Or since the weather's nice,

2144
02:50:42,233 --> 02:50:46,528
- we can have Mojito at the Maldives.
- That sounds good too.

2145
02:50:50,324 --> 02:50:51,575
Where is the Mojito?

2146
02:50:52,993 --> 02:50:54,453
- Damn.
- I know, I know!

2147
02:50:55,955 --> 02:50:57,122
It's in Japan!

2148
02:50:57,915 --> 02:50:59,083
You make me crazy.

2149
02:51:00,501 --> 02:51:01,585
Or in China?

2150
02:51:11,887 --> 02:51:13,889
LEE BYUNG-HUN

2151
02:51:14,765 --> 02:51:16,850
CHO SEUNG-WOO

2152
02:51:17,851 --> 02:51:19,853
BAEK YUN-SHICK

2153
02:51:20,729 --> 02:51:22,690
Directed by WOO MIN-HO

2154
02:51:23,691 --> 02:51:26,067
Any characters, places, company
or organization mentioned in the movie

2155
02:51:26,068 --> 02:51:28,319
and every events and episodes
are all fiction and made up.

2156
02:51:28,320 --> 02:51:30,360
If any of those really exist
it's all a coincidence.

2157
02:52:01,145 --> 02:52:02,146
Yes?

2158
02:52:04,440 --> 02:52:05,441
Yes.

2159
02:52:06,734 --> 02:52:08,652
Prison food wasn't so bad.

2160
02:52:10,404 --> 02:52:12,323
I had time to think.

2161
02:52:12,781 --> 02:52:14,283
It was okay.

2162
02:52:19,371 --> 02:52:21,582
You tried chewing dry squid?

2163
02:52:22,374 --> 02:52:24,626
But the squid is very tough to chew.

2164
02:52:26,086 --> 02:52:28,088
Will you keep chewing it?

2165
02:52:28,714 --> 02:52:29,757
I thought so.

2166
02:52:31,091 --> 02:52:34,428
Who would keep chewing it
when it hurts your teeth.

2167
02:52:35,554 --> 02:52:37,097
It's all the same.

2168
02:52:37,598 --> 02:52:40,017
All they want is something

2169
02:52:40,100 --> 02:52:45,606
they can chew on at parties
and on the internet.

2170
02:52:50,944 --> 02:52:54,990
They will chew on it
but get bored and move on.

2171
02:52:55,657 --> 02:52:58,994
Teeth hurts and
they're busy with other matters.

2172
02:53:01,038 --> 02:53:02,373
That's right.

2173
02:53:03,290 --> 02:53:05,459
We just have to

2174
02:53:06,460 --> 02:53:09,046
stay strong and be tough.

2175
02:53:10,672 --> 02:53:12,383
Koreans tend to be hot-headed.

2176
02:53:13,300 --> 02:53:16,720
We boil up quick
but get cold fast.

2177
02:53:18,222 --> 02:53:23,185
Just throw them something to chew on
time to time.

2178
02:53:24,853 --> 02:53:26,897
What they want...

2179
02:53:28,107 --> 02:53:29,900
it's not the truth.

2180
02:53:33,278 --> 02:53:35,989
Throw some concerns
to those who want concerns.

2181
02:53:36,031 --> 02:53:38,700
Give a baby reason to cry
if the baby wants to cry.

2182
02:53:39,368 --> 02:53:43,664
And throw some gossip
to those who want to speak ill.

2183
02:53:44,415 --> 02:53:49,503
After concerning and crying
and swearing

2184
02:53:50,337 --> 02:53:52,339
they'll blow some steam off

2185
02:53:53,799 --> 02:53:56,510
and get tired eventually.

2186
02:53:59,263 --> 02:54:00,389
Pardon?

2187
02:54:16,155 --> 02:54:17,489
My right hand?

2188
02:54:19,992 --> 02:54:22,286
I can write with my left hand.
