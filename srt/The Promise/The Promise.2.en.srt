1
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:17,080
I have to go see mum in Melbourne.

2
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,560
Take care of yourself.

3
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,000
Young man, you forgot something.

4
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:38,960
Thank you.

5
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,160
I almost missed it.

6
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,440
Phu!

7
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,360
Nan!

8
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,400
Holy fuck!

9
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,640
Is that really you or am I hallucinating?

10
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:06,080
What do you mean, Nan?

11
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,080
Don’t tell me that this is …

12
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,120
It really is me.

13
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,520
You haven’t changed at all.

14
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,600
Phu!
I’ve missed you so much.

15
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,880
I’ve been calling everyone to find out where you’d gone.

16
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,080
I thought you’d died!

17
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,760
Have you moved into Joe’s condo?

18
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:39,080
Phu! Phupa! That’s your friend:
The one who you said you grew up with and went to school with,

19
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:44,800
who disappeared without a trace?

20
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:49,520
Is this your girlfriend?
She’s not shy, is she?

21
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:54,400
No … but not for the lack of trying. I’ve been friend zoned.

22
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:57,480
She’s a colleague from work.

23
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:05,240
See!
I told you that if you wore pink, you’d be lucky in love and lucky in game.

24
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,560
Huh?

25
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,960
Friendship is a type of love.

26
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:16,960
Did you know Nan has talked about you since I started working.

27
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:22,440
I thought you were a metaverse character or an imaginary friend,
like a coping mechanism, you know?

28
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,320
Be quiet!

29
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,400
(man)

30
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,560
Hello!
Hello, Nan Fah!

31
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:43,160
Yes, Man, I’m going to be a little late because of all this traffic.

32
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:46,160
What traffic? I can’t hear anything. Don’t lie to me.

33
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,840
If you keep this up, I’ll get Ken to fire you.

34
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,400
Hold him.

35
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,600
Sorry!

36
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,480
He’s asked me to do it.

37
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:05,160
No problem. I’m not going anywhere.

38
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,560
Hello? I can’t hear you.
There’s so much traffic here.

39
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,160
Why must you act like this all the time?

40
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:15,360
I’m nearly there. See you soon.
Hello? Hello?

41
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,880
Take this.

42
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:27,440
His name is Oliang. He’s my guarantee

43
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,000
that you won’t disappear again. Understand? I’ll be back to pick him up later.

44
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,800
You’re leaving him with me?
Yes.

45
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,960
I’ve missed you so much.

46
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,560
Really?

47
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,800
Gie Gie, quick!

48
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,320
Why not make it straightforward?

49
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:45,200
Apply this cream, and you look younger with better skin.

50
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,960
The product is great. There’s no need for a monologue.

51
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,960
That’s too generic.

52
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,240
We’re the experts.

53
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,840
Like when you stretch your back,
if you understand your physiology,

54
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,920
you’ll know what not to do.

55
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,960
Everyone over 30 has a bad back.

56
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,120
Personally, I think it’s because of

57
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,280
all the responsibility of being handsome I have to carry.

58
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,880
Look at how firm that is.

59
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,840
Do you want to get rid of your back pain?

60
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,880
Let me help!
I have taken yoga classes.

61
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,320
Really?
Really. Trust me.

62
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,480
Lie on your back.

63
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:23,920
Lie down. Trust me.

64
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:27,040
Now lift your hands

65
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,200
and pull.

66
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:43,840
Oh, wow! Yeah, I feel it here.
You know what you’re doing.

67
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:51,040
How does that feel?
Not so great anymore.

68
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:57,960
Come on. 1. 2. 3.
Ouch!

69
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:09,560
What was that?
Why can’t I move?

70
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:16,680
Man,
I’ll work on this and pitch it to you again tomorrow.

71
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:21,280
Sleep tight. I’ve got to go now.

72
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,560
Hey, where are you going? Help me.

73
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,120
Where is he hurrying off to?

74
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,240
Today is a special day for him. He’s got to rush home.
Let’s go.

75
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:34,200
Hang on!
Come and help me up first. I can’t move.

76
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,680
Phu!

77
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:58,240
Phu, are you there?

78
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,680
I’m not letting you out of my sight.

79
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,120
Sorry.

80
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:05,760
Oliang!
Are you hungry?

81
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,800
Must be his birthday or something.

82
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:26,120
Oliang Just wait

83
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:44,640
Damn! This place is amazing!
Look at that view.

84
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,720
It really is great.

85
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,720
I couldn’t have afforded this alone.

86
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,840
This bed is awesome.

87
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,760
I’m taking this bed!

88
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,000
Hang on! Get up a minute.
What?

89
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,680
This bed’s got a view.

90
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,680
So has that one!
There is nothing but a wall.

91
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,720
We’re paying the same.
Let’s play rock, paper, scissors for it!

92
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,200
Come on then.

93
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:11,040
I win!
Go on. You go over there. Move!

94
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:24,320
No! That was so scary.
I’m afraid of ghosts and walls. Let me take this one.

95
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,600
I’m afraid of those things, too!

96
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,600
If you were really afraid, you’d move the bed over here.

97
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,480
You want me to move it closer to you?
Yeah.

98
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:42,440
We need a 6-digit code for the door.

99
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,360
Why don’t you add my student number to yours,

100
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:53,920
then our 13-digit ID number, divide that by 5,
and take the final 6 digits of that as the code.

101
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:58,640
Yeah, great idea. Very smart.
Nobody would be able to guess that.

102
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:02,240
Not even you!
Are you mad? It doesn’t need to be so complicated.

103
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,840
Too hard?
Yes!

104
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:08,200
Imagine trying to put that code in when we come home drunk!

105
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:13,280
Then …
I’ll just use your birthday.

106
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,560
That’s nice and simple.

107
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:18,200
You won’t forget your own birthday, will you?

108
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,240
I won’t, but will you?

109
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:29,520
060433

110
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:52,160
Oliang!

111
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,560
Oliang, are you hungry?
What are you saying?

112
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:11,440
Look
Your bowl is full. What’s with the moaning?

113
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:14,480
Have you missed me?

114
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,720
You haven’t changed a bit.

115
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,240
Phupa’s Coffee

116
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
It’s like a botanical garden in here.

117
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,760
Stop smiling!

118
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,720
What are you smiling at?
Get out of my way!

119
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:49,920
This is an example of what you will be doing.
This station is all about friendship and cooperation.

120
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,520
I’ll place a ping pong ball between the foreheads of each pair.

121
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:58,160
The first pair to reach the finish line without their ball falling will be declared the winner.

122
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:04,160
The winning prize is a Bento set imported from Hokkaido.

123
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:13,760
The losers will have to eat a bowl of noodles
with chilies, fish sauce, and your own tears.

124
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:19,400
Get up! 1, 2, 3, 4, 5!

125
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,640
Is he a drill sergeant?

126
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:25,800
I think he’s just taking it out on us.

127
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:31,960
What are you two chatting about?
Nothing!

128
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:38,760
Don’t you dare speak
when your elders are talking. Get it?

129
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,720
Yes!
Good.

130
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:46,480
Quickly! Get out the way!

131
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,920
We’d better not lose. I don’t want noodles with fish sauce.

132
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:05,440
There’s no need to be so competitive.
I’ll take you to dinner after all this.

133
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:09,240
It’s a matter of honor.
Get it?

134
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,480
You’re just like your father.

135
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,560
Don’t bring my father into this!

136
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,840
Shit!

137
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,440
Hi, Granny!

138
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,720
Is he home?

139
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:55,360
We were talking about cats earlier.
I forgot to tell you that I had sent you some catnip.

140
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,520
It’s express mail. You’ll probably get it tomorrow.

141
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,640
Thank you so much.

142
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:10,320
Oh yes, I also sent you the human equivalent.

143
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,640
My research team has tested it.

144
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:24,080
It’s quite good. Very relaxing.

145
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:28,000
I knew you were up to something.
Look at my eyes.

146
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:38,200
I have no trouble sleeping, but I’ll get my friend to try it.
I miss you, Granny. Bye!

147
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:52,720
Oliang!

148
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,440
Oliang, where are you?

149
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:57,440
Are you in here? Oh, there you are.

150
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:04,800
Are you hungry?
I know I am!

151
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:18,800
What’s that noise?

152
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:24,520
There must be a mouse in here.
Oliang, it’s your Joeb to catch them.

153
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,720
Have you been eating my fish?

154
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:36,000
Let’s count them: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
Good. They are all still here.

155
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:43,760
In that case, I’m going to make you some crab fried rice instead,

156
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,680
but you must wait here, ok?

157
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,920
That’s right. Wait right there.

158
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,480
What are you looking at?

159
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,520
What’s vibrating?

160
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:35,920
There’s nothing there.
I’ll finish making the dinner.

161
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,680
smell good

162
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:41,000
Dinner’s ready, Oliang.
Come on, come out to eat.

163
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:18,080
How did you know I was here?

164
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:22,280
With all that snoring? Of course, I knew.

165
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:27,760
You knew all along and
still didn’t wake me up.

166
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,440
My back is killing me.

167
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:34,040
How can you complain when you’ve snuck into someone else’s room?

168
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:37,240
What else could I do? Oliang was making such a fuss.

169
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:39,760
I had to come and see what it was all about.

170
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:44,280
It’s your fault for still using our old passcode.
It’s my birthday, and I don’t like sharing.

171
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,720
I just can’t be bothered making up a new one.

172
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:57,600
Are you hungry? I’m starving. Hang on a minute.

173
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:09,920
Let’s eat.
You’re inviting me?

174
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:12,920
Me?
Yes, you.

175
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:17,880
No, you’re inviting me.
You even made an extra plate for me.

176
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,800
Whatever. Eat.

177
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:25,600
You’re lucky
to have this amazing meal.

178
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,600
Eat!

179
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,320
Is this what you call amazing?
It certainly is.

180
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:50,320
You’ve got too much free time.
Look at all these fish you’ve managed to breed.

181
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:54,400
I heard these fighting fish get pregnant

182
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:58,040
from just looking into each other’s eyes.

183
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,200
That’s not true.

184
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:05,320
The male looking at the female
stimulates ovulation.

185
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:10,480
Then the female releases the eggs
and the male fertilizes them.

186
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,440
What are you staring at?
I’m not a fighting fish.

187
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:29,000
I’m not trying to get you pregnant.
I just want to know where you’ve been.

188
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,680
I … I went to stay with my mum in Melbourne.

189
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:45,280
I can tell when you’re lying
because you start blinking.

190
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:49,400
There’s more to it than that, isn’t there?

191
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:58,520
Are we going to eat or what?
If not, let’s give it to Oliang.

192
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,200
Hang on.

193
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:09,120
Look me in the eyes and tell me again where you were.

194
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,400
Answer it. They’ve been calling for ages.

195
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:51,400
Hello?
Nan, open the door. I’m outside.

196
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,400
Okay.

197
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:06,920
Oh?
I was knocking on the wrong door?

198
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:11,520
Did you change the door?
That’s not cool.

199
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:14,840
No, this is my friend’s room.

200
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:17,840
Friend?
Yes.

201
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,080
Oh … Hello!
Hi!

202
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,520
Nan, have you eaten yet?
I’ve bought your favorites:

203
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:33,680
crab fried rice and cheesecake.
The line was so long; I was standing there forever.

204
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:38,600
I … I …
Come eat!

205
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,480
I’ll help you with the project.

206
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:45,720
I’m sorry about this. The company has been calling him,

207
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:50,480
but he hasn’t been answering the phone.
I had to come in person.

208
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,880
Phu … I …
Go eat! It’s fine.

209
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:08,280
When did you get a cat?
Be careful. It might end up dying of starvation like its owner.

210
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:14,480
You should thank me for getting you something to eat.

211
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,760
It’s still piping hot.

212
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:32,280
I’ve been here so many times,
but why have I never met this friend of yours?

213
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:36,640
He just moved in this morning.

214
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,520
Oh, is that why you weren’t at work?

215
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:05,560
What would you make of it
if your best friend disappeared

216
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:11,800
like for ten years
with no news at all

217
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:23,520
then reappeared next door after all that time?

218
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:28,240
If it isn’t fate, it’s awfully odd.

219
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:41,760
Let me ask: who is a closer friend, me or him?

220
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:58,200
What kind of question is that?
Come on. Let’s eat and then get on with the Joeb.

221
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,440
You want that again?

222
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:12,000
I don’t even want to think what Man will think.

223
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:07,200
Last night I forget to ask for your number I hurry to work  Can you take care Oliang for me, he's in my room (Password is the same)

224
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:23,360
Oh my goodness!

225
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,680
Is this really where you sleep?
It’s a mess.

226
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,600
Stop eating frozen food (it contains preservatives, and eating it often causes cancer).

227
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:31,200
Quit gathering worn-out items (the refrigerator is not a trash can). Other things will also be ruined by it.

228
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,840
Oliang!

229
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:24,440
Don't let the clothes fester (the fabric will accumulate germs, bacteria, and your room will stink).

230
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:33,400
Stop using sleep aids to avoid dementia and a worn-out body. Go out for a run and go to bed early. Quit playing on your cell phone before going to bed; it may help.

231
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:53,320
Holy shit! Jackie the superstar
has flown to Korea to have plastic surgery

232
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:55,000
in preparation for his next role as a highschooler.

233
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,240
What?

234
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:59,640
Ken just messaged.
We’ve got to change the presenter immediately..

235
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:02,520
He says undergoing plastic surgery
doesn’t align with our brand image.

236
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,160
This is stressing me out.

237
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,200
But we’ve already signed the contract with Jackie.

238
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,120
Him doing that has broken the terms of the contract.

239
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:12,800
Our brand is based on sustainability
and silicone is a form of plastic.

240
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,320
I don’t think that’s the point.

241
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:18,000
The point is that the surgery will be huge news

242
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,840
and it will contradict the key message
that our cream can make you look younger.

243
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:30,800
We’ve got to find a suitable replacement.
Ken will be back tomorrow.

244
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:34,680
Tomorrow? That’s less than 24 hours.

245
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,560
Shit!

246
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:42,960
No idea, but we need to divide and conquer.
Tomorrow, we’ll present our findings.

247
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:46,640
Man …
Wait!

248
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:22,760
Fuck!, where’s my computer?

249
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:36,840
Stop eating frozen food (it contains preservatives, and eating it often causes cancer).

250
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:44,160
Stop using sleep aids to avoid dementia and a worn-out body. Go out for a run and go to bed early. Quit playing on your cell phone before going to bed; it may help.

251
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:53,080
This is Phu’s handiwork.

252
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:06,720
Shit! I forgot to pay the electricity bill.

253
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:40,360
This is just fucking perfect.

254
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,200
Ouch!

255
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:54,400
Ow!
Ugh!

256
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:32,440
What’s wrong?

257
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:41,280
Look at that!

258
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:49,320
Take a look at this nightmare.
I’m going to end up depressed after this.

259
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:53,120
What are you on about? It’s just a power outage.

260
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:57,480
I must’ve forgotten to pay the bill.

261
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:01,160
Can I work at your place?

262
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,640
You’re such an idiot.

263
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:08,200
It’s a power cut to the whole building.
Didn’t you see the announcement in the lift?

264
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:08,880
What?

265
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,280
Yes.

266
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,640
Wake up, will you?

267
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:18,560
I was about to go out
and then I heard you moaning and groaning, so I came in to see what was up.

268
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,480
I have to go.

269
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:23,680
Hang on!
Where are you going?

270
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,760
I’ve got stuff to do.

271
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:30,240
Oh yeah, Oliang is at my place.
I gave him some of my grandma’s catnip

272
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,160
and now he’s asleep.
Alright, I’m off!

273
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:39,240
Meow!

274
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,760
What are you meowing for?

275
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,880
My boss is back tomorrow,

276
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:48,240
and I have no power and can’t work.

277
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:51,640
Please let me go with you.
I promise I’ll be quiet.

278
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,560
Meow!

279
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:58,640
Phu, do you know
how many people were asking about us?

280
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:03,520
I just told them you hadn’t been in touch.
All our friends thought we’d had a fight,

281
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:08,760
but I always knew
you’d come back.

282
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:17,360
Phu,
when did you get back exactly?

283
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:24,720
Phu,
can you hear me?

284
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:27,840
Yes, but let me concentrate on the GPS.

285
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:32,480
Whatever. I’m just glad you’re back.

286
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:37,720
I was so lonely by myself.
This is better despite your one-word answers.

287
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:44,520
Hey!

288
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:46,280
Watch where you are going!

289
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:56,960
Were you seeing anyone over there?

290
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,520
From time to time.

291
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:01,280
Did you get to eat Thai food?

292
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,320
Here’s a power strip.

293
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,440
Thank you.

294
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:15,200
He came back
to sing for you?

295
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:21,440
It’s a form of repaymemt
for helping him out with the coffee shop.

296
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:27,360
He wants to open a coffee shop
that sells the beans his grandma grows.

297
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,600
Really?
Where?

298
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,800
Are you two really friends?

299
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:38,040
It’s that place you both liked to go to
when you were at uni.

300
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:42,000
The owner was a dick.

301
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:47,960
He arranged to meet us super early
but won’t sell us the place for some reason.

302
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:54,320
Did you mouth get you into trouble again?

303
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:58,640
Oh, it’s almost time for the live concert!
There is no watch on your wrist.

304
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:07,360
Ha ha.
Phu’s going to get us lots of customers tonight!

305
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:31,200
Excuse me! when will he start his set?

306
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,400
He’s just finishing the sound check. Not long now.

307
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,760
Can we have the bill, please?

308
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:39,880
This is a disaster, Joe.
When is he going to start? The customers are getting impatient.

309
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:46,000
Phu!

310
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,240
Phu!

311
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,400
Haven’t you finished that yet?

312
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:34,120
No.
I have made no progress at all.

313
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:38,680
When you were in Melbourne, did you know of any Thai celebrities?

314
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:41,120
Who was the most popular one you knew?

315
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:47,400
I didn’t watch any TV. I knew of no one.
Why are you asking me?

316
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:52,320
You didn’t read any of my emails, did you?

317
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:57,080
I work in marketing for a skincare company.

318
00:43:57,080 --> 00:44:01,960
I’m asking you as a consumer.
Which celebrity would attract you to our products?

319
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,840
These?
Yes.

320
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:16,520
I’m too old
to be swayed by a celebrity.

321
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:20,200
I make choices
based on what is best suited to my skin.

322
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:22,720
If I really like something, I’ll stick to it.

323
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:40,480
Just like that coffee shop?

324
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:45,080
Joe was telling me that you wanted the one across from uni.

325
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:48,720
News travels fast around here.

326
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,200
What’s so special about it?

327
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:55,200
I’ve looked at many.
That one is just the best.

328
00:44:56,840 --> 00:45:00,360
Damn!
You always have such a unique perspective.

329
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:13,120
Hey!
Phu!

330
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:18,880
You mean that we choose something
because we have experienced it, right?

331
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:25,800
Phu, thank you so much! I’ve got it!

332
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:30,840
Can you help me with something else?

333
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:35,520
What?

334
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:39,160
Turn left.
Now go straight.

335
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:42,360
What the heck are we doing?
Keep going. We’re nearly there.

336
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:45,880
Are we there yet?

337
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:48,040
Yes.

338
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:50,520
Ta da!

339
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:52,840
Wow!

340
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:57,120
Here it is.
My secret base.

341
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:59,000
Do you like it?
Yes.

342
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:03,200
I come up here when I can’t sleep
or am struggling for inspiration.

343
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,920
Hmm

344
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,640
You’ve been on your own all this time,
and you still can’t sleep?

345
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:17,240
And …
The other condo owners don’t mind this?

346
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:19,840
Pff! Nobody cares.

347
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:25,040
They used to hang laundry out up here,
but everyone uses laundromats nowadays.

348
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:33,080
Why did you ask me to bring the weed up here?
Don’t tell me…

349
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:36,200
Let’s chill.

350
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:06,440
I feel great.
I don’t know whether

351
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:12,760
it’s your grandma’s weed
or because I figured out that project,

352
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:18,240
or because you’ve come back into my life.

353
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:28,880
You know, we haven’t celebrated your return yet.
Shall we?

354
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:32,840
Are they still selling alcohol?
I don’t drink anymore.

355
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:36,760
What?
Why?

356
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:39,640
I don’t want to get drunk.

357
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:45,600
What’s up with you?
It’s okay every once in a while.

358
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:50,760
The last time I was properly drunk

359
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:54,840
was with you—after graduation.
Remember that?

360
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:10,320
We’ve done it. Let’s drink!
Cheers!

361
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:19,720
Phu

362
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:28,400
I really love you, you know.
I couldn’t have graduated uni without your help.

363
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:37,720
You’ve forgotten something.
Without me you wouldn’t have even finished high school!

364
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:56,920
Phu, promise me
that we’ll always be together.

365
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,320
Of course! I promise.

366
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:09,000
I don’t believe you.
Wait here…

367
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:18,560
We must have this in writing.

368
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:19,880
What am I doing?

369
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:28,200
Write on this.
The word “promise.”

370
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:35,200
You want me to write the word “promise”
On this? Sure.

371
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:43,200
Here! Promise.

372
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:51,800
Will you ever forget this?

373
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:56,160
No way! How can I?

374
00:49:57,320 --> 00:50:00,320
Then write “I won’t forget.”

375
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:04,080
You want more?
Okay.

376
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:11,200
Done.

377
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:12,800
Your name, too!

378
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:14,360
My name, too?
Yes.

379
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:20,040
Happy now?

380
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:31,120
Yes, I am.

381
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:42,560
Is this beer or poison? It tastes like shit!

382
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:45,280
You just can’t handle your alcohol.

383
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:53,200
Phu …
What’s next?

384
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:58,240
I feel odd.

385
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:04,880
Are we going to end up with our dream jobs?

386
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:08,040
What do you want to do?

387
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:10,600
Me?

388
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:14,320
I want to open a coffee shop.

389
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:18,440
The smell of it makes me think of my dad.

390
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:21,800
It makes me feel like he’s there by my side still.

391
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:24,880
Why don’t you move in with your dad?

392
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:34,800
Oh, I’m only kidding…

393
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:45,240
Can I ask why you studied advertising with me?

394
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:51,440
I …

395
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:55,360
I’m tired… I’m going to bed.

396
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:56,760
Hey!

397
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:59,000
Hey! Wait a minute.

398
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:01,360
Phu!

399
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,440
Let me ask you something.

400
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:11,120
Why did you disappear?
Why did you cut off contact?

401
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:12,920
Why?

402
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:20,840
What if I tell you
that I’m not ready to tell you yet?

403
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:25,680
Okay. Okay.

404
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:29,200
When you’re ready, I’ll be ready.

405
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:34,920
I only ask one thing of you:
Don’t ever leave me again.

406
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:42,600
I’m sleepy now, too.

407
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:44,000
You know,

408
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:49,800
this is the first time I haven’t needed medication to sleep.

409
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:53,720
I haven’t fallen asleep before 2 a.m. in almost 10 years

410
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:13,080
Nan, you don’t want to know why I left.

411
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:18,440
Well, why are you here to study advertising with me?

412
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,520
I …

413
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:36,520
I… I think I’m drunk.

414
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:41,280
Hmm… I know

415
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:45,880
you did it because you love me.

416
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:57,440
I love you, too.
