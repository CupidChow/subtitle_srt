1
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,640
- Kopi.
- Kopi.

2
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,360
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

3
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22,320
It smells great.

4
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,440
Let's go give it a try.

5
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,440
You know we'll be late for class, right?

6
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,640
It'll only take a minute.

7
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:28,840
Alright?

8
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,040
Okay. Okay.

9
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,440
Two cups of kopi, please.

10
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,560
Coming up.

11
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,840
They have the same type of coffee your dad used to serve.

12
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,600
But this one is weird.

13
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,280
Where are all the customers?

14
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,760
Come on.

15
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:57,920
I want me some kopi.

16
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,640
We'll be late for class.

17
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,120
It's only a minute or two.

18
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,080
- Doing this is good, right?
- Yes.

19
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,400
Hello.

20
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,960
(Sale for business)

21
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,840
(Sale for business, only some people.)

22
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,520
Phu...

23
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,360
I'm already exhausted from running.

24
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,120
What are we doing here?

25
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,760
I'm supposed to present my project.

26
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,520
Pity my poor body, won't you?

27
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,320
I still need to go home to shower.

28
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:36,880
Oh?

29
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,000
If you came to me, you would've opened it by now.

30
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,200
Instead you went to Joe and his potty mouth.

31
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,120
Phu!

32
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,200
Phu!

33
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,880
Come on.
The middle lane is free.

34
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:54,080
Quickly!
Come on!

35
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,600
Who are you?

36
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,080
Who are these people?

37
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,880
Hi!
Hello!

38
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,200
I must apologize for my friend's behavior the other day.

39
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,720
Yes.

40
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,920
He's off his meds.

41
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,440
We've taken him to many psychiatrists.

42
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:31,200
Do you remember me?

43
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,400
I used to order a sweet, rich kopi from you.

44
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,480
Daddy, who are these people?

45
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:43,760
I used to be your father's regular way before you were even born.

46
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,400
Does that make you important somehow?

47
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,880
I'm beginning to understand Joe now.

48
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,480
No, no...

49
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:02,520
I'm just saying I used to be a regular.

50
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,840
Oh, I remember now...

51
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,080
You were looking to buy the place, right?

52
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:08,840
Yes, that's right.

53
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,760
You're too late.

54
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,560
What happened?

55
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,160
Someone has already made an offer.

56
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,680
She's even paid the deposit.

57
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,800
What?

58
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,960
It's the mum of Patrick's friend from school.

59
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,320
She is going to make it a nail salon.

60
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:26,880
Patrick...

61
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,240
Can you tell me who she is?

62
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,720
I've got to go now.

63
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Phu...

64
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:53,760
If you like it so much, just come here more often.

65
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,200
Are you saying I need my nails done, Nan?

66
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,400
Nan, wait for me please.

67
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,800
Why were you MIA last night?

68
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,400
What about my celeb suggestions?

69
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,760
I need to book them in advance, you know?

70
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,360
Nan...
Does Plan B work?

71
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,720
Nan Fah...

72
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,760
Why haven't you gotten the team to look into the celebs' availability?

73
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,840
We can't present the list to Ken

74
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,920
without knowing their availability and charges.

75
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,960
What the hell are you doing?

76
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,520
You've been working here for years.

77
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,440
Do I have to re-teach you everything?

78
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,840
Everybody, stop!

79
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,760
Listen to me.

80
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,560
Please wait until the meeting.

81
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,520
Nan, wait.

82
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,840
Here we go with the show again.

83
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,720
Who does he think he is?

84
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,440
Why does he have no respect for me?

85
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,640
I don't think it's funny.

86
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,760
Not funny at all.

87
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,040
You won't pass!!

88
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,080
Nah Fah.

89
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,840
Ken will see to that.

90
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,880
Hey!

91
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,680
Nah!

92
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,840
You okay?

93
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:36,840
I'm okay.

94
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,200
But I'm not.

95
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,600
This is a group chat.

96
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,000
Oops!!!

97
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,000
First of all,

98
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I'd like to inform you

99
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,920
that I have had our Legal team speak to Jackie's management.

100
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:08,520
I have also spoken to him personally.

101
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,640
Wow! So that ended well?

102
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:16,560
It did, but what about us?

103
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:22,800
We've still got to find a presenter fast

104
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:26,360
to ensure our marketing plan can still go ahead.

105
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,080
The billboard we've rented

106
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,560
must also be ready on time.

107
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,280
What?

108
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,800
In 3 weeks?

109
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,280
Don't worry about that, Ken.

110
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,560
I've tasked Nan Fah to come up with a plan.

111
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,800
Go ahead, Nan Fah.

112
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,400
Have you got any interesting celebs?

113
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,640
I've checked.

114
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:01,840
All the best ones are fully booked,

115
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:05,720
and I don't want to use a presenter who has worked with other brands.

116
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:10,320
I've looked into options that are more suitable than a celebrity presenter.

117
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,440
Unfortunately, I feel that limiting ourselves to

118
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:15,240
such individuals is holding us back,

119
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,480
though I do have an idea.

120
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:36,200
Future Biotechnology for Men's Skin

121
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,080
Our mission is to build understanding for our products among our target demographic,

122
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:42,280
which is men over 30.

123
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:45,360
We need to communicate to them

124
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,080
that we use highly potent stem cell extracts.

125
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,520
Our biotechnology,

126
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,920
which we've researched for more than 5 years,

127
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,480
maintains the properties of these extracts,

128
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:03,120
nourishing and repairing skin

129
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,080
at a cellular level.

130
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,160
They can provide solutions for a range of skincare problems.

131
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:10,360
Our rejuvenating products are easy to use

132
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:13,720
and suitable for the lifestyle of modern men.

133
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:17,440
This is why our next presenter

134
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,480
should be...

135
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,400
a regular man.

136
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,520
However, this ordinary man

137
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,840
places great importance on his skincare routine.

138
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,840
He is also interesting.

139
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:43,280
All of this says choosing Devonte

140
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:46,720
is choosing the best for yourself.

141
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,880
Fantastic, Nan!

142
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,800
What are you talking about, Nan?

143
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,720
Can't you see that Ken isn't on board.

144
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,360
Our brand represents the highest technological standards

145
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,280
and expensive ingredients that aren't typically available in Thailand.

146
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,680
How can our presenter be a regular man?

147
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,280
It's not suitable.

148
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,360
Right, Ken?

149
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,000
Man...

150
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,000
Look at Nan Fah. He's presenting right now.

151
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,640
Just look.

152
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,000
Keep looking.

153
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,560
It's free.

154
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,600
Okay.

155
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,800
My lips are dry.
Got some lip balm?

156
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,280
I've got some Tiger Balm.

157
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,720
I think his idea is cool.

158
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:38,920
Our products resonate with people who care about quality

159
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,680
and who select the best products available.

160
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,600
If they like something,

161
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,520
they'll stick with it forever.

162
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:54,040
I like how you are thinking.

163
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:02,440
An ordinary man
with extraordinary taste.

164
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,600
But the challenge will be

165
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:08,920
to find a presenter who fits the bill.

166
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,320
Let me take responsibility for that.

167
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,680
Let me help, too.
We'll get it done.

168
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,360
I'll help as well.

169
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:22,920
I think I know just where to find him.

170
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,840
Don't forget the deadline.

171
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,760
Let me head this project.

172
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,440
I've got the skills for the job.

173
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,960
- How did you like my presentation?
- Excellent!

174
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,960
You've got game.

175
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,960
Not telling anyone what you were up to.

176
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:02,120
Presenting by yourself and taking all the glory.

177
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,840
Well, when I was working on it last night,

178
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:09,400
I didn't see you volunteering to help.

179
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,720
Pathetic.

180
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,320
Forget about him.

181
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,200
You've done well.

182
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:33,560
I was wondering why you went MIA last night.

183
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,520
Let's celebrate tonight.

184
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,480
I want a cold drink.

185
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,120
Today?

186
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,600
I can't.

187
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,000
I've got something to do.

188
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,600
You've forgotten me now you've got that new friend.

189
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,680
It's not like that...

190
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,200
Then what is it?

191
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,720
Alright... If you're free,

192
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,560
come and help with something.

193
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,360
With what exactly?

194
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,960
What are you doing here?

195
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,120
Picking up your kid?

196
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,840
Trust me.

197
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,800
Ahem!

198
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,120
Ahem!

199
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,960
Ahem!

200
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,520
What's up, old man?

201
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,720
I'm not that old.

202
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:52,280
I've bought you some snacks.

203
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,440
No, thank you! I'm trying to lose weight.

204
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,400
What game are you playing?

205
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,520
None of yours.

206
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:17,560
I can help you pay for items in the game.

207
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:21,320
Special ones.
Deal?

208
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,160
What do you want from me?

209
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,360
Alright. Fine.

210
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:33,720
I want to know the lady who is buying your father's old café.

211
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,720
Introduce me to her, will you?

212
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,720
A million.
It'll cost you a million.

213
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,960
A million!

214
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,680
That's a bit much, fatty!

215
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:53,160
Hey! Don't bully a little kid.

216
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,800
I'm sorry.

217
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,920
That's still a bit much.

218
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,560
No money, no talk.

219
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,760
Ooh!

220
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:33,000
Do you like her?

221
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,120
Quit it.

222
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,600
Fair enough.

223
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,240
Oh!

224
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,600
Look at those boys staring at her.

225
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:52,360
You can't compete with them, can you?

226
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,240
So...

227
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:58,120
Do you like her or not?

228
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,640
If you do, you should let her know.

229
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,360
Are you crazy?

230
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,560
I can't.

231
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,160
Do you always chicken out in front of the ladies?

232
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,800
I agree.

233
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,600
If you like her, you should tell her.

234
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,280
I know that from experience.

235
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,200
Hey!

236
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,120
Who have you secretly fancied?

237
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,840
I don't mean it like that.

238
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,040
I mean...

239
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,640
It's important.

240
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,160
If I didn't tell someone that I liked them,

241
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,440
I'd regret it for life.

242
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,360
Who's studying advertising?

243
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,560
Me, me, me!

244
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,200
Who's studying advertising?

245
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,400
Me, me, me!

246
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,840
Who's studying advertising?

247
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,040
Me, me, me!

248
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,320
Who's studying advertising?

249
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,520
Me, me, me!

250
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,320
Hey!

251
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,040
We've gone past your house!

252
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,120
Eat those vegetables.
They're good for you.

253
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,640
Nathi, give me your plate.

254
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,520
How is school these days?

255
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:12,640
Work hard! You'll graduate soon enough.

256
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,920
And you, Namnuea?

257
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:17,520
No, thank you.

258
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,680
Huh? Why?

259
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,240
There's no way he'll let me study advertising.

260
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:28,400
He thinks
if you study medicine, you become a doctor.

261
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,480
So, if he asks me what I'll do with an advertising degree,

262
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,080
what am I going to tell him?

263
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,680
Just talk to him like we practiced.

264
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,800
He won't understand.

265
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,200
My brother and sister are in medical school.

266
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,080
I'm the black sheep of the family.

267
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,520
If I don't get in,

268
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,880
he'll have me take over the family's pharmacy.

269
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:54,200
This is your last chance.

270
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:57,040
If you don't tell him, your chances are 0.

271
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,800
If you tell him,

272
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,040
there's at least a chance.

273
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:05,320
Are you going to give up on your dream
and just take over the pharmacy?

274
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,960
It's up to you.

275
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,440
Can you do it?

276
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,440
Yes, I can!

277
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,760
Can you do it?

278
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:20,400
Yes, I can!

279
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,040
Can you do it?

280
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,040
Yes, I can!

281
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,280
Hi, Mum! Hi, Dad!

282
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:29,240
What does your story have to do with this?

283
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,720
It's all the same.

284
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,120
Here!

285
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,040
Take this chocolate over to her.

286
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,840
Everyone likes chocolate.

287
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,920
It makes everyone happy.

288
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:45,440
Don't you want to see her smile?

289
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,320
Come on. Take all of this.

290
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:59,240
I can't. Who's going to smile at a fatty like me?

291
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,080
You won't know if you don't try.

292
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:04,160
If you don't try, your chances are 0.

293
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:08,360
But if you do, who knows what could happen?

294
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,160
Aah!

295
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,040
Aah!

296
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:30,160
Aah!

297
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,520
Minnie!

298
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,320
Ouch!

299
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,960
You fat little...

300
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:49,880
Oops!

301
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,320
Hey!
Patrick, are you okay?

302
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,320
You're Patrick, right?
Thank you.

303
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,960
And you?

304
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,360
I think it's broken.

305
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,160
Gie Gie!

306
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,160
What are you up to?

307
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,240
Phupha!

308
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,640
Is Nan Fah home?

309
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,560
He's not answering my calls.

310
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,920
Didn't he go into work?

311
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,160
Yes,

312
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,760
but when he finished the presentation
he left to go somewhere with Party.

313
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,520
Those two are like twins.

314
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,360
They're always together.

315
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,320
Party...

316
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,720
The one who comes here to work with Nan Fah?

317
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,560
Are they very close?

318
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,640
Very close.

319
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:57,640
I forgot the keycard,
so I can't take all this to Nan's room.

320
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,600
Could you let me in?

321
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,600
Oh, yes.

322
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,800
Thank you.

323
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,080
Does Nan Fah usually give his passcode
to his colleagues?

324
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:20,360
Just me and Party.

325
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:24,240
He needs me to pick up things all the time.

326
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:27,960
Party, he's mostly here to party.

327
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:41,040
Thank you so much.

328
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,080
Oliang!

329
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,920
Do you mind if I play with Oliang a little?

330
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:45,840
Oliang.

331
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,160
Ouch!

332
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,160
I had to practically beg Dad

333
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:57,640
to get her to come see us.

334
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:00,200
You owe me a pizza for this.

335
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,840
No problem.

336
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:07,280
Make it count.
Don't waste time.

337
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,480
Jiab?

338
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,000
That's right.

339
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,560
Hello!

340
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,000
Hi!

341
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,120
Say what you've got to say.

342
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,520
I've only got 30 minutes.

343
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,680
I'll get straight to the point.

344
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,160
Ok.

345
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:36,200
This used to be our regular coffee shop
when we were at university.

346
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,600
Now that it's up for grab,
my friend would very much like to buy it.

347
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,320
Er...

348
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:49,960
It's an amazing location.

349
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:53,600
I am planning on opening a nail salon.

350
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,800
Jiab, here's why.

351
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:04,400
My friend's dad had a coffee shop in Chiang Mai.

352
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:09,760
When his dad died of heart disease,

353
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:14,160
they had to close it down.

354
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,520
When we got to university,

355
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,080
we came across this place.

356
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:24,720
The coffee was just like what we used to drink.

357
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:28,440
It made my friend happy.

358
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:35,520
The aroma and taste
made him feel like

359
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:39,760
he was with his father again.

360
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:48,000
I sympathize with you,

361
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,120
but I've already paid a deposit

362
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:56,320
and started planning.

363
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,520
More importantly...

364
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,920
I promised my mum

365
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:07,960
before she passed away that I'd open

366
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:13,040
a nail salon of my own to make her proud.

367
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:19,920
On her death bed she told me

368
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:26,160
it had to be at a location exactly like this.

369
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:42,200
Her story is as heartbreaking as yours.

370
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,560
You've got so many fish.

371
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,400
How many?

372
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,600
Oh, you've got coffee, too.

373
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,600
Do you like coffee?

374
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,240
Yes, I do.

375
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,560
And books?

376
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,200
Correct.

377
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,480
Me too.

378
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,880
My favorites are the prayer books.

379
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,080
Look at all these plants.

380
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,240
It feels like a forest!

381
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,240
What's this picture?

382
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:35,040
Never forget.

383
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,480
What does that mean?

384
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:38,800
Nothing.

385
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,240
I just wrote it as a joke when we were at uni.

386
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,960
It's lovely.

387
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:44,720
Put it out here.

388
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,480
Why would you hide it away?

389
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:53,760
Your room is so vibrant.

390
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,480
It's nothing like Nan's room.

391
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:58,600
His room is soulless.

392
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:12,520
What's that?

393
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,240
I'll read your fortune for free.

394
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,360
Pick one.

395
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:18,920
Really?

396
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,480
Place it here.

397
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,680
Don't look so confused.

398
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,080
Wheel of Fortune.

399
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:39,480
This could mean an event is about to occur

400
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:43,200
over which you have no control.

401
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:47,600
Expect the unexpected.

402
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,840
In a good or bad way?

403
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:56,920
It could be either.

404
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:59,040
That's all I know.

405
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:02,440
Is something bothering you?

406
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,560
It's nothing.

407
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,520
Anyway, do you like coffee?

408
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:19,920
I'm a bit of a coffee addict, to be honest.

409
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:25,200
That's why I've got my own cup.

410
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,560
Wow!

411
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,840
I thought it was some other kind of juice.

412
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,920
Oh, no, no, no!

413
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,720
Just kidding.

414
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,400
Let me make you some coffee.

415
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,600
Are you going to roofie me?

416
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:41,120
I'm not that kind of girl.

417
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,880
In that case, you'd better go.

418
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,320
I'm kidding...

419
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,560
- Is this your coffeemaker?
- Oh, yes!

420
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:52,200
It's so cool.
I've never seen anything like it.

421
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,760
They call this a syphon.

422
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,720
It's like a cross between a Mokka pot and a drip.

423
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:00,760
The result is neither too intense, nor too weak.

424
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:06,120
These beans are from my Granny's farm in Chiang Mai.

425
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,600
You're a coffee expert.

426
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,080
You even have your own farm.

427
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,880
You should open your own coffee shop.

428
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:18,880
That's the dream,

429
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,520
but I've run into an obstacle.

430
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:22,960
Expect the unexpected.

431
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,600
That's what the card has foretold.

432
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:29,440
But will it be good or bad?

433
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,440
It must be something good.

434
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,080
Smell that.

435
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,640
Careful. It's hot.

436
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,520
It smells amazing.

437
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,160
Nah!

438
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,520
Joe!

439
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,200
The table's inside.
I'll be there in a minute.

440
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,680
Ok.

441
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:07,040
Is that your friend?
He's quite something.

442
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,840
That's Joe, the owner.

443
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:15,240
If I'd known I'd get hurt helping you,

444
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,280
I'd have stayed home drinking by myself.

445
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:20,720
That's why I owe you a drink.

446
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,160
Go all out!

447
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,720
It's my way of paying you back.

448
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:31,320
Here we are, same as before.

449
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,280
Ouch!
Hey!

450
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,160
Sorry!

451
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,360
I didn't see you there.

452
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,280
Are you his new friend?

453
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,920
Enjoy!

454
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,920
He doesn't seem so cool anymore.

455
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,800
Can I punch him?

456
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,280
Calm down.

457
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,600
Here!

458
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,480
Have some more.

459
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:59,520
Have we come here because of him?

460
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,200
The more, the merrier!

461
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,240
You are doing a whole lot for him.

462
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,400
Does he know what's going on?

463
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,560
Of course not.

464
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,880
There's no need to tell him.

465
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,640
Alright.
Cheers!

466
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,800
He sat on my hand.

467
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,520
That very hurt.

468
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:39,080
You're such a drama queen. Is that better?

469
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,040
Is that better?

470
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,640
No?

471
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,600
How about now?

472
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:03,600
Party, you alright?

473
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,120
Okay. Keep drinking.

474
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:08,160
Pour. To the top!

475
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,280
Phu! Wait!

476
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,160
Come drink with us.

477
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,320
I told you I don't drink.

478
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,680
I'm going home soon.

479
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,200
I'm worried about Oliang.

480
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:25,680
What are you worried about?

481
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,240
Oliang's probably asleep already.

482
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,560
Stay here with us.

483
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,120
I'll go home with you later.

484
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:33,560
It's okay. I'll take you.

485
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,040
You?
Taking me?

486
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,600
Look at yourself?

487
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,240
You can't even take yourself home.

488
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,480
Call a cab.

489
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,120
Leave the car here.

490
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,480
I can drive.

491
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,600
I'm not drunk.

492
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,520
Yes, you are.

493
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,600
Okay, I'm off.

494
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,480
Bye.

495
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:54,200
Alright. Alright. We're all going.

496
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,120
The end.

497
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:59,520
And who are you going with?

498
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,680
Hold on tight.

499
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,040
Yes.

500
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,760
Hey! Hey! Hey!

501
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,160
I said hold on.

502
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,440
You focus on driving!

503
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,480
I'm about to fall off.

504
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,720
I said hold tight.

505
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,440
Ah...

506
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,920
Go, go, go!

507
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,000
You're such a burden.
Turn right.

508
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,080
Right to what? It's a wall.
Turn left.

509
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,600
We are here.

510
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,960
Let me do it.

511
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:05,360
It's my room.

512
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,560
But that's my cat.

513
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,480
Wait a moment.

514
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:15,840
Oliang!

515
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:20,240
Here is your cat.

516
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,400
Oliang,

517
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,880
I've missed you so much.

518
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,120
I haven't seen you in so long.

519
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,600
Oliang, over here!

520
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:35,440
Oliang!

521
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,400
Hey!

522
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,960
About your coffee shop.

523
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,000
Forget it.

524
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:50,000
If I can't have that location,

525
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,880
I'll probably just sell my coffee beans instead.

526
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:59,200
"Moo" (Coffee shop owner)

527
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:01,960
Nan!

528
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,680
Moo, the coffee shop owner is calling.

529
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:06,960
Answer him!

530
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,760
Hello?

531
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,240
Hi.

532
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:16,000
My first buyer has dropped out
and is asking for her deposit back.

533
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,320
Are you still interested?

534
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:21,800
If you are still interested,
you can come in and sign the contract tomorrow.

535
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,120
Of course!

536
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:25,520
I'm interested.
I'm very interested.

537
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,320
I'll be there as soon as I can.

538
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,760
Thank you!

539
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,000
Nan!

540
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,600
I got the place!

541
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:58,840
(Previously)

542
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:07,760
Hey!

543
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,280
I need a piss.

544
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,600
Just go.

545
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:14,240
I'm scared. It's... it's...

546
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,720
It's what?

547
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:19,520
There's something there.

548
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:26,960
Doesn't it seem strange to you
that he's kept the shop shut all this time

549
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,640
despite its excellent location?

550
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:36,560
Lately things have randomly fallen.

551
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,800
What the hell!

552
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,160
Patrick!

553
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:42,960
Where did he go?

554
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:43,880
I don't know.

555
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:44,640
What the hell!

556
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,960
The back storage room.

557
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:49,840
What the hell?

558
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,480
Dad told me not to go in there.

559
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,720
I've seen it.

560
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,880
Just a body.

561
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,280
No head.

562
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,120
What is it,

563
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:04,480
Mum? Okay.

564
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:10,480
My Mum doesn't want me to have this anymore.

565
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:13,840
The location and the feng shi are off.

566
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,880
I'm in a hurry.

567
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,400
Would you still like to buy it?

568
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,960
I can speak with the owner.

569
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,920
I'll clear things regarding the deposit.

570
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:21,760
Good luck.

571
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,520
I've got to go.

572
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:25,560
Something's come up.

573
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:37,440
That was great!

574
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,960
Are you ready, Mr. President?

575
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,680
I am.

576
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,120
Okay.

577
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:55,000
1, 2, 3... Yay!

578
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:01,120
It's official now.

579
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,840
What's that smile for?

580
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,600
I can't tell if you're happy or drunk?

581
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:09,000
You'll be seeing this smile every day from now on.

582
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:16,240
Here's your paperwork, Mr. President (in Korean).

583
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,720
Thank you (in Japanese).

584
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,120
I said that in Korean.

585
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:22,000
I'm going against the mainstream.

586
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:25,280
One sec...
Yeah, yeah.

587
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,600
I'm going in.
Alright.

588
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,360
What's up, Gie Gie?

589
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,440
Nan Fah, Man is on my case.

590
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:34,560
He doesn't think we've found a presenter.

591
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,880
So he wants us to send him photos.

592
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:38,560
Okay.

593
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,760
I'll be quick.

594
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:48,360
Please let the presentation go well today.

595
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:53,080
Nan!

596
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:57,240
Ken will be here for the meeting in 5 minutes.

597
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:58,160
Yeah.

598
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,280
Wait!

599
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,640
Where did you put the product samples?

600
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:06,520
What product samples?

601
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,880
I'm so sorry.

602
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:18,880
I'd typed the message but never hit send.

603
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,600
Yesterday the factory sent us samples.

604
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,960
I put them in your room.

605
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:27,400
Ken wants to see them today.

606
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,960
I'm so sorry.

607
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,200
We're so screwed.

608
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:36,880
I'm sorry.
What are we going to do?

609
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,960
He's not picking up.

610
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,160
Ahem!

611
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,080
Ahem!

612
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,160
Ahem!

613
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,560
Do you need a lozenge?

614
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,720
Yeah, I'll have two pills, please.

615
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,000
Stop messing around.

616
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:15,400
Where are the samples?

617
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,160
Gie Gie, you said Nan Fah had them, right?

618
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:20,840
Er...

619
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,000
I... I...

620
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,600
I didn't bring them with me.

621
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:26,800
What?

622
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:32,480
It's unprofessional to forget the samples for your presentation.

623
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,680
We are discussing the presenter today,

624
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:37,160
but the products are also important?

625
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:40,920
We need to see them with the talent.

626
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:45,360
You've really messed up this time.
Oh my god!

627
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:46,760
Hey! Oh why!

628
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:51,600
What are we going to do?
Come on, tell me!

629
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:56,840
I first talk about the presenter.

630
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:59,200
The products will come in good time.

631
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:02,360
Goodness me, I am beyond tense,

632
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,920
and you are making it worse.

633
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:10,480
I'll put product images up in the background.

634
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,680
You'll be able to see what we're trying to do.

635
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:14,400
It doesn't feel the same.

636
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:17,840
Don't make excuses for each other.

637
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,520
How can you mess this up?
It's so simple.

638
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,480
How many years have you been doing this?

639
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:24,480
Don't stand to apologize,
I've had enough.

640
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,440
I won't accept any apology.

641
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,400
Good morning, Ken!

642
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,560
Please have a seat.

643
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:48,120
Okay. I'd like to present our timeline.

644
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:49,280
Don't bother.

645
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,880
Let's get on with the presenter issue.

646
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,680
Phu, I need your help.

647
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:00,160
I forgot the product samples in my room.

648
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,360
Can you bring them here?

649
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,400
I'll share the location.

650
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:06,400
The Gen Y target audience of males over 30

651
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,800
are independent,

652
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,960
knows the value of treating themselves,

653
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:13,440
and have some worldly experience.

654
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:19,920
I believe that it's best that we

655
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:23,640
don't use a known public figure for this campaign.

656
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:34,400
Nan Fah, are you kidding me right now?

657
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,560
You're wasting Ken's time.

658
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:37,240
Quiet for a moment, Man.

659
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,440
Please finish what you were saying.

660
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,800
Here are the candidates.

661
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:46,440
First one: Ohm,

662
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:48,080
a national team swimmer.

663
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:49,440
Hello?

664
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,160
Are you at the restaurant already?

665
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:55,120
Hainanese chicken on rice with no chicken.

666
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,680
Next up is Non,

667
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:03,480
- a chef specializing in French cuisine.
- A delivery?

668
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:05,080
Yes, just leave it in front of the house.

669
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,720
Someone will get it later.

670
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:11,840
- and finally, Kitti, a...
- Omakase, right?

671
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:13,720
Oh, yes, please,

672
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:14,880
that'd be lovely.

673
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,560
Ok, bye bye.

674
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:24,320
Each of these men have an interesting lifestyle,

675
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,960
and a powerful gaze.

676
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:30,280
They also understand the value of living.

677
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,400
They make good choices.

678
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,920
When they find something they love

679
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:38,600
they are ready to go all in for it
without changing their mind.

680
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:47,160
I feel like it's missing a certain x factor.

681
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:50,680
If that's what you're after, allow me to...
Man, have a seat please.

682
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,600
Nan Fah, continue.

683
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:58,320
Ken...

684
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:01,960
Is there someone you feel would be suitable for our brand?

685
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:05,320
What are your thoughts?

686
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:09,000
Who do you think is the best?

687
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:11,080
Excuse me.

688
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:12,560
I'm here to see Nan Fah.

689
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:15,760
You're looking for Nan Fah?
He is in the board room.

690
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,560
He's in an actual meeting right now.

691
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:26,160
This one. Non.

692
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:28,680
As a chef, he is particular about his ingredients.

693
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:31,800
He's also got those playful eyes.

694
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:33,320
I think he is the one.

695
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:36,000
I think he can represent our brand well.

696
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,520
But not perfect.

697
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:39,360
To be honest,

698
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,640
I don't like any of them.

699
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,160
But if we delay our choice any longer,

700
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:49,400
we won't make the presenter reveal date.

701
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:51,920
I think we need to make a decision.

702
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:54,800
We can't delay the launch.

703
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:58,720
Losing the billboard slot would cost us a fortune.

704
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,840
Don't you get it?

705
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:05,320
I've brought something for Nan Fah.

706
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:07,160
The board room is downstairs.

707
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:08,720
Thank you.

708
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:13,240
He's so handsome!

709
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:16,280
I understand the difficulties involved,

710
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:19,040
but we can't just choose anyone.

711
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:23,640
It has to be someone who aligns with our values.

712
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:27,000
They have to look youthful

713
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:35,360
for someone around the age of 30.

714
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:43,160
Excuse me.

715
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:52,000
Is this what you wanted?

716
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:54,400
Him!

717
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:13,520
It's so late.

718
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:15,560
Where have you been?

719
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:17,520
Were you out studying or horsing around?

720
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:26,280
How was it?

721
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:28,280
Did you do it?

722
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,200
I didn't.

723
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:35,840
Nan!

724
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:43,640
Oh, Phupha!

725
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:45,600
Are you hungry?

726
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:47,040
Come join us for dinner.

727
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:49,320
Let's grab him a bowl.

728
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:50,920
No, thank you.

729
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:54,080
I've got to speak to you, Uncle.

730
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:57,440
If you're here about him studying advertising,

731
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:59,360
the answer is no.

732
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:01,120
It's a waste of money.

733
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:03,840
If he can't get into medical school,

734
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:05,520
he can work in the pharmacy.

735
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:17,360
Uncle...

736
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:20,440
He can't live your dreams for you.

737
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:23,280
Please don't rob him of his.

738
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:26,240
It may not be what you want,

739
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:30,280
but I know it will lead him to success.

740
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:42,560
I'll study with Nan Fah.

741
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:48,240
I promise that I'll keep a close eye on him
and keep him on the right track.

742
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:53,280
Please, I beg you to let Nan Fah make you proud,

743
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:55,560
