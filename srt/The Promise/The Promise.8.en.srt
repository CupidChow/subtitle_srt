1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:05,560
Phu, I've visited Melbourne every year,

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:08,040
although I've never run into you.

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:12,600
Don't think I only went looking for you.

4
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,400
New Year's is my annual leave.

5
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,400
I'm glad it wasn't cold there,

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,600
otherwise,
I wouldn't have enjoyed it.

7
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,600
You know I don't like the cold weather.

8
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:28,280
My visits happen to be around your birthday.

9
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:32,720
I was hoping to run into you.

10
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,840
Anyway, it's your birthday today,

11
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:42,200
Wherever you are,
I wish you a very happy birthday.

12
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:47,000
If you're still alive,
please reply to this email.

13
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,880
Khunkhao: Hi, Nan!

14
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,360
You must be in Thailand by now.

15
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,240
Thank you for the other night.

16
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,040
I hope we can meet again.

17
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,280
I'll visit you in Thailand if I get the chance.

18
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,120
What are you up to?

19
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,640
Why aren't you asleep?

20
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,880
I can't sleep...

21
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,080
You and Nan Fah are a perfect match,

22
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,120
you both go to sleep without showering.

23
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:19,520
Unfortunately,
we can only be friends.

24
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,200
I'm sure you're so upset about that.

25
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,040
It's ok. I've made my choice.

26
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,840
I can rest easy knowing I said my piece.

27
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,680
Aren't you afraid you won't be friends anymore?

28
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,640
I love Nan.

29
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,680
I'll do what I can to ensure
that we remain friends forever.

30
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:59,240
People who keep things inside
and don't tell people how they feel

31
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,440
can never call themselves a true friend.

32
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:08,400
Like you, you're not just any friend.

33
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,160
Don't you want to act on that?

34
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,920
You don't understand.

35
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,000
You're right.
I don't understand

36
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:34,000
I never wanted us to be just friends.

37
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,480
We are going back to Bangkok tomorrow.

38
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,080
Do you know how stressed he is about work?

39
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:59,120
It's ok if you don't help with the job

40
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,880
because he'll still have me as a friend.

41
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:33,320
Goodness me...
Why are you rushing off?

42
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,960
You could postpone the flight.

43
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:36,640
Well.

44
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,720
Phupa's not even awake yet.

45
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,240
Oh, Granny,
I honestly wish I could stay

46
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,520
but they keep calling me from work.

47
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:49,000
As for Phu, let him rest.

48
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,480
He'd sleep in all day if I let him.

49
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,600
Are you gossiping about me?
I heard all that.

50
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,520
Come here,
of course we were!

51
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,520
Wow, this looks delicious.

52
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,640
Have some!

53
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,640
Phu, where are you going?

54
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,520
I'm going back with you.

55
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:20,640
I thought you were staying here with Granny.

56
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:29,440
I'm worried about the shop,
and I've got a presenting job to do.

57
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:41,160
What job?
You never told me about anything.

58
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,200
It's for your company.

59
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:51,560
I didn't pressure you into that.

60
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,880
You're overthinking things.

61
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:02,080
I just want to use these good looks of mine.

62
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:07,360
What are we handsome guys to do, eh?
Isn't that right, Granny?

63
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:13,840
Let's celebrate that.

64
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,480
Cheers, come on.

65
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:22,680
We'll celebrate properly when you're famous!

66
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:28,840
Granny, if something happens,
you must call me immediately.

67
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,920
Please don't do what you did last time.

68
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:34,480
I'll call you at 8 p.m. each night,
and you have to answer.

69
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:39,160
I need to know that you're ok.
And another thing, don't sleep too late.

70
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,360
Are you my grandson or my dad?

71
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,360
I'm just worried about you.

72
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:58,920
Phu, you're doing the right thing by chasing success.

73
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:11,600
I'll take good care of myself
so that I can make it to 100, 120, 150 years old!

74
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,240
Excellent,
stay here with us for as long as possible.

75
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,600
Would you like any eggs?

76
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,320
Yes, please.

77
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,560
This rice congee is good.

78
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,400
We call it rice soup around here.

79
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,360
Here's your coffee!
Please enjoy! We brewed it with our heart.

80
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,080
And here's our homemade cheesecake.

81
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,920
Hello! Is everything to your liking?

82
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,880
It's a great place, isn't it?
The owner is also very good looking.

83
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:02,840
Joe!

84
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,160
When did you come back?

85
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,960
Give me that.

86
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,760
Go on in.

87
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,600
Hello!
How's everything?

88
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,480
Please help us by checking in online.

89
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,360
Hey! How's it going?
Lots of customers today, right?

90
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,800
Is that the guy you were talking about?

91
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:28,560
- Are you the owner of this shop?
- Yes.

92
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:36,120
Hello, I've come on the right day.

93
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,360
- Quick, come and take a picture.
- Ok, no problem.

94
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:41,880
Move in a little, don't be afraid.

95
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:46,280
- 1, 2, 3. Ok.
- One more.

96
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:49,080
1, 2.

97
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,520
One more.

98
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:54,320
1, 2.

99
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,720
Thank you so much.

100
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:59,960
You ok?
Come on, stand up.

101
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,720
I saw the video clip about your coffee farm.
Keep up the good work.

102
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,800
I'll keep following you.

103
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:09,040
Oh, thank you.

104
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,560
Enjoy!

105
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,440
How's it going?

106
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:18,200
It's been busy since I came to help you out.
It's nothing like when you were here.

107
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:22,800
I think that's because his face
is all over the city on Devonte billboards.

108
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,920
I think my presence also made a difference.

109
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:30,360
That's enough.
How's the house search?

110
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:36,000
Have I ever let you down?
Have I not delivered on my promises?

111
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,640
I always strive to exceed expectations.

112
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,960
It's move-in ready for you.
I'll show you this evening.

113
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,520
- Ok, I'll wait and see what it's like.
- Hmm.

114
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,040
I'd better get back to work, it's so busy.

115
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,000
Which table?
Come on, quickly!

116
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,080
That table selling insurance.

117
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,560
Quickly, the customers are waiting!

118
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:02,360
Our brand has become more popular,
especially online.

119
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,160
More customers are telling others
about our products,

120
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,840
which is crucial to us getting more people
to try our products,

121
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:17,640
so I must thank you all for your dedication
to this success.

122
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,960
Clap your hands,
what are you waiting for?

123
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:38,240
I'm excited for you all to get started
on our new campaign.

124
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,760
Man, please explain what stem cells are.

125
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:48,080
Man, please explain what stem cells are.

126
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,320
Hmm!

127
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:58,080
Man, this is your area of expertise.
How can you not know any basic info?

128
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,240
Hmm!

129
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,200
I'm better with in-depth stuff, Ken.

130
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,920
Um...

131
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,160
Stem cells are found throughout our bodies.

132
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,720
They're responsible for repairing physical damage,

133
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:15,840
but they decrease in number as we age,
leading to physical degeneration.

134
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,680
People do not yet know that we are using biotechnology to stimulate stem cell growth

135
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:25,400
to provide a multidimensional solution for aging skin,

136
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:28,560
which will result in them looking younger.

137
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:37,680
How can we get people to understand
more about our products?

138
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:48,040
Ok... I'd like to tell you more
about this campaign.

139
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,040
Ok.

140
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:56,440
We will focus on promoting the products' ability
to turn back time

141
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:05,960
and our presenter will speak about their past experiences, which they hope to revisit.

142
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:10,120
I'll include explanations about stem cells too,

143
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:16,920
because stem cells will act like a time machine.

144
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:20,720
I've just got back from my hometown actually,

145
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,440
so I've got lots of nostalgic experiences to share.

146
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:33,080
I firmly believe that everybody
will want to relive past experiences

147
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:37,880
and that this campaign
will increase engagement with our page

148
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:42,640
as we'll ask consumers to share
their own past experiences in photo form

149
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:45,720
and they have the chance to win
a special Devonte skincare set,

150
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:51,960
as well as select a gift set for a friend.

151
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:59,520
This campaign will give us access
to new consumer groups,

152
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:05,000
who will become regular users of our products.

153
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,200
Excellent!

154
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,720
That's very interesting.

155
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,160
I'd like to say something else.

156
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:23,000
I'm pleased to announce that Phupa will be joining us as a presenter on this project.

157
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,440
Wait a minute. What about the new presenter
that Ken already approved?

158
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,720
I think Phupa is more suitable
as he's already well known.

159
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,640
But he took too long to confirm,
and we've already found someone else.

160
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:49,280
I'm very glad to hear Phupa is coming back,

161
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,160
But...

162
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:54,040
I also think that the presenter Man suggested

163
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:58,480
could help strengthen this campaign.

164
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:04,600
This is our second campaign,
so having another person on board makes sense.

165
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:08,920
I initially had Dina penciled in to help

166
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:15,640
but she has to go abroad,
so having another person will be good.

167
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:24,840
Nan Fah, I'm leaving this with you.
I think we're ready.

168
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,000
Yes, sir.

169
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:32,240
The new presenter is very good-looking.

170
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,120
- Really?
- So handsome.

171
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,120
Bring him to try.

172
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:53,960
So what did you want to talk about?

173
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:58,360
Do you know I'm moving back to the U.S.?

174
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,840
Yes, it's very sad.

175
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:05,080
Ken wanted you in the next campaign.

176
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:10,040
Have you told Phupa?

177
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,760
No.
Could you tell him for me?

178
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,920
I've got something else to speak with you about.

179
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,080
I'd like you to take care of Party for me.

180
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,640
You want me to take care of Party?

181
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:33,120
It's just... I've never seen Party
care about anyone like he does for you.

182
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:38,360
I want him to have great friends like you.

183
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:46,000
He's just got back and he's never had a friend
who he can trust before.

184
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:55,240
And another thing is Phu,

185
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:04,360
did you know I once confessed my love to him?

186
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,320
Yes.

187
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:18,120
But he told me that he didn't love me.

188
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:29,240
He told me that there was someone else in his heart

189
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:37,280
and I know that it hasn't changed to this day.

190
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,080
Who are you talking about?

191
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:46,400
I'm not sure, but I want to tell you

192
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,280
That you should listen to your heart.

193
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:08,040
What do you think?
A house for the price of a condo,

194
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:10,320
52 square meters of space,

195
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,400
2 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms,
a garden with a lawn,

196
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,560
space for drinking coffee
and space for your fighting fish

197
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,720
as well as all your other animals.

198
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,520
Why don't you go live with me?

199
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:23,280
I invited you to come and live with me

200
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:32,920
I didn't want to outstay my welcome
while you were so busy with work.

201
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,800
4-walled rooms bore me,
a house will be better.

202
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,200
And there's space for Oliang to roam free.

203
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:43,840
Ok, so I'll come and live with you here.
Give me that key.

204
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:47,280
Really?
Ok, if that's what you want.

205
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:59,200
If you're living here,
help me move the stuff in.

206
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:46,760
Happy birthday to you,

207
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:54,000
my darling grandson.

208
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,880
I wish you all the best for this coming year.

209
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:02,600
- Wish you all the best.
- Wish you all the best.

210
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:05,600
Thank you,
I want you to take care of yourself too.

211
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,040
That way,
you'll be with me for a long time to come.

212
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,520
Of course!

213
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:14,400
Phupa, did you get another advertising job?

214
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:19,800
Your grandmother is renting a billboard
outside the local district office

215
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:22,400
to show everyone her handsome grandson!

216
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,440
Granny, you're being over the top.

217
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:28,240
No, it's actually at the provincial office.

218
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,080
Please don't. I'm so embarrassed.

219
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:34,520
I'll brew up some beer for your next visit.

220
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:38,520
You and Nan Fah can drink
to your heart's content.

221
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,920
Can you all keep an eye on Granny.
Don't let her drink too much.

222
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,200
I'm worried about her.

223
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:49,960
How can we keep an eye on her?
We're all drunk as skunks too!

224
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,000
Oh.

225
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:59,960
Phupa, there were so many reps here
buying coffee beans today.

226
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:06,240
Apparently, there's a video clip about us.
They said we have an interesting story to tell.

227
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:10,800
All your Grandpa's dreams are coming true.

228
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:14,040
He and I will be able to rest in peace.

229
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:17,120
Hey, stop that talk.

230
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:20,160
I still need you here.

231
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,480
What about a special someone?

232
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,720
Haven't met them yet.

233
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:33,600
Don't forget to tell me when you do,
so we can all celebrate it.

234
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,920
That's quite enough. I've got to go.

235
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:40,880
Bye.

236
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:59,680
Aren't you going to tell him?

237
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:04,000
Heart disease is no trifling matter,
you know.

238
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,320
Do not tell him under any circumstances.

239
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:15,720
You called him last time when I had that fall.

240
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:20,040
I don't want to be a burden on him.

241
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:24,920
He's like a grandson to all of us.
We've known him since he was tiny.

242
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:27,080
I don't know if I should tell him.

243
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:30,480
Tell him, it's important.

244
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:38,840
I don't have long left,

245
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:47,160
I want him to spend his time enjoying life,

246
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:50,400
not worrying about me.

247
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:02,200
Do you remember that song?

248
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:07,880
Friends,
friends are friends until the end.

249
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:15,440
We'll always be here to take care of you.

250
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:49,080
Here's some food, Oliang.

251
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:57,680
Hmm…look at you, a big, soft cat daddy.

252
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,960
I need to go to work, I'll be back later.

253
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:03,480
What are you looking at?
I'm a human, not a fish!

254
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,560
Ouch!!

255
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,080
Ouch!

256
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:36,800
Here's the menu.

257
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,000
Nan!

258
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,120
Nan!

259
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:07,160
Phu, when did you get here?

260
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:12,760
Not content with sneaking into my room,
now you're sneaking into my house.

261
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,200
What's all this?

262
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,160
Surprise!

263
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,360
Surprise!

264
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:31,920
Come over here.

265
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,400
Hang on.

266
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:08,120
Ok,
blow out the candles on your birthday fish.

267
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:19,280
Happy birthday to you...
Happy birthday to you...

268
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:25,560
Happy birthday
Happy birthday

269
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:32,840
Happy birthday to you...

270
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:52,560
Where did you buy this food from?

271
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,720
It doesn't look appetizing.

272
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:01,200
I made it myself.
I even descaled the fish.

273
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,560
No wonder it looks so strange.

274
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:10,720
Though it may look strange,
the taste is amazing.

275
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:16,160
I saved this piece for you especially.

276
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:23,640
Why do you still bother cooking
when you're so bad at it?

277
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:28,080
I want to make you eat.

278
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,880
I put a lot of effort into making this for you.

279
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,440
I scooped up rice for you.

280
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,400
Why did you turn Party down?

281
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,720
Did you see that?

282
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,120
Yes.

283
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,040
Well.

284
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:13,000
I was uncomfortable that
he suddenly confessed his love for me.

285
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,560
And what was your answer?

286
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:27,160
I told him it was better we remained friends.

287
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:32,080
It wouldn't feel right to cross that line.

288
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:45,760
Don't you feel weird when you see him around?

289
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:53,680
I don't think so.
It'll be the same as before.

290
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,120
Will it really be the same as before?

291
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:06,200
Of course,
why wouldn't it be?

292
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,560
Nothing, let's eat.

293
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:17,120
Let's see what you're capable of.

294
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,720
Is it really tasty?

295
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:33,040
It's decent actually.

296
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,800
Delicious, not decent.

297
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,120
Delicious.

298
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,680
My throat is very stiff.
Do you have water for me to drink?

299
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:43,120
- Here you are!
- Oh!

300
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,720
We must celebrate a little,
it's your birthday.

301
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:48,400
Cheers!

302
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,400
Bottoms up!

303
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,800
Bottoms up?

304
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,520
- Sure?
- What's wrong?

305
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,280
I win.

306
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,960
How about another one?

307
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:05,600
Okay, but eat first.

308
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:12,920
- We'll follow this plan, ok, Man?
- Sure.

309
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,800
- Here you are. Great timing, Phupa.
- Hello.

310
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:20,160
Please meet our new presenter.

311
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,840
Khunkhao.

312
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,680
Nan!!

313
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:36,200
- Khun!!
- How about you?

314
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:39,200
- Fine, and you?
- Fine.

315
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,720
Long time no see.

316
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,960
Goodness,
you seem to know everybody.

317
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,760
We met in Melbourne,

318
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,640
I helped him search
for his friend for a few years.

319
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,160
That's how we met.

320
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:56,680
Ah yes,
Nan Fah used to visit Melbourne every year.

321
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:57,880
What a small world!

322
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:00,600
I like to think it was fate
that brought us together again.

323
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:05,880
Khunkhao was a model in Melbourne ever
since he was young.

324
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,720
I grew up in Melbourne.

325
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:11,760
I worked as a waiter,
model, and Thai boxer.

326
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,760
Oh wow.
Today, I leave it to you. Khun Khao.

327
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:17,000
Ok, let's get this started.

328
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,720
- Well, better start working.
- Ok.

329
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:25,440
I haven't seen you for a long time.

330
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,520
- Ready?
- Yes.

331
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,760
- Is it your first job in Thailand?
- Yes.

332
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:37,720
Our new presenter is handsome,
don't you think?

333
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,960
Phu Pha.
Let's go do makeup.

334
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,840
Over there.

335
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:46,600
...Still image,
and there's also a video as I said before.

336
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:49,040
Your face looks like Phu Pha.

337
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,720
Yes, he really looks like Phu Pha.

338
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:55,000
Khunkhao and Phu Pha.
Have similar names.

339
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:59,560
Okay.
Today there will be still images and video...

340
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:01,440
Game On.

341
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,600
Change the pose.

342
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,440
Okay.

343
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:32,880
- Ready?
- Ready.

344
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,560
Next is the last pose.

345
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:37,080
But in this pose,
let's wipe the product first.

346
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,880
And then let's switch.

347
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,840
- And both of you, don't forget to say the tagline too.
- Yes.

348
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,080
- Ready?
- Ready.

349
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:44,800
Okay.

350
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:48,120
5..4..3..2..
Action!!

351
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:54,320
- Innovative biotechnology that helps you look younger.
- Nobody will guess your age!

352
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,080
Oh my goodness.

353
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:06,000
We chose the right ones here, eh?

354
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,600
I can't believe
how you've turned this all around.

355
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,280
Your eye for a star is unmatched.

356
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:15,040
Phupa's really developed into this role.

357
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,400
Yes, I agree.

358
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:30,560
Innovative biotechnology that helps you look younger.
Nobody will guess your age!

359
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,440
Hey.

360
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,160
Hey.

361
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,560
What's gotten into you?

362
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,840
How was it?
Was I charming?

363
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,880
Hmm… it looked good.

364
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,640
Ok, your turn.

365
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,560
Um...

366
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:12,280
Innovative biotechnology
that helps you look younger.

367
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,320
Nobody will...

368
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,880
Do it properly.

369
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,400
Stop messing around.

370
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,400
I'm not messing around.

371
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,440
Then do it properly.

372
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,960
Stretch out.

373
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:36,560
Breath in, face up.

374
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,280
Have confidence.

375
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,240
Um...

376
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,240
A handsome face,

377
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,160
beautiful eyes,

378
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,800
strong nose,

379
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,560
full lips.

380
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,440
Try again!

381
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:21,960
- Try again
- Um.

382
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:28,880
Innovative biotechnology
that helps you look...

383
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,680
- ...look what.
- Look young.

384
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:31,400
Look young.

385
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:34,360
Nobody will guess your age!

386
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,480
Almost there, try this.

387
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:42,280
Try it again,
look me in the eyes.

388
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:54,200
Innovative biotechnology that helps you look younger.
Nobody will guess your age!

389
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,080
Ready?

390
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,680
Ok, look into the camera
and introduce yourself.

391
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,600
Hello, my name is Khunkhao.

392
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:10,760
Khunkhao.

393
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:17,880
Tell us about your happiest memories
and how you'd like to revisit them.

394
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:25,520
The experience I'd like to revisit the most,
right?

395
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:32,200
For me, it was the day
I met a special someone in Melbourne.

396
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:41,160
We spent a lot of time together
and shared some memorable moments

397
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:48,800
but I found out he had
someone else in his heart.

398
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:56,560
Now I've had the chance to meet him again,
I want to be his special memory that he'll never forget.

399
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:19,400
Man,
didn't you brief Khunkhao about the interview?

400
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:26,040
Erm…I gave him a summary.
Let the editing team work on it later.

401
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:34,120
Next time, make sure you prepare properly,
so we're not fixing things afterward.

402
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,640
Gigi.
Yes.

403
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:43,160
- After work, call an editor to talk to me.
- Yes.

404
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,000
Ouch!!

405
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:52,560
Phupa,
please tell us about your happiest memories

406
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:55,240
and how you'd like to revisit them.

407
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:02,200
I'd like to go back to my childhood,

408
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,440
when everything seemed fun.

409
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,680
My best friend and I,
we were so happy.

410
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:13,040
We never told each other what we needed,

411
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:17,240
but we were always there for each other.

412
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:24,600
Just thinking about it makes me smile
and makes me want to turn back time

413
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:29,640
to when we had no worries about the future.

414
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:35,320
We lived in the moment
and enjoyed every minute.

415
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:48,440
If I could go back to any time in the past,

416
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:54,320
I'd go back to feel that way one more time.

417
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:03,760
That feeling of not having any worries
and the safety I felt.

418
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:17,600
Cut!

419
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:26,600
Would you like to redo anything, Ken?

420
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,360
No, it was excellent.

421
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,120
I retract my statement
about Phupa being too wooden.

422
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:35,520
He looks so natural these days.

423
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:40,320
It's because he's saying what he wants to say.

424
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:44,280
Phupa was talking about you just then, I'm sure.

425
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:51,320
I initially didn't see the connection
between biotechnology and our treasured memories

426
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:57,040
but I get it now.
You've created something special here.

427
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:58,720
Thank you, Ken.

428
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:05,360
I don't know what happened to you,
but you've changed for the good recently

429
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:15,760
You used to be reckless,
but you've been well prepared.

430
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:29,320
It must be because I used to be so self-confident
that I wouldn't ask for advice, focusing only on results.

431
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:36,760
I no longer focus on sales or interest,
but instead believe in what we're doing.

432
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:40,280
Our products can help us all achieve happiness.

433
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:57,040
- After work, where are we going?
- I made an appointment with my boyfriend for dinner.

434
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,360
Aw, don't go with me.

435
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:01,040
- Well, next time.
- Uh, okay.

436
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:02,520
Thank you.

437
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:06,680
- Khunkhao.
- Nan!

438
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:12,840
I can't believe we're meeting again in this situation.

439
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:16,160
Are you busy this evening?
I'd like to invite you for dinner.

440
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:28,000
That's my mother.

441
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:31,200
You've both got the same features.

442
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:38,120
(Happy Birthday Phu
...I love you.)

443
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:37,280
Nan, I'm heading to Thailand.

444
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,120
If we meet again,

445
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:42,840
don't forget our promise.

446
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:44,720
I miss you.
