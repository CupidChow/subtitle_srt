1
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,280
Nan!

2
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,400
Come here.

3
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,320
Come quickly.

4
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:54,000
-Wow.
-Please sit down.

5
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,880
What kind of a surprise is this?

6
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,560
I scooped up rice for you

7
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,640
-Enough?
- Oh, that's enough.

8
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:10,560
I noticed you'd been working hard recently.

9
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,360
The office has been hectic today.

10
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:19,160
That new cream you helped present
has been selling very well.

11
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,400
How is it?

12
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,880
I've been on the phone
with our dealers all day.

13
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,520
Wow.

14
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,400
Let's eat.

15
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,360
Because you are the presenter
so that sells well.

16
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,720
Nan.

17
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:47,280
I already know that you will go...

18
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,520
Nan!

19
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,040
Nan!

20
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,440
-Nan.
-Khunkhao.

21
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,040
Nan.

22
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,720
What's wrong?

23
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,400
-Hey wait.
-Don't mess with me.

24
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,800
Phu calm down.

25
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,640
Nan.

26
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:18,160
I've liked you for a long time.
Why don't you like me back?

27
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:22,080
What's so good about him?

28
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,440
Why do you not pay attention to me?

29
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,520
Why?

30
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,840
Why?

31
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:35,400
-Khunkhao, I think it's better to calm down.
-I told you to leave me alone.

32
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,000
Phu!

33
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,680
Phu take it easy.

34
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:45,960
He's drunk.
Don't take any notice.

35
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,720
Khunkhao.

36
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,920
We'll have to chat again another time.

37
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,560
I don't want to see you get hurt.

38
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:05,960
Although I came into your life later,
please give me a chance.

39
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,280
My feelings are true.

40
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,520
And if that someone leaves you,

41
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:20,640
I want you to know
that I'll still be here for you, always.

42
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:26,560
I want you to know
that I'll never leave you.

43
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,120
I promise.

44
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,000
Is this really necessary?

45
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:01,240
Are you going to let him
go home like this?

46
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:05,200
Will he get home ok?
Where's he staying?

47
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,480
This kindness of yours
is why your intentions are misunderstood.

48
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,680
Why?

49
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,160
Are you jealous?

50
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,680
Oh.

51
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,160
Don't be like that.

52
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,160
You know I love you.

53
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,440
Please don't be angry at me.

54
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,320
Please.

55
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,520
Should I?

56
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:59,080
Should I?

57
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,440
No.

58
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,520
What did you do?

59
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,600
Don't do it.

60
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,360
I'm going to bed.

61
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:37,760
Hey Phu, are you really sleeping?

62
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,960
Yes.

63
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,040
Are you really going to sleep?

64
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,320
Really?

65
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,480
Really?

66
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,480
Ow!

67
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,680
Ow!

68
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,960
Nan, I think he's just acting the drunk.

69
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,760
Why would you annoy me?

70
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,520
Hey!!

71
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,120
Give me some of those nuts!

72
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,800
Be polite.

73
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,840
Please give me some of those nuts, sir.

74
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,720
Can't you get them yourself?

75
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,920
So I'll take them myself

76
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,000
Don't be playful.

77
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,760
Bring them to me.

78
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,640
How many nuts should I put?

79
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:47,360
If you like a lot, put a lot.
If you like less, put less.

80
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,800
And if I like them all.

81
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,680
Put it all on, but not the nuts,
love.

82
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,840
I don't have to eat anymore.

83
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,640
So what do you do?

84
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,120
Nan.

85
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,560
Your shirt fits me perfectly.

86
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,600
Don't you want to go home?

87
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,560
Hey.

88
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:25,720
Khunkhao, let's eat first,
Phupa's cooked it himself.

89
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,120
Alright, I'm hungry.

90
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,040
Ahem!

91
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:39,440
Khunkhao, wait until you're done eating,
and I'll call you a taxi.

92
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,520
Ok.

93
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:52,320
- Look, it's not finished.
-Really.

94
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,640
Talk too much.

95
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,960
Let's eat.

96
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,480
This is delicious!

97
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,480
-Yum.
-Yum.

98
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,840
Yes, it's great.

99
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:06,080
What's up?
Don't you like it?

100
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:13,720
Nothing, it's just that it tastes
like my mum's cooking.

101
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,800
How can that be?
This is a special recipe.

102
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,920
Aren't you going to work today?

103
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,120
Today I work at home.

104
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:35,040
Oh, that's excellent.
I'm free too, can I stay here with you?

105
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,120
Phu, what's wrong?

106
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,320
Drink water.

107
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,560
So cute.

108
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,080
Coffee for you.

109
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,320
Thank you.

110
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,400
-Oliang.
-Is it delicious?

111
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:25,640
Oliang, come here.

112
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,760
Hang on, please,
I'm going to film this.

113
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,640
-Oliang, are you hungry?
-Oliang, come here look at the camera quickly.

114
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:33,240
-Oliang
-Quickly look at the camera.

115
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,160
Are you going to sleep?

116
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:43,920
Oliang, I also has this dessert.
It's more delicious.

117
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:44,960
This one is more delicious than Oliang.

118
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:49,040
Oliang, come and eat quickly.

119
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,720
-Oliang.
-Oliang.

120
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,560
-Oliang come here quickly.
-Oliang, better eat this one.

121
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,240
- Let's eat. Come quickly.
- Oh, kind.

122
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,320
Hey!!

123
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,560
Go somewhere else.
I'm working here.

124
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,840
Let's go to eat better.

125
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,360
Hello.

126
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,040
Yes.

127
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,760
Let me see the schedule first.

128
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:53,440
Where?
Can I jot it down?

129
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:57,040
Nan, can I have a pen
and notebook please?

130
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,720
In my bag.

131
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:11,040
Okay.
Where do I have to go?

132
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:14,600
Anyway, I'll keep in touch again.
Bye.

133
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,560
Nan.

134
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,960
Why do you have a photo of my mom?

135
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,800
Is it really possible?

136
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:09,360
My mom told me about you several times.

137
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,480
But I never thought
I'd actually meet you like this.

138
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:22,560
Exactly,
I'd planned to visit on several occasions,

139
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:27,360
but I didn't want to intrude.

140
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,920
You mustn't think like that.

141
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,000
Mom loves you very much.

142
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:41,320
She named me Khunkhao
because she wanted our names to match.

143
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,960
May I call you brother?

144
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,520
Of course,
we're brothers after all.

145
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:17,320
And we ended up liking the same person.

146
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:22,680
-It must be in our DNA.
-But he's my partner.

147
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,640
That's ok.

148
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:30,320
I can accept it.

149
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:40,560
I hope you know that you've never been alone
despite us not sharing a surname.

150
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:45,080
We're brothers from the same family.

151
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,360
You're not alone.

152
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,480
Ok, brother.

153
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,400
The taxi has arrived.

154
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,640
-You haven't forgotten anything, right?
-Yes.

155
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,320
-Okay, bye.
-Goodbye.

156
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:23,280
I'll come and visit when I've got time.

157
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:26,160
Try and visit us frequently.
We'll cook for you.

158
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,280
Okay.

159
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:00,920
- Bye bye.
-bye.

160
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:33,360
No wonder it all felt so familiar.
He's your brother!

161
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:39,040
Although,
you're more handsome than him.

162
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,760
Come on.

163
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,000
I'm pleased for you.
At the very least,

164
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,840
You'll never be lonely again.

165
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,560
When are you going to China then?

166
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:11,160
How did you know about that?

167
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,560
I'm not going.

168
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:26,000
Why not?

169
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,360
Do you want me to move there?

170
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,680
Hmm, I'd like you to go.

171
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:44,240
It could be great for your career.

172
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:52,960
You could show off to your friends and family.

173
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,160
And what about you?

174
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,200
I'll be fine.

175
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,200
I'll stay here.

176
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,800
Why?

177
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:18,000
When you went to Melbourne,

178
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,080
I begged you to stay.

179
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,480
Now it's you who want me to go.

180
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,560
Don't you want to be with me anymore?

181
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,480
We've only just gotten back together.

182
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,360
You really want me to leave?

183
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,760
Nan, we've got plenty of time
to spend together in the future,

184
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,520
but your career is precious,

185
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:03,680
you can't just let this chance
slip by over something so immature.

186
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:13,080
Yeah, I'm immature.

187
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:16,520
That's why I'm always thinking about you.

188
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:21,640
I worry about you being alone,

189
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:30,120
but you don't want to be with me.

190
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,800
Nan!

191
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,240
Forget it.

192
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,280
If you want me to go,

193
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,000
I'll go.

194
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,520
Nan, wait!

195
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,600
Leave me alone.
I want to be by myself.

196
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:30,600
Ok, I'll believe you this time.

197
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:34,840
Prepare yourself, we're leaving together
at the beginning of next month.

198
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:35,840
Ok.

199
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,920
Nan!

200
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:49,400
I bought a cake from the shop you like.

201
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:53,000
And I got you your favorite kopi.

202
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,920
Nan.

203
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,880
Nan.

204
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,440
Nan, wait!

205
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,920
Are you still angry with me?

206
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,640
No.

207
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,600
Listen to me.

208
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,760
I didn't really want you to go.

209
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:22,440
My dream is to be with you.

210
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:27,160
Wait for me for a second.
I'm not good at talking here.

211
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:48,640
but I also wanted you to follow your own dreams.

212
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,840
I wanted you to be successful in your job.

213
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:21,400
How long will you be away?
I promise I'll wait for you.

214
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:25,240
I'll be your source of encouragement.

215
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:42,320
Promise me that you'll wait.

216
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,600
I promise.

217
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:58,600
We'll stick together no matter what. He who breaks promise will be struck down by lightning.

218
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,080
Thank you so much.

219
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,320
Travel safely.

220
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,160
I love you.

221
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,120
I love you too.

222
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,960
Let's not get soppy.

223
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,640
Get on with your job over there.

224
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:12,520
Ok.

225
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,080
I'm going.

226
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,720
Let me know when you arrive.

227
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:47,800
How are you?

228
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,120
Tired of working?

229
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,760
I miss you.

230
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:59,040
Help! Help!

231
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:02,400
Don't do anything to me,
I beg you.

232
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,800
Hey shut up.

233
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:06,120
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Please help.

234
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:08,680
This has nothing to do with you!

235
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:26,960
Hey.

236
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,400
Be careful.

237
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:54,240
Go away.

238
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:02,160
-What's the matter with you?
-It's okay.

239
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:05,320
You're bleeding quite a lot.
You should see a doctor.

240
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,920
It's just a scratch,
I'll be fine.

241
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:12,680
-Thank you, Mr...
-Khunkhao.

242
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,880
My name's Nan Fah.

243
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,480
(One year later)
Well...

244
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,960
Next month?

245
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,840
Let me see the schedule first.

246
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:31,120
Uh okay.
Early next month for sure.

247
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:34,920
Take it as a dark roast only, right?

248
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:38,920
Okay, bye.

249
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,760
What's up Gie Gie.

250
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:13,800
Ur...

251
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:20,400
Phu... Nan...

252
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:24,080
Nan Fah's coming back next week.

253
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:28,800
No... Nan's...
He planned to return next week.

254
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:35,320
What shall we do, Phu?
I'm so scared.

255
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,080
What are you afraid of?
Is anything up?

256
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:57,800
Nan wanted to surprise you,

257
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:04,680
so he worked hard to clear his jobs
and return today, but...

258
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:11,400
I just saw the news,
the plane he was on has disappeared.

259
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:33,480
I couldn't stand it,

260
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:39,440
so I called my friend who works at the airline.
They said they were also following the news.

261
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:47,920
Can they contact anybody who was with him?

262
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:23,440
Is there any update, Gie Gie?

263
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:26,680
Not yet, Phu.

264
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:37,160
Let me know if you hear anything.

265
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:22,440
You make a promise with me.
That we'll be together like this forever.

266
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,120
Ok.

267
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,040
I promise.

268
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:31,320
Promise me that you'll wait.

269
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,320
I promise.

270
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:38,960
We'll stick together no matter what. He who breaks promise will be struck down by lightning.

271
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:32,480
I'm so sorry for letting you go all this time.

272
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,480
Nan.

273
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,680
Is this really you?

274
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:20,240
Are you?
How can you come back?

275
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:27,600
Phu, calm down.

276
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,120
Listen to me.

277
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:37,360
I thought my surprise was going to work out fine.

278
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:41,400
But Ken got me an upgrade to an earlier flight
as a reward for my hard work.

279
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:45,080
I didn't have time to let Gie Gie know.

280
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:48,560
Who would've thought this could happen?

281
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,440
I'm sorry.

282
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:14,000
Don't give me any surprises next time.
I've been so scared!

283
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:18,480
Can you see that I'm going to die?

284
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,600
I want to see you happy.

285
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:35,880
I wanted to be here to celebrate it with you in person
rather than over a computer screen.

286
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:47,640
You being here
is more than enough for me.

287
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:51,080
You're the best birthday present
I've ever had in my life.

288
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:08,720
From now on,
we will never be separated again.

289
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,200
Um.

290
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,440
No more crying.

291
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:58,400
Happy birthday.

292
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:07,920
I'm going to open my gifts.

293
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:13,240
(Juliet, my darling,
Death, that hath sucked the honey of thy breath)

294
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:16,360
(hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.)

295
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:23,880
(Forbidden love has brought us to the end
but here I will remain.)
