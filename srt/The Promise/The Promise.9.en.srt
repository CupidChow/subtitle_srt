1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:02,040
Khunkao.

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,440
Nan.

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:09,600
I can't believe we're meeting like this.

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:13,120
Where are you going tonight?
I want to invite you to dinner.

5
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,920
I have something to tell you.

6
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:33,520
I'll pick up my mom’s call first.
You wait here, Nan.

7
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,880
I'll be back soon.

8
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,440
Sir.

9
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,080
Thank you.

10
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:47,840
Were you together before?

11
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,480
Don’t be silly!
We just know one another.

12
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,000
But you look tight.

13
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,360
We’ve spent a lot of time together.

14
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,680
Really?
Yes.

15
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:05,080
Ken invited us to a party tonight.
Will you come with us?

16
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:07,120
Sure, let's go!

17
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:07,880
Phu.

18
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,040
Let’s go together.

19
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,440
Here you are.
Thank you.

20
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,240
I must thank you.
Wrong side.

21
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,160
Ken is funny.

22
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,600
So talented.

23
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:54,680
I have to thank everyone
who contributed to our success.

24
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,760
I love this team.

25
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,720
Thank you, everyone.

26
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:03,480
Cheers!!

27
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:38,080
Two of Swords: Be careful, Nan.
You may have to make a choice.

28
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:44,520
Like if you choose to pursue divination,
you’ll have to give up marketing.

29
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:51,600
It’s just for fun, Nan.
I’m not letting it dictate my life.

30
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,480
I’ll go see my handsome Phupha instead.

31
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:58,960
Me?
I don't believe in this either.

32
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:06,160
My sixth sense says
you will be even more viral than last time.

33
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,960
That’s over the top, Gie Gie.

34
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:13,480
It’s true!
I always speak the truth.

35
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:17,440
If you’re making guesses like this,
why even look at the cards, Gie Gie?

36
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,120
Well, I’ve been handsome since birth.

37
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,480
Hey, look at my friend.
Isn’t he handsome?

38
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:34,920
Nan, can we talk for a bit?
Oh, sure.

39
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:42,280
I actually want to talk about something personal.
Can I borrow Nan Fah for a bit?

40
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,640
Why is there tension in the air?

41
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,080
It feels familiar.

42
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,040
Be quiet.

43
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,600
It taken a while to get this chance to chat.

44
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,080
So, what do you want to talk to me about?
My friends and I were just getting started.

45
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,600
Just a minute.
I just have something to say.

46
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,400
Oh, sure.

47
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,760
What are you up to?

48
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,960
Do you mind if I smoke?

49
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:48,480
That Khunkao sticks to Nan Fah like glue, eh?

50
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:53,120
We used to be so close,
but I never thought we would meet again.

51
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,560
Same!

52
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:03,400
Here, everyone likes Nan Fah.
Nan Fah is loved by everyone.

53
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:14,520
Nan Fah is close to everyone,
but he’s never opened up to anyone in particular.

54
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:24,680
Okay, then. Can I talk to Nan Fah by myself?
It's just that I have something to say to him.

55
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,840
Nan Fah has never had
any secrets from his friends.

56
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:37,320
You go first.
I'll follow you in a bit.

57
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,400
I'll be with you soon.

58
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:04,520
This guy’s not normal,
he’s got a special something.

59
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,800
What’s that?

60
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:14,600
And why is that other guy so annoying?

61
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,440
You have to confess your love for Nan Fah.

62
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:22,080
If you don’t do it, Khunkao is bound to.

63
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:39,840
Don’t give up on this.
You’re about to be usurped.

64
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:52,640
He seems like he might be more than a friend.

65
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,800
That’s just his nature,
don’t overanalyze it.

66
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,080
Speaking of which,
have you opened up to anyone yet?

67
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:17,040
I happen to know that the friend
you went to find at that time was Phupa.

68
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:25,200
But even if you meet, you're still just friends.
Can I have the privilege of being something else?

69
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:35,000
Today we will invite guests to sing here.

70
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,520
Invite ken.

71
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:40,480
Ken.
Ken.

72
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:43,240
No.

73
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:48,880
Oh, Ken doesn't sing.
If so, is there any one interested?

74
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,040
Who will sing?
Phu?

75
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,480
Phu, come here.

76
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:57,840
Excuse me, please,
hey.

77
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:01,400
Come here,
come up and sing a song.

78
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,360
Just a moment.

79
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,320
Yeh!!

80
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,680
Sorry,
I'm just so happy to see you again.

81
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:27,960
Can you give me just one more chance?

82
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:42,000
Ok, start talking.
We are talking.

83
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,360
I invite everyone.

84
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:03,680
Pick up the phone then you can take a picture of his handsomeness. Wow.

85
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,360
Wow.

86
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,240
Clapping hands.

87
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:17,040
I would like to sing a song that I wrote myself.
I would like to give it to my closest friend.

88
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,560
Sir!!

89
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,240
Nan?
Hey Ken called you.

90
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,280
Ken called me.

91
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,640
Ok.

92
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,160
Me too?

93
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,160
Please hold a cigarette.

94
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,600
Thank you.

95
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,240
You must be drunk tonight.

96
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,320
Bury it.

97
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,480
Here's my heart.

98
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:46,240
I wrote this almost 10 years ago,

99
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,680
but I’ve never sung it in public.

100
00:12:52,720 --> 00:13:00,280
I never dared to because I never dared reveal my true feelings.

101
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:10,280
But this reluctance ended up with me
losing the one I loved most.

102
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:19,520
Today will show that I’m afraid no longer
and that whatever happens,

103
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,800
I’ll always be there for him.

104
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,400
Nan.

105
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,520
I love you,

106
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,520
I always have,

107
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,480
and I always will.

108
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:20,360
Are you sure you’re not afraid anymore?

109
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:38,880
Wow!!

110
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:12,080
So Sweet.

111
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:28,600
Granny has passed away.

112
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,080
Fon.

113
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:20,240
We and your nephew brought you home.

114
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,560
Back to live with me.

115
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,320
Thank you granny.

116
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,880
Don't cry.

117
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,440
Granny.

118
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:51,720
You said you would stay with me forever.

119
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,600
You're gone,
how am I supposed to live?

120
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,920
Granny.

121
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,560
I have nobody left.

122
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,280
Morning coffee with condensed milk.

123
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,520
It's so sweet for you.

124
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,280
Always.

125
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:44,920
Thank you.

126
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,080
How’s Phupa getting on?

127
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,760
Not great,
I have to force him to eat.

128
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:05,720
Otherwise he won’t eat or do anything.

129
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:11,120
He just stays alone in his room.

130
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:18,360
I’ll go and see you again on my day off.

131
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,680
Does he have any relatives left?

132
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,680
His mom is still alive,
but she lives in Melbourne.

133
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,200
It’s so sad.

134
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:42,000
Let him take his time with all this.

135
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:50,560
I’ve come to chat with you
about the additional billboards that Ken wants to rent.

136
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,960
Phu! I have arrived at work.

137
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:13,880
Where have you been?
Have you eaten?

138
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:20,280
You must be feeling pretty terrible right now,

139
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,280
I get that.

140
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:31,880
I feel bad for you but don’t forget
that I’m always here if you need me.

141
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,000
I’ll come to see you on my day off.

142
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,840
I love you.

143
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:59,000
I’m fine here with Granny.

144
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:06,000
I’ll take good care of myself
so that I can make it.

145
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,600
You promise?

146
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,560
Promise.

147
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:25,680
I saw the sales figures you sent over.

148
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,480
You’ve done very well.

149
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,520
Thank you.

150
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:38,960
I want us to expand into China
and I think you’re the one who can help us do it.

151
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:43,240
I’m going to put you in charge of this team.

152
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:44,520
Really?

153
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:50,200
But you’ll need to move to China.

154
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,160
Yeh!!

155
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,880
That’s great news, Nan!

156
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,600
Don’t forget about me now that you’re a big shot!

157
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,160
You’re talking like you helped him get where he is.

158
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:43,720
It’s true.
I encouraged him every step of the way.

159
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:46,240
Without you guys,
I wouldn’t be where I am today.

160
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,280
Right?

161
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:08,040
I think I’m going to turn it down.

162
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:13,200
What?!
These chances don’t come along every day.

163
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:17,240
It’s only 2 years,
not forever.

164
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:27,640
Phupa’s got nobody left. I
don’t want to leave him.

165
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:37,200
Phupa’s a grown man.
Each of you have your own responsibilities.

166
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,120
You can’t stay by his side forever.

167
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:57,000
Have a good think about it.
This is a unique opportunity.

168
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,440
This was your favorite, Granny.
I’m here to have a drink with you.

169
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:05,720
Although your grandfather loved this farm

170
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:13,320
if I’m no longer here with you,
you don’t need to take it on if you don’t want to.

171
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:21,840
And just where do you think you’re going?
That all sounds so ominous.

172
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:25,280
I’m not letting you go anywhere,
you’re going to stay right here with me.

173
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,160
Nan.

174
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,960
Nan.

175
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:16,920
Nan, I have nobody left.

176
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,760
You still have me, Phu

177
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,600
Let's go home.

178
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,840
Oh, are you done taking a shower?

179
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,760
What are you doing?

180
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,280
What?

181
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,880
And why are you looking at that photo of my mom?

182
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:57,040
When you said your mom had family in Melbourne,
did you ever meet them?

183
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,480
Never,
but mom told me I had a little brother.

184
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:07,160
Really?
Yes.

185
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:12,600
Have you ever met him?

186
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,200
No.

187
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,520
Don’t you want to?

188
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:34,800
I’m not really sure.
It might feel weird to meet him,

189
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:37,840
though I’m sure it would turn out ok.

190
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,760
Why, what are you thinking?

191
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:45,480
Nothing,
I was just wondering.

192
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:08,160
Oh yeah, that picture I said I’d frame for you,

193
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,360
can I take it?

194
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,000
Ok.

195
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,200
Yes.

196
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,120
Where are you?

197
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,280
Oh yes, I'm on my way.

198
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:33,480
Ouch!

199
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:35,920
Ouch!

200
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:36,720
Wait!

201
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,600
What are you playing?

202
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,160
Ouch!

203
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,680
Play again?

204
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,480
No!

205
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:57,120
Come, let me take off your helmet.

206
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,760
Already cute.

207
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:09,920
What shall we have for dinner this evening?

208
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,080
I thought you said you were in a rush.

209
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:16,880
Ok, let’s think about it again later.

210
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,320
Ken called me.

211
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,120
Hello.

212
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,240
I have arrived.

213
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,440
I'm going up.

214
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,080
Oops.

215
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,520
Can you smell that?

216
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,320
What is it?

217
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,880
It smells like love is in the air.

218
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:03,560
Sweet like this, even if Nan goes to work far to China,
it's not an obstacle.

219
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,640
Nan’s going to work in China?

220
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:08,880
That’s right,
our boss is sending him to work in China.

221
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:14,680
Didn’t he tell you?

222
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:21,640
I’ve got some work to do,
I’d better go.

223
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,800
Goodbye.

224
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,000
Nan!

225
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,560
Oh, what are you doing here, Khunkao?

226
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:44,160
I’ve come to get those photos from Man.

227
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,520
Get those photos?

228
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:49,240
You can get him to email them over.

229
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,560
But then I wouldn’t get to meet you.

230
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:59,160
I’ve got something to tell you.
It may be late but that’s better than never.

231
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:03,200
Nan!,
the dealer’s calling you about the stock.

232
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,920
Dealer!

233
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:09,040
He’s waiting on the line to speak with you.

234
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,920
let’s make sure we have a chat.

235
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:13,040
Nan!

236
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:23,880
Khunkao! Come here, those photos are ready
for us to check out together.

237
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,760
Is everything ok.

238
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:40,760
It's all right.

239
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:50,440
I’ll come too,
so that I can chat with that dealer.

240
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:54,680
Of course, Nan, with sales as good as yours,
you’re bound to get a hefty bonus.

241
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:59,440
Let's go.
Let's get in the car first.

242
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,560
Let’s leave that for later.

243
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:24,640
What’s up?

244
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,240
Go ahead.
