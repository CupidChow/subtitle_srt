1
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:12,960
I’ve come to tell you that I’ll be your presenter.

2
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,360
Ah yes, just like we agreed, right?

3
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:30,160
My goodness, you gave me quite a scare the other day.

4
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,360
Well, becoming a star requires a team

5
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:36,320
to offer support and encouragement, right?

6
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,560
What made you change your mind?

7
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,760
Oh, nothing really,

8
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,360
I just wanted to give it a go.

9
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:50,080
Also, seeing how much it means to you as a team
made me want to join.

10
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,760
Ah, you must’ve seen how hard I was working.

11
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:58,400
I’m extremely pleased that you’ll be joining us.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,560
I’ll leave him with you,
No problem.

13
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,440
Nan Fah.

14
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:03,840
Yes, sir.

15
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:09,240
Why Nan Fah?
They’re friends and he’s been helping since the start.

16
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:14,080
This project is going to be great because of you.

17
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:08,680
It wasn’t because of you at all.

18
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,480
that made me walk away.

19
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:19,160
Did you ever know how wonderful
it was every time I had you by my side?

20
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:26,120
The closer we are, the more I want you to see me.

21
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:32,160
Beyond that border line, I can’t take that anymore.

22
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:40,080
I chose to keep my love inside, undisclosed to you.

23
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:47,280
I chose to hide it letting no one discover.

24
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,480
It’s not your fault nor...

25
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,320
Phu, look at me.

26
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,640
What?

27
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,720
Why did you decide to help me?

28
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,720
What’s up with you?

29
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,200
I want to know if it’s because you’re sick or something.

30
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,600
Oh … or is it …

31
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,560
that magic balm Gie Gie used?

32
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,920
I thought you said you didn’t believe in all that?

33
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:11,400
I’m trying to figure out why you suddenly changed your mind.

34
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,160
Or was it because you

35
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,440
wanted to help me personally?

36
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:30,200
No, I just wanted to see what it’d be like

37
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:33,280
and to help raise the profile of my coffee farm.

38
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,800
You’re lying.

39
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:39,800
Do you realize how may times you just blinked?

40
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:48,040
I’m here now, so I’ve got to make sure sales improve.

41
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,760
Otherwise, Granny will laugh at me so hard all her teeth will fall out.

42
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:02,440
Prepare to roast the most beans you’ve ever roasted.

43
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,920
I will make you and your beans famous.

44
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,440
Hmm.

45
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,240
Ken wants me to give this to Devonte’s new presenter.

46
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,400
A intense serum made using Luminin complex ex7.

47
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,160
An extract that helps nourish skin,

48
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,400
leaving it clearer, smoother, and brighter than before.

49
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,720
Don’t worry. I’ll help you.

50
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,240
You’re a presenter now.

51
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,000
You can’t just hold the product.

52
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,640
You’ve got to try it yourself to understand what it’s all about.

53
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,200
Start with this one.

54
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,840
A cleanser.

55
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,800
Phu, don’t scrub so hard,

56
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,760
it’ll start irritating your skin.

57
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,200
Gently massage it into your face.

58
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,080
Imagine you were the audience.

59
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,320
How would you want to see it?

60
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,840
It feels gentle, soft.

61
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:34,920
That’s it.

62
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:43,320
This cleanser protects against acne,

63
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,960
tightens pores and moisturizes skin.

64
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:52,080
Once the face is clean, you can start applying the serum.

65
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,160
Just a little.

66
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:07,240
This helps repair damaged cells to strengthen skin.

67
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:14,760
Now it’s time to apply the night cream.

68
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:22,240
A men’s best friend, a fast-absorbing thick cream.

69
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,760
Has it soaked in?

70
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,080
Phu …

71
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,360
I said soak, not sulk.

72
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,520
Oh, sorry.

73
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,600
What happens if I fail in front of everyone?

74
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,400
What if I mess up the whole job?

75
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,800
Look into my eyes.

76
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:21,560
I’ll be with you on that day.

77
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,840
You’ve got nothing to be afraid of.

78
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,960
Thank you so much for agreeing to help.

79
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,600
I’m so grateful for your help.

80
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,920
And thank you for coming back.

81
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,320
Hmm.

82
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,440
Man.

83
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,000
The assistant director said there’s 5 minutes left until shooting.

84
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,240
How is everything?

85
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,080
Do you have everything.
Ok.

86
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,720
Right, we’ve got 5 minutes until we film.

87
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,680
Get moving!

88
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,240
We also need an extra 5 minutes.

89
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:22,520
Our presenter is new to all this,

90
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,000
so he will probably mess up.

91
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,680
Prepare for that as well.

92
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,880
Hey, that’s an expensive Devonte product.

93
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,360
Be careful.

94
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,880
Is he going to be ok?

95
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,160
Excuse me, Phupa.

96
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:54,440
The concept is a younger, fresher looking face

97
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,320
but one which has sufficient life experience.

98
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,920
We’ll tell the story through your eyes.

99
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,400
The story of you being careful in your choices.

100
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,560
Something like that.

101
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,400
Hang on.
Yes?

102
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,240
Do we have a female lead?

103
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,520
Oh, yes, of course.

104
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,360
Oh my goodness … Dina.

105
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,920
She’s stunning.

106
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:34,960
What?

107
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,280
Dina?

108
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,800
She was my idea.

109
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,920
Ken is very impressed with me.

110
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,640
I wanted to add value to Phupa’s look and Ken agreed

111
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,840
that if we had a famous model alongside him,

112
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:59,360
it would only make him stand out more.

113
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:02,440
Phupa is still our main presenter.

114
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,480
I just wanted to add a female perspective.

115
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,920
A woman who appreciates a man who takes care of himself.

116
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,440
Man.
Yes?

117
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,960
Why didn’t you speak to your team about this?

118
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,560
Um, everybody, this is Dina.

119
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:25,960
Our wonderful model who has just returned from overseas
and agreed to be featured in this Devonte production.

120
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,120
Dina, this is …
Phupa.

121
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,080
Oh.

122
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,680
How’s it going, Nan?
Huh.

123
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,320
Surprise!

124
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:34,720
Are you surprised? The team actually

125
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:40,360
The team actually contacted me a while back,
but I wanted to keep it a surprise.

126
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:45,080
Hang on a moment, it’s …

127
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,240
You guys know each other?

128
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,800
Of course, we used to study together in Thailand.

129
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,280
Nan Fah and Phupha always took good care of me

130
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,800
before I moved to New York

131
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,840
with my brother.

132
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,680
Hi Dina.

133
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,880
Hi.

134
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,000
Oh.

135
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,800
When did you get back?

136
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,800
I had no idea.

137
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,920
When did you start working here?

138
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,120
Daddy’s been worried about you.

139
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:17,400
You don’t read your texts, you don’t reply to our messages.

140
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:21,520
You’ve become a burden like a missing person.

141
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,120
I’ll call when I want to.
Um … may I?

142
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,960
Can I borrow the models to do some blocking?

143
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,840
Um … Dina and Phupa, please go over there.

144
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,680
Sure.

145
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,880
If you will excuse me …

146
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:37,320
Come on, Phu, we’ve got a lot of catching up to do.

147
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,040
How are things?

148
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,200
Are you a model now?

149
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,240
I haven’t seen you for 10 years.

150
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,560
I just started modelling on this job.

151
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,320
Is this ok?

152
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:52,520
Oh my goodness … Phu.

153
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,720
How’s that?

154
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,520
It looks fine.
You look like a robot.

155
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,360
Move a bit closer, will you?

156
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,480
Look at this.

157
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,440
This is all I’ve got.

158
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,200
What are you talking about? You can do better than this.

159
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,160
Would you like to have something to eat after we’re done?

160
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,360
I’m getting hungry.

161
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:16,920
Well?

162
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,080
Me?
Yeah.

163
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:18,960
I’m busy …

164
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,800
I’ve got to take this hard disk to my colleague.

165
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,000
You guys go.

166
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,360
I … if you want to go too, I’ll wait for you.

167
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,800
Don’t be silly.

168
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,040
You can with Dina.

169
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,320
Who are you going to eat with?

170
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,880
If you don’t go, I’m not going.

171
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:35,920
Huh.

172
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:39,400
Nan, why won’t you join us?

173
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,760
We’ll all go together, it’ll be fun.

174
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,480
Come with us, please.

175
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:45,640
Uh…

176
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:47,760
Pretty please.

177
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,560
Hmm, ok I’ll go.

178
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,560
All that for nothing.

179
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,960
But we’ve got to finish the shoot first, ok?

180
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,080
Start shooting then.
Come on, take some shots. 2–3 more should do it.

181
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,280
You’ve got me over here now.
Go, quickly.

182
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,920
This is so difficult.

183
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,040
Ok, smile.

184
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,240
1, 2, 3.

185
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,200
You’ve got your eyes closed in every shot …

186
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,080
Ok, come on, let’s get one.

187
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,120
Is everything ok?

188
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:22,880
Let’s do it again.

189
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,360
Can you look natural, please.

190
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,280
We’re supposed to be selling a product.

191
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,080
Ok, here we go.

192
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,360
Try again. Ready?
Hang on one second, please.

193
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:36,080
Phupa, stand like this.

194
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,160
Give me the product a moment.

195
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,560
Watch how it’s done.

196
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,320
Dina, hold me tight.

197
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,480
Tighter! Don’t worry, I’m not prudish, I’m a ex-pro model.

198
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,320
Ok, start shooting.
Ok, I’m ready.

199
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:50,760
Ok, move that pack down a little.
Is he really doing this?

200
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,120
I’m starting to have fun here.
Hang on.

201
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,160
It’s ok, hug me tight, that’s it.

202
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,000
ok, we’re ready.
Start shooting.

203
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,040
Ok, here we go.
Phu!

204
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:03,840
Phu!

205
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,240
Phu!

206
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,520
Carry on shooting.
It’s fine.

207
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,920
Phu, are you ok?

208
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,920
Open the door.

209
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:26,480
Phu …

210
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:27,840
I just … I

211
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,520
I can’t do it.

212
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,760
The old symptoms have come back.

213
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,720
Open the door for me, please.

214
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,520
Phu, take deep breaths.

215
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,200
You managed to do this before at uni.

216
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,080
Just stop overthinking things.

217
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,560
Take deep breaths.

218
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,080
That’s it. Breathe in.

219
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,520
Calm down … breathe out slowly.

220
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,520
In.

221
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,880
Out.

222
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,520
In.

223
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,200
Out …

224
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,920
Nan, I’m so sorry.

225
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:29,840
My body shuts down when lots of people are around …

226
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,040
It doesn’t do what I want it to do.

227
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,280
They’re asking me to look at the camera and I can’t even do that.

228
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,120
I understand.

229
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,760
It’s just like when you were on stage that time.

230
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,280
There wasn’t anyone there to help you.

231
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,600
Listen to me.

232
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,600
I’ll be there with you this time.

233
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,480
Ok?

234
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,920
I can’t.

235
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:07,400
Look at the time.
Hmm, Ken, Nan’s on his way back.

236
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,080
Wait here a moment.

237
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,960
How is everything?

238
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,760
Phu, are you ok?
Ken, sir.

239
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,960
I need to ask you all a favor.

240
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:27,720
I need to brief Phupa one-on-one.
Once we’re ready, I’ll call you all back in.

241
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,200
No problem.

242
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,080
Really? What’s going on, Ken?

243
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,520
Ken?

244
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:37,560
What’s going on?

245
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,680
Ok, listen up everybody.

246
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,440
I need to ask you to leave for a moment.

247
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:47,480
I need to brief Phupa on his on-screen presence.

248
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,600
If he’s ready, I’ll …

249
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,280
I’ll ask you all to come back.

250
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,800
I’m sorry to have to do this.

251
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:57,040
Ok, let’s give them a little time.

252
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,040
If he can’t sort it out … we’ll get someone new in.

253
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,840
Don’t stress, we believe in you.

254
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,160
Let’s go.

255
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,200
I can’t.

256
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,400
Come here.

257
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,360
Believe me, please.

258
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,160
Wow, that’s it! That’s excellent.

259
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,400
Look beyond the camera

260
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,240
and think about talking to someone you know.

261
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,760
Send that feeling through your eyes.

262
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,760
Breathe in.

263
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,080
Breathe out.

264
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,440
Do you feel it?

265
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,200
Yes, I do.

266
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,200
He looks great.

267
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,240
Yes, he does.

268
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,600
Oh, wow, it’s amazing.

269
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:46,800
And we’re done for the day.

270
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:54,240
I’d like to thank everyone
for all your hard work today!

271
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,120
Thank you so much.

272
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,080
Thank you.

273
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,200
I’d like to thank Dina for joining us today

274
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,160
and especially Phupa.

275
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,960
You were outstanding.

276
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,360
I’m pleased we stuck with you.

277
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,680
Thank you.

278
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,960
Phupa’s been a star ever since university.

279
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,480
We were Prom King and Queen together.
Really?

280
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,080
That’s right.

281
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:20,040
I can’t believe I never knew
that you’d been prom King and prom Queen together.

282
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:25,600
I knew I’d made the right choice for you, Ken.

283
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:26,560
Um...

284
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,960
Anyway, thank you once again for today.

285
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,400
Gie Gie!
Yes?

286
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,840
Call my driver for me please.
Sure, no problem.

287
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,600
I’m so pleased with how that went.

288
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,520
Thanks again.

289
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,200
I’m off now.

290
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,160
Goodbye.

291
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,280
Goodbye.
Bye bye.

292
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:46,720
Did you see how happy Ken was?

293
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,080
Really?
He was over the moon with you.

294
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,720
Come, take a look at your work.

295
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,000
Look how great it is!

296
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,120
You look amazing.

297
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,480
It’s fantastic.

298
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,720
Is that really your first time?

299
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,160
Hmm.

300
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,480
Are you serious?
How was it? Amazing, right?

301
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,280
Amazing.
Who’s friend is it?

302
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,520
Dina?
Yes?

303
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,440
You hungry?
Very.

304
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,600
Shall we go and find something to eat?

305
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,760
You don’t have to ask me twice, I’m starving.

306
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,400
Come on then.
What shall we have?

307
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,960
Look at me in the eyes, and try to express

308
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,040
the feeling of love to that special one.

309
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,800
Smile!

310
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,480
Ready?

311
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,360
Nan …

312
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,320
I love you.

313
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,320
Huh?

314
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,280
I’d like a coffee please.

315
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,000
No problem, one moment please.
Ok.

316
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:56,280
One hot drip coffee, medium roast.
Thank you.

317
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,320
Hmm … is this Phupa’s room?

318
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,200
Phupa, there’s someone here to see you.

319
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,200
Let them in.

320
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:28,600
Please go inside.
Thank you.

321
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:35,640
Phupa, I’ve finished fixing the cooker hood.
I’ll be leaving now.

322
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,200
Oh, Dina, how did you find out where I lived?

323
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,920
My goodness, that shows you haven’t thought of me at all.

324
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,600
I asked the team for your address.

325
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:57,880
Oh, I see, is something up?

326
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:04,000
My casting director wants you to try out for a role
because he saw your photos from the last job.

327
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,680
So, I told him I’d come and ask you.

328
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,040
No, thank you.

329
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:12,480
What? … This project is going to be amazing,
it will suit you down to the ground.

330
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:15,640
Just come to casting with me, will you?

331
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,440
Dina, you know how bad I am in front of the camera.

332
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,480
You saw me that day, and that was just photography.

333
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,480
The photographers almost tore my head off!

334
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,360
That was just your first time.

335
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,240
It’ll be easier from now on.

336
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,320
Come on, have a go, please!

337
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:34,080
Why don’t we try some right here?

338
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,240
Let’s see how you go.

339
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,800
Come on, I’ll be the evil woman.

340
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,960
Sit down here, Mr Assanai.

341
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:10,080
Oh dear, just come and sit down!

342
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,760
Just this.

343
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:17,560
Just that, really?
Yes!

344
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:22,200
Well, why don’t we go and do it outside then?
That’s fine.

345
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:23,400
Let’s go.

346
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,040
Oh!
Oh!

347
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,920
I’ve bought us some dinner to celebrate you completing the job.

348
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,440
Dina.
Hi.

349
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:31,160
Dina came to invite me to cast for another project.

350
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,240
Oh …

351
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,720
Do you live here with Phu, Nan?

352
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,160
No, he lives across the hall.

353
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,800
Oh, I see …

354
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,080
Would you like to join us for dinner?

355
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,640
Hey, we should be careful of the reporters around here.

356
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,440
They might start some rumors about us.

357
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,800
Rumors are good.

358
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,080
They might turn into the truth!

359
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:03,400
Oh, but I’ve got an appointment with my trainer.

360
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,520
Let’s do it again another time instead.

361
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,200
I’m sure I’ll be round here a lot from now on.

362
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:11,520
I’m not going to let you get away this time!

363
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:17,600
Nan, make sure you keep on at him … I’m going now.

364
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,840
Bye bye.

365
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:30,800
Shall we eat?

366
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,000
Hmm.

367
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:45,880
Are you two dating again or something?

368
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,520
Don’t be silly.

369
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,920
She just came to ask me to cast for a project.

370
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,440
You know I can’t do it.

371
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,320
Hmm.

372
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,600
I can see that she’s liked you for a long time.

373
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,720
She used to ask for my help with you at uni.

374
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,400
So, did you help her?

375
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,760
Well, I could see she liked you.

376
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,480
And have you ever thought to ask who it is that I like?

377
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,400
Get out of the way.

378
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,080
Are you really saying you’ve never known who I liked?

379
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,280
How would I know?

380
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,120
You’ve never told me.

381
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,920
I thought you knew everything about me.

382
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,720
How would I know?

383
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,600
Go and answer that.

384
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,040
I’ll get all this ready.

385
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,040
Hello?

386
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,400
Hello, Nan Fah?

387
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:56,760
Hmm … The billboard is looking excellent.

388
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,960
We’re trending at number 1!

389
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:01,840
Everybody’s calling me asking about our presenter.

390
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,720
Yes, I’ve seen the feeds blowing up.

391
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,840
want to say thank you for your help, Ken.

392
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:09,400
Thank you for taking a risk on me.
Hmm … I’ve got something else.

393
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:14,200
I want Phupa to be a presenter
on our new stem cell product project.

394
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,640
I want to get him locked in.

395
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,640
I’ll leave it with you, ok?
Thank you!

396
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:22,200
Ok, I’ll see what he has to say.

397
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,160
(Mum)

398
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,680
(Mum, missed call)

399
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,760
Mum: When are you coming to see me?
I haven't seen you in 10 years.

400
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:53,120
You must have forgotten me by now.
Call me, Phu.

401
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:56,840
I’ve got to leave for Melbourne straight away.
Hey, when did you get back to Thailand?

402
00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:01,000
You promised me that you’d always be by my side.

403
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,120
Hmm.

404
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,480
I promise.

405
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,080
Nan, it’s ready.

406
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,960
Come here so we can eat.

407
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,560
Come on.

408
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:43,360
Nan, it’s ready.

409
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:50,720
What’s wrong, are you so hungry you’ve gone deaf?

410
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,640
You …

411
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,440
You didn’t go to Melbourne at all, did you?

412
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,880
Why did you lie to me like that?

413
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:12,120
Nan.

414
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:13,560
It’s …

415
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,360
You just disappeared.

416
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:26,360
You lied to me for 10 years!

417
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,600
How could you do that to me?

418
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,520
You’re not going to tell me the truth, are you?

419
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:50,320
You’re going to leave it like this for ever, aren’t you?

420
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,920
You’re just going to leave me guessing.

421
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,920
Leave me guessing by myself about what

422
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,240
I did wrong to make you leave.

423
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,520
Do you realize just how

424
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:12,120
much of a freak …

425
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:22,200
You asked me
whether I knew everything about you, right?

426
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,400
Don’t you see?

427
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,000
I really don’t know anything about you.

428
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,160
You’re not going to give me an answer, are you?

429
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,320
Nevermind!

430
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,920
I don’t care anymore.

431
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:49,000
I don’t give a freak about that.

432
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:55,040
Hey, wait!
Don’t you dare!

433
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:58,200
Don’t freaking bother,

434
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,400
you are freaks.

435
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:07,760
Nan!

436
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,680
Nan!

437
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,600
Nan, listen to me.

438
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:01,640
Ok, go ahead! What is it?

439
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,440
I didn’t go to stay with my mother.

440
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,320
I went to stay with Granny.

441
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:12,960
I went to see her a couple of times though.

442
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,440
She said you weren’t there.

443
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,520
I asked her to lie to you for me.

444
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:28,320
Why?

445
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,760
What did I do to deserve that?

446
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,040
Why can’t you just tell me the truth?

447
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:37,720
You left as suddenly as you returned.

448
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,480
Did you ever stop to think how I’d feel?

449
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,480
Didn’t you ever stop to think

450
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,400
how much I was worrying about you?

451
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:01,000
I asked myself every day just what I did wrong.

452
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:03,760
Nothing at all.

453
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,000
You didn’t do anything wrong.

454
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,720
It was all my fault.

455
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,200
So, what was it all about?

456
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,480
Tell me.

457
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,600
Tell me now!

458
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,520
I was so stupid to think

459
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,880
that I could just run away

460
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,280
and everything would come back to normal.

461
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:47,920
I didn’t want anything to change between us.

462
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,520
I thought I’d lose you.

463
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,320
Change?

464
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,320
What change?

465
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,560
What are you talking about?

466
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:06,080
Wasn’t it you who left me in the first place?

467
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,040
If you’re capable of doing something like that,

468
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:21,080
why don’t you just leave properly.

469
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,800
I don’t want to see you ever again.

470
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,040
You love me, don’t you?

471
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:54,160
Let’s just … put your date of birth.

472
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,880
I love you too.

473
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,680
I love you,

474
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,240
but I’m not brave enough to tell you.

475
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,440
Over there, Nan’s waiting for you.

476
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:12,000
Nan Fah … how’s it going?

477
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:14,520
Hi Grandma.
Hi there.

478
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:16,120
How are thing?

479
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:17,280
Wow.

480
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:19,760
You’re looking as handsome as ever.

481
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:22,040
How are you?

482
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,160
I’m well, thanks.

483
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:23,920
How have you been?

484
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:26,400
I’m doing fine, you know, just plodding along.

485
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,760
How are you feeling now you’ve finished uni?

486
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:33,760
Come on, let’s get something to drink.

487
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:36,280
Bern, go and make us some drinks,

488
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,200
alcoholic ones please.

489
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,240
Ok, madame.

490
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,400
Come on, let’s get a drink.

491
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:41,200
Can we take a raincheck please.
Oh.

492
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:45,040
It’s just, I’ve come to ask you something.
What is it?

493
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,200
Has Phupa been here?

494
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:50,680
He said he’d gone to Melbourne to be with his mother.

495
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,640
But I haven’t been able to reach him at all.

496
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:56,520
Hmm … I don’t have any idea either.

497
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,880
He’s probably busy over there or something.

498
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:04,480
If he contacts me, I’ll let you know.
