1
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,920
Juliet, my darling,
Death, that hath sucked the honey of thy breath

2
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:31,000
hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.

3
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:33,000
hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.

4
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,600
Phu... are you in there?
We'll enter the darkness together, just as we promised.

5
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,600
Phu!

6
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:44,800
In the darkest hours, you kept your promise to stay by my side.
Phu!

7
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,000
You kept your promise to stay by my side.

8
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:48,880
Phu!

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,120
Thank you.

10
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,560
Hmm, I'm going home now.

11
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:54,920
Ok.

12
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:55,640
Hang on a moment.

13
00:00:59,320 --> 00:00:59,800
Um...

14
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:00,640
Hello.

15
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,680
Are you Nan Fah's friend?

16
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,160
Yes.

17
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,240
Not just any friend.

18
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:09,800
They're very close.

19
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,400
They're extremely good friends.

20
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,920
They live in the same condo complex, opposite each other.

21
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:14,800
Um...

22
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,200
This is my boss.

23
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,040
Goodness me, have you any manners at all?

24
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,480
We're in the middle of a meeting

25
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,800
and you just waltz in here like it's nothing.

26
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,760
I'd like to apologize to you all.

27
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,600
I thought Nan Fah needed this urgently,

28
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,920
so I just rushed in.

29
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:38,080
Ok, I'll go now.

30
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,200
Goodbye.

31
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,040
I'll be off.

32
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,160
Hmm, ok, thanks again.

33
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,640
This is unacceptable, Nan.

34
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,920
We can't just let anyone into the offices.

35
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,200
Right, Ken?

36
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:57,320
Your friend is very interesting.

37
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,800
I'm better than him.

38
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,040
Right, Gie Gie?

39
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,760
Ken, sir.

40
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,320
I hope I'm not overstepping my boundaries here

41
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,000
but I saw how you were looking at him.

42
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,720
I know you were thinking the same as me

43
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:18,200
when Phupa walked in just now.

44
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,800
What an aura he had!

45
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,560
He has pet fish,

46
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,480
he's a musician,

47
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,360
he has his own coffee plantation

48
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,400
and, most importantly,

49
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,720
he makes the best drip coffee I've ever tasted!

50
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,600
That's quite enough, Gie Gie.

51
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:31,920
Deary me,

52
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,760
when did you find out all that about him?

53
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,280
This is what I do!

54
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,320
In fact, I've got something to ask you, Nan,

55
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,600
how the hell did you overlook Phupa?

56
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,840
I thought you were best friends.

57
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,400
He doesn't seem so special to me.

58
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,320
I can't see him making it big.

59
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,160
His face is boring and expressionless.

60
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,320
Is this him?

61
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,200
He's blowing up on social media.

62
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,120
People are sharing his stuff everywhere.

63
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,720
That's him all right!

64
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,480
Look at this, Ken.

65
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,400
This shows that Gie Gie and I aren't making this up.

66
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,360
That's right.

67
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,200
Nan Fah.

68
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:14,920
Yes?

69
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,000
How would you feel about us

70
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,440
casting your friend for our project?

71
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,200
Um... I...

72
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:24,960
No problem at all.

73
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,720
If that's what you would like,

74
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,920
we'll make it happen.

75
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,920
Answer him,

76
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,040
otherwise we'll see his angry side.

77
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,680
Not a problem, sir.

78
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,000
I'll have a chat with him.

79
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:39,800
Hmm.

80
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,080
He looked great.

81
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,720
Ken saw what a great fit he'd be for us.

82
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,440
He has an aura about him.

83
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,560
Let me help.

84
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,160
Hmm.

85
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,200
Where do you want it?

86
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,720
Over there.

87
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:56,960
Put it down.

88
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,640
I can't believe it. You're famous!

89
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:12,000
May I ask: Do you have a manager yet?

90
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,760
I could manage you if you like.

91
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,720
A manager?

92
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,600
Yes.

93
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,440
What about your dad doing it?

94
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,080
Very funny, you idiot.

95
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,280
Hmm.

96
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,880
Phu... I want to thank you for today.

97
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,800
You're welcome... my burden.

98
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,680
It's good you said that actually,

99
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,760
I don't need to worry what you'll think anymore.

100
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:44,080
I'll be your personal burden for ever.

101
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,120
I'm already exhausted.

102
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,080
Oh, Phu.

103
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,520
You know that coffee shop next to my office?

104
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,760
They're looking for a bean supplier.

105
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,880
I took them some of your beans.

106
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,440
They're interested.

107
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,600
You should talk to them.

108
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,960
Really?

109
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,840
Really.

110
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,400
And they trust you of all people?

111
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,640
I work in marketing, you fool.

112
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,280
Don't you think I know how to present products?

113
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,760
What do you think,

114
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,560
that I just bumble through each day not knowing what I'm doing?

115
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,400
Exactly.

116
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,240
Whatever. Thank you for doing that.

117
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,000
Oh, Phu.

118
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:23,560
What would you have said about the coffee then?

119
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,360
It's like that, is it?

120
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,160
Yeah.

121
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,680
I'd tell them what was so good about the beans.

122
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,600
I'd say they were grown on a bountiful farm

123
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,640
and that every bean was of the utmost quality

124
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,640
because every bean had been allowed to grow

125
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,880
for the perfect amount of time before being harvested,

126
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,880
which is why they're so fragrant and flavorful.

127
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,880
Drinking this coffee makes you feel like you are in an orchard.

128
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:49,960
Phu...

129
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,480
What are you thinking about?

130
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,400
How did I overlook you for that role?

131
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,640
You know,

132
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,920
ever since we've known each other

133
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,320
and to this day

134
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,560
I've only just understood

135
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,560
that you are the one.

136
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,880
Phu...

137
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,680
Let me cast you as our presenter.

138
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,280
Oh, I get it...

139
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,880
This is why you contacted them about the coffee,

140
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,560
because you wanted me to be your presenter, right?

141
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,040
It's not like that.

142
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,920
They really are interested in your beans

143
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,800
but my boss is interested in you, too.

144
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,480
You know I'm not capable of doing that.

145
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,320
Don't you remember what I did

146
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,880
during that uni contest?

147
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,640
Phupa... are you ready?

148
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,440
I'm ready.

149
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,640
Ok... if everyone's ready,

150
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:11,280
these are our 5 finalists.

151
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,200
Give them a round of applause.

152
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:18,000
Next up is the part you've all been waiting for,

153
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:23,640
the talent showcase for the handsome young gentlemen
of the faculty.

154
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,080
Our first contestant is going to put on a show

155
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,680
known as a tragedy

156
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,440
from one of William Shakespeare's

157
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,040
most famous romantic plays:

158
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,400
Romeo and Juliet.

159
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,800
If you're all ready,

160
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:35,960
I'd like to welcome onto the stage

161
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,880
Phupa from the Faculty of Communication Arts.

162
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,160
Hang on a minute,

163
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,560
what the hell is he going to do up there?

164
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,320
Well, he's studying communication arts

165
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:51,080
so of course, he's going to put on a show.

166
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,280
A show?

167
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,520
He hasn't passed a single subject yet.

168
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,840
That's why he's up there now,

169
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,960
his lecturer said that if he can do this show,

170
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,800
he'll give him a pass on this subject.

171
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,480
Oh no.

172
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,680
OMG.

173
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,680
We've got to believe in him.

174
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,240
Phu!

175
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,600
You can do this!

176
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:12,520
Phu!

177
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,520
You can do it!

178
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:24,520
Phupa! Phupa! Phupa! Phupa!

179
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,400
Oh, Juliet, my darling,

180
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,760
the grim reaper has taken your life,

181
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,000
but he couldn't take your beauty.

182
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,800
Love is... Hey!.

183
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,440
Love is... what was it?

184
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,360
Err... what was the line?

185
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,560
Hey!, Phu!

186
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,720
Oh, Juliet, my darling,
Death, that hath sucked the honey of thy breath,

187
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,800
hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.

188
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,520
hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.

189
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:41,840
Forbidden love...

190
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,600
Phu!

191
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,640
Who is Phu?

192
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,680
Phu, are you in there?

193
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,520
will keep us together for ever.
Phu!

194
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,320
Hay!...

195
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:06,920
Are you OK?

196
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,040
Nan, I'm sorry...

197
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,440
Don't worry about it. It's a difficult line.

198
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,040
Phu...

199
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,080
Are you ok?

200
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,040
Take a deep breath.

201
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,120
Why do I always mess up when people are watching?

202
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,480
It's always the same.

203
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,720
You did it so well when we rehearsed together.

204
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,200
Hang on. Try this.

205
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,040
Phu... repeat after me

206
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,480
look ahead and say

207
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,160
Oh, Juliet, my darling

208
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,360
Say it! Juliet, my darling.

209
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,440
Oh, Juliet, my darling,

210
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,360
Death, that hath sucked the honey of thy breath

211
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,040
Death, that hath sucked the honey of thy breath

212
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,480
hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.

213
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,400
hath had no power yet upon my beauty.

214
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,360
Not my, you idiot...

215
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,320
hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.

216
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,840
hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.

217
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:29,360
Forbidden love... sit down.

218
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,160
Forbidden love

219
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,600
has brought us to the end.

220
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,160
Here I will remain.

221
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,120
Look up to the sky and open the bottle.

222
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,680
Will I set up my everlasting rest,

223
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,840
We shall enter the darkness together

224
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,640
just as we hath promised.

225
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,120
Together

226
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,080
until the bitter end.

227
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,120
Kiss...

228
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:26,920
Kiss me!

229
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:27,920
Really?

230
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:28,440
Yes!

231
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:57,960
Phu!!

232
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,440
What are you doing?

233
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,720
I meant a fake kiss, you idiot.

234
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,240
Ok, done.

235
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,720
Phu!

236
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:33,800
Joe

237
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:34,960
Joe

238
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,080
Joe

239
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,040
Joe

240
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,400
Phu's fainted.

241
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:39,600
What?

242
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,800
I'm so exhausted.

243
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,240
Phu.

244
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,040
Huh?

245
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,360
Thank you so much for your help up there.

246
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,480
Without you, we'd have gotten a beating from those senior students.

247
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,840
All that practice and you still needed me next to you.

248
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,240
I saw how well you knew those lines.

249
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,360
If it'd been you up there,

250
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,720
you'd have won.

251
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,400
This award

252
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,040
What?

253
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,040
should belong to you.

254
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,000
Put this sash on too

255
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,320
Here.

256
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:22,720
It's not that simple.

257
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,920
This belongs to both of us,

258
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,600
half each!

259
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:32,640
Hmm.

260
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,800
But this will be the last time...
The last time I will ask for something from you.

261
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,280
I know. Don't repeat yourself.

262
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,480
Ok? I promise.

263
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:44,800
You really promise

264
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,760
that you won't do it again?

265
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:48,760
Yeah.

266
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:53,920
You know I don't like it when there are crowds of people.

267
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:58,240
Is that because the only person you want around is me?

268
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,280
Hey! There's something on your crutch?

269
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,120
What?

270
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,200
Hey!

271
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,160
Why?

272
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,120
Yeah.

273
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,960
Hey, what are you doing?

274
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,880
Come on, say it.

275
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,960
If you don't say it, I'm leaving now.

276
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,200
You...

277
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,120
Yeah, yeah.

278
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,640
I give in.

279
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,840
I promise not to do it again.

280
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,640
What was that? I didn't hear you.

281
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,960
I promise not to do it again.

282
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,240
Ok?

283
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,960
Excellent. Come on.

284
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,600
Is that all?

285
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:43,480
Give me my crutch back.

286
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:44,760
Come and get it.

287
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:45,560
I'm coming, ok?

288
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,040
Now, give it back.

289
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:48,960
You idiot

290
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:49,720
I'm going.

291
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,160
Wait up!

292
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,360
I'll see you back at the room.
Hey!

293
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,360
Hey! Wait up.

294
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,600
Phu!

295
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,040
You Bastard.

296
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,440
You made the promise. Have you forgotten?

297
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,560
I have not.

298
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,080
But it's hardly the same thing.

299
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,760
You should find someone else.

300
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,160
I don't want to make a fool of myself.

301
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,200
And I don't want to mess things up at your job.

302
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,360
Hmm...

303
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,120
But they really are interested in you at the coffee shop.

304
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,880
Don't forget about tomorrow.

305
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,120
Hmm... thank you.

306
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,280
I'll be there tomorrow.

307
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,000
Granny's  calling. Hang on.

308
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,240
Hmm, do what you need to do.

309
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,640
Hi Granny... What are you up to?

310
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,880
Hello, Phupa!

311
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,320
I'm...

312
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:52,720
with my friends doing teenager stuff.

313
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:57,800
We're also drinking some of the craft beer you made.

314
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,200
You don't mind, do you?

315
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,280
Not at all, just don't drink too much.

316
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:05,400
Oh... do you want to keep it all to yourself?

317
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:08,760
I guess I won't be getting any at my own funeral.

318
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,160
No, no, I'm concerned.

319
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,200
Oh, Granny, how is the farm looking?

320
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:17,480
Not great, to be honest.

321
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,320
It's nothing like it was 4–5 years ago.

322
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,400
Oh, Granny...

323
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,120
You know that shop I mentioned?

324
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,040
Don't worry.

325
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,600
I've got a coffee shop now.

326
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,320
It'll have a little showroom

327
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,840
where we can display our products for the customers to try.

328
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,080
It'll be great.

329
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:35,600
My friend already talked to a potential customer earlier today.

330
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,760
I'll meet them tomorrow.

331
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,960
Oh a friend, who's that?

332
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,360
This guy.

333
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,240
Nan, come here.

334
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:45,120
Wow... Nan Fah!

335
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,280
I haven't seen you in ages!

336
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,480
Hello, Granny!

337
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,440
How are things?

338
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,680
Well... quite lonely.

339
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,680
It's boring without Phu here for company.

340
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:57,200
Me and the gang just look for stuff to do.

341
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,160
You must have missed  Phu terribly.

342
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,840
Phu's been in Melbourne for a decade, eh?

343
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:05,840
Hmm... yes... it's been extremely difficult.

344
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,600
Ok, I'll leave you two to chat.

345
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,120
I've got some work to get on with.

346
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,000
Hmm...

347
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,760
I'm going home now.

348
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:28,880
Hmm.

349
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:29,840
Hmm.

350
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,080
Hey!

351
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,560
Your secret almost slipped out there.

352
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:43,120
You still haven't told him about Melbourne, have you?

353
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:46,400
If he knew I was in Thailand all this time,

354
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,840
he'll be pissed off at me.

355
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:51,320
He'll want to know... why I did something like that.

356
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,840
Phupa, Nan Fah was looking all over for you.

357
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,960
He even came to the farm a few times.

358
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,040
Secrets are never good, you know.

359
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:03,640
You either tell him or he'll eventually find out.

360
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,640
Think about it.

361
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,240
I'll leave it with you then.

362
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,280
He's very busy right now,

363
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,480
but I'll find the right time and let him know.

364
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,680
And are you going to tell him everything?

365
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,160
I miss you, Granny! Sweet dreams... bye bye.

366
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:58,440
Take that! Hmm... ooh.

367
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,040
Ohh...

368
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,160
Yeah!

369
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:04,240
Take that...

370
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,320
Quickly!

371
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,480
Oh!

372
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,240
Follow him.

373
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,120
How was your chat with Phupa last night, Nan?

374
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,720
Do you need to ask?

375
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,640
His face tells it all.

376
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:20,440
Oh... I don't think you need to try and convince him.

377
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,200
People would kill for this opportunity.

378
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,000
Hmm... true.

379
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,080
If it were me, I wouldn't bother talking.

380
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:31,520
Hmm.

381
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,680
Gie Gie, hold this.

382
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,360
Play for me.

383
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,600
Quick! Just for a minute.

384
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,040
How do you play this again?

385
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,640
What about the presenter?

386
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,880
Have you found one yet? It's stressing me out.

387
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,120
I'm serious.

388
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,320
Oh, Ken, hello.

389
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,920
Hello.
Hello.

390
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,080
Ken, sir.

391
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,080
You know my friend you wanted to cast?

392
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,560
Well, he...
Ah yes, I was just going to say,

393
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:06,360
there's no need to cast him anymore.

394
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,720
See, Ken has come to his senses.

395
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:12,800
Casting someone like Phupa would be a waste of time,

396
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:13,640
right?

397
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,960
Yes, a complete waste of time

398
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,320
because I've already decided on him being our presenter.

399
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:20,720
Yes.

400
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:30,200
How did you come to that realization without casting?

401
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,720
I've already casted him earlier today.

402
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,560
Have you?

403
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,560
Indeed.

404
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:01,480
Ok.

405
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,920
How... How can I help you?

406
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,200
Can... Can I help you with anything?

407
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,680
I'm a friend of Nan Fah.

408
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,840
I've brought some coffee beans.

409
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,240
Oh!

410
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,640
Khun Phupa.

411
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,440
Nan Fah has told me all about your coffee.

412
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:31,040
I wanted to try it for myself.

413
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:34,720
Please would you make me a cup to try?

414
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:35,960
It would be my pleasure.

415
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,680
May I come in?

416
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,280
Of course, the door is just there.

417
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:49,840
Can I use this?

418
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:50,880
Go for it.

419
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,040
May I try a cup?

420
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,040
Do you remember me?

421
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,840
We met in a meeting at my offices.

422
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,840
Oh... hmm...

423
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,400
I must apologize,

424
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:09,280
there were so many people around that day.

425
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,200
No problem at all.

426
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:11,920
Is this your coffee?

427
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,200
Yes, sir.

428
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:18,720
In that case, could you tell me what's so special about it?

429
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,760
About my coffee?

430
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,520
Yes...

431
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,720
These beans have undergone a new roasting technique,

432
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,960
giving them an intense aroma.
It has a bitter start but sour finish,

433
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,800
leaving a fruity taste on the tongue.

434
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:43,880
None of those people you presented during casting

435
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,360
were to my liking,

436
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:50,760
so I've concluded that Phupa is the one we need.

437
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,120
Your coffee is ready, sir.

438
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:53,000
It's just like you said about the fruity taste on the end of my tongue.

439
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,080
This is delicious.

440
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:58,200
It's delicious because you willingly waited for it.

441
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,480
You're so right.

442
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,960
If we place importance on something,

443
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:06,200
it becomes important by definition.

444
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:13,280
I've saved you all time, isn't that a good thing?

445
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,800
Yes, it's not that I'm lazy or anything.

446
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,720
Anyway, you're right.

447
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,800
Phupa's the best option for us right now.

448
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:28,640
It's not important who we select

449
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,560
because if we can overcome this crisis as a team,

450
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:37,000
there'll be a reward waiting for you.

451
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,160
I'll give you 3 hearts each.

452
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,520
And, whoever gets in touch with Phupa

453
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:45,640
will get an extra 2 hearts.

454
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,440
Wow!
Oh!

455
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,600
I'll see you soon!

456
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,120
Wow, thank you so much!

457
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:58,680
Nan, you simply must get this done!

458
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,720
These hearts of our jobs

459
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:07,920
haven't moved in the right direction for a long time.

460
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:11,160
If I can get just a few more, I'll be eligible for promotion.

461
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,400
That's applicable for all of us.

462
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:15,240
Most will get a promotion, and most will get a bonus.

463
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:18,920
Those hearts are there to encourage us to do our best.

464
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:23,600
Yes and that is why Phupa must join us!

465
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,840
There's no way Phupa's going to do it

466
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,800
You're breaking my heart.

467
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,400
Can you not destroy my moment of joy?

468
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,000
What's so difficult about it?

469
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:38,320
Man, I know him very well.

470
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,000
He's an introvert, who hates crowds of people.

471
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:46,360
Most importantly, he knew he can't do this job.

472
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:00,040
I won't allow my billboard to remain empty
because we don't have a presenter.

473
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,480
Who are you talking to?

474
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,240
I don't know.

475
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,760
I just know that Phupa has to change his mind.

476
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:11,840
Gie Gie,

477
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,040
I'll sort this out.

478
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,560
Gie Gie... you just find us an auspicious moment.

479
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,120
An auspicious moment would be...

480
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,400
one where you to mind your own business.

481
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,920
only 2 more stars!

482
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:42,240
We'll catch up with Man if we can sort this out.

483
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,560
Forget about that, we've got plenty of time.

484
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,880
Nan,

485
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,760
you know in the last 3 years

486
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,800
I haven't moved in that leaderboard like you guys.

487
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,240
You won't be angry at me

488
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,960
if I ask to try sorting it myself, will you?

489
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,640
Please...

490
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,560
Why isn't it going in?

491
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,120
Is it stuck on something?

492
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,240
Are we doing the right thing here?

493
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,280
Hmm...

494
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,160
Don't worry,

495
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:39,720
today's Wednesday... orange is the color of hope.

496
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,240
Here he comes.

497
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,280
What are you guys doing here so early?

498
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,240
Oh... um...

499
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,360
Hey, come here.

500
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,520
I've never seen him so angry.

501
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,400
I'm busy decorating.

502
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,600
Oh, ok.
Oh.

503
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,840
Gie Gie's brought you something.

504
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:03,680
I brought you a gift for the new shop.

505
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,040
A special Buddhist figurine for luck and dexterity.

506
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:13,800
Sorry...

507
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:17,400
I meant luck and prosperity.

508
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,480
I hope it brings your shop good fortune.

509
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,400
Thank you.

510
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,640
Sathu.

511
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,440
Sathu.

512
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,160
I'll leave it here.

513
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:24,720
Ok.

514
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:28,320
Remember when we looked at those fortune cards?

515
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,920
They were accurate in their predictions

516
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:33,240
when they said there'd be some unexpected changes afoot.

517
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,600
Then you got this shop!

518
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,400
Oh yeah, you're right.

519
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,400
They were spot on.

520
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:40,160
So, would you mind if we have another go?

521
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,240
Hmm... another go?

522
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,640
Ok, ok.

523
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,840
Let's take a look.

524
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,560
Ok, I suppose we could.

525
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,920
Cut them equal times to your age.

526
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,080
Equal to my age?

527
00:31:59,080 --> 00:31:59,720
Exactly.

528
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,760
Make a wish before you choose.

529
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,360
Go ahead, choose one.

530
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,160
This one.

531
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:16,640
Are you sure?

532
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:17,960
I'm sure.

533
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:18,560
Sure?

534
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,240
Sure, do it.

535
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,560
I'm sure it will be great.

536
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:32,360
Death.

537
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,880
Something will come to an end or expire.

538
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,800
Doesn't sound so great.

539
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:41,680
No problem,

540
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,120
choose again because I...

541
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,480
I'm not going to let anything bad happen to our presenter.

542
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,400
Wait a minute.

543
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,040
Who is your presenter?

544
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,600
You didn't mention this.

545
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:56,840
Um...

546
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,680
Oh... it's...

547
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,960
She's presenting you with this statue

548
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,120
Um... yes... that's it.

549
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,520
It's nothing to do with anything else.

550
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,320
That's right.

551
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:06,560
Yes, we're talking about this figurine.

552
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,880
Obstacles are like grains of sand.

553
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:30,000
Despite their number, they're easily removed.

554
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:33,920
Are you talking to me?

555
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:36,720
Pardon me?

556
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:46,160
Hello? Check, one, two. Ok.

557
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:52,960
Hmm...

558
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,640
I can hear your heart beating.

559
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:01,760
Fear can actually be something...

560
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,400
which we create ourselves.

561
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,840
Fear of speaking.

562
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,160
Fear of expressing ourselves.

563
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,320
fear of making mistakes.

564
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,280
Once more please.

565
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,440
Ah ha!

566
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:16,200
You're scared, aren't you?

567
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,120
Look here please.

568
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,640
Who's scared?

569
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:20,480
Not me.

570
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:23,160
What do those without fear end up with?

571
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,440
And what is lost through fear?

572
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,880
Don't... hey, hang on.

573
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:29,200
We must therefore

574
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,960
try not to keep our fear inside of us

575
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,840
because it will build up

576
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,800
and end up in an explosion.

577
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:41,280
It could end up holding us back, right?

578
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:44,840
Something difficult to deal with.

579
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,800
Once it reaches that stage, oh dear...

580
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,360
How much is that, Phupa?

581
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:49,240
How much?

582
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:51,840
No! Don't stop!

583
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:56,000
Exactly, how much longer must we be fearful?

584
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,400
A very long time.

585
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,600
Non-stop.

586
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,560
That's it, pick that fear up

587
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:03,680
and kick it away into Asgard.

588
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:06,000
Once it is in the Asgard

589
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,720
we'll see it if it comes back into focus and

590
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,560
push it away again, keeping it there.

591
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,880
We can lock it up in Asgard.

592
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,160
Bang! And then we look

593
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:14,280
You can do it! You can do it!

594
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:14,920
Yay!

595
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:24,760
You can do it! You can do it!

596
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,000
But I can't do this.

597
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:30,000
Oh dear... that's a big knife.

598
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,960
Don't worry, that's quite normal.

599
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,240
Fear is entirely normal.

600
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,520
See, I'm stuttering now

601
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,800
because I'm feeling fearful.

602
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,360
Oh... why are you following me?

603
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,360
It's ok, I'll leave.

604
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,680
I've been fearful since I was little.

605
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:43,440
Since I was still in the womb.

606
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:45,720
They had a knife and I was just like ‘ahhh'.

607
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:48,640
So, there I was in the womb

608
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:49,680
and, hey, I was scared.

609
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,320
I was very fearful. It's normal.
Hey, where are you going?

610
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,760
I'm leaving, sir.

611
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,160
Leaving?
We've hired you for the day!

612
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:57,000
I'm leaving.
Can't you see that huge freaking knife?

613
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,480
I'm off!
Hey, wait, Coach!

614
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,240
I'm gone!

615
00:35:59,240 --> 00:35:59,840
Coach!

616
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:02,800
This was your doing, right?

617
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,360
I think you'd all better leave.

618
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,240
Gie Gie, quickly!

619
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:18,280
Go, get out.

620
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:19,320
Me too?

621
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,560
Yes... go.

622
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:21,200
Gie Gie!

623
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:22,320
Gie Gie!

624
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:22,720
Huh?

625
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,240
Get out.

626
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:24,520
Of course.

627
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,480
Where are you going?

628
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:35,760
I'm leaving.
Please don't.

629
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,360
Look at the size of that knife!
He's crazy.

630
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,320
Look at his face, he wouldn't dare use that thing.

631
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,040
It's for cutting things.

632
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,400
I want to tell you something,

633
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:51,160
acting according to our heart's desire

634
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:52,920
isn't difficult.

635
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,720
It's only weaklings and cowards

636
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:00,200
who can't do it.

637
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:00,880
Where are you going?

638
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:03,760
Prawet, Bang Khen, Sam Sen, Pattaya, Pathum Kongka, Wattana, Bang Bor, Bang Sue,

639
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,520
Bang Son, Bang Krabue, Bang Bon, Khonkhaen, Yasothon, Phra Nakhon, Bang Khae.

640
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,960
He's gone!

641
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:16,680
Nan Fah!

642
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:19,200
You traitor!

643
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,320
Look what you've done.

644
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:23,400
The whole team is here, and that coach cost a fortune!

645
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,880
He wasn't here 10 minutes and he's already left.

646
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:29,400
But you shouldn't have snuck in like that.

647
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,160
So what?

648
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,880
We've come to make a show with him.

649
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,640
If we'd have made it, we'd all have been happy!

650
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:40,440
I think it is best if you all leave now.

651
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:42,000
My friend is extremely angry.

652
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:46,040
If he calls the police about trespassing, what will you do?

653
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:47,920
Oh my goodness...

654
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:57,840
Coach, wait up!

655
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,320
Man doesn't know what he's doing.

656
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,480
I told him this plan wouldn't work.

657
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:14,520
Right?

658
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,200
You too, please leave.

659
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,040
Me?

660
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:23,680
Yes.

661
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:25,800
Ok.

662
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,120
Bye bye, Party!

663
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,600
Me too?

664
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:37,680
Yeah.

665
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,720
Party, wait for me!

666
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,520
Phu, please may I have a photo with you?

667
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:10,600
Hmm.

668
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,360
Of course, I'll take it for you.

669
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,200
Strike a pose.

670
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:17,200
1, 2, 3.

671
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,240
Say cheese.

672
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,000
Outstanding.

673
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,080
It's a lovely photo.

674
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:22,320
Here, let me take a few more.

675
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:25,000
Don't forget to use #Joehaseverything

676
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:28,000
A great place to eat while listening to beautiful music from a handsome singer.

677
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,560
Thank you.
Thank you.

678
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:30,240
Hello.

679
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,200
Take a seat.

680
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:34,480
Can't you smile for my customers?

681
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:36,760
Not really.

682
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:40,240
Just playing in front of them makes me want to die.

683
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:41,960
Why?

684
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:42,920
Are you going to fire me?

685
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,080
Oh, come on...

686
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:47,800
Who in their right mind would fire you?

687
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:49,760
Oh, by the way, there's someone over there

688
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:51,840
who has come to see you.

689
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:53,960
He looks familiar, like he's been here before.

690
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:08,840
You haven't come to listen to me play, right?

691
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,640
I was listening actually.

692
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:12,600
You've got a great voice.

693
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:14,920
It got me thinking about why you can do this

694
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:19,360
but refused to be in our advertisement.

695
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:25,280
I do things I'm good at, not stuff I'm bad at.

696
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,280
I don't drink.

697
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:32,960
I quit a long time ago.

698
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:34,640
Is that true?

699
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,160
Nan drinks until he can barely walk.

700
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,040
How can you two be friends?

701
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,760
We've been friends for almost 30 years.

702
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,080
Don't count the 10 years you disappeared for.

703
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,440
I've come to ask you to reconsider.

704
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,120
If you're talking about the presenter job,

705
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,160
I'm not going to do it.

706
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,440
Sorry, I've got to go.

707
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,600
It's ok.
I'll sort it out.

708
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:00,960
What's going on here?

709
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,280
Phu, don't be afraid.

710
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:06,960
He's a shaman.

711
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,360
He can help alleviate your woes.

712
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,440
He'll send those evil spirits on their way.

713
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:12,840
It'll help.

714
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:15,440
Gie Gie.

715
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:17,080
What are you doing here?

716
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:18,960
I've just come to help.

717
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:22,680
Why are you doing this?

718
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,400
I just wanted to help out.

719
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:27,720
Go home.

720
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:29,280
But...

721
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,160
Go home now!

722
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:33,000
Ok, let's go.

723
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:35,160
I'm going. I'm going.

724
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:37,360
Quickly.

725
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:42,280
Ohm... ohm.

726
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:43,080
That's enough!

727
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,360
Ok, we're going.

728
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:49,800
You've got no respect.

729
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:53,560
Phu, I'm sorry about this.

730
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:02,080
I'm exhausted.

731
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:04,120
Not only that, but I'm also angry.

732
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,360
Look at how stubborn your friend's been.

733
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:08,560
I hired one of the best life coaches around and he didn't cares.

734
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,520
He threw it straight back in my face.

735
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:12,560
That wasn't clever and another thing is that

736
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,800
I don't really agree with Ken's vision anyway.

737
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,080
Is there something wrong?

738
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:18,680
Oh.

739
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:20,440
Ken, sir, hello.

740
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:20,960
Yeah.

741
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:21,560
Hello.

742
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:23,440
What were you doing down there, Ken?

743
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,280
I was fixing a plug socket.

744
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,360
There seems to be a lack of maintenance around here.

745
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:28,640
All the plugs are broken.

746
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:30,920
Have a seat.

747
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:35,160
Ok.

748
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:41,320
I don't mind if people don't agree with me.

749
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:46,360
I just see Phupa as having a rare gift.

750
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:51,360
It's an x-factor in his eyes.

751
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:56,120
He looks so honest and straightforward,

752
00:43:56,760 --> 00:44:00,000
but that he's also hiding something.

753
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:02,480
Ken, sir.

754
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:07,880
I don't think Phupa is going to take this job.

755
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:08,840
What?

756
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:11,320
Well...

757
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,320
I hope this doesn't come out like

758
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:14,600
I'm throwing the blame around but

759
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:18,760
Nan Fah has been putting obstacles in our way

760
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:22,480
and now Phupa doesn't seem interested in the job.

761
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:24,960
Is that right, Nan Fah?

762
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:32,080
Well... I know that my friend hates this kind of job.

763
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:36,520
Ken, sir, could we try this?

764
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:40,400
How about we hire someone well-known instead?

765
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:42,480
We can't.

766
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:46,080
It won't align with our concept of an everyman.

767
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:49,160
This concept is perfect for us.

768
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:52,800
I promise I'll find the right person for us.

769
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:54,360
Just like who you are looking for.

770
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:58,440
And what if you don't?

771
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:01,720
Are you going to take responsibility and quit?

772
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:05,840
I will.

773
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:07,160
Oh my goodness.

774
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:11,000
Can you please leave us alone.
Sure.

775
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:13,960
I'd like to speak with Nan Fah.

776
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:15,280
Of course.

777
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:17,640
You've made your promise.

778
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:28,400
Take a seat.

779
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:41,720
I don't think quitting is an answer to any of this.

780
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:45,520
Yes, sir.

781
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:49,560
It's true I've done very little about this,

782
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:53,160
but I'm not going to force my friend to do something

783
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:54,640
if he's not willing to do it.

784
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:02,120
It seems you really care about this friend of yours.

785
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:06,760
I do.

786
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:09,960
The reason I made that promise to quit just now

787
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,520
is because I want you to have confidence in my ability.

788
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:15,840
I promise I'll do everything I can to find a presenter.

789
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:20,400
Ok.

790
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:25,800
I accept your promise, too.

791
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:32,400
Hey! Find someone to sort this plug socket out.

792
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:54,280
Ohm... maha sane... wait.

793
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:56,560
What was it again?

794
00:46:57,560 --> 00:47:01,560
Om sane maha sane om na metta mahametta.

795
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:03,640
Om metta deva cittam

796
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:13,600
Believe and it will be.

797
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:17,520
Let's do this.

798
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:25,760
Which foot did the book say?

799
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,280
The right, no, try again.

800
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:30,920
Women go left foot first.

801
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:35,360
What if it isn't the one? Today's an even day.

802
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Phupa.

803
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:53,720
Phupa, I just wanted to apologize for last night.

804
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,560
I didn't mean to...

805
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:04,880
Don't worry.

806
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:05,720
Forget it.

807
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:08,840
You were doing what you thought was right. I'm not angry.

808
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:15,600
The balm worked!

809
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:20,960
Phupa.

810
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:23,520
Will you do this presenter job for us?

811
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:31,800
No, thank you.

812
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:45,720
That hurts worse than being broken up with.

813
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:49,400
Why?

814
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:50,680
Why didn't that work?

815
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:54,320
I must've said the wrong spell.

816
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:55,640
I'm not giving up.

817
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:56,640
Let's try again.

818
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:03,200
Believe and it will be.

819
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:04,680
Oh dear, it must work this time.

820
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:08,400
Believe and it will be.

821
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:15,880
Believe and it will be.

822
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:17,480
Gie Gie, what are you doing?

823
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:22,880
What?

824
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:25,640
It's special balm.

825
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:28,000
When put on the lips, your words come true.

826
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:30,840
The shaman said it was completely safe.

827
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:33,720
It's white magic.

828
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:36,840
It's made from specially harvested beeswax,

829
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:39,400
viper bones, and gecko saliva.

830
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:40,680
Eugh.

831
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:42,400
What?

832
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:43,720
Ew!

833
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:45,600
Wow.

834
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:47,840
Nan!

835
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:49,120
Oh.

836
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:52,320
That's very disrespectful of you.

837
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:54,960
How can that help us now?

838
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:58,040
You can't rely on magic to solve your problems.

839
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:00,400
I just wanted to help us all.

840
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:04,440
Gie Gie, isn't it our teamwork
that has brought us success in the past?

841
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:06,000
It had nothing to do with magic.

842
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:10,160
Oh, I see, you're blocking our team's path to glory again,
just like Man said.

843
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:11,440
Concentrate.

844
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:14,560
You seem to have been taken in by all that nonsense.

845
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:15,640
Look at your lips.

846
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,200
They're all swollen.

847
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:21,520
It must be the balm punishing me!

848
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:24,040
For you guys throwing it away.
Ah, come on!

849
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:25,720
You're allergic to the balm.

850
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:30,000
Get to the hospital and sort it out!

851
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:32,520
And promise me you won't do something like this again.

852
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:35,560
Go!
I'm just not as talented as you are, Nan.

853
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:37,480
That's why I need all that other stuff.

854
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:39,960
Charms, auspicious colors,

855
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:42,520
They give me the confidence I need to work here.

856
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:46,680
Gie Gie, calm down and just listen for a moment.

857
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:50,480
You're here because of your talent.

858
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:51,440
Yes.

859
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:53,280
You support us all the time.

860
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:53,800
Yes.

861
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,400
And you always encourage me when I need it.

862
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:55,960
Yes.

863
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:59,240
Believe me, we'll get through this.

864
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:00,800
Yes.

865
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:05,080
I feel bad about what I did

866
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:10,280
but I feel more itchy than bad right now.

867
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:13,880
You shouldn't have made that promise to Man.

868
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:16,120
I don't want to lose you from the team.

869
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:19,200
Hey... I'm more worried about losing you right now.

870
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:20,360
Go, get some help.

871
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,040
Oh, Phu, I'll be back, ok?

872
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:24,120
Uh hmm. Please go.

873
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:25,360
Oh, Gie Gie.

874
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:38,040
Nan!

875
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:40,240
What is it?

876
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:41,200
Who died?

877
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:42,720
The little one.

878
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:43,800
What little one?

879
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:44,840
Oliang?

880
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:46,240
Which little one?

881
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:47,480
This one.

882
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:54,680
The plant?

883
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:57,040
The plant's dead?

884
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:03,360
One of your little ones is still alive.

885
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:06,840
Hmm... it's ok.

886
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:08,800
Don't worry.

887
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:09,720
I can help.

888
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:13,680
Take it out.

889
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:15,800
Wash it with water.

890
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:21,360
This is an anti-fungal solution.

891
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:23,800
Just a few drops in the water on it, like this.

892
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:26,840
Only 3-4 drops.

893
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:31,320
Then leave your little one in there to soak

894
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:35,000
for about 5-10 minutes

895
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:38,240
then you replant him in a new pot of soil

896
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:39,880
That's all.

897
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:43,640
Ok, I'd better go.

898
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:44,640
Hey, wait a minute.

899
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:48,320
You still haven't...

900
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:50,640
Are you still angry with me

901
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:52,920
about my colleagues getting involved?

902
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:56,160
Not at all.

903
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:59,320
But I do wonder why they're so persistent.

904
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:04,120
They're just quite odd like that.

905
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:08,040
Hmm.

906
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:11,000
Can't you stick around? It hasn't been 5-10 minutes yet.

907
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:13,760
Take care of my little one while I do some work.

908
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:15,040
Pretty please.
Ok, ok.

909
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:33,600
Oh yeah, Nan.

910
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:39,280
Do you still remember the lines to Romeo and Juliet?

911
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:52,240
Oh Juliet, my darling,
Death, that hath sucked the honey of thy breath,

912
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:55,600
hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.

913
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:00,400
Forbidden love has brought us to the end

914
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:02,680
but here I will remain.

915
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:05,480
I can't believe we remember that.

916
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:09,560
I was so grateful for your help back then.

917
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:12,680
If I didn't have you, I would've been terrible.

918
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:15,280
I was happy to help.

919
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:19,160
I'm going to stay here with you forever.

920
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:23,160
And you… don't ever leave my side.

921
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:36,560
I need to carry on with this.

922
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:39,960
Oh!

923
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:42,600
This is terrible.

924
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:52,680
Oh... it's all destroyed.

925
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:54,360
Phu...

926
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:55,800
Don't worry about it.

927
00:54:56,480 --> 00:55:00,480
It's ok, we'll print out new ones.

928
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:04,840
No.

929
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:10,040
No.

930
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:14,080
No.

931
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:14,840
Yes.

932
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:19,000
You mean you're not happy with Nan Fah's suggestions, right?

933
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:22,760
I just think Phupa is the best fit for the role.

934
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:27,320
If we're forced into choosing an unsuitable candidate,

935
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:30,280
I'm worried we'll end up doing more damage
than we'd lose on the billboard.

936
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:33,520
True, but if we leave that billboard empty,

937
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:35,880
we'll be losing the company a lot of money.

938
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:39,600
Nan Fah, don't forget your promise.

939
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:42,520
Oh, it's such a terrible position we're in, Ken.

940
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:45,720
What are we going to do?

941
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:02,600
I've come to inform you that I'll be your presenter.

942
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:34,640
If you're here to talk about the presenter job, don't bother.

943
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:36,040
There's no way I'll do it.

944
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:41,480
What if it was Nan asking?

945
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:45,240
What is that supposed to mean?

946
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,120
Sit down and listen for a moment.

947
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:58,680
Oh, I don't smoke anymore.

948
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:03,960
I understand you.

949
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:06,800
You haven't seen him for 10 years,

950
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:09,240
so you don't feel like you know him as well as before.

951
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:16,240
Aren't you suspicious about how you secured this place?

952
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:24,640
It was Nan who came here every day
to convince them to take you on.

953
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:30,480
He never told me that.

954
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,600
Why would he?

955
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:38,480
He doesn't want you to feel bad.

956
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:43,560
If he asked you to be a presenter and used this against you,

957
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,240
you'd rightly see that as being dishonest.

958
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:49,160
Let me tell you something else.

959
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:52,440
It's not just about our boss being upset,

960
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:57,760
Nan has promised to quit if he can't find the right guy.

961
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:04,880
If it were me, I wouldn't stand by and let that happen.

962
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:14,560
Nan cares so much about you.

963
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:19,080
Thank you.
