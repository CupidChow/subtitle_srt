1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,400
Oh, Phu.
Hmm?

2
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:03,400
Did you hear about Tong and Waew dating?

3
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:05,760
You told me about it on the last day of class.

4
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:07,840
I’m so shocked about it.

5
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:11,280
They have been friends for so long
and now they’re together.

6
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:15,600
Why is that odd?
They’ve known each other a long time.

7
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,800
I wouldn’t date a friend.

8
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:19,240
It’s just weird.

9
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:22,920
Why?

10
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,960
Can’t friends become more than friends?

11
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,600
I suppose.

12
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,920
But it’s not my thing.

13
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,400
Just imagine that they split up,

14
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:37,240
what would happen to their friendship?
They’d be unable to look each other in the eyes.

15
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,440
They’d lose that friendship.

16
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,040
That’s why I’m against it.

17
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,120
Whatever. Have you chosen a tree yet?

18
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,120
Hang on.

19
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:56,520
Hey!

20
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:01,000
This one, this one’s perfect.
It should be easy to spot.

21
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,640
Have you finished?
This one should be fine.

22
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,840
Here, that’s deep enough.

23
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,320
My stuff’s in here.

24
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,600
Where’s yours?

25
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,080
Where?

26
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,600
This is why they call it a magic box.
See that?

27
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,680
That’s amazing.
Isn’t it just?

28
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,680
Nobody will know what’s really inside.

29
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,440
Good, good.
But what about yours?

30
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:32,600
I asked you to write something for us to dig up
in 15 years. Don’t tell me you forgot?

31
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:37,640
Give me your box
and I’ll put mine inside.

32
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,920
Wow.

33
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,560
What are you doing?

34
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,480
Ok, all done, let’s bury it.
Why are you being so secretive?

35
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,080
Hey!
You said we’ve got to wait 15 years.

36
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,320
Come on, let’s bury it.

37
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,840
Oh.
Quick! We’ve got to hurry.

38
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,920
Cover it.
That’s it.

39
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,680
Come on, help me.

40
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,360
Quickly.

41
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,520
Mission complete!
Yay!

42
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:07,560
Our time capsule mission is complete.

43
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,160
Oh, my goodness, if we read it all now
it would be so amusing.

44
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,480
Don’t forget to let me know
when you’re planning on digging it up.

45
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,720
Ok?
Hmm, ok.

46
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,160
I like you. I like you as more than a friend.
What are you talking about?

47
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,520
If you’re going to be like this,
we can’t continue being friends.

48
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:57,960
Nan! Nan!

49
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,120
What kind of a terrifying dream was that?

50
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,320
Nan, are you finished? I’m hungry.
Hm, hang on, I’m almost done.

51
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,200
Hey, you’ve showered already, right?

52
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,400
Hmm.

53
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,480
Have you applied your cream?

54
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,600
Definitely not yet.

55
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,240
Come here.

56
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,640
You’ve got to use it every day to form a habit.

57
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,800
Get it?

58
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:08,640
Yes.

59
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,680
In the morning you put this one on.

60
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:16,800
It’s a sun cream to protect your skin from
UV rays and PM2.5 pollutants.

61
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,480
Oh yeah, it reduces wrinkles, too.

62
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,480
Show me how you do it.

63
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:36,080
Hey, don’t you remember what I taught you?

64
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,040
Come here. I’ll show you how it’s done.

65
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,640
Here.

66
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,920
You’ve got to lovingly apply it.

67
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,920
Gently, like this.

68
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,760
So, when we put it on,

69
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,920
we’ll understand how gentle we need to be

70
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,400
to ensure our skin feels loved.

71
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,200
Are you feeling the love yet?

72
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,800
Hm.

73
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,760
Come on, put some on me.
Huh?

74
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,400
Show me the love.

75
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,680
Like you did for me just now, right?
Hm.

76
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:40,800
Putting cream on is showing love.
Use the middle and ring fingers because

77
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,800
they’re the gentlest for your face.

78
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,600
Let that love soak in.

79
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:54,880
How was that?
Do you feel the love?

80
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,640
Hm.

81
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,320
Sun cream can be applied repeatedly.

82
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,360
Let me show you how it’s done.

83
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,160
Hm.
Put some on the neck, too.

84
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,040
Hm.
It’ll stop the neck from sagging.

85
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:21,000
This one smells great.

86
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,080
Take a sniff.

87
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:27,440
Am I right? It’s so fragrant, isn’t it?

88
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:32,880
Hm.
Does it smell good?

89
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,800
Yes, it does.

90
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,240
You can put it on several times.

91
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,240
On the neck too, right?

92
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,120
Hm.
Ok.

93
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,920
Apply it to the neck

94
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,560
to defy the Earth’s gravity.
Hm.

95
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,440
Hm …

96
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:58,160
Make sure you’re spreading it
all over the area.

97
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,280
How’s that?

98
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,640
Hmm, that’s great.

99
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,680
Phu, is he really going to come?

100
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,200
I don’t think he does it anymore.

101
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,800
Just hang on a moment.

102
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,240
What’s up, Gie Gie?
Nan, it’s something terrible has happened.

103
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,800
What’s wrong?

104
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,000
The box for the cream from the factory
isn’t anything like what we ordered.

105
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,200
Man has gone to tell Ken
that it was your fault.

106
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,960
Haven’t we talked about
the design before printing?

107
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,920
Oh, my goodness!

108
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:14,360
Where are you?
How could you leave us at this crucial time?

109
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,480
Get back here to sort out this mess you’ve made.
Man.

110
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:22,040
I’m in Chiang Mai at the moment.
I’ll be back in Bangkok tomorrow to sort it out.

111
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:25,040
Oh dear, the later you leave it,

112
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,880
the more time we waste tidying up your mess.
It’s like this, Nan:

113
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:31,600
Come back to sort this out now
and we’ll sort out the Phupa issue later.

114
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,480
Give me Phupa’s number, please.
Huh? Hello?

115
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,360
Hello? I can’t hear – you’re breaking up.

116
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,360
Hello? Give me Phupa’s number!
Hello? Hey!

117
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,640
Huh? Hello, hello?

118
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,360
Was that work asking where you are?
Yeah.

119
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,680
It’s getting a little busy back there.

120
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,920
Phu, let’s go, he’s not coming.

121
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,320
Calm down … hang on a minute.

122
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,000
Hah, told you.

123
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,080
Oh, hello, Uncle!

124
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,040
Hello, Uncle Kham Ai.
Hello there.

125
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,160
I haven’t seen you for such a long time.

126
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,760
Yes, it’s been a long while.

127
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,360
How are you both? Fancy a ride?

128
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,200
We sure do.
Let’s go.

129
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:27,920
Let’s do this.

130
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,520
Wow, you’ve got so many beans!
Yes, there are quite a few.

131
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,080
This is excellent.

132
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,920
Let’s continue picking.

133
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,600
My goodness, you’re acting like a tourist.

134
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,960
Look at my outfit!

135
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,760
Hmm … I see.

136
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,720
Aren’t you going to help out?

137
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,560
I didn’t know I could.

138
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,760
Yes, get down here!

139
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,160
Ok, I’m here.

140
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,600
Let’s do this.
Ok

141
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,960
Take this.

142
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:43,880
Look, this is how you pick them.

143
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:48,240
Make sure to only pick the red ones
as they’re the ripest.

144
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,600
We’ll peel them later
before placing them in the sun to dry.

145
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,160
Then we’ll roast them like we always do.

146
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:56,440
We need to fill this basket with them.
Otherwise, we won’t get dinner later.

147
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,600
Fill this basket?
Hm.

148
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,360
Come on, let’s get picking.

149
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,720
Excuse me, can I take some of yours, please?
Of course.

150
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,880
Oh, ok.

151
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,360
I hope you’re not cheating.
Huh? No, of course not.

152
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,960
The red ones only!

153
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:40,440
Choose carefully. Leave the unripe ones alone.

154
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,040
Take those out those we cannot use.

155
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,640
Look! Here’s the owner.
Let’s get to know him.

156
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,560
Come on, say hello to the viewers.
Oh, hello!

157
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,760
So … what do we have here?

158
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,760
Huh?
These.

159
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:59,080
Oh, these are the coffee beans we’ve collected.
We’ve got to soak them in water

160
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:02,880
so that we can easily remove the seed
before placing them in the sun to dry.

161
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,120
Turn to the camera and give us a smile.

162
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,360
Smile!

163
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,840
Ok, ok.

164
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:14,880
Nan, pick the phone up for me, please.

165
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,520
Ok, one second.

166
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,440
Who is it?
It’s Joe!

167
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,280
I’ll put him on speakerphone for you.

168
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,520
Hi, Joe.

169
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:30,800
Phu, I think you might have to move out.

170
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,480
What? Why?

171
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:36,840
I’ve been told to get you out of your condo.

172
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:40,160
The owner wants to move in.

173
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:46,000
You haven’t given me a month’s notice.
I know. I’m sorry.

174
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,040
I’ve only just found out myself.

175
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:52,600
I’ll help you find somewhere else to live.
Hope that’s okay.

176
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,320
What are you going to do?
Where are you going to live?

177
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,400
I’m not sure yet.

178
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,080
But I know exactly what to do.

179
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,680
Why don’t you …

180
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,520
move in with me?

181
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:19,240
It’ll be like old times; we can be roommates.
It’ll be great!

182
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,040
Think about it, me, you and Oliang.
It’ll be great, don’t you think?

183
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,880
Come on … you’ll move in, right?

184
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,800
What’s it going to be?

185
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,240
What are you thinking?
Huh?

186
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,600
Will you do it?

187
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,320
is it really a good idea?

188
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,640
Of course, it is.

189
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:49,760
You’ll move in, right?

190
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,520
Phu, Phu, come quick!
Yes?

191
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,720
I’ll be back in a minute.
I’ve got something to ask you. Come here, please.

192
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:57,760
I’m here. What’s up?

193
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:02,440
The beans seem to have a weevil infestation.

194
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:07,440
What? Really?
Can I ask you to take them all out immediately?

195
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,440
I’ll check them for moisture.
No problem.

196
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,920
Look, look at this.
Where?

197
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,280
They’re everywhere.
Oh my goodness.

198
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,920
I’ll be back in a moment.
Ok.

199
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,040
Is that your stock?

200
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:26,240
Hm.
There’s loads.

201
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,560
You’re quietly amassing a fortune here.

202
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:33,400
A fortune? I can’t sell these ones.
That’s why they’re stored here.

203
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,960
They’re infested with coffee weevils now.

204
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,880
Your beans are great. W hy aren’t they selling?

205
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,080
I’m just not that good at marketing them.

206
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,240
Have you forgotten what my job is again?

207
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,040
Marketing!

208
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,280
Let me help you out.

209
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,520
But first, you’ve got to give me an answer.

210
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,000
Are you going to move in with me or not?

211
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,200
I already agreed since the first time you asked.

212
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,080
Let’s do this.

213
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,200
Do what?

214
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:30,400
Hello … we’re … here … at the coffee erm … farm.

215
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:37,160
Who’s going to want to see you stuttering?
Can you try to speak normally, please.

216
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:40,000
You know I’m no good at these things.

217
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:46,400
We can’t have this.
Phupa, you’re the latest Devonte presenter.

218
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,680
Just imagine you’re back in that studio.

219
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,840
I don’t know how to.

220
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:59,560
Ok, I’m going to come clean with you,
I haven’t forgiven you for lying to me yet.

221
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,400
I don’t mean to intrude on your life.

222
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,600
If you don’t want to do it, then don’t.
Hey! Wait a minute.

223
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,160
Ok, ok, we’ll do the shoot.

224
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,000
Just don’t give me the silent treatment.

225
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:20,120
Ok, ready?
Huh? Now?

226
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:24,840
Right, stare into my eyes.
Go!

227
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:31,320
Hello, we’re here at the Granny Namfon’s Farm,

228
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:35,840
which is located in Chiang Mai
and surrounded by stunning nature.

229
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:40,040
We utilize organic growing techniques,
meaning our beans are free from chemicals

230
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,640
so you can be sure you’re getting the best flavor.

231
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:52,200
That should do it. Hang on, please.

232
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,560
Nan Fah, send me Phupa’s number.

233
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:05,280
Is it something urgent?
Is that why they’re chasing you around?

234
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,840
Not really, I requested this as a holiday.

235
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:16,000
They want you to do a new campaign,
but I told them you didn’t want to.

236
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,520
Now they’re asking for your number.

237
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:24,120
Do they still want to work with me?
I almost destroyed the whole shoot last time.

238
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:32,040
You look great, though. Everyone says so.
Be confident in yourself.

239
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:46,360
I need you there too
if I’ve got any chance of feeling confident.

240
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:55,600
Ok, let’s go to the highlight of this farm.
Make sure it’s the best place possible.

241
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:01,440
Ok, let me take you to the roastery.
They’re roasting some beans now actually.

242
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,200
Ok,
Follow me!

243
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:11,720
Wait there and I’ll show you some magic.
This smoke will disappear in a mere 5 seconds.

244
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,760
How was that?
Do you know why the smoke must go?

245
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,840
It’s because it would otherwise
make its way back into the coffee beans,

246
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,960
resulting in them tasting burnt
and unusable.

247
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,520
They call this the Viennese roasting technique

248
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:55,840
and all you’ve seen here today
represents Granny Namfon’s Farm.

249
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,920
Boys!
Oh, Granny!

250
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,520
Here is Granny Namfon herself.

251
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:09,720
Hello.
Hello, netizens … how should I act?

252
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:13,120
Hello to all the netizens out there.
Don’t worry! That’s just fine.

253
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,240
Hello.
Ok, and cut!

254
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,080
Let’s have a little drink, shall we?

255
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:20,240
Great.
Thank you, Granny. I’m so thirsty.

256
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:25,200
You’re thirsty? You haven’t said a word!
I’m the one who should be thirsty!

257
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:34,160
What is it you’re making here?
Oh, they call it a vlog.

258
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,920
Vlog?
Vlog.

259
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,640
Vlog.
That’s right.

260
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,520
We’re promoting your farm, Granny.

261
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:45,600
It’s so good that you’ve got those skills, Nan Fah.
Not like my grandson here.

262
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:51,800
Granny … I’m better at other things.
Anyway, how’s that arm of yours? Still painful?

263
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:58,040
Ouch, ouch, it’s been better a while now.
Oh.

264
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:00,760
Leave it alone then.
Hmm.

265
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:03,640
Granny, what have you got for us to eat?

266
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:08,960
Well, we’ve got some sticky rice
and some northern sausage with chili dip.

267
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:13,120
And some pork crackling, of course.

268
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:18,560
Hello, hi there!
Hello Phupa! This is Man.

269
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,920
Oh, hi there, Man!

270
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:24,760
Has Nan Fah told you about our new campaign?

271
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:28,880
Devonte would like you
to be our presenter again.

272
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:39,720
I’m upcountry at the moment,
it’s not a good time to talk.

273
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:46,280
Don’t say no just yet,
I’ll give you some time to think.

274
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:51,320
1 … 2 … 3 Ok, you’ll do the job.
Let me know your schedule, please.

275
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,560
I’ll call you back, Man.
I’ve got to go. Goodbye.

276
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:06,480
I thought you said that if I had a golden face,

277
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,160
all my wishes would come true.

278
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,520
Isn’t my charm obvious?

279
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:18,520
Painting your whole body gold wouldn’t help.

280
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:23,520
You’ve got to have a good heart to get results.
What?!

281
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:28,000
Don’t throw insults and don’t get angry.
The magic could backfire.

282
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,880
Never mind all this.

283
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,920
Those who play silly games
will get what they deserve.

284
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:40,680
Fortunately, I’ve got a plan B.
Plan B?

285
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,120
What plan?

286
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,520
Was that Man who just called?

287
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,680
Hmm, it’s like what you said:

288
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:02,000
He wants me to present the new campaign.

289
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:09,000
Oh … great, I’ll see you looking handsome again.

290
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:13,080
Granny, are you saying I’m not handsome now?

291
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:20,680
Well, yes, but it’s a quiet, smoldering handsome
that only the coffee beans see. It’s pointless.

292
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:25,280
Isn’t it better for everyone to see your charm?

293
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:34,960
Phu, if you really don’t want to do it,
don’t worry, I can let them know.

294
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:40,480
Wouldn’t that make things worse for you?
Don’t worry about all that.

295
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:44,360
You helped us last time round,
I’m sure they’ll find someone else for the shoot.

296
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:49,880
In fact, I’ve got a list of 3–4 models already,
who can fill in for you.

297
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,720
Really?

298
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,360
Yep.

299
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:05,760
That’s fantastic. You can have me all to yourself.
Oh, that’s not good at all!

300
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,880
Just look at those old photos of me instead.

301
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:11,720
I want to see you in the new campaign!

302
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,320
Oh my goodness, it’s today!

303
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,360
What’s today?

304
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:27,600
Our time capsule. Did you forget?
I just got the notification.

305
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:31,520
How could you forget?
You were the one who said you’d remind us.

306
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:38,120
Is it really today?
Yes, it is.

307
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:42,080
Granny, what a coincidence!
It’s today!

308
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,720
It’s today, and we’re here,
nearby where we buried it!

309
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,880
Granny.
Go!

310
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:48,520
I’m requesting your permission to take this boy.

311
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:51,760
Do we really have to?
Come on, let’s go, it’s today!

312
00:25:55,640 --> 00:26:01,640
This is one of the greatest discoveries of all time!

313
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:08,520
Isn’t that a bit over the top?
What? I’m just excited. Have you found it?

314
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:12,080
Wow! It looks ancient.
It this is?

315
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,800
This is it.

316
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,680
I remember this. Do you?
Hmm.

317
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:20,960
The magic box.
Where are its contents?

318
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,320
I was so into this style back then.

319
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,320
Do you remember this?

320
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,720
You drew this heart.
15 years and it’s still there!

321
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:36,920
128...129...130

322
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:40,920
Phu, I got 130 hearts this year!

323
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:50,600
And?
Well, it means 130 people love me.

324
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,880
You’re such a hottie, eh?

325
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:58,840
And how many did you get? 1 … 2 …

326
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,480
Who gave you those two?

327
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,800
These?
Hmm.

328
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,080
Waew and Tong.

329
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:12,840
That’s not surprising given you let them
copy your homework every day.

330
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,480
No wonder they love you.

331
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:22,440
I must say that I also love you
because you let me copy it too!

332
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:25,160
Take this big one!
No, no, it’s ok.

333
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:28,080
I don’t want it.
There!

334
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,880
I don’t want a heart that
someone else gave to you.

335
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:38,640
These belong to me now. I’m giving you one.
What’s wrong with that?

336
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:47,000
I didn’t see you give me any hearts.

337
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:53,400
You’ve already got 130 lovers.

338
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:57,240
That’s not the same.

339
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,120
Nan.

340
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,200
Here you go.

341
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:25,720
Here’s my heart for you.
What do you think?

342
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:40,080
Phu!
Huh?

343
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:45,000
What have you done? It won’t wash out.
I’ll write one on your shirt now!

344
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:49,280
What’s wrong? You’ve got loads already.
It won’t wash out. That’s what’s wrong.

345
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:52,760
That’s because my heart is permanent.
My mum’s going to kill me.

346
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,480
We were so cute back then.

347
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,640
We look funny.
We’re the cool kids now, though.

348
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,960
Take these.

349
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,480
What else do we have here?

350
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:14,040
Ah, this was mine
… and yours.

351
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:25,680
Did you put this in here?
Hm.

352
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:28,120
I bought this for your birthday.

353
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:34,280
Which year was it again?
Middle school, when I started playing the guitar.

354
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,720
Ah, yes, I remember.

355
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:44,800
And this is the funniest. Save that for later.
Hmm.

356
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,440
What is that?

357
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,360
Whose photo is this?

358
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,520
That’s my mother.

359
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,160
You’ve both got the same features.

360
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,960
I’d forgotten what she looked like, to be honest.

361
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:10,960
Let me get this framed for you, ok?

362
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,240
There’s no need to do that.
Don’t worry. I want to do it.

363
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:17,760
Huh?

364
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,600
Where has it gone?

365
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:28,080
What are you looking for?
Your letter.

366
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,360
What letter?
The one you wrote.

367
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,760
I remember putting it in here. Where is it?

368
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:39,040
It’s not there. This was all there was,
a photo and guitar pick.

369
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,200
Are you sure?

370
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:45,840
Sure.

371
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,120
Really sure?

372
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,760
Yes!

373
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,280
You look suspicious?

374
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:34,200
No, I don’t.

375
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,280
Really?
Yes.

376
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,720
Nan, are you there?

377
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,440
Party!

378
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:58,400
How did you find us?
It’s not difficult, is it?

379
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:01,920
I searched ‘Granny Namfon’s Farm’
and followed the GPS directions.

380
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:05,040
There’s even a photo of Phupa out the front.

381
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:10,960
Your farm is awesome. The weather’s great!
Thank you.

382
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:18,640
I’m here now. This weather’s as good as the view!
I’m going to check in on my socials.

383
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:23,720
Let’s get a photo. This weather’s amazing.

384
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:28,240
Come here, Nan, where’s the best angle?

385
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:31,800
Here in front of this tree. Smile!

386
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:40,120
I’m going to upload that straight away.
Hm.

387
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,840
Phu, come here!
Huh?

388
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,320
What’s up?

389
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,160
Can you take a photo of us, please?

390
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,640
Sure, no problem.

391
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:03,640
Move that way a little.

392
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:08,680
Make sure you get that tree in.
Ok, on three, 1 … 2… 3.

393
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,520
1...2...3...

394
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:15,440
One more 1...2...3...

395
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:21,120
That should be enough.
Yesh, that’s enough.

396
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,000
Thank you.

397
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:27,520
Can you get a shot?

398
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,360
A shot of what?
A photo!

399
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:34,920
Put that down.

400
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,360
Use these for reference.

401
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,320
Ok? Let’s do it.

402
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:49,680
Phu, come here. We haven’t got a photo together.

403
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,080
Really?
Yes.

404
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:53,800
Right, here we go.

405
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:58,520
Ok, 1 … 2 … 3 … fusion!

406
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,680
Another, 1 … 2 … 3 …

407
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,440
You remember that one?

408
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:08,080
This angle was always great for us.
Hmm.

409
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:09,360
This one, right?
Exactly.

410
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:12,360
It’s just like the old days.
We always did enjoy the silly poses.

411
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:21,000
Hang on, just a moment, please.

412
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:24,040
Let me take a quick break.

413
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,040
Why are you so tired?

414
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:29,480
You walk back and forth like this each day.
Aren’t you tired at all?

415
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,560
I’ve got a motorcycle.

416
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:40,520
Anyway, are you coming back with me tomorrow?

417
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:43,640
Yes, I came up here to get you.

418
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:46,200
Good, but we’re leaving first thing.

419
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:50,320
I need to sort out that stuff with the factory.
I can’t believe they didn’t use the right color.

420
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,800
Don’t worry about that,

421
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,560
I already managed that situation.

422
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:56,880
I opened the email you sent to the manufacturer.

423
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,000
They clearly messed up the color.
Ok.

424
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,800
They decided to produce a new one.

425
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:04,760
Lucky, we had that order confirmation email,
otherwise we’d have been in big trouble!

426
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,520
Seriously?

427
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:10,680
That’s awesome.
You’re such an amazing friend!

428
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:14,240
If I didn’t have you, I’d have been fired by now.
My life would be a nightmare.

429
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,440
I can’t live without you.
You’re so great.

430
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:18,880
I’m so grateful to have you.

431
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,160
Let’s make sure we get back tomorrow.
The quicker we get back to work, the better.

432
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,200
Ok.
Hmm.

433
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:30,200
Is that office job really so urgent?
Oh Phu, you don’t understand our job.

434
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:33,360
It’s a constant battle against time.

435
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:36,280
If we’re even a little late,
our competitors will overtake us.

436
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:41,320
And what will happen if you’re always
rushing around? Is it a good idea?

437
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:47,240
I think you should try to slow down a bit.
You might see things from a different perspective.

438
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:53,360
You’re a coffee bean farmer,
you don’t understand people in the rat race.

439
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:58,920
If we lived this lovely little slow life of yours,
we’d be left so far behind.

440
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:05,840
I don’t mean you should give up your careers,
just that slowing down could be a good thing.

441
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,840
You should prioritize what’s most important.

442
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:10,240
At the very least, you’d feel less stressed.

443
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,720
Working hard can be a good thing,

444
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:17,800
but what’s the use of it if we end up
spending all that money on medical bills?

445
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:26,760
I agree we should go back tomorrow.
Man’s been on your case this whole time.

446
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:31,560
He thinks you’ve been hiding things from him,
and you don’t want Phupa to be our presenter.

447
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,720
Don’t worry. This has nothing to do with you.

448
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,000
Don’t listen to Party. He’s just talking hot air.

449
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:47,280
Hot air, is it? Didn’t you come up here
to bring Phupa back to present for us?

450
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:52,680
Why didn’t you tell me that?

451
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,800
Because I knew you wouldn’t like it.

452
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,320
I didn’t want to try and change your mind.

453
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:05,400
If you just told me the truth,
I might have changed my mind and helped you.

454
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,280
Phu, where are you going?

455
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:11,720
I need to deliver some coffee.

456
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,920
Ok, let me come too.

457
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:17,040
Nan! I’m coming too.

458
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:54,200
I need to use the bathroom. I’m about to burst.

459
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,200
I bet it was that sausage of yours.

460
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:03,440
Your farm’s so big,
but this truck is tiny.

461
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,880
It’s only meant for two people.

462
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:08,480
Here they are.
Oh, you’re here already?

463
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,360
How many boxes do you have?
It’s 3 boxes today.

464
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:14,560
Can I help?

465
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,280
No problem. I can manage by myself.

466
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,920
Take it easy. We’ll be done soon.

467
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,440
Be careful

468
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:27,840
Hi there.
Hi, how many boxes have you brought us?

469
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,000
I’ve got 3 boxes today.

470
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,600
3 boxes, ok, hmm …
Put them over there, please.

471
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,480
That’s it.
Ok.

472
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,600
How are things?
Not bad.

473
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:39,160
How’s that grandma of yours?
She’s ok, her injury is healing nicely.

474
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:42,600
Oh, she’s feeling better then?
She certainly is.

475
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:48,840
We’ll take 3 bottles of water as well.
Sure, just take them out of that cooler.

476
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:49,720
Thanks.

477
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,080
How much will that be?
40 baht, please.

478
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:02,800
Here you go, 40 baht.
Thank you very much.

479
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:04,880
Ok, we’d better go now.
See you next time.

480
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,520
Sure, we’ll be back again soon.
Great.

481
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:38,480
Are you done already?
Yeah, I feel much better.

482
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:41,320
Have some water.
Thanks.

483
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:45,280
Shall we get something to eat?
No, it’s ok.

484
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:48,160
Let’s eat dinner at your grandma’s place.

485
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,280
Would you like some water?

486
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:00,080
All right, let’s get going.
Hm.

487
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,080
Hmm.

488
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:36,480
Cheers!

489
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:43,320
This beer of mine is brewed with coffee beans.

490
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:48,680
I’ve downed it!
My beer is excellent.

491
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:51,040
Hey, Nan!
Huh?

492
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,000
This bit’s cooked.

493
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:59,000
Here.
Look how hungry you are.

494
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:10,360
Party works with Nan Fah, right?
You look like such good friends.

495
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:17,000
When I first started work at Devonte,
Nan was the one who trained me.

496
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:23,960
That’s how I landed the full-time gig.
Wonderful! That’s very nice of Nan Fah.

497
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:32,000
That’s why you’ve got lots of friends,
not like my grandson here.

498
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:37,080
He spends all his time in the fields,
I rarely see him go out with anybody.

499
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:40,680
Who are you talking about?
You!

500
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:46,360
I agree with you there.
Yes, that’s very true.

501
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:51,080
I’ve met Phupa a few times already
but we’ve only ever exchanged a few words.

502
00:41:57,080 --> 00:42:01,040
See what he’s like, Granny.
We’re only teasing, and he’s already in a mood.

503
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:07,560
I’m not in a mood, that beer is nearly finished,
so I’m going to get some more.

504
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:11,000
Sounds good, let me come and help.
There’s no need.

505
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,680
Stay here and take care of grandma.

506
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:27,440
Nan, I want to thank you
for being such a good friend to him.

507
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:32,000
I’m the one who should be thankful.
If I didn’t have Phu back when

508
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,960
we were studying,
I wouldn’t have graduated.

509
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:42,760
When I’m no longer here,
I want you to take good care of him.

510
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,280
Granny, why are you speaking like this?

511
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,720
I pity Phu.

512
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:54,960
He was such a shy boy;
he never expressed himself properly.

513
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:58,120
He always kept everything inside.

514
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,520
How will he survive without me here?

515
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,800
Phupa.

516
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:11,560
I was just speaking with you mom.
You must go and stay with her in Melbourne.

517
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:18,200
But mom has already got a new family,
I’ll be an outsider if I go there.

518
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:23,560
Can’t I stay here with you, Granny?

519
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:34,720
Of course, you can.

520
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:41,000
You’ll stay here with me then.
Thank you, Granny.

521
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:44,840
Don’t cry. It’s going to be ok.

522
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:53,160
You don’t need to worry, Granny.
I’ll never leave him.

523
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:57,400
It’s him who likes to run away from me,
not the other way round.

524
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:01,240
I’d like to apologize on his behalf.

525
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:04,040
I’m not angry with him.

526
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:08,280
I just wonder why he left so suddenly.

527
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:14,080
You know that he lied to me, right?
He didn’t go to Melbourne at all.

528
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:22,760
He’ll tell you once he’s ready.

529
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,360
I’m feeling sleepy all of a sudden.

530
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:28,760
I’d better go to bed.

531
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,720
Ok, good night, Granny.
Thanks.

532
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:34,800
Tell the other two I said goodnight.

533
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:40,840
Hang on.

534
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:49,680
You dropped this at the coffee shop.

535
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:58,840
Thank you.
Why haven’t you told him how you feel?

536
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:01,720
Did you read my letter?

537
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:08,640
I didn’t mean to,
but you’ve had so many chances to tell him.

538
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:11,040
Why would you keep it buried inside?

539
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:20,960
Whatever,
it’s none of my business,

540
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:25,920
but I’ve got something to tell him myself.

541
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:30,600
I don’t want to hide anything from him anymore.

542
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:38,840
Even if it doesn’t end the way I want,
I’m ready to accept that disappointment.

543
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:42,360
It’s better than not knowing.

544
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:54,600
If you’ve got nothing to say, I’ll go ahead with it.

545
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:19,840
Nan.
Huh?

546
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:22,240
I’ve got something to tell you.

547
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,760
Go for it. What’s up?

548
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:28,560
Can we chat over there?

549
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:33,760
Sure … I’ll be there in a second.

550
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:46,800
Phu, did you get that beer?
We’re running out quickly.

551
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:49,760
Phu!

552
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:07,480
Ok, what is it?

553
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:14,360
Can you come and sit here?

554
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:22,600
Why? Are you cold or something?

555
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:07,320
I like you.

556
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:12,840
I don’t know if you know already.

557
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:17,160
but I can’t keep it to myself any longer.

558
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:28,080
I know.

559
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:49,640
Party.

560
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:58,720
You’re my best friend.

561
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:08,360
I’ve never thought of you as more than that.

562
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:26,800
Why not?

563
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:31,960
Other people can start off as friends

564
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:36,400
and become partners later on.

565
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:43,960
But I can’t.

566
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:58,840
Can’t you give me one chance?

567
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:06,480
For me,

568
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:10,040
friends mean just friends.

569
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:24,160
But why can’t friends become
more than that?

570
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:28,360
I suppose so, but that’s not for me.

571
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:35,720
You’ll always be my best friend, Phu.

572
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:04,880
I feel better for telling you.

573
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:24,440
Thank you so much
for always respecting me.

574
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:28,240
I’m going to sleep now.

575
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:32,360
Party!

576
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:44,200
I’d never disrespect you.

577
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,640
You’re my best friend.

578
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:55,480
Thank you for always

579
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:01,800
being there for me when I needed you.

580
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:14,160
Can we keep this feeling forever?

581
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:19,920
Of course.

582
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:07,000
Hi Joe, can you help me find somewhere new

583
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:17,600
to live when I get back. Thank you.

584
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:39,520
Phu, come here.
Yes?

585
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:41,680
I’ll be back shortly.
I’ve got something to ask you.

586
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:42,760
Yes, what is it?

587
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:47,040
What are we going to do about the coffee weevil?

588
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:52,720
Hello Gie Gie,
can you find a cleaner for me, please?

589
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:54,840
Phu’s going to move in with me.

590
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:58,840
Make sure she’s a good worker.

591
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:00,640
Yeah.

592
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:03,680
Ok, thank you!
