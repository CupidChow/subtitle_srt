1
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,920
Hi! It’s me: Nan Fah.

2
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,360
I’ve just moved to Chiang Mai.

3
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:27,080
Hey! Look where you’re going.

4
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,520
I’m so sorry.

5
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:37,640
I’m so sorry.

6
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:01,480
My grandfather, and his father,
and his father, and his father …

7
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,560
have all been doctors. My father …

8
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,440
What are you working on?

9
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,080
My Thai literature reading.

10
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,000
Have you done your math homework yet?

11
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,960
That’s next.

12
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,120
Nan Fah,

13
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,440
bring everything inside
and help me with this.

14
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,280
Of course, mum.

15
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,520
Do you want to come play with us, Phupa?

16
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,040
Yeah …
Dad, can I go to play with them?

17
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:41,960
No problem.

18
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,680
You are so loud. Go somewhere else!

19
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:48,040
Go on!
Get out of here!

20
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:52,280
Can’t children play?

21
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,160
My children are studying. See?

22
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:58,200
They can’t concentrate
with all this noise.

23
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,760
I only asked that they go somewhere else

24
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,080
Come in. Don’t pay attention to him.

25
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,440
Dad, please bless our business and help

26
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,320
all your grandchildren become doctors.

27
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:21,040
Hey! What happened to you?

28
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:26,000
I’ve got to go to a wedding.

29
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:29,080
Do you have anything that will get rid of these black marks?

30
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,080
Emotional instability,

31
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:42,000
stress and a lack of rest

32
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,760
will lead to black marks forming.

33
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,680
Hang on. I’ll get some medicine for you.

34
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:48,880
Okay.

35
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,200
Here.

36
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,960
Boil it for half an hour and let it cool,

37
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,880
strain it through a muslin cloth,

38
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:01,920
dab a towel in the warm liquid, and hold it to your face.

39
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,200
You’ll see an improvement in 2–3 weeks.

40
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,520
That’s so complicated.

41
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,720
Don’t you have a cream that

42
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:12,120
I can put on and see results in a week?

43
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,880
There’s no such thing!

44
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,520
If you want clear facial skin, you need to get sufficient rest.

45
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,560
Also, all those sweet fizzy drinks

46
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,440
will age you terribly, so cut them out.

47
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,120
And you could end up with diabetes!

48
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,840
What are you? A doctor?

49
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,440
No …

50
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:34,560
Then don’t be giving out medical advice!

51
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,320
So what if I’m not. I’m the only one around here with any medicine.

52
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:41,120
I was just saying that although my father isn’t a doctor,

53
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,040
he is doing his best to continue our lineage of healers.

54
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,480
Keep drinking all your fizzy drinks,

55
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,480
but don’t come to me when you’re sick.

56
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,640
Nan,

57
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:58,280
look at your siblings. You have to study hard

58
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,880
and become a doctor when you grow up, okay?

59
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:05,120
Now the pressure is on me and my siblings.

60
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,960
Have you just moved to Chiang Mai?

61
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,800
Yes, I have.

62
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:20,040
If you want to hang with us, it’s not easy.

63
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:23,640
There is a test you must pass first.

64
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,280
Walk up that street to the house

65
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:31,000
with a big cactus plant,

66
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:35,240
then shout, “You bald bastard!”. Think you can do it?

67
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,160
You bald bastard!

68
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,520
That’s Phupha.

69
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,720
He lives across the street.

70
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,600
Look at him! Even his face is annoying.

71
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,440
Don’t run, you little shit!

72
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:55,600
I’m not bald, I’ve just not got that much hair.

73
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,400
He thinks he’s some kind of hero.

74
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:05,080
I bet Nan Fah will come running out crying.

75
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:10,200
On 1 … 2 … 3

76
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,600
How is that possible?

77
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,320
Let me see that!

78
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,200
Ow! Please be gentle.

79
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,200
I am gentle.

80
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,000
Hey!

81
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:47,920
Don’t play with them. They’re too rough.

82
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,400
I’ll be your friend.

83
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,160
Thanks!

84
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,680
Can we do it again?

85
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,640
Go!

86
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,480
Phu, told tight!

87
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,840
You, hold yourself together.

88
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,080
What the hell?

89
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,160
Dad …

90
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,040
Dad, please don’t leave me!

91
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,720
Dad!

92
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:03,280
No, don’t cry!

93
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:08,280
Please come to the police station to give testimony.

94
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,360
Phu, please stay here.

95
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,240
Take care of him, please.

96
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,840
I will. I will.

97
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,520
Be strong. Your dad is at peace now.

98
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,400
Nothing to see here. You can all leave now.

99
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:43,680
Phu!

100
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:48,160
Nan, my dad …

101
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,400
My dad died.

102
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:28,760
Phu,

103
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,360
this is yours until you’re feeling better.

104
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,720
What if I never feel better…

105
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:55,280
Don’t worry. I’ll always be here for you.

106
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:59,360
This thing needs two players …

107
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,440
Don’t cry anymore.

108
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,080
I’ve spoken to your mother.

109
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,920
You’ll go  live with her in Melbourne.

110
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,640
Phu,

111
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,360
is that really you or am I hallucinating?

112
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,200
Ouch, that hurts!

113
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,320
Sorry.

114
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,880
Weren’t you going to live with your mum in Melbourne?

115
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,960
I’ve asked my mum to let me stay with my grandmother at the coffee plantation.

116
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:44,560
I need to get up so frigging early to get to school in time.

117
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,040
And another thing …

118
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,880
This game console needs two players, right?

119
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,720
Yeah …

120
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,720
I miss you so much, Phu.

121
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,880
That hurts. Are we  going to school or what?

122
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:12,800
Yes, yes, let’s go.

123
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,120
Quick, tie it up.

124
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,920
Go …
Phu,

125
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,000
What are we doing here?

126
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,640
It’s almost time for class

127
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,800
What class?

128
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:56,520
What’s the first period?
Life skills, and that’s what we’re learning here!

129
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,760
Ow …
It’s cold.

130
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,040
It’s cold.

131
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:12,080
Move! Get out of the way! Move!

132
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,600
Fuck, I’ve been shot by a sniper.

133
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,560
You suck!
Alright, time to study.

134
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,200
I’m alive. You’re dead. You go on.

135
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,480
I’ll keep playing.

136
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,480
That’s enough.

137
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,360
What’s wrong with you?

138
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,040
Stop playing.

139
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,320
No, no!

140
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,480
It’s too much.

141
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,640
I’m just going to keep on playing.

142
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,960
Do you know what a highlighter is?

143
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:41,040
We use it to make key information stand out.

144
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,640
It will help you remember the important stuff.

145
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:45,960
Just go and read the things I’ve highlighted for you.
It will help you on the test.

146
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,920
If I can’t play, then neither can you.

147
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:53,360
No playing for you.
What!

148
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,560
Come and teach me instead.

149
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,760
Phu, sir,

150
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:15,000
did you know that test was on exactly the stuff you highlighted for me?

151
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:19,560
It was amazing! From now on I’m going to call you “Saint Highlighter”.

152
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:25,960
Or did you just sneak a peek at the test beforehand?

153
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:29,320
That might explain what happened.

154
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,120
Come here.
What?

155
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,120
The teacher told us what was going to be on the test,

156
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,720
but you were sleeping, you idiot!

157
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:46,680
Really?

158
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,120
Well, thank you anyway.

159
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,960
What are you doing?

160
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:56,320
Without you my life would be a mess.

161
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,920
Yeah, well I’m not going anywhere.

162
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,680
Without you I’d have nothing to worry about!

163
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,480
Anyway, stop all this rubbish. Let’s go eat.

164
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:23,360
We did it!

165
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,640
Do you think we’ll get the jobs we’ve always wanted?

166
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,680
I want to open a coffee shop.

167
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,840
The smell of coffee reminds me of my dad.

168
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,400
It makes me feel like he’s here with me.

169
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:46,600
Can I ask you something?
Why did you study advertising with me?

170
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,080
I know …

171
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,440
It’s because you love me, right?

172
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,360
Tto, have you seen Phu?
No, not at all.

173
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:23,720
Come on! We’ll miss it.
They’re almost done.

174
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:26,360
Oh, Nan, hello!
Oh, hi!

175
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,920
Are you done with the graduation rehearsal?

176
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,280
Yeah. Have you seen Phu?

177
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,160
We haven’t.

178
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,480
Okay, thanks!

179
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,160
Hello, Jo!

180
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,960
Is Phu with you?

181
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,640
I left with him this morning,

182
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:52,960
but he wasn’t at the rehearsals and he’s not home.

183
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:56,960
Phu’s one of those Indy kids. He goes places and tells no one.

184
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,720
Hold on …

185
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:15,160
I have to go see mum in Melbourne.
Take care of yourself.

186
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,520
You have reached the voicemail service.

187
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,760
Please leave your message after the beep.

188
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,880
Why didn’t you let me know?

189
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,920
I thought we’d promised not to leave each other’s side.

190
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,000
Where do I begin?

191
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:23,200
Excuse me!
Have you ever seen this man?

192
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,000
No, I haven’t.

193
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,680
Have you seen him before?

194
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:31,240
Sorry we haven’t seen him.

195
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,240
I’ve been emailing you for 10 years.

196
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:44,520
I’m not crazy; talking to you this way

197
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,000
just makes me feel a little less stressed.

198
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,760
The sleeping pills aren’t really working anymore.

199
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,080
Maybe I should take up running like you said.

200
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:05,320
I still remember you saying that
morning runs wake the body up

201
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:10,880
and leave the mind feeling refreshed.

202
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,240
Excuse me!

203
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,560
Is that all you could manage?

204
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,000
Come here. I’ll help. Stand up straight.

205
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,800
Stay still. Turn around.

206
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,840
You told me that all the contestants

207
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,840
had to run a half marathon.

208
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,480
Phu

209
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,320
That’s why I’m trying to help you train.

210
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,600
It’s only training. 2 km is enough.

211
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:05,160
No, it’s not! Look at those brand-new trainers.

212
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,600
You haven’t even run more than 5 km in them.

213
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:13,080
Think of beloved Dina!
It’d be embarrassing if you couldn’t even keep up with her.

214
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:21,480
All right! For Dina …

215
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:25,800
Ouch!

216
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:28,200
There it is!

217
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,680
Moaning and groaning as usual.

218
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,360
Oh, it hurts. Argh!

219
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,440
Quit acting!

220
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,360
Let go!

221
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,040
Hey!

222
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,280
Hey!

223
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,160
Hey! What’s wrong?

224
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,600
Are you okay? Wake up!

225
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:55,360
I really wanted to run,
but I just can’t anymore.

226
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,200
Stop talking rubbish. You won’t be able to walk any time soon.

227
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,640
Why not?
You’re here to help me walk!

228
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,920
Be careful or you won’t be ready for the show.

229
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:14,440
It’s fine. I'll piggyback on you.

230
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,480
For real?
Yes.

231
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,320
Have you gone mad?

232
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,960
Running doesn’t seem to be helping me deal with the loneliness.

233
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:32,040
Phu, aren’t you lonely over there in Melbourne?

234
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,400
Hi there!
Hi, Phu! Where are you headed?

235
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,800
To delivery coffee.

236
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,480
Don’t forget to come over for dinner.

237
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,520
Granny has prepared lots of food.

238
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,600
Could you take care of the customers please?

239
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,520
Hi there!

240
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,560
Oh! the coffee is here.

241
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,920
Here it is.

242
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:04,360
Hang on. I heard the good news.
Congratulations on your baby.

243
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,040
Thank you.

244
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,040
How is it going?

245
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,440
It’s quite exhausting at the moment.

246
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,240
I bet.
I’ll bring some fresh banana blossoms with me next time.

247
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,880
It helps with breastmilk production.

248
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,280
Thank you. That is very kind.

249
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:14,680
No problem.

250
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,800
Here’s the coffee.

251
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,280
Thank you, Phupha.
You’re welcome.

252
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,240
I’ll be off now.

253
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,960
Phu! Wait!

254
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:21,920
Yes?

255
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,800
Do you remember Goy from up north?

256
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,960
Yeah. Why?

257
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:32,720
She said that after tasting your coffee, she’s fallen in love with you.

258
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,400
That’s a bit much!
I know!

259
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,880
Did you infuse it with a love potion?

260
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:39,440
It’s just my good looks.

261
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,560
Of course!

262
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,200
Tell her I said, “Big kisses and enjoy the coffee”.

263
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,560
Wait! Say that again.

264
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:48,560
Okay.

265
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,240
Say it again.

266
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:50,880
Okay.

267
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:51,960
Goy …

268
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:56,360
Goy … Big kisses. Enjoy the coffee!

269
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,080
I’m sending this to her now.

270
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,800
Oh, my god!

271
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:05,280
What is it?

272
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:09,640
She said you need to deliver 10 kg of coffee to her place.

273
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:10,560
10 kg?

274
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,120
Yes!

275
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:11,960
To her place?

276
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,360
Yes, you. Alone.

277
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,880
By myself? Sure!

278
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:16,920
I’ll deliver it.

279
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:17,720
She’s got game!

280
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,360
I’ve got to go.
All right! Drive carefully.

281
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:39,320
Hello, Phu!
Hi, Gaew!

282
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:49,320
Phupha, come here! Look at this.

283
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,160
Coming!

284
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:55,920
Come over here.
Yes, Granny.

285
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:59,240
Look at this.
I’m talking to my grandson.

286
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,400
Who’s that?

287
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,520
You can’t see, can you?
No.

288
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,040
Here.

289
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,440
Oh, wow!

290
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:10,480
Wow, she’s stunning.

291
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,760
Is that your future granddaughter-in-law?

292
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,000
Oh, no, no, no.

293
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,720
If you don’t like her, I’ll ask her out.

294
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:23,200
Go for it.
I’m fine here with Granny.

295
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,440
I’ve got some work to do. See you soon.
Yes, go.

296
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,280
You come here.

297
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:33,320
I’m so fed up with my grandson. He’s too fussy.

298
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:36,560
I’ve introduced him to so many women, but he hasn’t fallen for any of them!

299
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:40,000
Or maybe he doesn’t like women?

300
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:43,000
I’ve also tried introducing him to men!

301
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,120
Oh … My … God!

302
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:49,440
I’ll be happy with whoever my grandson ends up with.

303
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,800
I’m not one of those conservative nutjobs.

304
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,520
Marriage equality, have you heard of it?

305
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:59,280
That’s so wonderful to hear.

306
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:04,680
I’ve no issues with it at all.
Just last night I was watching an LGBT series with my grandchild.

307
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:09,520
You must have watched it all night. Look at those bags under your eyes!

308
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,280
Maha, we’re going for a dark roast this time.

309
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,280
The beans have to be coated in their own oil.

310
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:18,000
If not, they will produce a sour taste,
which is no good for espresso shots.

311
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:18,840
No problem.

312
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:24,880
You know. He’s so thorough and careful with his choices.

313
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:29,040
He makes such great selections, but he can’t decide on a partner!

314
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,680
You want to have a great grandchild soon?

315
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:33,960
That’s not it. I just want you to be happy.

316
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:37,040
I am happy.

317
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,040
Okay.

318
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:49,800
Choose one. Make a wish.

319
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:53,320
Hello, I’m calling from Devonte.

320
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,400
That’s pronounced -tay, not -tee.

321
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,480
Yes.

322
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,440
That’s right.

323
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:04,520
I’ll get the marketing team to contact you.

324
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,760
Goodbye.

325
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:17,360
Your morning coffee with condensed milk

326
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,080
to make it sweet and intense, just how you like it.

327
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:23,440
Thanks.

328
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,240
Drink up and get to work.

329
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,320
200

330
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,040
200? For the coffee?

331
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:33,800
Yes.

332
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:34,960
Why so expensive?

333
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:37,680
Your order isn’t easy to find.

334
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:40,840
People are drinking specialty coffees these days.

335
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:44,000
And you’re still drinking kopi like an old man.

336
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,600
Shut up! Here’s 100.

337
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,000
Just 100?
Yes.

338
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:04,240
Hey! Why are people like us
cursed with a coffee addiction?

339
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,560
We work hard.

340
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:11,280
You know what they say: Hard workers never sleep.

341
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:20,360
The Tower: Change. The unexpected.

342
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,560
Workplace conflicts.

343
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:25,680
Really working hard.
Yes.

344
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:32,960
It’s Man! No way!

345
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:38,600
Don’t worry about a gift. Hello?

346
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,720
I got cut off.

347
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,640
Bad signal?

348
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:03,960
Gie Gie,

349
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,040
I’ve got a gift for you.

350
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,520
Here.

351
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,280
Turn it on.

352
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,280
Put it on …

353
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:15,920
your lips, cheeks and eyebrows.

354
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
It’s pink and pretty.
It’s my gift to you.

355
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,800
Thank you.

356
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,440
All right!

357
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,840
Listen up.

358
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,640
Ken hasn’t come back from the U.S. yet as he has an important meeting,

359
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,880
so he’s asked me to take on the project

360
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,560
since he doesn’t trust players.

361
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,720
On Ken’s behalf,

362
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:45,360
I’ll start with you, Nan Fah.
I don’t think your idea works.

363
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:50,040
It doesn’t? How so?

364
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:51,680
I don’t know.

365
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:58,360
You are acting on Ken’s behalf, right?

366
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,600
Don’t be shy.

367
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:03,360
If it were Ken
he’d tell me what’s goo and what’s not.

368
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,200
When you think of it, just send me a Line message.

369
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:13,480
Gie Gie!

370
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,200
Yes? What did I do wrong?

371
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:19,000
Nothing. I just wanted to invite you to lunch.

372
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:19,880
No.

373
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,920
When a woman says no,

374
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:28,760
she may be unsure,

375
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:34,760
it’s not necessarily bad, you know?

376
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,240
Oh …

377
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:48,360
Oh … I’ll be back in a moment.

378
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:57,080
Yes!

379
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,640
He deserves that.

380
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:05,480
Nan, I warned you. You needed to wear a lucky color.

381
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,360
See what happened just now?

382
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:12,320
Party and I have already dealt with it.

383
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,800
Let’s take a look at the cards.

384
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:23,760
Just one.

385
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,240
Okay.

386
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:27,440
Here.

387
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:30,920
The Hermit.

388
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:37,040
Loneliness. Isolation. Needing time to heal the heart.

389
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,200
Does anything there resonate with you, Nan?

390
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:01,160
Power bill: 1,700 baht.
Paid.

391
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,560
Credit card:

392
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:10,760
12,000 baht?

393
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:14,440
Paid.

394
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,040
All done.

395
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:48,960
I have been writing to you for a long time.

396
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:53,480
You’re all I’ve got.

397
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,200
The older I get, the fewer friends I have,

398
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:03,560
but I’ve decided to stop writing you

399
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,560
because I have new a friend now.

400
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,200
He’s a fat black cat,

401
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,040
probably too much for me to handle.

402
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:15,200
It isn’t because of the cat that I’m going to stop writing you.

403
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:21,640
I used to think that sharing my thoughts like this would help,

404
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:27,120
but it just reminds me that you’re not here in my life.

405
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,240
I’m not going to forget you.

406
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:35,360
You’ll always be my best friend, Phu.

407
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,160
Granny,

408
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:48,280
you know we were talking about
expanding the coffee business?

409
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,680
Well, I think we’re ready now.

410
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:54,840
I tried so hard to get you to do it, but you kept saying no.

411
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,080
Now I’m mad.

412
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:03,240
Granny …
I just wanted to be sure.

413
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:05,920
And are you absolutely sure now?

414
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:07,720
Yes.

415
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:10,400
I’m ready to go to Bangkok.

416
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:12,160
In case that …

417
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,400
What are you waiting for?

418
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,680
Let’s go.

419
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,960
Fuck …

420
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,760
Phu!

421
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,200
What the fuck, Jo?

422
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,200
Holy fuck!

423
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,680
I’ve missed you so much.

424
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:10,360
You’re still as handsome as ever,
just like me.

425
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,080
I remember when

426
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:13,640
we used to drive around like madmen

427
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,280
on those motorbikes at university.

428
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,200
Hold on, Jo!
You’ve changed so much.

429
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,040
You used to be a hardcore rocker,

430
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:27,040
now you look like one of those stars from a K-Series

431
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:33,640
It’s messed up. Having a bar alone isn’t enough.

432
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,280
I’ve got to find extra income from selling insurance.

433
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:41,160
Now I’m acting as a realtor for you!

434
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:45,840
I had to change my look
to suit the customers.

435
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:50,840
Are you sure?

436
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,080
I’m warning you.

437
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:57,440
Opening a coffee shop right now isn’t a good idea.

438
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,880
This location is great.

439
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:05,080
It’s quiet and would make a great place for customers looking to relax.

440
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,440
It’s also not too far from the main street.

441
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:12,840
The coffee was gross, though.

442
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,640
I have no idea why Nan came here often.

443
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,240
I thought you liked it too.

444
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:26,640
Yes, the feng shui of this place is good

445
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,360
but I can’t stop thinking about

446
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:34,680
how they’d managed to run it for so long.

447
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,560
This coffee tasted like crap!

448
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:43,160
I can’t work out if they’d been

449
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:47,760
using ground coffee or ground coconut.

450
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,200
What?

451
00:36:58,720 --> 00:36:59,440
What?

452
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,280
What?

453
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:01,960
What?

454
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,080
What?

455
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,040
What?

456
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,600
What do you want, fatty?

457
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,680
Not as fat as your daddy!

458
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:11,040
Hello!

459
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,840
Hi, Moo!

460
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,600
When did you get here?

461
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,760
Around the time you said the coffee tasted like crap.

462
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:23,840
What? No.

463
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:26,720
We were talking about the fizzy drinks.

464
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:31,440
The coffee your father made was great.

465
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:33,440
We loved it.

466
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,560
Kiss ass!

467
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,200
Who?

468
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:40,720
You!

469
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,880
Are you insulting me, you little pig?

470
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,240
That fat bastard.

471
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:47,080
Jo, calm down.

472
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:51,440
Calm down.

473
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:57,960
Hi! It’s me. I used to come here when I was in uni.
No, no.

474
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,440
I’m not selling it to you.

475
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,600
And you need to go to school

476
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,320
Hang on, both of you.

477
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,440
No, don’t touch me.

478
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,320
I really like this place.

479
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,440
I have come all the way from Chiang Mai.

480
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,320
Daddy, we’re late.

481
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,240
Go to school.

482
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,800
What are you so upset about?

483
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,440
The coffee was terrible.

484
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:22,120
Jo, stop it.

485
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:24,720
I want this place.

486
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:32,400
Oh, crap!

487
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:33,480
Jo!

488
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,040
Jo!

489
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:36,800
Jo!

490
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:38,400
Jo!

491
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:39,880
Hey!

492
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:49,880
Were you trying to kill me?

493
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:54,920
No killing,
but you’ve really messed up.

494
00:38:57,160 --> 00:39:00,760
There are others. Forget this place.

495
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,160
But I want this one.

496
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:08,440
Why does it have to be this one? I don’t understand.

497
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:12,840
I’ll deal with the owner.

498
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:16,560
What about the condo I asked you to help with?

499
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:21,880
Oh, not this again. There are tons of available rooms,

500
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:25,560
but you want mine. Someone has already given me a deposit for it,

501
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:29,200
now I have to return the money. It’s such a hassle.

502
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:35,120
It’s the one for me: a low-rise condo near the park, nice and peaceful.

503
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:40,120
It gets the morning light. It’s breezy. It has a large space that’s perfect for my plants.

504
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:48,520
In that case, go for it.

505
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,200
Hang on.

506
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,920
Don’t forget your promise to me.

507
00:39:56,680 --> 00:40:02,280
You must come and sing at the bar from 8 to 10  pm,.
3 days a week

508
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:08,600
and, most importantly, you have to smile at the female customers

509
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,320
This way.

510
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:00,480
Here we are.
Right.

511
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:03,280
Let’s start by moving this table.

512
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:04,560
Go ahead.

513
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:20,320
How much have I spent on these apps?

514
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:23,080
Unit 803.

515
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,200
All of these boxes, it looks like.

516
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:54,040
Woah …

517
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:56,800
Pardon me?

518
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,200
Woah …

519
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:02,920
Oh, I mean, I’m also waiting for the lift.

520
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:04,760
Please, go ahead.

521
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:07,680
Handsome and polite.

522
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:14,360
I’m single, by the way.

523
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:20,920
Excuse me, the sticker you ordered for your vehicle is ready now.

524
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:22,560
Please come and sign for it.

525
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:23,640
Okay.

526
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:26,440
Aren’t you coming?

527
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:28,440
Oh, no!

528
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:33,440
Nan!

529
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:37,160
Nan, I’m here.

530
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:40,960
I stopped by the office downstairs to get your packages.

531
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:46,760
Oliang!

532
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:55,720
Hey, Gie Gie!
I’m ready.

533
00:45:58,320 --> 00:45:59,480
Oh, no!

534
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,040
Take it off! Not this color.

535
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:06,880
Why? What’s wrong with it?

536
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:10,560
You can’t wear grey on a Tuesday.
It must be pink like mine.

537
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:12,560
It works for your career and your love life.

538
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:14,520
Go change! Quickly! We’re late.

539
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:16,960
Really?
Really.

540
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:19,440
What’s the color?
Pink.

541
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:23,160
Oliang!

542
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:31,680
Okay?
Okay.

543
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:34,320
I’ve got something to tell you.

544
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:38,880
I’m wearing pink today,
and I think I met my soulmate down by the entrance of your condo.

545
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:43,000
I wonder which floor he is on and what room number.

546
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:46,360
I really have to come here more often.

547
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:50,720
I am the most handsome one here.

548
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:52,920
Right.

549
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:01,560
Oh, I’m sorry.
That’s okay.

550
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:06,800
Wait a second. I forgot my bag.

551
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:12,520
Sorry.

552
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:15,080
Which way are you going?

553
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:16,920
Oh!

554
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:18,360
I’m sorry.

555
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:19,480
You all right?

556
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:20,880
Yes, hello!

557
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:22,800
Oh, okay.

558
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:25,080
Yes, yes, for sure.

559
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:26,840
Oliang!

560
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:29,720
Don’t go outside.

561
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:33,080
Thank you.

562
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:34,720
There’s still something on the floor.

563
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:35,960
Oh, thanks.

564
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:38,640
Be good.

565
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:44,480
I almost missed it. Thank you.

566
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:54,760
Young man…

567
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:57,080
young man, you forgot something.

568
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:57,960
Thank you.

569
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:10,360
Phu!

570
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:16,520
Nan!

571
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:45,080
I used to think that sharing my thoughts like this would help,

572
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:49,920
but it just reminds me that you’re not here in my life.

573
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:58,280
I’m not going to forget you. You’ll always be my best friend, Phu.

574
00:48:58,960 --> 00:48:59,880
Phu

575
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:20,640
Jo, I simply must have that room.

576
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:26,240
It just can’t be any other room.
