1
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:02,760
I know now,

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:07,560
you love me, don’t you?

3
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,120
I love you too.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,080
And the other side.

5
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,040
One more.

6
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,240
You promised me

7
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,480
that you’d never leave.

8
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,960
What’s wrong with you?

9
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,360
You looked like you’ve swallowed a wasp.

10
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,200
It’s nothing, I’m just thinking about work.

11
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,800
You know you can tell me anything, right?

12
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:45,120
Let me take care of Phupa, you can rest.

13
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,520
It’s fine, I can do it.

14
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,560
Hello Grandma,

15
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,880
Pardon me!?

16
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:12,480
Ok, let’s do this for my career.

17
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,520
And what about myself?

18
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:32,920
Americano…Phu, you idiot.
What are you doing here, Jo?

19
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:36,440
I’m glad you’re here, help me figure this out.

20
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,680
Phu’s left me here all alone after ringing me
out of the blue and saying he needed my help.

21
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,600
He said I should look after this place,

22
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,160
but haven’t I helped enough already?

23
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:48,960
I helped him find this place,
so what more is expected of me?

24
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,880
What am I getting out of this?

25
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:55,640
Did Phu tell you where he was going?

26
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,600
He hasn’t told me anything.
He hung up straight away.

27
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,280
How is an Americano made?

28
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,920
Thank you, Uncle Gie.
No worries.

29
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:17,360
Calm down, there’s no rush.
Ok ok.

30
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:31,320
We’re sorry, we cannot connect you at this time.

31
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:55,600
We’re sorry, we cannot connect you at this time.

32
00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:00,600
Sorry, it is not possible to reach
the number you’ve dialed at this time.

33
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,400
Grandma!

34
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,600
Grandma,

35
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:09,960
what’s wrong?

36
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,480
Grandma, what’s wrong?
Going to die!

37
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,800
Grandma, what’s wrong?

38
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:22,960
Won’t last much longer.
Grandma, where does it hurt? Let’s find a doctor!

39
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:29,560
No, I won’t go.
The star’s about to die, there’s not long left.

40
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,040
My special Kong Mee.

41
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,080
I’m fine, I just can’t turn this off.

42
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:42,480
I’m addicted.
Oh dear, it’s just a movie.

43
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:46,000
So, what’s up with your arm,
why is it in plaster?

44
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,840
Nothing really, I just took a fall
off my bike a few days ago.

45
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:57,760
The doctor did an x-ray but he said
it’s just bruised, no fractures.

46
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:02,040
How is that possible, Uncle Neung said
you had to stay in hospital, isn’t that so?

47
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:05,840
He said the doctor needed to monitor you.
How did you manage to fall over?

48
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:12,640
It's just blood pressure, an old disease.,
I didn’t need to stay in hospital.

49
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:18,680
Why’d you listen to Uncle Neung?
He’s full of hot air.

50
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:22,400
What are you doing here? Who’s in charge of the shop?

51
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,720
How did you get here?
Have you had something to eat yet?

52
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,320
Calm down, please. I’ll do my best to answer
all that in one go.

53
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:32,480
Ok, I asked my friend to watch the shop,

54
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,600
and I got on a plane to come here,
Right.

55
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,960
then Uncle Gie brought me here.
I see.

56
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:41,200
And are you hungry? I’ll make you something.
It’s fine, I’m not hungry.

57
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,720
Ok, in that case, you can go back tomorrow.

58
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:50,360
Grandma, I’ve just got here,
I thought I’d stay 4-5 days at least.

59
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,160
Can I take you to see the doctor tomorrow?

60
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,840
They’ll be able to give you a check-up.

61
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,280
The doctor?

62
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:56,960
Yes.

63
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,800
If I want to go to a doctor, I can go by myself.

64
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,080
I’m worried about you - please.

65
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:07,280
Are you sure you’re not hurt?
Can … can that be?

66
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:13,360
I’m addicted, addicted to being pampered.

67
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,560
Grandma, I’m serious.

68
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,720
Again please, come on.
Ok, ok, I get it.

69
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,080
Come on, let’s see a doctor.

70
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:08,520
Phu, where are you? Call me back.

71
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:12,880
Where did you go? What did I do wrong this time?

72
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,800
You’re going to run away, aren’t you?

73
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,120
Oh, Nan, won’t you join us for a drink?
Ken’s asking after you.

74
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,880
Phu!
Oh.

75
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,560
I forgot something inside.

76
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,680
Are you ok?

77
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,960
You’ll be ok here by yourself, right?

78
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,600
I’ll leave you to close up.

79
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,480
I’d better go.

80
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:35,400
Don’t bother ever coming back again!

81
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,280
I never want to see you ever again!

82
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:08,680
Welcome to the voicemail service.
Please leave your message after the tone.

83
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,560
What is it you’re not telling me?

84
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,880
We made a promise to one another.

85
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,200
My goodness.

86
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,080
Is this really necessary?

87
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:51,960
My grandson is so handsome, I’m proud of you.

88
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:55,480
Mr. Phu, can I have your autograph?
Why? We’ve known each other all our lives.

89
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,920
Don’t be shy, you’re a star now.

90
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,440
Sign one for me too, please.

91
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:06,720
She just fell over onto her back,
we were so shocked.

92
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:12,800
You were so shocked you couldn’t shut
that big mouth of yours.

93
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,320
She refused to stay in hospital like they asked.

94
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,520
Then, we offered to watch her once
she got home but she refused that, too.

95
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:23,440
She sent us all away.
What’s all this then?

96
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,320
There’s nothing wrong with me.
Grandma, be careful.

97
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,280
Why would I waste money staying in hospital?
Come and take a seat.

98
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:33,520
See how stubborn she is?

99
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:40,520
If you’re going to gossip, at least do it quietly.
I’m not deaf, I heard it all.

100
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,840
Grandma?
Hmm.

101
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,400
I really think you should see a doctor
so they can give you a good check-up.

102
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:51,920
Ok.

103
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,200
I will.

104
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,640
You promise?

105
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,000
I promise.

106
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,680
She’s a stubborn one, that’s for sure.

107
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:11,080
I just wanted him to be the one to tell me.
All right.

108
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,320
I always do what he tells me to.

109
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,240
I’ve made a schedule for the release of our

110
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:28,760
INTENSE SKIN BOOSTER SERUM
LAMININ COMPLEX product.

111
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,960
It’ll come out next month?
What?

112
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,480
Next month?
Yes, next month.

113
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:40,120
Seeing your responses makes me certain.
We should strike while the iron’s bent.

114
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,680
Don’t you mean while it’s hot?

115
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:55,160
I … I was just checking to see
if you were listening.

116
00:14:55,960 --> 00:15:00,760
Ok, this project will have a shooting product,
presenter, and social media campaign.

117
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:07,680
I think we should post straight away.
Devonte presents the first stem cell biotechnology in Thailand.

118
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:13,800
I have no issue with it,
but will you guys have time for this?

119
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:17,520
You know very well how much
work it takes to get to this stage,

120
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:21,040
how much product testing is required.

121
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:27,520
I don’t want to rush this
and end up with an incomplete campaign.

122
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:33,880
Ken, sir, I’ve been working with you
for 5 years now

123
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,040
and I’m confident in this product of ours.

124
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:41,200
It is time we released it.

125
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,680
You do have a good point.

126
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:53,160
Ok, this serum should be presented by
Phupa and Dina, like the last one.

127
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:56,880
That would give us continuity.

128
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,680
Nan Fah.

129
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:02,000
Have you asked Phupa is he’s free,
so we can make a start?

130
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,800
Nan.
Huh?

131
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,880
Yes … what is it?
Oh my goodness.

132
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:24,680
Ken asked about Phupa’s availability.
If we know his schedule, we can get him in.

133
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:32,040
I’m not quite sure.
Deary me!

134
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,600
Or … do you have a better suggestion?

135
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,760
Um...

136
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:43,000
In that case, please ask Phupa
about his schedule.

137
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,480
Ok, we’re done.

138
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:50,960
Goodbye.
Ken, sir, I won’t let you down.

139
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,480
Ken, sir.

140
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,280
Nan.

141
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,840
Hey, Nan!
Oh, Dina.

142
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,440
Sit down, there’s something I want to say.
What are you doing here?

143
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:31,200
I went to see Phu at his shop but it was shut.
Where’s he gone?

144
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,520
I’ve got no idea.

145
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,800
Have you had an argument?

146
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,680
What is it you are doing here?
You haven’t answered me yet.

147
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:45,080
I’m here to talk about the new campaign.

148
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:49,120
I thought I’d see Phu here.
I was going to invite him out to dinner.

149
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,800
Shall I try calling him again?

150
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,240
Hello, Phu?

151
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:08,960
Why haven’t you been answering my calls?
What are you doing at the farm?

152
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,120
When are you coming back?

153
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,480
I don’t know yet.
What!?

154
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:22,040
Ken’s been talking about a new campaign?
Oh, really?

155
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,040
Hurry back won’t you.

156
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,360
Hmm, is that all? I’ve got to go.

157
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,640
What’s up, young man?

158
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,240
Nothing.
Who were you talking to?

159
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,800
Was that Nan Fah?

160
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,120
No, it was …
I was talking to Dina.

161
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:45,800
Dina?
The one I did the campaign with.

162
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:48,120
My friend from university.
Oh, her.

163
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:51,360
She’s a stunner, I like her.
Do you like her?

164
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,720
We’re just friends, grandma.

165
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,240
Really?
Really.

166
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:05,560
Is something up with you?
You’ve looked stressed since this morning.

167
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,640
Tell me if there’s something bothering you.

168
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,640
It’s nothing.
Are you sure?

169
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,680
I’m sure.
Ok, then go.

170
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:19,680
Go where?
I’ve got something to tell you.

171
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:23,920
I’ve been wondering a lot about you.
Ok.

172
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,120
Come on.

173
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:30,000
What’s up Nan Fah?
Did Phupa tell you he didn’t want to do it?

174
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,400
Well …

175
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:39,360
I … I just don’t think he’ll want to.

176
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,320
He’s just opened his own coffee shop.

177
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,760
is that what he said?

178
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,560
Why are you speaking on his behalf?

179
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,160
Don’t you want to ask him first?

180
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:11,600
Sometimes being close to someone
ends up with us making the wrong assumptions.

181
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:17,680
Sometimes, the closer we are to them,
the less we end up talking with one another.

182
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:24,720
In fact, the closer we are,
the more we should be speaking to one another.

183
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,680
Go away and think about what I’ve said.

184
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:34,800
Nan.

185
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:36,400
Nan!

186
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,920
Are you ok?
You completely ignored me.

187
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,200
I’m sorry.

188
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,240
Did you have an argument with Phupa?

189
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,000
It’s not like that.

190
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:56,760
So how is it?

191
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,240
I found out he’d been lying to me.

192
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,760
He said he’d gone to Melbourne

193
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,520
but he hadn’t gone anywhere.

194
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,800
He’s gone to his grandma’s farm now.

195
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:19,200
I’ve tried calling him
and getting in contact

196
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,560
He’s not responding to me at all,

197
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:25,960
but he picked up a call from Dina.

198
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,880
So what? Why are you so bothered?

199
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,480
He’s obviously not bothered about you.

200
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,960
I’m saying this because I’m concerned.

201
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,560
Ever since he came back,

202
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,480
all he seems to bring is disruption.

203
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,640
Thank you for your concern,

204
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,920
but don’t place the blame on him,

205
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:03,600
it’s my fault
for getting involved in his life.

206
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:09,080
Just forget about him altogether.

207
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:14,920
I’ll help you come up with an idea
for this new campaign.

208
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,400
Huh!

209
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31,960
Where are you going now, Nan?

210
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,040
Stop!

211
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,960
I must ask are you really going to
let Phupa just leave us in the lurch?

212
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:54,920
You’re a pest!
How can you leave it like this?

213
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:01,880
I’ve got an idea to help us decide.

214
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:10,080
Let’s toss this coin and if you guess right,
you must sort out this Phupa situation.

215
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:13,320
But, if you guess wrong, you can leave here now.

216
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,640
Heads or tails?

217
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,160
Heads.

218
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,720
Tails.

219
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:32,080
Look after Oliang for me, please,
I’ll be gone 2-3 days.

220
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:39,480
Look after Oliang for me, please,
I’ll be gone 2-3 days.

221
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:44,920
What was the point if you were already leaving?

222
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:50,920
Phu.

223
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:57,160
I told you before, right?
About the first coffee plant we grew here.

224
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,320
You did.

225
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:06,200
And, did I tell you about when
your grandfather asked me to marry him?

226
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,160
Not yet.

227
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,360
Would you like to hear about it?
Yes, please.

228
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,880
We’d had this argument,

229
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:19,720
because he wanted to grow coffee here
but I didn’t agree.

230
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,120
Coffee wasn’t as popular back then, you see.

231
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,520
I thought it was a complicated crop.

232
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,360
So, I told him that if he wanted to

233
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:35,200
start growing coffee here
we’d best break up.

234
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:40,800
That’s so cold.
I know.

235
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:45,200
What did he do to change your mind?

236
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:52,920
He begged me … he said he wouldn’t let me down;

237
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:58,520
that he just wanted one chance

238
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:05,800
and that if it didn’t work out,
he’d at least feel he’d given his all.

239
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:13,640
My grandfather sounds amazing.
Indeed.

240
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,400
And he didn’t let me down.

241
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,120
I’m telling you this because
I want you to know

242
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:27,560
that whatever you want to try,

243
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:33,000
you must give it your all

244
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
so that you won’t be left wondering.

245
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:41,960
Then you’ll never have any regrets, understand?

246
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:44,680
I do.

247
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:51,640
And another thing is that
although your grandfather loved this farm

248
00:25:55,040 --> 00:26:02,560
if I’m no longer here with you,
you don’t need to take it on if you don’t want to.

249
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:11,320
And just where do you think you’re going?
That all sounds so ominous.

250
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,600
I’m not letting you go anywhere,
you’re going to stay right here with me.

251
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:21,080
Do you think I’ll last till 100?

252
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,200
Huh?

253
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:31,000
Fon, madame, I’m here.
Hi, Uncle Add.

254
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,200
Hi Phu.
How are things?

255
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:35,600
I’m going to the market, you need anything?
I’m coming too.

256
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,960
Really? Are you fit enough?
Of course!

257
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:41,960
Gently does it, I’m coming.
Careful there.

258
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,680
Going to the market with my good friend.
Yes, we are.

259
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,440
Don’t worry about me.
Ok, ok.

260
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,680
Hold your arm, right?
Yes, please, the arm just there.

261
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,360
But are your legs ok?
Grab my hips, too, please.

262
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:54,840
Steady, steady.
That’s it.

263
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,280
Why are you being like this?

264
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,560
You just love running away from problems.

265
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,800
You pay no mind to anything at all.

266
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,200
Did you ever think to apologize?

267
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,640
I thought you’d at least have a good reason.

268
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:55,240
Phupa, give him some of that laab, won’t you?

269
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,880
I bet he hasn’t had that in Bangkok.
Ok.

270
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,800
Make sure you eat your fill.

271
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,000
Take some more.

272
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:14,280
Don’t worry, we have this in Bangkok, too.

273
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:21,080
Ok, let’s get to the point.
Phupa found out I’d had a fall, so he rushed here.

274
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:26,040
That’s why he didn’t let you know,
he knew I’d be angry with him.

275
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,720
Right?

276
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:35,720
Ok, grandma.
He’s very independent, this one.

277
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:38,520
He withdraws because he’s scare of crowds.

278
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:43,520
You’re his only friend.

279
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:49,360
You’re right about him being afraid of crowds.
When we shot that campaign,

280
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:52,320
I had to build him up so much for that one photo.

281
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,840
Really?
Yes.

282
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:59,600
Thank you for being there for him.

283
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,880
Grandma, would you like anything else?
Yes?

284
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,960
Is that right?
Of course, what would you like?

285
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:10,800
You’re being so kind I’d like to change the name on my will.

286
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,600
Huh?
Shall we?

287
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:16,040
Change the name? Really?
Really? That’s so kind of you.

288
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:22,600
I don’t want too much,
just 3-4 acres will do for me, grandma.

289
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,160
Which part would you like? Come and show me.

290
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:27,560
Certainly, let’s go now.
We can sign the document later.

291
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,680
Hang on a minute. Calm down, grandma.
Why, what’s wrong?

292
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:32,360
That’s my land, how can you give it away?

293
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:37,160
You can both be in the will, can’t you?
Of course you can.

294
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,440
Calm down a moment, my little excited teenager.

295
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,640
Let’s eat something first,
then you can take your medicine.

296
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,440
Who’s serving who here?
Would you like some of this sausage?

297
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,800
You always say that.
Here you go.

298
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:50,280
Try some of this pork, too.
We can eat until the morning.

299
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:52,000
Don’t forget about my land, though.

300
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,640
Here, have some vegetables.
This is all so great.

301
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,360
You can go and take a shower.

302
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,080
Hmm.

303
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,680
Did you bring some clothes?

304
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:33,680
Take some of these then.

305
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:36,520
Don’t worry, I can wear this again.

306
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:44,600
Wear mine, you’ll get a better night’s sleep.

307
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:51,160
I don’t want to wear yours.
I’d rather sleep naked.

308
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,000
Are you still angry at me?

309
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:05,520
Why would I be angry at you?
You came here for a reason,

310
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
not like the last time you disappeared.

311
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,360
Where’s my towel?

312
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:50,600
Some friend he is, he could’ve just said his

313
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,880
grandma was sick in the first place.

314
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,200
Brrrr.

315
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,440
Argggggggh!

316
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:50,400
Nan, what’s wrong?

317
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,680
That … that gecko is massive!

318
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,800
Oh, you mean Tuk Tik?

319
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:59,400
He’s your pet?!
Well, not a pet, but he does live here.

320
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,600
Don’t make any loud noises, he hates that.

321
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,440
What should I do?

322
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:12,480
Don’t be scared, he doesn’t bite.

323
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,440
He doesn’t bite you, he might bite me!

324
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:19,120
Anyway, where is he right now?

325
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,880
On the window.

326
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,120
The window?
Yes!

327
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:28,040
Hmm … just open the door for me then.

328
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,800
I can’t move.

329
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:37,840
How can I help if you don’t let me in?

330
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,920
I’m freezing here - quick!

331
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,240
Oh!

332
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,640
Look at the size of it!

333
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,080
Oh, Tuk Tik.

334
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:57,800
He’s huge!

335
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,520
He’s much bigger than before.

336
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:03,000
What shall we do?
Grab him!

337
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,040
How will I do that?

338
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:07,920
Give me that towel.

339
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:09,880
I’ll be naked!

340
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:13,520
Ok, you carry on with your shower then.
Ok, ok.

341
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:19,920
Here.

342
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,240
Hmm.

343
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,440
Oh, Tuk Tik.

344
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,800
Don’t let him escape!

345
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:38,120
Oh, Tuk Tik, you’re so big and strong.

346
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:42,000
Looks like there are two geckos here.

347
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:48,120
Mine’s bigger!

348
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,360
Ok, all done.

349
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:05,160
I’m done showering.
How can you be done, you’re covered in soap.

350
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:06,760
I said I’m done.

351
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,800
It’s ok, I’ll stand guard here.

352
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,840
Or let me go in and shower for you.?
Don’t be silly.

353
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:13,360
There’s no need for that.

354
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,560
Ok, so have your shower.

355
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,240
Hey!
Huh?

356
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:21,720
You’ll stay there, right?
Of course.

357
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,600
Phu, are you still there?

358
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:40,160
Yes, I’m not going anywhere, don’t worry.

359
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:27,920
Hey.

360
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,800
Come and sleep up here, I’ll sleep down there.

361
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:37,840
Don’t worry, it’s your bedroom
I can sleep down here.

362
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:43,520
I’m used to sleeping on the floor,
come and sleep here or you’ll have a bad back.

363
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:44,800
No.

364
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,840
Let’s both sleep on the floor then.

365
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,480
I’ll sleep on this massive bed
instead of us getting in each other’s way.

366
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,040
Come up here then!

367
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:31,040
All that for nothing.
Hey, wait a moment.

368
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,280
Keep on your side.

369
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:39,640
I’m still angry with you
so don’t speak to me.

370
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:02,320
Nan.
Hmm.

371
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,680
If you’re still angry, why’d you come to see me?

372
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:12,640
I just want to know why you’d left me.

373
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,600
You know I came to see my grandma.

374
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:23,080
I mean before, why’d you leave me back then?

375
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:31,000
If I tell you, will you be angry?

376
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,880
Why don’t you try me out.

377
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,200
Nan.

378
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,880
I like you.

379
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,120
I like you more than a friend.

380
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:05,240
But I didn’t dare tell you.

381
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,200
I was scared you couldn’t accept it.

382
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,080
Are you angry?

383
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,680
What are you thinking?

384
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,480
Are you mad?

385
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,360
What are you talking about?

386
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:35,280
I’ve never thought of you as more than a friend.
If that’s how you really feel,

387
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,840
we can’t be friends anymore.

388
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,200
Nan!

389
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:44,280
Nan!

390
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,080
Nan!

391
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:52,680
Nan, I’m sorry.

392
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:58,400
Nan, I’m sorry.

393
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,440
Please don’t leave me, Nan.

394
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,640
Nan, I’m sorry.

395
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:12,520
Nan, I’m so sorry.

396
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:16,040
Please don’t leave me, Nan.

397
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:35,400
Please don’t go anywhere, Nan.

398
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,240
I’ll never leave you.

399
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:07,400
I’m so happy Mum is letting me study in Bangkok.

400
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:09,720
But what about your dad?

401
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:11,720
Who cares?

402
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:16,040
Mum will pay for it.
Plus, I’ve got you.

403
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:17,480
I’m not afraid of anything.
