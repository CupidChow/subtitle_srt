00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:01,140
That's the power of love!

191
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:03,060
Zang Long's resilience against attacks

192
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,980
is the strongest among Outsiders.

193
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:05,980
Strong and durable.

194
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:08,620
Ordinary attacks can't harm him at all.

195
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:10,340
Let's see if Zang Long

196
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:12,340
can stand up again.

197
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:14,420
This

198
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:16,540
is what men should watch in a match.

200
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:25,740
Zang Long is putting in all his effort

201
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:26,540
just to have a meal with Linglong.

202
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,140
He's taking hits
like a resilient thousand-year-old turtle.

203
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:32,020
Please

204
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:33,500
surrender.

205
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:44,860
Zang Long,

206
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,540
Linglong is waiting for you to have a meal!

207
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:47,660
Shut up!

208
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:49,020
He...

209
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:50,300
He's not knocked down yet.

210
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,260
But will Spiritual Master Lingyu

211
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:52,900
have the patience

212
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,860
to continue wasting time on him?

213
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,060
Don't get up!

214
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:58,660
Calm down.

215
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:00,020
(For Linglong,)

216
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,860
(I must hang in there.)

217
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:04,300
(I won't be knocked down easily.)

218
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,260
(I've already made a reservation
at the restaurant.)

219
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:08,180
(There's no way I'm falling here.)

220
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:09,180
(Linglong,)

221
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,620
(I can do it.)

222
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:11,620
Zhang Chulan,

223
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:13,260
if only you could take hits like this.

224
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:14,220
Every time I hit you,

225
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:15,460
you always whimper.

226
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:17,020
That doesn't look like a servant and a master.

227
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,700
His superpower is enduring hits.

228
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:19,700
Before Zang Long went into the arena,

229
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,740
he made a bet with Lu Linglong.

230
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,740
If he could hold on in this match,

231
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:24,900
Linglong promised to have dinner with him.

232
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:26,100
Why must he endure hits

233
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:27,940
just to have dinner?

234
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,300
That's love.

235
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:30,940
You won't understand even if I tell you.

236
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:41,620
It's the Lightning Palm!

237
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:42,700
This attack ignored defense

238
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,580
and pierced through Zang Long's body.

239
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:45,540
Zang Long

240
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:46,820
forced Zhang Lingyu

241
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,500
to use Celestial Taoist Mansion's
Lightning Technique

242
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,100
for the first time in the match!

243
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:52,820
It was black lightning.

244
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,060
Wow!

245
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,700
That's cool!

246
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:57,620
Look at the abstinent-looking Taoist Zhang,

247
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,500
he seems to have no faith in love.

248
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:01,500
He didn't want to waste time.

249
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,860
So he resorted to the Lightning Technique
to stimulate Zang Long's meridians,

250
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:06,060
causing him to suffer
from organ injuries and fall.

251
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:08,820
Zhang Lingyu defeated his opponent
with one powerful move.

252
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:10,540
The winner

253
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:11,380
is Zhang Lingyu!

254
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,100
Zhang Lingyu's attack

255
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,620
not only ends the match

256
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:15,460
but

00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:18,060

is Hu Sheng.

267
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:52,260
He was too harsh.

268
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,100
He doesn't look like he's here for the tournament.

269
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,500

It's just that the mattress is too soft.

00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:00,900
Zhang Chulan,

565
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:01,780
tell me.

566
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:02,900
Lyu Gong, you don't have to ask.

567
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:05,660
My grandpa didn't pass down Qi Apotheosis to me

568
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:06,620
or tell me anything

569
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:08,660
about Qi Apotheosis.

570
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,380
He's telling

571
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:30,460
the truth.

572
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,700
Come here.

573
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,420
Let me confirm it.

574
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:47,340
Mr. Lyu, Mr. Wang.

575
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:48,740
May I know

576
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:50,420
what you want with our employee?

577
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:54,340
In this Outsider Martial Arts Contest,

578
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:56,700
Zhang Chulan is a rising star

579
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,380
who has been the center of attention.

580
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:00,460
That's why we were eager

581
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:01,500
to invite him over for a chat.

582
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:05,180
Thank you for your hospitality.

583
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:06,180
If there's nothing else,

584
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:07,620
I'll take him away now.

585
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:07,900
Come on.

586
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,340
Wait.

587
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:13,860
Zhang Chulan,

588
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:15,460
do you know

589
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:18,620
why your grandfather suddenly disappeared
from Celestial Taoist Mansion

590
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:20,700
and changed his name to Zhang Xilin,

591
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,660
hiding for 30 years?

592
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:25,500
That's

593
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:28,180
because he disrupted the Outsiders' world

594
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:28,860
and

595
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:31,100
colluded with the Sinister Pleasure.

596
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:31,940
Mr. Lyu,

597
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:33,620
please tell me what happened back then.

598
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:37,420
I can only reveal this much.

599
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:39,100
As for the details,

600
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:41,100
it's not my place to reveal them

601
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:43,380
as it involves

602
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:45,260
the scandals of Celestial Taoist Mansion.

603
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:48,980
It's better for Chief Celestial Taoist
to tell you personally.

604
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:53,380
See the guests out.

605
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:54,420
No need.

606
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:58,980
He's stunned.

607
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:01,100
He suffered a blow.

608
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:03,060
[Si, come to the arena now, something happened.]

609
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:03,780
Baobao,

610
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:04,740
I have something to take care of.

611
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:05,740
Help me keep an eye on him.

612
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:07,580
All right.

613
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:08,740
Don't affect the tournament.

614
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:10,700
It won't be a problem.

615
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:11,980
He's more important than the tournament.

616
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:27,100
[Shen Chong]

617
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:28,660
Hu Jie,

618
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:30,460
when are you going to pay the qi you owe me?

619
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:32,380
I'm being targeted.

620
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:34,100
Besides, there are so many people here.

621
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:36,580
I can't find an opportunity to strike.

622
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:38,380
That's your problem,

623
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:39,740
not mine.

624
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:41,300
Can you give me a few more days?

625
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:42,420
Just a few more days?

626
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:48,220
Are you bargaining with me?

627
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:53,500
You have one hour,

628
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,460
and that's it.

629
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:56,900
Hurry up and find a target.

630
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:59,060
If you can't repay the qi,

631
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:02,580
I'll make your life miserable.

632
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:08,420
Next match,

633
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:10,300
Hu Sheng versus Bai Shixue.

634
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:13,060
Both players, please get ready.

635
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:17,860
[Hu Sheng VS Bai Shixue]

636
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:31,380
Let me reiterate the tournament rules.

637
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:33,180
If your opponent falls

638
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:34,500
or concedes,

639
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:35,340
it's considered a victory.

640
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:37,300
If your opponent

641
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:39,180
loses consciousness,

642
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,460
you must not continue

643
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:42,980
or harm them further.

644
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:44,100
Do you understand?

645
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,020
Hu Sheng,

646
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:53,260
you can request to delay

647
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:54,100
if you don't feel well.

648
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:54,980
No need.

649
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,180
Let's get started.

650
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:57,660
San,

651
00:26:57,660 --> 00:27:00,020
they found Hu Sheng's body at his home.

652
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:00,900
So, who is the one

653
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:01,780
competing now?

654
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:03,420
We'll find out soon.

655
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:05,220
Dad has gone to discuss countermeasures
with Chief Celestial Taoist.

656
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:07,340
He told us to keep an eye on the fake Hu Sheng.

657
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:08,540
We'll just do as he says.

658
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:10,460
Hu Sheng versus Bai Shixue.

659
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:12,020
Let the match begins.

660
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:17,260
Maintaining order among Outsiders is crucial.

661
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:19,660
We'll investigate this matter thoroughly.

662
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:22,100
You said Hu Sheng was the killer.

663
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:23,940
But isn't he currently competing?

664
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:25,540
The Outsider Martial Arts Contest

665
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:27,180
is a significant event at Mount Longhu.

666
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:28,820
This is the reason

667
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:30,700
that we haven't rushed to arrest anyone.

668
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:35,060
Thank you for being considerate, Mr. Xu.

669
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:36,700
But, Mr. Xu,

670
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:37,980
I have one more question.

671
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:40,100
Hu Jie is just a puppet.

672
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:41,980
You didn't have to come personally.

673
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:44,980
I'm a bit concerned

674
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:47,540
about leaving this matter to Xu San and Xu Si.

675
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:49,180
The one you're concerned about

676
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:50,620
is Zhang Chulan, isn't it?

677
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:52,020
Chief Celestial Taoist,

678
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:53,220
you've misunderstood.

679
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:56,540
When Zhang Chulan just arrived,

680
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:58,420
he asked me several questions.

681
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:01,540
He wanted to know about Huaiyi's secrets

682
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:03,140
and the truth

683
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:04,140
behind Jiashen Calamity.

684
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:06,380
Was it Zhang Chulan who wanted to know?

685
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:08,180
Or NDT Express?

686
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:09,500
Or

687
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:12,380
was it you, Mr. Xu?

688
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:13,900
Chief Celestial Taoist,

689
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:14,940
please rest assured.

690
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:17,620
I never used Zhang Chulan.

691
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:19,300
I only had his best interests at heart.

692
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:21,660
If you truly care for him,

693
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:23,460
I thank you on behalf of Huaiyi.

694
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:51,660
Are you trying to absorb my qi?

695
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:53,540
I advise you to surrender.

696
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:54,660
If this continues,

697
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:56,420
I will drain all your Qi.

698
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:57,900
Is my qi

699
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:01,140
delicious?

700
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:02,940
Now,

701
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:04,580
let me taste

702
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:06,860
your qi!

703
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:27,700
I can't endure this anymore!

704
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:44,820
I'm afraid Hu Jie has already made his move.

705
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:45,460
Chief Celestial Taoist,

706
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:45,980
I should go now.

707
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:47,980
This Outsider Martial Arts Contest

708
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:49,500
has many contenders stronger

709
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:50,940
than Hu Jie.

710
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:52,820
Hu Jie is Shen Chong's puppet.

711
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:54,220
He has absorbed many people's qi.

712
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:55,500
His strength

713
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,620
has already surpassed his peers.

714
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:57,940
It seems

715
00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:00,340
you don't know the younger generation well.

716
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,260
The world produces
talented individuals continuously.

717
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:04,700
What do you think

718
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:06,300
(about Zhuge Liang's descendant, Zhuge Qing?)

719
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:08,260
What about Wang Ye

720
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:09,620
(from Mount Wudang?)

721
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:11,300
They are still young.

722
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:23,380
We, so-called renowned masters,

723
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:25,300
are always high and mighty.

724
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:27,260
When have we ever cared about young people?

725
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:29,260
In this Outsider Martial Arts Contest,

726
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:30,940
they all have something to prove,

727
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:32,820
wanting to surprise us, old folks.

728
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:39,020
Here comes another one.

729
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:41,020
Today, I can finally pay up my debt.

730
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:43,820
Even a beast knows

731
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:45,340
not to prey on its kind.

732
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:46,620
But you absorbed the other's qi

733
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:47,860
right in front of so many people.

734
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:49,180
You're worse than a beast.

735
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:51,700
Wow.

736
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:54,060
Not bad.

737
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:57,100
Are you ignoring me?

738
00:30:58,380 --> 00:30:59,340
Four-Pillar Barrier.

739
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:11,060
Hey...

740
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:13,260
Darned Taoist,

741
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:14,420
your qi

742
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:17,180
is enough for me to repay my debt.

743
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:18,260
I'll take it

744
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:20,140
as an extra treat

745
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:21,340
for me to eat!

746
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:24,540
Calm down!

747
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:26,860
You're unbelievable.

748
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:28,740
Undo this barrier now.

749
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:32,060
Since you're here,

750
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:33,580
you can take care of him.

751
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:43,060
Your turn.

752
