Grandmaster.

13
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:54,460
I didn't do anything to upset you.

14
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:55,700
Very well, Zhang Chulan.

15
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:57,660
You turned the contest

16
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,500
into a ridiculous joke!

00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:02,820
At this point, it's not entirely my fault.

19
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,060
Now is definitely not the time

20

signature Gold Brilliance Spell
of Celestial Taoist Mansion.

34
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,420
The millennial secret art didn't fail you.

35
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:37,940
You were already a bunch of living failures.

36
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,420
You rely on a girl to save your necks.

40
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:45,580
If you set a limit for yourselves,

41
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:46,820
you'll amount to nothing.

00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:49,140

I don't care about the others,

45

46
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,180
I am obsessed

47
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:55,220
with destroying those you cherish.

48
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:57,180
That includes this millennial temple!

49
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:59,420
It will be reduced to nothing eventually.

50
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:01,180

67
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,860
But there is a second part.

68
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,460
"Not even the smallest gain

69
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:33,900
to bring any suffering."

70
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,580
Do you not remember that?

71
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:37,380
No sacrifice,

72

Disregarding the countless
temptations in the world

74
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,420

Your founding master, Yang Zhu's goal

76
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:46,460
was to let go of the whole world.

77
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:53,100
Such an idea was shocking to the world.

78
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,580
Now, you and your people

79

80
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,420
and not the selflessness.

81
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:58,860
You're a disgrace to your title.

82
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,540

This analogy

87
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:08,620
doesn't sound right.

88
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,940

00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,180

But you were brave.

103
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:36,940

I'm already over 100 years old,

110

but my fight is still not over.

111
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:49,540
Never mind.

112
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,580
I'll consider this some exercise.

00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:13,100
Now you're paying

119
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,180
for your tardiness in training.

120
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:17,540
Grandmaster, watch out!

121
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:18,420
His headbutt is unstoppable!

122
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:22,580
Ironhead Liao's head

123
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:23,420
was crumbled!

124
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:24,900
Is this the Grandmaster's Gold Brilliance Spell?

125
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,740
It's simply unbreakable.

126
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:27,980
If we can't break it down now,

If we must fight,

139
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:51,420
we must fight together!

140

Have these people lost their minds?

141
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,100
We are here to stir up trouble,

142
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,100
not to meet our end.

143

What about you?

148
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:16,900
Certainly.

149
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,940
Your Taoist robe is pretty neat.

150
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:25,580
Sadly,

151
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:26,620
this outfit

152
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,300
makes you look old.

153
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:38,060
You carry a nice scent.

154
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,380
I smell

155
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:43,780
Maojian tea and jasmine.

156

Sir.

157
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,380
I remember the brands
that produce the tea leaves.

158
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:50,300
I'll send you

159
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,500
a regular supply.

160
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:52,620
Put it back

161
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:53,940
where you took it.

162
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:55,180
Remember,

163
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:56,860
clean the room up.

164
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,740
I am Kun of the Sinister Pleasure!

165
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,540
You take me for room service?

166
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,300
Do you think I won't draw my sword?

167
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,380
Or are you tripping?

168
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:08,700
Shut up!

169
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,380
Clean the room, now!

170
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:11,700
Come on.

171
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:14,740
Of all the people,

172
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:15,740
you impersonated Zhang Lingyu.

173
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:17,780
Even I feel like punching you!

174
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:19,860
Sorry, gentlemen!

175
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:20,980
A girl with pink hair asked me

176
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:21,860
to dress like this.

177
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:24,380
That's all I know!

178
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:26,020
I only joined the Sinister Pleasure recently.

179
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,660
Please, spare me!

180
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,300
We can spare you,

181
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,820
but you must give us some answers.

182
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:33,500
I'll tell you all I know!

183
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:36,940
I didn't know there'd be so many people!

184
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:37,780
All I saw were

185
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:38,900
around 100 members of the Sinister Pleasure

186
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:39,980
and Four Crazies.

187
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:40,740
They are here.

188
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:42,420
The elderly are here.

189
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:43,860
I don't know

190
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,020
anything else.

191
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:45,580
San.

192
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,020
We must find Ms. Bao as soon as possible.

193
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:49,380
How long until reinforcements arrive?

194
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,260
Si informed the office.

195
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:52,060
They will be here soon.

196
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:52,620
In that case,

197
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:53,660
we'll split up and search.

198
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:54,540
We can cover more ground.

199
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:55,700
No, it's too risky.

200
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:56,700
Come with me.

201
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:57,460
It's my responsibility.

202
00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:59,660
San!

203
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,540
I am not Ms. Bao.

204
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:03,180
I can run if I'm losing the fight.

205
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,620
Watch for the tough ones.

206
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:10,660
By the way,

207
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,260
you were right about everything

208
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:13,660
except for one thing.

209
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:16,220
This isn't your responsibility.

210
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:18,020
This is our responsibility.

211
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:36,580
Xia He, stand aside.

212
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:37,740
I must aid Mr. Lu.

213
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:38,740
Forget it.

214
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,500
You will only get in his way.

215
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:05,540
You gained some weight.

216
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,340
Xia He.

217
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:11,860
Let's not talk about

218
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:12,780
the two of us.

219
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:14,500
Let go.

220
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:18,660
If you want to save Mr. Lu,

221
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:20,700
you must go through me.

222
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:23,460
Am I not big of a challenge for you?

223
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:25,300
Do not force me.

224
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:33,580
Your firm and muscular chest...

225
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:39,580
I've missed it so much.

226
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:41,460
Stop it

227
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:42,780
before you regret it.

228
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:44,260
Are you going to hit me?

229
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,340
I can't wait to!

230
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:51,220
Capricorn!

231
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:52,460
You actually hit me!

232
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,140
Give it a rest!

233
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,140
Not a chance.

234
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,660
You broke my heart!

235
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:06,620
Xia He.

236
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:08,860
Please,

237
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:10,140
just leave.

238
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:12,540
Why you...

239
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,500
You still taste the same.

240
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:21,500
You asked for this!

241
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:31,420
That day,

242
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,380
I accepted who I was.

243
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:35,340
It was the day

244
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,740
you thought you had made a mistake.

245
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,580
I really enjoyed watching

246
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:43,740
your battle with Zhang Chulan.

247
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:45,860
I thought you'd finally found closure

248
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:47,700
and accepted yourself.

249
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,980
But look at your now.

250
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:55,500
How foolish of me.

251
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:56,780
Zhang Lingyu,

252
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:58,260
what's wrong with being with me?

253
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:01,740
Why must you torment yourself so much?

254
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:03,460
Because you changed.

255
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:05,740
You became a sorcerer of the Sinister Pleasure.

256
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:06,620
You became...

257
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,260
Cheap?

258
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:12,660
Or indecent?

259
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:17,740
I expected nothing less from the righteous heir
of Celestial Taoist Mansion.

260
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:20,140
You're too virtuous

261
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:22,740
to utter such words.

262
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,340
Master?

263
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:37,780
Lingyu.

264
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:46,380
Is this the girl?

265
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:49,260
Xia He.

266
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:50,620
Evil sorcerer.

267
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:51,780
You saw it.

268
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:53,260
My master is here.

269
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:54,980
Leave Mount Longhu now

270
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,380
before I make you.

271
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:57,500
Drop the act already.

272
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,620
If you wanted to hit her,

273
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:02,140
you would have done so just now.

274
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:08,100
Xia He, what are you doing?

275
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,020
I see.

276
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,460
You're Bone Scraper.

277
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:15,620
Lass.

278
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:18,380
Do you find this old man

279
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:19,860
worthy of your time?

280
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,780
I am Xia He of the Sinister Pleasure.

281
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:31,140
Greetings, Chief Celestial Taoist.

282
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:32,340
Lingyu.

283
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:33,500
Go to the other side.

284
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,740
Clear those troublemakers.

285
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:36,500
But Mr. Lu is...

286
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,100
I'll take care of that.

287
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:41,860
I came here following Lu's qi.

288
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:43,740
Master.

289
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,500
Xia He is not a bad person.

290
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,220
Go.

291
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,860
I know what must be done.

292
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,100
Yes.

293
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:57,140
Little lass.

294
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,380
I applaud your audacity.

295
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:01,020
A sorcerer of the Sinister Pleasure

296
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,460
should run away

297
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:03,900
upon seeing me.

298
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:07,260
If you don't allow me to leave,

299
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:09,660
can I even hope to flee?

300
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,260
The legs are yours to command.

301
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:13,500
You can decide whether or not

302
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,540
you want to flee

303
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:15,860
and which path to take.

304
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,020
It's the same

305
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:19,340
for what kind of a person you want to be

306
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,860
or whether you want to be a human.

307
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:24,900
You've lived over 100 years.

308
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,380
Why are you uttering this nonsense?

309
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:29,980
Most of the time,

310
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,580
we don't get to decide

311
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,060
how the world sees us.

312
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,140
Indeed.

313
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:42,300
The path we choose is perilous.

314
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,980
It's tough to be a good guy.

315
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:46,500
If you're trying to say you didn't have a choice,

316
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,860
that's a waste of breath.

317
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,420
If you don't follow your heart,

318
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:51,220
how can you make a difference?

319
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,540
Take care,

320
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:56,460
lass.

321
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:27,380
I told you

322
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:29,700
it was a bad time to get under his skin.

323
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:30,940
My toxins

324
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:32,660
are completely useless against him.

325
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:34,860
Is this the power of the Triple Rebirth?

326
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:36,900
Here's the ideology of the Trinity Sect.

327
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:37,900
When a person is born,

328
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,700
one qi forms the limbs and the bones.

329
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:41,500
That is neutrality.

330
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,020
Neutrality is the law of nature

331
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:44,460
but isn't spared from demise.

332
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:45,580
Neutrality is humanity.

333
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:46,580
Reversal is ascendance.

334
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:47,740
Lu Jing is planning

335
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:49,180
to go against the law of heaven

336
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:51,740
to return his body
to the state of qi of his birth.

337
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:53,540
If he can reach the third state,

338
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:55,300
he won't be far from ascending.

339
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,180
In that case,

340
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:57,780
we must wait until his qi

341
00:13:57,780 --> 00:13:58,580
is depleted.

342
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:00,500
The anguish and hatred are planted

343
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,580
deep in his heart.

344
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:02,660
Not even I am capable

345
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:04,140
of transmuting his emotions

346
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,220
instantly.

347
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:07,020
So, we wait.

348
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:08,420
We are only losing some time.

349
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:10,580
But time is of the essence.

350
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:11,220
Don't forget

351
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:12,620
that we are now on Mount Longhu,

352
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:14,140
Anything could happen.

353
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:25,940
A Thunder Smoke Cannon?

354
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,260
My friends,

355
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:57,700
show yourselves.

356
00:14:58,420 --> 00:14:59,380
Gao Ning!

357
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:00,500
I could feel

358
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,300
someone prickling my meridians when I got here.

359
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:03,860
It might take some strength

360
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:05,540
to deal with Lu.

361
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,820
If you're smart and want to leave,

362
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:08,460
I won't keep you.

363
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,540
But if you stay for the fun,

364
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:11,460
you're doomed.

365
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:37,740
Let's leave!

366
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:49,940
Yuan,

367
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:50,620
you almost

368
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:52,460
got all of us killed!

369
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,380
He had every intention to take our lives.

370
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:55,420
Had we not left sooner,

371
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:56,540
none would've survived.

372
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,020
You are exaggerating.

373
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:01,980
I'm serious.

374
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:03,820
Inside my Bewitchments Array,

375
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:05,740
I can torture a person's heart

376
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:07,460
as easily as pulling a string.

377
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:09,500
But when I did the same to him,

378
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,060
I could feel myself

379
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:12,260
holding a sturdy and refined

380
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:14,620
pillar of steel!

381
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:17,860
Stop looking.

382
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:19,380
Forget the Infinite Heavenly Talisman.

383
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:20,540
Let's leave.

384
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:22,860
Go on ahead.

385
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:24,500
I've exhausted too much qi.

386
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,980
I must replenish it.

387
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:33,900
The Vermilion Book prized by all sects

388
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:35,340
is being wasted like junk.

389
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:37,180
Thankfully, you weren't
from the Vermilion Book Sect.

390
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:39,700
You are utterly wasting it.

391
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,260
You struck me
with the Five Thunder Vermilion Book?

392
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:50,260
Lu.

393
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:52,300
That was uncalled for.

394
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:18,540
I see.

395
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:19,740
You lost control

396
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:20,820
of your Liver Meridian of Foot-Jueyin

397
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:22,380
and Heart Meridian of Hand-Shaoyin.

398
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:23,780
That left your heart

399
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:26,140
undefended against the evil within you.

400
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:27,260
You are now deranged.

401
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:29,140
Lu.

402
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,420
You're giving me a tough challenge.

403
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:34,220
Thankfully, the Founding Master left me
a useful item.

404
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:38,100
Ward off evils and bind the malice.

405
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,420
Protect the soul and body.

406
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:43,540
Clarity and serenity.

407
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,420
Calmness and stillness in mind.

408
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,260
Eternity for the three souls.

409
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,580
The spirits be free, the sorrows let flow.

410
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:53,700
Lu.

411
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:55,820
If my Calming Spell can't wake you,

412
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,860
you are destined for your demise.

413
00:17:59,020 --> 00:17:59,820
Bring it on,

414
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:00,660
Lu Jing!

415
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:02,620
Kill me if you can!

416
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:04,100
(I'm right here.)

417
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:06,300
(Take my life if you can.)

418
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:08,340
(Lu Jing!)

419
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:10,940
(Kill me if you can!)

420
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:11,940
Wu Gensheng!

421
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:14,220
I must kill you!

422
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:34,860
Ms. Bao,

423
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,780
don't do anything reckless.

424
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:44,460
Zang Long!

425
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:45,380
Run!

426
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:46,140
It's all right.

427
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,100
Grandmaster will be here.

428
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:48,140
I can hang in there.

429
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:51,540
What are you? A turtle?

430
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,340
You still hung on for so long

431
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,580
after reaching your limits.

432
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:57,980
Enough talking!

433
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,540
Zang Long!

434
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,020
I'm all right.

435
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:16,660
It's all right, Linglong.

436
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,380
Source of Malice...

437
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:24,460
Shen Chong...

438
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,820
What a loyal one.

439
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:34,140
Too bad.

440
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:39,460
However, I'm really fond

441
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:41,180
of people with obsessions.

442
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,620
Obsessions bring desires.

443
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:45,060
And I

444
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:47,740
can grant any wishes.

445
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:51,300
I'll offer you an opportunity.

446
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:56,980
[Contract]

447
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:57,900
Press this button

448
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,180
and sign this contract.

449
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,060
I'll loan you some qi.

450
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:02,820
I guarantee you can blast them off to bits.

451
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:04,260
How does that sound?

452
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:05,660
Source of Malice!

453
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:06,900
What is the meaning of this?

454
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,380
Are you stealing our quarry?

455
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:13,780
I've exhausted a bit too much qi.

456
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:15,420
I need to replenish some qi.

457
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,220
What?

458
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:18,900
Are you scared now?

459
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:21,300
How about I loan you some qi?

460
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,180
We are from the Sinister Pleasure.

461
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:24,980
Every single person

462
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:26,380
does things for themselves!

463
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:28,940
That's the ideology of the Sinister Pleasure.

464
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:31,180
Step aside if you're not taking a loan.

465
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:33,420
Don't get in the way of my business.

466
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:37,980
Well?

467
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:39,900
Sign this.

468
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,180
No.

469
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:42,260
Don't do it, Zang Long.

470
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:45,380
You'd become his puppet if you signed it.

471
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:48,180
You'd suffer the same fate as Hu Jie.

472
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:51,220
Linglong.

473
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:55,340
I must get you out safely.

474
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:57,020
So...

475
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:58,740
I'm sorry.

476
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:01,260
No.

477
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,060
This time,

478
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:04,020
I must go against your will.

479
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:15,900
I'll sign it.

480
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:17,300
The mighty Source of Malice

481
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:18,140
has stooped so low.

482
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,700
Even a bunch of grunts

483
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:21,340
can order you around.

484
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:24,660
Zhang Chulan,

485
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:27,700
Champion of the Martial Art Contest,

486
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:28,900
is making a deal with me.

487
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:31,980
That won't be a problem.

488
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:37,350
[Contract]

489
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:41,300
An absolute VIP deal.

490
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,860
[Shen Chong, Zhang Chulan]

491
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:47,660
Why does my contract have so many clauses?

492
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:49,380
Because you're the champion.

493
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:50,780
The limitations and punishments

494
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:51,940
for breach of contract

495
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:54,100
are more severe than others.

496
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:56,580
That makes sense.

497
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:58,140
Come on.

498
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:00,740
Chong,

499
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:01,940
we are all businessmen.

500
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:03,780
We need contracts and businesses.

501
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:04,820
However,

502
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,780
there are two matters at hand.

503
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:07,940
Shouldn't you make them pay

504
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:09,260
for what they did to my friend?

505
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:13,300
No need to provoke me.

506
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:16,180
I've meant to finish them off.

507
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:23,340
Chong, that's a nice punch!

508
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:24,940
Well done, Chong!

509
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,300
Let's go.

510
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:31,140
Chong!

511
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:32,460
They are getting away!

512
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:37,020
No one slips through my grip!

513
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:40,500
Let's go!

514
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:54,540
Chong.

515
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,900
Those three got away.

516
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,500
We can't close the deal.

517
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:00,340
But, there is honor between us.

518
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,140
See you.

519
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:03,980
You three!

520
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:05,620
You made me famish!

521
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:12,540
I'll stall him.

522
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:13,500
Leave now.

523
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,660
I told you!

524
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:15,980
All three of you

525
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:17,580
shall be my food!

526
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:30,740
Lian...

527
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:33,500
Stop dilly-dallying.

528
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:35,220
Leave now.

529
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:36,140
Zhang Chulan!

530
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:38,220
Aren't you usually the shameless one?

531
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:41,260
Why are you trying to be the hero now?

532
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,820
I didn't ask for this.

533
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:44,940
I don't think I can defeat you.

534
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:46,020
I'm a human.

535
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:48,740
I can be shameless in my daily life.

536
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:50,060
But I can't

537
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:52,860
discard my humanity.

538
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:57,700
Humanity! Well said!

539
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:00,540
I love seeing the despair on people's faces

540
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:01,980
when humanity is lost!

541
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:03,460
Zhang Chulan!

542
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:05,460
I look forward

543
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:07,940
to seeing you fight!

544
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:20,140
Zhang Chulan!

545
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:22,180
Die now!

546
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:23,780
Your qi shall be mine!

547
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:24,300
Mine!

548
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:25,140
Mine!

549
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:26,580
Mine!

550
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:58,180
(The contest was nothing like this.)

551
00:24:58,180 --> 00:24:59,980
(I didn't even get to react.)

552
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:01,900
(I'm too weak.)

553
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,900
(Am I going to die here?)

554
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,420
Sign the contract if you want to live.

555
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:12,540
Otherwise,

556
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:14,260
my obsessions

557
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:17,740
will consume every bit of you!

558
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,540
(Is there no hope for me?)

559
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:56,780
(I'm totally no match for him.)

560
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:00,540
(Is this the end of the line?)

561
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:05,380
(Outsiders...)

562
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:07,620
(Champion...)

563
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:09,660
(Qi Apotheosis...)

564
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:11,860
(What do all of these mean?)

565
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:14,980
(Can I still go back?)

566
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:18,820
(Back to being a nobody?)

567
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:20,820
(To have no friends)

568
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:23,060
(and families,)

569
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:25,860
(and die a lonely, silent death?)

570
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:28,820
(But Grandpa,)

571
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:31,340
(Grandmaster,)

572
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:33,220
(Mr. Xu,)

573
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:35,060
(and Ms. Bao...)

574
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,580
(Can I leave them behind?)

575
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:39,140
(What if I can't?)

576
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:40,940
(Everything is over anyway.)

577
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:43,260
(What a cruel world.)

578
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:47,020
(My power means nothing in this world.)

579
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:55,740
Chulan?

580
00:26:58,260 --> 00:26:59,580
Chulan?

581
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:06,100
Chulan?

582
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:08,580
Grandpa.

583
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:10,580
There are many powers

584
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:13,820
normal people can't utilize.

585
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:17,140
Turn those powers into yours.

586
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:19,380
That is our special abilities.

587
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:21,540
When you were little,

588
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:25,740
you loved watching this qi light.

589
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:27,660
When you threw a fit,

590
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:28,940
I showed you this light.

591
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:32,580
When you saw it,

592
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:35,500
you couldn't stop chuckling.

593
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:43,300
Contain the energy in this world

594
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:45,500
inside your body.

595
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:48,100
Then, generously return it

596
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,260
to the world in your own way.

597
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:52,580
A cycle of in and out.

598
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:54,180
It goes on without pausing.

599
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:56,900
That is the true meaning of your power.

600
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:00,660
Chulan.

601
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:02,500
Do not be afraid.

602
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:03,540
Do not run away.

603
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:06,700
If we run away upon the slightest challenges

604
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:08,180
in life,

605
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:10,940
we may be alive,

606
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:12,660
but we won't be much different

607
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:13,820
from a corpse.

608
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:18,980
(A cycle of in and out.)

609
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,860
(It goes on without pausing.)

610
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:51,420
Zhang Chulan.

611
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:52,420
Just go.

612
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:57,980
Why should I?

613
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:01,140
Everyone

614
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:02,660
is risking their lives.

615
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:06,580
When I first stepped into the world of Outsiders,

616
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:09,260
I really hated it.

617
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:12,140
But deep down, I was happy.

618
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:15,900
After all, I entered a whole new world.

619
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:19,460
How can I not cherish it?

620
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:22,820
Besides,

621
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:25,620
I'm on a mission to find Ms. Bao.

622
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:28,540
I want to be with everyone.

623
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:30,620
That

624
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:33,900
is my reason to keep fighting.

625
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:37,020
You are standing up for two strangers.

626
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:38,700
That's your reason for fighting?

627
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:42,180
What a cheap excuse to fight!

628
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:45,380
These people

629
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:48,140
are my friends.

630
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:51,900
They've given me so much.

631
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:55,820
They brought colors to my dull life.

632
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:57,740
I'd love to give

633
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:00,660
the world some colors!

634
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:08,180
What a nuisance!

635
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:10,940
Zhang Chulan.

636
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:13,620
What's more will be more abundant,

637
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:15,060
and what's rare will be more scarce.

638
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:17,900
There is no such thing as fairness.

639
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:19,260
Everything

640
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:21,780
will go to the winning side.

641
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:24,940
It's time to pay your bill!

642
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:36,100
Friends?

643
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:38,140
How much qi are they worth?

644
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:41,740
What's wrong with becoming strong

645
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:43,220
like me?

646
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:44,860
You worthless fool!

647
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:47,460
You want death, so be it!

648
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:49,900
- (A cycle of in and out.)
- A cycle of in and out.

649
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:53,380
- (It goes on without pausing.)
- It goes on without pausing.

650
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:54,340
Little

651
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:56,260
White

652
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:57,580
Worm.

653
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:10,420
My qi!

654
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:12,420
My qi!

655
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:17,940
My qi!

656
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:33,580
Of all my life,

657
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:35,460
I've never heard of anyone

658
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:37,660
who only takes and never gives.

659
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:41,340
My qi

660
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,740
is mine to command.

661
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:57,060
Lian.

662
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:58,540
How did you do it?

663
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:03,140
My grandpa taught me that.

664
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:04,980
Do you believe it?

665
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:07,420
I now recognize

666
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:10,820
the champion you are.

667
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:14,860
Stay safe on your way back.

668
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:17,100
I must go and find Ms. Bao.

669
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:23,180
Remember, delete the video for me.

670
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:35,660
Old man.

671
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:36,580
Impressive.

672
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:38,300
You're only one man,

673
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:38,820
but it felt

674
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:40,580
as though I had fought a dozen.

675
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:42,420
Miss.

676
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:45,660
You're an extraordinary one yourself.

677
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:48,660
I've never seen anyone

678
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:51,060
who could start healing

679
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:52,540
during the fight

680
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:54,180
after losing so much blood.

681
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,100
Too bad.

682
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:58,740
No cosmetic in this world

683
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:00,820
can remove this scar

684
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:03,180
from my face.

685
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:06,620
The face never changed over the decades.

686
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:08,580
That left quite an impression on Zhang Huaiyi.

687
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:10,220
Young lady.

688
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:11,820
When I first met you,

689
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,660
you piqued my interest.

690
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:17,260
You reminded me of an old friend.

691
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,460
Many old men

692
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:20,260
have said the same thing to me.

693
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:21,500
Who is that friend?

694
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:24,740
Yes.

695
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:27,060
You are very much alike.

696
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:31,500
I can't bring myself to hurt you.

697
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:37,740
With NDT Express,

698
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:39,340
life is easier!

699
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:41,260
With NDT Express,

700
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:43,100
life is easier!

701
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:44,780
With NDT Express,

702
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:46,300
life is easier!

703
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:47,860
Charge!

704
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,720
Lan.

705
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:07,540
Hello? Ms. Bao?

706
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:08,300
Hello?

707
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:09,060
Hello? Ms. Bao?

708
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:09,580
Where are you?

709
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:10,780
Hello?

710
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:17,220
Ms. Bao!

711
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:21,060
See you in the hall on the other side!

712
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:46,620
I...

713
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:49,420
I...

714
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:49,900
I...

715
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:51,660
I killed

716
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:53,220
the Chief Celestial Taoist!

717
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:57,220
Get over yourself.

718
00:34:59,020 --> 00:34:59,860
Lu Jing.

719
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:01,420
Killed me, you said?

720
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:03,380
A deranged man like yourself

721
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:05,140
could never do it.

722
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:08,580
You could've told me you were alive!

723
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:09,940
You scared the wits out of me!

724
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:11,580
You certainly scared me.

725
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:13,740
You're over 100 years old.

726
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:14,740
Yet, you still sob.

727
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:18,420
You didn't pull any punches.

728
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:20,180
I was calling for you

729
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:22,020
while maintaining Gold Aura Armor.

730
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:23,660
That took a lot of effort.

731
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:25,820
So, I sealed off my Gold Aura

732
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:27,060
to protect my vital organs.

733
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:28,540
You were deranged anyway.

734
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:29,900
It was easy to see through your moves.

735
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:31,100
However,

736
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:33,100
you did break a few of my bones.

737
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:35,700
You can bluff about that for some time.

738
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:57,220
[The Sinister Pleasure
wreaked havoc on Mount Longhu,]

739
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:59,920
[causing a great amount
of casualties and property damage.]

740
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,500
[NDT has issued arrest warrants
on all involved assailants.]

741
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:02,820
Something is off.

742
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:03,900
What's wrong?

743
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:05,580
I scanned the Sinister Pleasure,

744
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,660
but I didn't get any positive ID.

745
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:08,060
Half of the people we arrested

746
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:09,380
never had any records

747
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:10,380
in our company.

748
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:11,980
Impossible.

749
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:13,740
(All Outsiders, including the Sinister Pleasure)

750
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:14,580
(are registered.)

751
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:15,580
(No one could've slipped through.)

752
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:17,420
I'll ask my grandpa to save you.

753
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:20,540
Grandpa!

754
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:21,860
Take a look at his wounds!

755
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:22,700
Patience.

756
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:23,500
Let me have a look.

757
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:26,140
Well?

758
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:35,220
He is not in a critical condition.

759
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:38,540
But he's lost his arm for good.

760
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:41,420
Not even I can heal that.

761
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:45,220
It was already a miracle to survive

762
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,500
the Sinister Pleasure's attack.

763
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:49,820
Linglong.

764
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:51,740
You've grown stronger.

765
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:53,060
It wasn't me.

766
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:54,380
It was...

767
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:56,340
It was him.

768
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:58,860
Zhang Chulan saved us all.

769
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:03,540
Ms. Bao, are you hurt?

770
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:05,340
What happened to you?

771
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:06,380
It's nothing.

772
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:08,100
I got into some minor trouble just now.

773
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,020
I settled it.

774
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:10,020
Zhang Chulan!

775
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:14,260
Well done.

776
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:16,260
Impressive.

777
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:17,900
You have my gratitude.

778
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:20,900
I promised to do something for you.

779
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:21,540
However,

780
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:22,380
you saved my family

781
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:24,380
even before I could fulfill my promise.

782
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:25,100
Mr. Lu.

783
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:26,700
I was doing my job.

784
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:27,220
No.

785
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,500
I don't owe any favors.

786
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:31,700
You saved Linglong.

787
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:33,660
Let me

788
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:34,660
heal your wounds.

789
00:37:59,020 --> 00:37:59,940
See?

790
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:05,180
That's all?

791
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:06,180
Yeah.

792
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:07,340
Don't thank me.

793
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:08,580
We're even now.

794
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:10,140
Mr. Lu!

795
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:12,380
I was hoping to use the wound to get some credit!

796
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:14,180
At least save some for me!

797
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:16,620
As the heir of the Tianshidu,

798
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:18,540
you dare ask for rewards after the beating?

799
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:20,140
What a mess.

800
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:21,380
Clean yourself up.

801
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:23,980
Zhang Chulan.

802
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:27,140
