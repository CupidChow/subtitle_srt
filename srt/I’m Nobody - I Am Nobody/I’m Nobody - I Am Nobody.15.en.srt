I had no choice.

00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,020
My opponent was too strong to tackle.

19
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:03,620
You should work on your bravery.

20

Why should I?

21
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:06,940
I have tons of them.

No!

Bye-bye.

33
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,980
Oh, right, Taoist Wang.

34
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:09,660
Actually, you gave Zhang Chulan

the chance.

36
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:13,060
But he made a different choice.

37
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,380
I bring you a choice.

38
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:17,780
I can't decide for you.

39
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,540
Speaking of which, it's your own choice

40
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:21,340
to present yourself in Mount Longhu, right?

41
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:25,060

You used Enhance Hearing against us.

43

[Outsider Martial Arts Contest Top Eight]

192
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:27,950
[Feng Baobao advanced to the Top Four,
Feng Shayan is eliminated]

193
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,900
I don't think this is good, though.

194
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:34,140
This is going to be my first real fight here.

195
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:35,540
But now I've advanced
to the final effortlessly.

196
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:36,980
Happy?

197
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,180
Next round,

198
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:41,460
Round of 16.

199
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:42,500
Feng Xingtong

200
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,820
versus Wang Bing.

201
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:46,100
[Feng Xingtong, Wang Bing]

202
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:54,740
Oh?

203
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:56,780
You possess a qi spirit too?

204
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:58,380
Very well.

205
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,140
It's time for me to show mine off.

206
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,580
This is ridiculous.

207
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:13,460
This is a humiliation for Master Kunsheng.

208
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:14,020
Exactly.

209
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,100
He summons Master Kunsheng as if it's a pet.

210
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:20,380
Chairman Feng.

211
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,140
You're here too, Old Master Wang.

212
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:25,300
My grandson Wang Bing

213
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,740
is against Xingtong in this round.

214
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,380
Of course, I must be here.

215
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:29,860
Come on, Master Liu.

216
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,660
Please lend me your power.

217
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:41,900
Hey, come down.

218
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:46,300
Animal.

219
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:47,420
Come to my summon now.

220
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,180
Dispatch of Detained Spirits?

221
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:55,980
Old Master Wang.

222
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:56,420
You...

223
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:57,420
Watch the match.

224
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,060
You know that too?

225
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,500
You're not invoking the qi spirit.

226
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,300
You're eating

227
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,180
the qi spirit instead.

228
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,220
Once I eat that animal,

229
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:26,380
I'll become invincible.

230
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:30,660
Oh, no!

231
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:31,780
Master Liu is in danger.

232
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:33,100
Let's fight them!

233
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:38,540
Gentlemen.

234
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:40,260
Do you not know the rules?

235
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,420
You're not allowed

236
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:43,380
to intervene.

237
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,300
I, Deng Youcai...

238
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,460
Youcai! Don't do it.

239
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,460
Don't invoke any qi spirits

240
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:51,420
in front of them.

241
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:52,940
Master Liu has never suffered
such a humiliation

242
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:54,220
when it was with us.

243
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:58,380
The one who stole Master Liu from you
is Feng Xingtong.

244
00:10:58,380 --> 00:10:59,140
Put your blame

245
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,820
on this brat.

246
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:04,540
(Darn it!)

247
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:05,580
(I guess I'm left with no choice.)

248

(Grandpa Zizhong,)

249
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:10,180
(I'm counting on you now.)

250
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,780
If I'm not mistaken,

251
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:17,860
this qi spirit

252
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:19,740
is the medical savant,

253
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:22,940
Mr. Wang Zizhong, am I right?

254
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:28,180
(Grandpa Zizhong.)

255
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:29,860
(Please transform into a needle.)

256
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:30,860
(In the manner of supplementary,)

257
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:32,740
(pierce into my major meridians)

258
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:36,300
(to circulate the qi throughout my body.)

259
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,020
(Even though)

260
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:39,060
(it's going to have a severe impact on my body,)

261
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,660
(that's the best option for now.)

262
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:41,660
(I can never allow Master Liu)

263
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,380
(to be taken by this twerp.)

264
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,100
Brat!

265
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:51,220
You determine to screw things up for me, huh?

266
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:53,100
Master Liu,

267
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,140
come

268
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:55,780
here!

269
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,060
Detained Spirit.

270
00:11:58,660 --> 00:11:59,660
Set free.

271
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:04,220
Thanks, Xingtong.

272
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:07,940
Take Master Liu and leave.

273
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:09,100
Leave Zhangxi.

274
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,220
Now!

275
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:15,980
Wang.

276
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:18,900
I admit...

277
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,260
I won't allow it.

278
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:25,340
Let go of me.

279
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:26,500
Bloody hell.

280
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,180
You made me miss such a wonderful tonic.

281
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:30,500
Compensate for my loss!

282
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:31,900
Oh, I almost forgot it.

283
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,980
The thing you invoked just now
was intriguing.

284
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,180
Show yourself.

285
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:44,260
Sheesh, an old man?

286
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,420
Fine.

287
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:46,900
Let me taste it.

288
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,420
I shall see what I can get

289
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:50,660
after eating this old man.

290
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:59,100
Let go of Grandpa Zizhong.

291
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,060
Let go of him!

292
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:03,540
Come back!

293
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:07,380
(Darn it!)

294
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:14,820
(I've reached my limit.)

295
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:18,660
(Grandpa Zizhong.)

296
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,980
Dear Xing, you're going

297
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:24,420
to inherit my healing skills.

298
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:25,620
[Feng Xingtong, six years old]
Aright?

299
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,340
[Feng Xingtong, six years old]

300
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,420
OK!

301
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:29,200
[Feng Xingtong, six years old]

302
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:39,340
Feng.

303
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:41,060
I asked for you

304
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:42,980
because I want to know more

305
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,220
about Dispatch of Detained Spirits.

306
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:48,180
[Wang Zizhong]
Is it that amazing, like you said?

307
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:51,060
Well, I was drunk last time,

308
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:51,980
and I was just bragging.

309
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:53,500
Cut that out.

310
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,940
We're friends, aren't we?

311
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,500
I know the weight

312
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,260
your word

313
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:00,900
can carry.

314
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,300
Feng.

315
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,140
Let me be frank with you.

316
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,020
I'm nearing my end.

317
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:16,260
At one's death, their primordial spirit disperses,

318
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:17,540
qi turns into thin air,

319
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:18,900
while the body turns into earth.

320
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:20,980
Can Dispatch of Detained Spirits

321
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:23,660
keep the primordial spirit intact

322
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:25,260
and nourish the wielder

323
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:27,820
in the form of a qi spirit?

324
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:29,660
Besides, the wielder can inherit

325
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,940
the primordial spirit's ability.
Is that true?

326
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:33,340
Yes.

327
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:34,860
I'm sorry to tell you that it's true.

328
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,540
Xing.

329
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:38,580
Come here.

330
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:39,900
Are you calling me, Grandpa?

331
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:43,340
Tell me.

332
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,380
Have your father taught you that?

333
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:45,980
Yes.

334
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,620
You'll inherit my healing skills

335
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:50,860
after my passing,

336
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:51,700
all right?

337
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:52,420
Sure.

338
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:53,900
How dare you!

339
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:54,940
Don't yell at him.

340
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:57,420
You've scared him.

341
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:58,260
Sit here.

342
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,020
My boy

343
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:00,260
is too insensible.

344
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:01,940
But what you said just now

345
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:02,780
is kind of reckless.

346
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:03,660
Reckless?

347
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:05,740
Will the spirits you detained

348
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:07,300
suffer?

349
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,740
No, they won't.

350
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:10,100
Unless we mean to harm them.

351
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,420
That's perfect, then.

352
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:14,380
But I revere you as a senior.

353
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,260
The Feng family

354
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:16,740
mustn't summon you

355
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:17,300
like a tool...

356
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:18,540
It's okay.

357
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:20,100
Bodies have their limit,

358
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,420
and primordial spirits could be retained.

359
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:24,020
I've already donated

360
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:26,100
my body.

361
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,780
After my death,

362
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:30,860
they can use it for research purposes.

363
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:34,660
To be helpful to the younger generation,

364
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:38,780
it's something wonderful

365
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:41,860
for a physician like me.

366
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:44,100
Feng.

367
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,020
I adore this boy.

368
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,580
And I trust you, too.

369
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:51,780
I'm counting on you.

370
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:53,540
Sir.

371
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:54,820
Is it because

372
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:58,580
you can't forget about your wife?

373
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:00,460
You want to stay in this world for a while more,

374
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,700
even with your primordial spirit.

375
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:04,780
Feng.

376
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:07,420
Please.

377
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:14,700
Xingtong.

378
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:21,740
Kneel.

379
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:27,740
Grandpa Zizhong.

380
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:30,140
Get up.

381
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:51,140
Grandpa Zizhong.

382
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:52,700
(Well,)

383
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:53,900
(I really like this boy.)

384
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:56,100
(After my death,)

385
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:58,260
(please make my primordial spirit)

386
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,860
(useful.)

387
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:08,340
Dispatch of Detained Spirits.

388
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:11,300
Crush it into thin air.

389
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:16,220
Scatter.

390
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:24,740
(Grandpa Zizhong.)

391
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:26,500
(I'm so sorry.)

392
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:40,220
Young Master Feng.

393
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:42,820
How petty of you.

394
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,820
You'd rather shatter this old thing

395
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:46,660
than give him to me.

396
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:58,580
Chairman Feng.

397
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:00,100
It's only a match between two young men.

398
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:02,340
Let's not intervene, all right?

399
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:03,620
This is not a match.

400
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:05,140
Wang Bing is going to kill Xingtong!

401
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,100
Chairman Feng.

402
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,660
Just now, you asked me

403
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:09,940
why our family managed to master
the Dispatch of Detained Spirits, no?

404
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:17,300
The one who imparted us with the skill

405
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:19,580
is your own

406
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:21,780
grandfather,

407
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:23,220
Feng Tianyang.

408
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:36,100
What are you doing?

409
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,180
How dare you...

410
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:38,900
The contestant already fell.

411
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,820
This contest has ended.

412
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,580
If you can't get enough of the fight,

413
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:49,060
you might as well fight with me.

414
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:52,660
Get that arrogance off your face.

415
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:55,940
Even your chief

416
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:57,460
has to respect my great-grandpa.

417
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:03,500
Feng Xingtong versus Wang Bing.

418
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,740
The winner is

419
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:08,860
Wang Bing.

420
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:11,400
[Outsider Martial Arts Contest Top Eight]

421
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:15,650
[Wang Bing advanced to the Top Four;
Feng Xingtong is eliminated]

422
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,340
Where are you going?

423
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:52,260
That old geezer

424
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:54,020
can't even manage his grandson well.

425
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:55,300
I'll do it for him.

426
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,180
Stand right there.

427
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:02,580
Chairman Feng.

428
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:05,780
My grandson has crossed the line.

429
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:08,020
I told him to hold back.

430
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:09,140
I didn't expect

431
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:11,620
Young Master Feng would hurt so badly.

432
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:18,780
Shayan.

433
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:20,140
You may leave.

434
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:23,860
Leave the room.

435
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,780
She can stay.

436
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:30,220
Old Master Wang.

437
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:32,020
You should tell me

438
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:33,740
how your family

439
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:35,860
mastered the Dispatch of Detained Spirits.

440
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:40,860
Like I said,

441
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:43,780
it was your grandfather who taught us.

442
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,540
I know you don't believe this.

443
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:50,100
But think about it carefully.

444
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:53,260
As the descendants
of the Eight Supremes creators,

445
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:55,060
Zhang Huaiyi

446
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:56,620
and Zhang Chulan

447
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:58,220
have been in hiding

448
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:01,060
for their whole life.

449
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:02,500
But the Feng family

450
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:05,500
have been living such a glorious life.

451
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,380
Because my father

452
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:09,620
protected your family then.

453
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:26,500
Back then, after your grandfather,
Feng Tianyang,

454
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,580
was separated from other traitors,

455
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:30,580
he fell into the hand of the Wang family.

456
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,020
Old Master Wang.

457
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:34,940
[One of the Eight Supremes creators]
I beg of you!

458
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:36,700
I can do anything for you

459
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:38,060
[Feng Tianyang, Dispatch of Detained Spirits]
as long as you spare me.

460
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:40,300
Old Master Wang, please!

461
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,620
[Head of the Wang family]
I beg of you!

462
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:44,140
[Wang Ai, 14 years old]
I didn't expect

463
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:47,540
Feng Tianyang to be so spineless.

464
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:49,220
He kept begging my father

465
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,740
to spare his life,

466
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:52,220
and he promised to do anything for us.

467
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:53,780
If you hand over the skills
of Dispatch of Detained Spirits

468
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,100
to the Wang family,

469
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:57,220
I'll let you live.

470
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:59,300
Not only that,
I'll keep your whole family safe

471
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:00,700
with the influence of the Wang family.

472
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,540
Feng Tianyang didn't hesitate.

473
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:05,580
Aside from handing over the skills,

474
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:07,300
he swore to Heaven

475
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:08,700
that he wouldn't impart the complete skills

476
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:11,820
to the descendant if he had any.

477
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:31,540
To repay our kindness,

478
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:32,820
he even gave away

479
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:36,060
the names of the Eight Supremes he knew.

480
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:37,300
Sadly,

481
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:41,100
he didn't know

482
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:44,220
about the other Eight Supremes thoroughly.

483
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:45,580
Eventually, the other leaders

484
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:47,820
agreed to spare Feng Tianyang.

485
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:50,060
They probably knew

486
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:51,740
about the deal between my father
and Feng Tianyang.

487
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:52,620
Therefore,

488
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:55,780
they didn't ask for skills from him.

489
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:57,580
Because everyone

490
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:00,300
knows clearly

491
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:01,620
that whoever captures the creator

492
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:02,820
will obtain the Eight Supremes.

493
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:05,540
Why

494
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:07,940
didn't the elders mention this before?

495
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,300
Sit.

496
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:14,580
This was highly confidential

497
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:17,620
in the Outsiders' world back then.

498
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:19,220
Naturally,

499
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:21,700
you wouldn't know about it.

500
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,140
You know it now, huh?

501
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:24,940
The glories you enjoy now

502
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:26,860
are all thanks to each and every kowtow

503
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:29,980
Feng Tianyang made

504
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:31,860
and his betrayal

505
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:32,620
against his accomplices.

506
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:34,100
The Wang family

507
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:35,060
protected you.

508
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:42,260
How do you feel now?

509
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:45,300
Chairman Feng.

510
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:46,540
Your grandfather

511
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:48,500
never told you

512
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:51,260
about his glorious stories, didn't he?

513
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:09,780
Dad!

514
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:12,060
You enlightened me.

515
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:14,460
I've been accepting the kindness
of the Wang family

516
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:15,340
and yet I didn't know about this.

517
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:16,620
My hubris blinded me,

518
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:18,700
and I even thought
I could deal with you as an equal.

519
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:19,540
Feng Zhenghao.

520
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:21,500
Don't give me that.

521
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:22,620
To be frank,

522
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:23,940
I truly

523
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:26,380
despise you.

524
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:27,700
Old Master Wang,

525
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,260
it's understandable that you loathe me.

526
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,540
Looking back

527
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:32,300
on my shameful act before you,

528
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:35,100
I'm so ashamed
that I'd find a hole to crawl into.

529
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:48,540
What are you doing?

530
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:50,340
I kowtow

531
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:52,220
not because of you.

532
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:53,460
I kowtow

533
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:54,460
to appreciate your father's kindness

534
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:55,980
in sparing the Feng family.

535
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,100
From now on,

536
00:24:58,180 --> 00:24:59,100
I, Feng Zhenghao,

537
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,300
am at your beck and call.

538
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,420
The All-Encompassing Guild

539
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:04,980
is at your service.

540
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:06,660
Oh, what are you doing?

541
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:07,060
Come on.

542
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:08,420
Get up.

543
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:13,540
You don't have to do this, Chairmen Feng.

544
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:16,460
I was just reminiscing
about the old past with you.

545
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:17,780
Chairman Feng.

546
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:18,900
No need to overthink.

547
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:20,620
No.

548
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:22,740
You're right to have enlightened me.

549
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:24,460
Today,

550
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:26,340
I came here to clear up your confusion.

551
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:29,460
Chairman Feng, you're a sensible man.

552
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:31,780
I'm glad about this.

553
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:32,740
Well, it's getting late.

554
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,500
Bing has a match tomorrow morning.

555
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,580
I shall

556
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:36,460
leave now.

557
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:36,820
Sure.

558
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:38,020
Let me see you out.

559
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:45,460
Our families have such a long history before.

560
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:46,740
We should get closer to each other.

561
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:47,580
Exactly.

562
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:49,060
Well, you may stop here.

563
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:49,740
Old Master Wang.

564
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:50,460
Take care.

565
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,060
Shayan.

566
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:10,860
You can't accept
what has happened just now,

567
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,940
right?

568
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:14,940
I knelt not because I was afraid of them.
