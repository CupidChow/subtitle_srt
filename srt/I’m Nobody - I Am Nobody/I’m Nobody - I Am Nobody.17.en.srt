You don't want it?

26
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:35,140
Mr. Lu,

27
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:36,100
despite having never seen it before,

28
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:37,860
I have gotten into a lot of trouble

29
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,940
because of the Qi Apotheosis.

30
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:42,380
The Infinite Heavenly Talisman
is the same as Qi Apotheosis.

31
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:44,420
They may be treasures to others,

32
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:46,140
but to me,

33
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,340
they will only cause me a lot of trouble.

34
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:50,340
Moreover,

35
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:51,660
being able to return to Mount Longhu

36
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:53,300
is already the greatest award for me.

What's going on?

39
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:02,020
I brought the Infinite Heavenly Talisman here.

40
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:03,140
Should I bring it home now?

41
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:04,140
Lu.

42
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:05,740
Since you've already brought it here,

43
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:07,300
there's no need to bring it home again.

44
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,260
If the champion doesn't want it,

45
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:10,540
give it to the first runner-up.

46
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:13,620
I suppose

47
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:14,660
there's no objection, right?

48
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,260
Chief Celestial Taoist, you're really cunning.

49
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:22,580
I'll end up giving it either to your disciple

50
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:23,820
or to the disciple of your junior.

51
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:24,700

the Infinite Heavenly Talisman,

Mr. Lu wishes to pass
the Infinite Heavenly Talisman to you.

56
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,980
You want to give me
the Infinite Heavenly Talisman, huh?

57
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,580
But I'm the loser.

58
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:42,380
I don't deserve that.

59

What's the matter?

60
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:45,820
You don't want it, either?

61
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:49,860
So now the Infinite Heavenly Talisman
has become junk

62
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:52,020

Yes.

79

the Tianshidu very soon.

80

81
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:59,620

00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:34,420
we shall not make things difficult for you.

371
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:35,940
You are...

372
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:38,820
[Elder of the Sinister Pleasure, Yuan Tao.]
I'm Yuan Tao from the Sinister Pleasure.

373
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:40,020
And this boy.

374
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:42,300
You can just call him Fool.

375
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,460
The rest of them

376
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:45,380
are the backbone of the Sinister Pleasure.

377
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:46,100
We only want

378
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:47,820
to borrow the Infinite Heavenly Talisman
for a few days.

379
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,220
We will return it to you after that.

380
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:50,420
Indeed, you're from the Sinister Pleasure.

381
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,620
You invaded Mount Longhu.

382
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:54,700
I'm afraid

383
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,060
that you won't be able to get out of here alive.

384
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:08,420
Spiritual Master Lingyu,

385
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:09,540
you're a really capable man

386
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:10,740
and a very good fighter.

387
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:12,460
But you rarely get out of the mountains,

388
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:14,380
so you haven't seen much of the world.

389
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:16,060
You haven't seen this before, right?

390
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:17,060
Then,

391
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:18,860
let me show you what it's like.

392
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:26,660
Yuan Tao.

393
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,100
So you've been coveting
the Infinite Heavenly Talisman.

394
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,100
Then, you should come to me.

395
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:33,260
Why are you attacking a young man?

396
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:34,740
Aren't you ashamed of what you're doing?

397
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:38,140
Mr. Lu is here, too.

398
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:39,580
It seems like

399
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:41,540
I won't get what I want today.

400
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:43,380
Mr. Lu.

401
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:44,580
You are a very knowledgeable man.

402
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:45,820
What technique are they practicing?

403
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:47,100
There is a group of Outsiders

404
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,340
who specialize

405
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:49,540
in cultivating their own qi

406
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:51,500
to create an independent superpower

407
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,780
out of an object.

408
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:54,220
That's called weapon forging.

409
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,160
It requires a lot of talent to forge a weapon.

410
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:58,700
Only a small handful of them
are capable of doing so,

411
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:01,620
and Yuan Tao is one of the most skillful ones.

412
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:03,540
The fat boy beside him

413
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:05,620
is probably an Armorer too, right?

414
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:07,300
It's nothing worth mentioning.

415
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:07,940
I am

416
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,260
flattered.

417
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:10,060
But

418
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:11,980
you aren't completely right.

419
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:12,740
Fool

420
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:14,340
is my greatest achievement

421
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:16,980
by far.

422
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:23,980
If that's the case,

423
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,820
that means we have fallen into your trap.

424
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:27,060
It's all right.

425
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,740
Since Lu is here,

426
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:29,820
Fool,

427
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:31,140
let's retreat first.

428
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:39,180
Running Hare!

429
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:43,140
That's really quick.

430
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:44,260
Lingyu, stay with me.

431
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:45,260
Kids,

432
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:46,660
don't forget what I told you.

433
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:47,500
Yes!

434
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:53,860
Charge!

435
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:10,460
Why did you stop running?

436
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:11,820
Mr. Lu,

437
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:13,580
you have really let your guard down.

438
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:15,420
You chased after me for such a long distance.

439
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:16,380
Aren't you worried

440
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:18,940
that something might happen to your kids?

441
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:19,860
Those kids know

442
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:21,980
a few tricks.

443
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,980
You should worried about your men.

444
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:25,300
Why are you so sure

445
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,380
that we are the only ones here?

446
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:31,820
Mr. Lu.

447
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:32,340
Well...

448
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:33,740
Don't worry, Lingyu.

449
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:35,420
Let's deal with him first.

450
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:36,180
Your master

451
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:37,940
can take care of the Celestial Taoist Mansion.

452
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:39,700
Regarding the Infinite Heavenly Talisman,

453
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,020
it's good if we can acquire it.

454
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:41,860
But even if we fail,

455
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:43,060
it's all right.

456
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:45,460
Notify those who are preparing
for an ambush in the mountain

457
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:46,940
and those who are standing by
at the foot of the mountain.

458
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:48,580
We should all do it together.

459
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:50,460
The greater the havoc, the better.

460
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:51,780
That way,

461
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:52,900
they will overlook

462
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,580

Where are you?

474
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:36,020
I brought her here!

475
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:37,620
Xia!

476
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:39,180
I finally found you.

477
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:41,420
I brought her here.

478
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:49,740
A petite body with very light qi.

479
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:51,660
You resemble an immortal.

480
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:54,620
Grandpa.

481
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:56,340
Are you talking to me?

482
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,060
Xia.

483
00:22:58,380 --> 00:22:59,380
This girl is really powerful.

484
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:00,460
You have to be careful.

485
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:02,300
My goodness!

486
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:04,060
Let me find out

487
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:05,460
what you

488
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:07,980
are capable of.

489
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:13,940
Grandpa, how did you do that?

490
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:15,060
Can you teach me?

491
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,340
I am a man,

492
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:19,580
and I don't kill women.

493
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:22,260
Beg for mercy now.

494
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:23,860
Then,

495
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:33,700
I will spare you.

496
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:37,780
I don't know how to beg for mercy,
but I know how to fight.

497
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:39,340
If that's the case,

498
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:42,740
I will kill you!

499
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:03,380
That's impressive.

500
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:07,220
It seems like I won't be able to defeat you.

501
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:16,780
Mu Guiying,

502
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:24,100
as brave

503
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:32,500
as ever.

504
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:46,300
Little girl, you are pretty good at this.

505
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:48,740
It's a pity that you are too naive.

506
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:51,540
Will you admit your defeat now?

507
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:51,980
Again.

508
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,460
You didn't allow the members
of the Sinister Pleasure

509
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:56,420
to participate
in the Outsider Martial Arts Contest.

510
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:57,620
This time, we are here

511
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:59,420
to redeem ourselves.

512
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:00,980
We want to humiliate

513
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:02,340
Mount Longhu,

514
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:05,260
and you will become the laughing stock
in the Outsiders' world.

515
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:06,380
Mr. Lu.

516
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:08,100
It seems like they are up to no good.

517
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:08,940
Perhaps

518
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:10,140
we should go and help others first.

519
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:11,420
Move aside!

520
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:12,860
What do you know, brat?

521
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:14,100
Lu Jing.

522
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,780
It's not the right time
to show off your seniority now.

523
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:17,980
How dare you call me by my name?

524
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:19,020
Rascal!

525
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:20,140
Are you trying to dig your own grave?

526
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:21,140
What are you doing, Lu Jing?

527
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:27,820
Lingyu.

528
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:28,940
Lingyu.

529
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:30,420
Seal your Hand-Shaoyin Meridian

530
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:31,900
and Foot-Jueyin Meridian.

531
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:36,820
I think

532
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:38,860
I was being rude to Mr. Lu.

533
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:40,260
Am I going mad?

534
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:41,380
No, you're not.

535
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:43,620
We were hypnotized.

536
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:51,700
Gao Ning, the Thunder Smoke Cannon.

537
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:58,180
Dou Mei, the Intoxicator.

538
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:00,140
It was your doing.

539
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,140
Lingyu.

540
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:17,620
Are you carrying
the Infinite Heavenly Talisman I gave you?

541
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:22,340
Looks like we're going
to have a big fight tonight.

542
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:23,380
But Mr. Lu,

543
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:24,300
the brush is with me.

544
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:25,100
What are you going to do?

545
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,260
Don't worry.

546
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:28,860
I can make do with this.

547
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:31,740
I have a lot of brushes.

548
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:33,260
That is huge.

549
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:35,140
The bigger, the stronger.

550
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:36,980
The Infinite Heavenly Talisman!

551
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,660
The book-combining technique.

552
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:41,300
The meridian-sealing Vermilion Book.

553
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:49,420
The Infinite Heavenly Talisman

554
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:50,820
is indeed extraordinary.

00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,400
[Twelve Bewitchments Array]

557
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:08,060
Fatty, you're so annoying!

558
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:09,140
Let me kill you first!

559
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:12,340
Quadruple Thunder Talisman!

560
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:28,420
Mire in the North!

561
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:49,380
Mr. Lu.

562
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:50,780
Have you realized how strong they are?

563
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:53,100
The Four Crazies are good

564
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:55,220
at messing with your minds.

565
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:57,300
In front of them,

566
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,700
your Infinite Heavenly Talisman

567
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:00,460
will be much weaker.

568
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:01,500
Lingyu.

569
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:03,420
Don't waste your effort
in applying more techniques.

570
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:05,460
Protect your mind.

571
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:06,300
Leave now.

572
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,580
How can I leave you alone?

573
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:09,340
I told you to leave now.

574
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:10,900
The Four Crazies are really powerful

575
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:12,220
and extremely vicious.

576
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:15,180
I have to teach these devils a lesson

577
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:17,780
even if it costs my life!

578
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:20,420
Aren't you the Four Crazies?

579
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:21,780
Where are there only three of you?

580
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:23,060
Are you talking about me?

581
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,060
I am not doing anything

582
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:42,900
because Mr. Lu still looks very good

583
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,540
at your age.

584
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:46,460
I don't want to hurt you.

585
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:51,820
Xia He.

586
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:55,340
Why are you staring at me?

587
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:58,500
You look like you want to eat me alive.

588
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:00,940
Mr. Lu.

589
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:01,380
What's the matter?

590
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:15,220
Grandpa, join us!

591
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:17,940
You look very tired.

592
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:19,260
We all have been waiting for you.

593
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:20,580
Hurry up.

594
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:21,300
Grandpa!

595
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:25,340
Hurry up.

596
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:41,740
It's just a hallucination.

597
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:44,740
It must be my hallucination.

598
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:53,940
Mr. Lu,

599
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:58,060
why are you so stubborn
when you're dealing with the Sinister Pleasure?

600
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:59,380
You're getting old.

601
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,420
There's nothing for you to dwell on.

602
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:03,620
When we defeat you today,

603
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:04,940
whether alive or dead,

604
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:06,740
at least, you won't feel any more pain.

605
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:07,820
I don't have other options.

606
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:10,540
I'm always this stubborn.

607
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:11,540
I won't rest

608
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:13,740
before I get rid of you.

609
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:15,260
I told you

610
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:17,300
that Lu Jing was very strong.

611
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:18,860
Disable him first.

612
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:21,140
Then, we will bring him back and deal with him.

613
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:27,940
I told you not to step in.

614
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:29,740
You didn't know

615
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:31,580
that the Twelve Bewitchments Array

616
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:34,660
[Hand-Shaoyin Meridian]
affects the 12 meridians in the human body.

617
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:36,780
Every meridian affects

618
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:38,540
[Gallbladder Meridian of Foot-Shaoyang]
the positive and negative emotions of the human.

619
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:41,620
It keeps switching between the two emotions

620
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:43,380
[Lung Meridian of Hand-Taiyin]
to weaken its opponent,

621
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:45,980
like a steel wire that's been twisted
over and over again.

622
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:48,700
You will eventually break down

623
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:50,740
and get swallowed by one of the emotions,

624
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:52,100
not being able to regain your composure.

625
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,620
And Dou Mei is here.

626
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:55,060
She is able

627
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:56,820
to make you weak.

628
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:58,260
When they are together,

629
00:30:58,260 --> 00:30:59,660
one is tough while the other is gentle.

630
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:01,220
They are the perfect match.

631
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:02,980
Lingyu.

632
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:04,980
They have used all their power

633
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:07,460
into immobilizing me now.

634
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:09,580
I'm going to say this one last time.

635
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:10,580
Do everything you can

636
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:11,220
and escape now!

637
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:15,380
Are you trying to leave?

638
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:17,700
Mr. Lu.

639
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:19,420
Do you think I'm here as a spectator?

640
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:25,660
Leave the pretty boy to me.

641
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:27,580
You can have the old man.

642
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:30,100
This crazy girl

643
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:32,020
gets distracted

644
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:33,340
when she sees a young man.

645
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:37,940
Now, I'm finally feeling at ease.

646
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:41,260
But I'm also reaching my limit.

647
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:43,460
Gao Ning.

648
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:44,500
You won!

649
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:50,460
Since you want me to lose my mind so badly,

650
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:51,980
I'll show you what I've got.

651
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:58,420
But this time,

652
00:31:58,420 --> 00:31:59,820
I will decide

653
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:01,740
what I'm going to do.

654
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:14,370
[Triple Rebirth]

655
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:17,100
Retreat.

656
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,420
Keep a safe distance from Lu Jing.

657
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:19,660
Why should we retreat?

658
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:21,380
We should take this opportunity to attack him.

659
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:23,300
It's difficult to see him losing his mind again.

660
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:25,300
Lu Jing has exhausted all his qi.

661
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:26,820
He is relying only on his self-control

662
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:27,820
to guide his emotions.

663
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,700
He barely managed to cast the Triple Rebirth

664
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,460
and has already given up
watching his Liver Meridian of Foot-Jueyin.

665
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:32,480
[Love. Hatred.]
He's pushing himself

666
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,420
to feel extreme anger and hatred.

667
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:36,220
The Triple Rebirth is very destructive.

668
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:37,100
We shall not take it lightly.

669
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:39,900
This

670
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:42,260
is going to be his final counterattack.

671
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:52,100
Where is Feng Baobao?

672
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:55,380
I think she was attracted by some weird noise.

673
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:56,620
The Sinister Pleasure is attacking Mount Longhu.

674
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:57,740
I need to bring the news
to Chief Celestial Taoist.

675
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:58,700
Mr. Xu San.

676
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:00,580
I'm sure you've seen the golden rays up there.

677
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:02,020
Rays of this brightness

678
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:03,980
are the result of Grandmaster's inheritance.

679
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:05,660
It's so chaotic out there.

680
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:06,980
With Grandmaster's cultivation,

681
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:08,300
he has definitely sensed it.

682
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:10,020
He can pass him the Tianshidu any other time.

683
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:10,420
But with this situation,

684
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:11,140
if the Chief Celestial Taoist doesn't show up now,

685
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:12,060
I'm afraid that they will blow up Mount Longhu.

686
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:14,260
Since Grandmaster has decided to stay put,

687
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:16,140
it means that what he's doing at the moment

688
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:17,700
is very important.

689
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,780
We won't allow you to disturb him.

690
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:20,500
Sorry,

691
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:21,460
Mr. Xu San.

692
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:22,660
We can only wait here.

693
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:24,620
I'm warning you on behalf of NDT Express.

694
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:25,660
Let me in.

695
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:26,540
Otherwise,

696
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:27,460
the Chief Celestial Taoist will have to bear
all the consequences.

697
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:37,020
Is it working, Grandmaster?

698
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:38,300
It's not.

699
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:41,460
This is already the third time.

700
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:44,980
There's nothing wrong on my side

701
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:47,300
during the inheritance.

702
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:49,100
You are the problem.

703
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:50,620
Chulan.

704
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:53,140
I reminded you before.

705
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:54,180
If the recipient hesitates

706
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:55,820
or is against it,

707
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:57,980
he won't be able
to receive the Tianshidu successfully.

708
00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:00,500
Do you not want to become a Celestial Taoist?

709
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:02,820
If you're worried about your life
as a mortal

710
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:04,260
after being a Celestial Taoist,

711
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:05,260
you can rest assured.

712
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:08,300
Disciples of the Celestial Taoist Mansion
aren't that strict.

713
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:09,220
You can smoke, drink,

714
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:09,980
and eat meat

715
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:10,980
even after this.

716
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:12,500
As long as you stay upright,

717
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:14,220
those useless rules and regulations

718
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:15,780
don't apply here

719
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:17,060
at the Zhengyi Sect.

720
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:18,660
If you don't want to take care of the affairs

721
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:19,900
of the Celestial Taoist Mansion,

722
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:21,060
you can leave it to Lingyu

723
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:22,580
and other martial uncles.

724
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:23,660
Most importantly,

725
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:26,500
once you become the Celestial Taoist,

726
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,620
those from the Sinister Pleasure
won't be able to lay their hands on you.

727
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:30,260
Grandmaster.

728
00:34:31,290 --> 00:34:32,850
If you want me

729
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:34,500
to accept the Tianshidu willingly,

730
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,140
please answer my question.

731
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:38,700
Is it about the Jiashen Calamity again?

732
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:40,420
It's not about the Jiashen Calamity.

733
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:41,620
Then, what is it?

734
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:45,340
Grandmaster.

735
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:48,940
After you pass me the Tianshidu,

736
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:49,820
what will happen to you?

737
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:02,060
Grandmaster.

738
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:04,340
I don't want

739
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:05,900
the Tianshidu.

740
