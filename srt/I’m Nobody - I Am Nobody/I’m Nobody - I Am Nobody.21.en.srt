(that I'll be waiting for him)

11
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,660
(three days later at Ganbei grassland.)

12
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:04,820
You are not who I seek.

13
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:05,700
Zhang.

14
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,020
Think twice.

15
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,060
Go home.

16
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:08,900
Chief Celestial Taoist.

17
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:09,820
You should

18
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,740
at least hear us out.

19
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:12,820
Mr. Feng,

20
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:13,980
is the All-Encompassing Guild

21
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:15,740
trying to meddle in my business now?

22
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:17,260
Of course not.

23
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:18,500
But I will!

24
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,140
Your business is my business.

25
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:22,980
We know you want to avenge Tian.

26
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:25,100
But there is a limit

27
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:25,900
to recklessness!

28
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:28,540
None here knows you as well as I do.

29
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:30,580
You're not impetuous like this.

30
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:32,500
So, why exactly are you doing this?

31
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,380
We have been good friends for years.

32
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:35,980
Tell me. Share your woe with me.

33
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:37,700
Let me help you.

34
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,980
They say the older you get,
the more obstinate you'll be.

35
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:41,220
Lu.

36
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:43,700
The only thing I want to do now

37
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,300
is to wipe out the Sinister Pleasure.

38
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,140
None of you can

39
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:48,780
get in my way.

40
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:51,940
You old moron. Are you provoking me here?

41
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:53,580
In that case,

42
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:55,540
I

43
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:57,220
will fight you!

44
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:59,540
You are the Chief Celestial Taoist,

45
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:01,100
the formidable Sage Tiantong,

46
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,740
you mustn't be overwhelmed

47
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:04,780
by your emotions!

48
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:24,060
Sorry, Lu.

49
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,060
I don't have time for you today.

50
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:27,580
Stay out of my way.

51
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,100
Since all of you are here,

52
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:32,860
I might as well make this clear now.

53
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:33,940
Regardless of what might happen

54
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:35,100
in my battle against the Sinister Pleasure,

55
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,140
I want all of you to stay out of it.

56
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,980
(Once this is over,)

57
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:42,940
(I will accept and serve)

58
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:44,540
(my punishment.)

59
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,420
Ding Dao'an.

60
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:08,460
You're here too.

61
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:11,300
Why would I miss the chance

62
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:12,500
to fight the legendary Sage Tiantong?

63
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:17,380
I am Tu Junfang.

64
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:19,380
Greetings, Chief Celestial Taoist.

65
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:21,460
Where is Gong Qing?

66
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:24,340
His presence matters not.

67
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,100
We are here for you,

68
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:28,020
Chief Celestial Taoist.

69
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,460
There can be no villain without a hero,

70
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:34,860
no good without evil.

71
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:37,740
The battle on Mount Longhu barely satisfied us.

72
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:39,180
Today,

73
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:40,820
all 14 of the Sinister Pleasure

74
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:43,140
will fight you,

75
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:44,860
the strongest Outsider there is.

76
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:15,500
I, Gong Qing,
Interim Leader of the Sinister Pleasure,

77
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,780
has come to see you, Chief Celestial Taoist.

78
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,540
As their leader,

79
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:25,820
you infiltrated my sect

80
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:28,660
by posing as a disciple for three years.

81
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:29,940
Qing,

82
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:31,700
that was audacious of you.

83
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:33,820
During my stay in the Celestial Taoist Mansion,

84
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,100
I have learned many things from you

85
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,620
and Grandmaster Tian.

86
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,820
I appreciate it.

87
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:39,780
How dare

88
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,460
you bring up Tian in front of me.

89
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:43,300
Grandmaster.

90
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:45,900
You can easily take my life.

91
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,660
So what's the hurry?

92
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,540
Before I die,

93
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:51,380
can I ask you a question?

94
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:01,620
Speak.

95
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,380
I killed Grandmaster Tian,

96
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,420
so I should pay with my life.

97
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:08,180
However, you would cross the Ten Elders

98
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:11,100
and disregard the Outsiders' rules
to summon me here.

99
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,260
I don't think my life

100
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,060
is your only goal.

101
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:17,540
It's about Grandmaster Tian's secret,

102
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:18,340
isn't it?

103
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:23,740
So I got it right.

104
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:29,780
You want the world
to forget about the Jiashen Calamity,

105
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:31,820
to avoid similar tragedies.

106
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:34,540
But do you truly

107
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,460
think that we could let it go?

108
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:40,180
As long as the Eight Supremes exist,

109
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:43,100
people will be drawn to the truth.

110
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,900
How many more can you kill?

111
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,700
If you truly wish to prevent another disaster,

112
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,540
my life is not the one you should take.

113
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:50,140
It should be Zhang Chulan's.

114
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:07,620
He is the grandson of Zhang Huaiyi,

115
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,340
who started the Jiashen Calamity.

116
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,900
Zhang Chulan will be the harbinger

117
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:14,180
of another calamity.

118
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:15,540
Only when he, as well as

119
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:17,340
the Qi Apotheosis he carries, disappear

120
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,380
can peace be kept.

121
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:21,740
You know that.

122
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:24,300
So you wanted to cage him with Tianshidu.

123
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,420
But he turned you down.

124
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,340
Is there something more important
than Zhang Chulan

125
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:31,380
in Mr. Tian's memory?

126
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:37,820
Everyone knows

127
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:40,260
that the Eight Supremes caused
the Jiashen Calamity.

128
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:41,460
Little do they know

129
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:44,220
that the secret behind the Eight Supremes

130
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:46,300
holds a greater treasure.

131
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,980
You care so much about Mr. Tian's memory.

132
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:51,180
It's not just because his memory

133
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:53,300
contains information about the calamity.

134
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:55,180
There is other information, too.

135
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:58,260
Secrets that can turn

136
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:00,460
the world of Outsiders upside down.

137
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:02,940
And that secret is where my ex-leader,

138
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,140
Wu Gensheng, received his enlightenment.

139
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:06,220
The Valley of 24 Terms.

140
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:11,540
For me, Zhang Chulan is a wild card.

141
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:13,060
But it is the same for you.

142
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,940
People with a good moral compass

143
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:16,260
like him

144
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:18,700
are most likely to stop you.

145
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:19,860
Qing.

146
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:22,020
You are very smart.

147
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:24,580
But you used your wit in the wrong place
and wreaked havoc.

148
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:26,740
His memory holds a lot of information,

149
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,740
and it cannot fall into the hands of your kind.

150
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:33,220
The Outsiders' world is no longer united.

151
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:35,540
Turning a blind eye to it
is the greatest ignorance.

152
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:37,500
The world needs a reshuffle.

153
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,020
It needs to revert to its original state.

154
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,540
That will happen.

155
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:42,500
Chief Celestial Taoist,

156
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:44,900
you won't be able to stop that.

157
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,820
I missed

158
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,460
the previous calamity.

159
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:51,780
But this time,

160
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,020
not anymore.

161
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:06,420
You'll finally make your move now.

162
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:08,900
Kill me here,

163
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,940
and you will pay a hefty price.

164
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:13,740
You will be barred

165
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,940
from handling the Outsiders' affairs.

166
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:18,060
Our world

167
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,740
is not centered around me.

168
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,220
You have your faith.

169
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:23,740
But so do I.

170
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,140
Interim Leader Gong,

171
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:28,100
the ones who can stop you are out there.

172
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,820
They will prevail. Justice will prevail!

173
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,870
[Sage Tiantong
violated several Outsiders' regulations]

174
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:03,050
[in his selfish quest for vengeance,]

175
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:06,800
[causing one death and several injuries.]

176
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,500
[NDT hereby sentences him]

177
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,670
[to a lifetime of confinement.]

178
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:15,820
[He is to be confined
in the selected area on Mount Longhu]

179
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,400
[and is not allowed to leave the vicinity.]

180
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:36,780
Grandmaster.

181
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:38,020
Chulan.

182
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:39,140
You're here.

183
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,740
Chulan.

184
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,540
I made a mistake.

185
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,220
Today might be the last day

186
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:52,260
we see each other.

187
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:01,020
Where people dwell, there will be rules.

188
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:03,220
Not to mention I made the rules

189
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:05,620
years ago.

190
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:07,540
But I broke them.

191
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:09,140
So I should accept the punishment.

192
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,540
Gong Qing is dead.

193
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,860
But the secret Grandmaster Tian kept

194
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:16,740
is also revealed.

195
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:21,140
Lyu Liang has his memory.

196
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:22,900
I count on you

197
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,340
to handle the rest.

198
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,460
I am old,

199
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:33,740
and I'm tired.

200
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:35,660
I should have retired a long time ago.

201
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:38,260
After all, I'm more than a century old now.

202
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:39,380
I'm pretty sure you can live

203
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:41,140
another century.

204
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:42,740
Another century?

205
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:44,260
I'd become an antique.

206
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:50,260
Chulan.

207
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:54,260
Can I ask you something?

208
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:56,380
You are thirsty for the truth.

209
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:58,500
But what will you do

210
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,980
once you learn the truth?

211
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,860
I actually don't know.

212
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:06,780
But this is something I must do.

213
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:08,380
For my grandpa,

214
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:10,140
for Ms. Bao,

215
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:13,380
and for myself.

216
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:16,340
What if someone wants to hurt others
with the truth?

217
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:17,460
You know,

218
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:18,740
humans are greedy.

219
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,020
People can do all sorts of things
under the banner of self-interest.

220
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:23,740
Then I will stop them.

221
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:24,980
But there are so many of them.

222
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:26,340
How?

223
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,060
I will give my life for it.

224
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:39,500
If only I were as determined as you

225
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,660
back then.

226
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:43,340
All this wouldn't have happened.

227
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:45,540
I already did

228
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:47,300
the easy part.

229
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,700
As for the toughest part,

230
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:54,180
I'll be selfish this time

231
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:56,020
and ask you to do it.

232
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:08,900
Grandmaster,

233
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:11,740
the last person who pet me

234
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:13,820
was my grandpa.

235
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:19,340
You still have a long way to go.

236
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:21,900
Your grandfather

237
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,060
and I

238
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:24,820
can only see you off.

239
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:29,020
We will not be able

240
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,020
to share the seasons to come.

241
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:46,700
Grandmaster.

242
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:52,980
Grandmaster.

243
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:54,820
Can you help me one last time?

244
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,820
Can you destroy the seal

245
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:02,980
Grandpa put on me?

246
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:20,140
[Calling]

247
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:21,180
(Hello.)

248
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:23,100
(The number you dialed is unavailable.)

249
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,700
(Lyu Liang has his memory.)

250
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:36,060
(I count on you)

251
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:38,540
(to handle the rest.)

252
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:44,260
(The Jiashen Calamity.)

253
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:46,260
(The Eight Supremes.)

254
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,900
(The Eight Supremes.)

255
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:51,860
(As of now,
we have found Dispatch of Detained Spirits,)

256
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:53,540
(Infinite Heavenly Talisman,)

257
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,260
(and Qimen Manipulation.)

258
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:58,860
(Qimen Manipulation...)

259
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:01,700
Chulan.

260
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:03,900
What else did Chief Celestial Taoist tell you?

261
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:07,580
I already told you everything

262
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:08,900
he told me.

263
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,140
That's all.

264
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:14,260
Now that Chief Celestial Taoist
was forcefully retired,

265
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:16,260
the Ten Elders will grow bolder,

266
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,700
let alone the rest

267
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,340
of the Outsiders' world.

268
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:22,860
After all, the one who reigned them in

269
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:24,780
cannot leave Mount Longhu now.

270
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,940
By the way, I've been meaning to ask you this.

271
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:32,180
Why did you turn Tianshidu down?

272
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:33,780
Exactly.

273
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:36,500
You turned it down.

274
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,700
But you should at least explain it to us.

275
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:46,780
Ms. Bao.

276
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,700
What did my grandpa tell Mr. Xu back then?

277
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:52,140
He said,

278
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:53,500
"Listen,

279
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,820
you should know that her past

280
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,580
is inextricably tied

281
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:00,660
to that calamity."

282
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:04,460
To find out your past,

283
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:07,020
we need to first seek the secret
behind the Jiashen Calamity.

284
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,060
My grandpa

285
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:09,100
misled Mr. Xu.

286
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:10,620
What do you mean?

287
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:14,460
Find the secret to unlock Ms. Bao's past.

288
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:15,620
But what if we can never find the secret?

289
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:19,340
Then Ms. Bao will stay by my side forever.

290
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:20,820
I will have a strong ally

291
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,540
at all times.

292
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:28,020
Ms. Bao.

293
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:29,700
Mr. Xu and you

294
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,220
were set up by my grandpa.

295
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:32,660
You mean

296
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:35,060
Zhang Huaiyi lied to my father?

297
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:36,340
My grandpa didn't lie per se.

298
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:37,180
The secret of the Jiashen Calamity

299
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:39,220
can reveal Ms. Bao's past to us.

300
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:41,540
But Tianshidu itself is an imposition,

301
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:43,060
a seal.

302
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:44,780
If I inherit Tianshidu,

303
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,580
Chief Celestial Taoist will die.

304
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:53,340
And like him,

305
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:55,140
I will know every secret

306
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:57,020
but I can't tell anyone,

307
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:58,420
including Ms. Bao.

308
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,740
Therefore, I'd rather be your slave

309
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:06,060
than a keeper of a thousand secrets.

310
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:41,420
Chulan,

311
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:42,500
what do you plan

312
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,500
to do next?

313
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,020
I want

314
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:49,580
to keep my promise to my grandpa.

315
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:51,500
The 36 Thieves. The Eight Supremes.

316
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:54,020
I will find every lead

317
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:55,900
until I find the truth.

318
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,660
Dude.

319
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:03,580
That's very naive of you.

320
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:05,340
After all these years,

321
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:08,020
the 36 Thieves must be all dead.

322
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:11,420
And you know how secretive and elusive

323
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:12,700
the wielders of the Eight Supremes are.

324
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:15,060
Who do we know
possesses one of the Eight Supremes?

325
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,860
Wang Ai, Feng Zhenghao,

326
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:18,060
and Lu Jing.

327
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:22,340
All three of them

328
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:24,180
are not someone you can mess with.

329
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:26,340
Getting information out of them

330
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:28,660
is like boiling the sea.

331
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:33,340
I know.

332
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:34,660
But you forgot someone.

333
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:38,820
I will not give up easily.

334
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:40,100
Wang Ye, who wields Qimen Manipulation,

335
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,860
is my lead.

336
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:44,100
And

337
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,700
from what I know,

338
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:48,500
we're not the only party interested in him.

339
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:53,220
[Mount Wudang]

340
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,100
Grandmaster.

341
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:10,940
It's me,

342
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:12,060
Wang Ye.

343
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:14,340
I brought congee for you.

344
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:16,140
Your favorite pumpkin congee with sweet corn.

345
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:19,460
Grandmaster?

346
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:22,620
Why did you return?

347
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,260
This is my home.

348
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:26,060
Where else can I go?

349
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,540
I've been back for a week already,

350
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:32,420
but you refused to see me.

351
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:34,180
Give me a chance to explain everything, please?

352
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:35,340
You told me everything I need to know

353
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,620
on the phone.

354
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:39,940
Grandmaster,

355
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:41,980
are you worried

356
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,180
that my public display of Qimen Manipulation

357
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:44,780
will draw unwanted attention to Wudang?

358
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,700
Don't worry.

359
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:48,900
If anything happens to Wudang,

360
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,140
I will take care of it.

361
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:51,220
And I won't implicate my peers at all.

362
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:52,180
Wang Ye.

363
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:53,700
Let me get this clear.

364
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,860
You have been expelled.

365
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:59,540
Even if a disaster strikes Wudang,

366
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:01,100
it is none of your business.

367
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:05,300
Grandmaster.

368
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,940
I am not your grandmaster!

369
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,180
You're welcome to stay here

370
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:11,460
as a tourist.

371
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,500
But not more than that,

372
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:15,300
Mr. Wang.

373
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:32,700
[Wang Ye's Father, Wang Weiguo]

374
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:33,420
Wang You.

375
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:33,820
Wang Yi.

376
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:35,020
Stop fighting.

377
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:35,980
Come here.

378
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:37,420
Come and make a wish.

379
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,980
O' Mighty God.

380
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:44,740
Please make sure Xin returns my feelings.

381
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:45,860
O' Mighty God.

382
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:48,140
Please make sure
I get into the top five in this exam.

383
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,140
Wang Ye, make a wish too.

384
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:51,940
Deity Zhenwu here will make your wish come true.

385
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:54,100
[Wang Ye, Seven Years Old]
I don't know what wish to make.

386
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:54,620
[Wang Ye, Seven Years Old]

387
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:56,940
Anything you want.

388
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:58,060
Go.

389
00:21:58,740 --> 00:21:59,500
Dad.

390
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,780
Forget Wang Ye.

391
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:02,260
Let's go to the next hall.

392
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:03,460
Wait for me.

393
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:08,340
Sir,

394
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:10,820
do you think the deity will hear us?

395
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:12,860
That depends on your wish

396
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:14,900
and on your performance.

397
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,140
Little buddy,

398
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:17,300
do you want to make a wish?

399
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,700
I think

400
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:20,940
that he'll be overwhelmed

401
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,340
if he has to listen to everyone's wishes.

402
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:24,740
I shouldn't add to his burden.

403
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:26,500
We were born with woes.

404
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,460
But not the deity.

405
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:30,020
He will not get tired at all.

406
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:31,300
If you do have a wish,

407
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,820
tell him.

408
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:37,060
Is he that powerful?

409
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:38,460
Can I ask him a question?

410
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:39,660
Sure.

411
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:41,500
Who

412
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,540
am I?

413
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:48,180
(I once thought that Zhang Chulan was the key.)

414
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:51,780
(But the moment I learned Qimen Manipulation,)

415
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:54,340
(I have inevitably become one of the pieces
in this Jiashen Calamity.)

416
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:56,660
(Alas, during my stay in Wudang,)

417
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:59,340
(I still haven't found my answer.)

418
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,540
Who

419
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:05,620
am I?

420
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:22,540
Taoist Wang Ye.

421
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:23,980
Are you heading to the airport?

422
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:25,540
I can give you a lift.

423
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:36,180
Come on.

424
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,020
Thanks.

425
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:50,300
You're welcome.

426
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:54,980
Taoist Wang Ye.

427
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:57,340
My father really admires you.

428
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:58,860
He only found
two persons of interest from the contest,

429
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:00,100
Zhang Chulan

430
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:01,060
and you.

431
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:02,740
Zhang Lingyu, Zhuge Qing,

432
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:04,660
he doesn't care about them at all.

433
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:06,380
Your father has keen eyes.

434
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:08,300
Of course.

435
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,500
What does a Taoist lack?

436
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,700
Money, of course.

437
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,340
Who turns to religion when they are rich?

438
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,340
I'll be frank with you.

439
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:16,700
My dad wants you to join

440
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:17,860
the All-Encompassing Guild.

441
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:18,820
You will be given

442
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:19,900
25,000 yuan every month.

443
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:20,940
After tax.

444
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:22,420
That's a lot.

445
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:23,620
Right?

446
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:25,020
Our guild offers you so much more

447
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:25,940
than being

448
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:27,300
a Taoist on Mount Wudang.

449
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:28,500
You see.

450
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:31,260
We're around the same age.

451
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:32,460
Compare my outfit

452
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:33,660
to yours.

453
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:36,420
Once you're rich,

454
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:38,020
you don't have to budget everything anymore.

455
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:39,140
You can wear or buy

456
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:40,700
whatever you want.

457
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:41,580
Isn't that great?

458
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:45,940
So true.

459
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:48,220
That's the attitude.

460
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:49,900
This is the contract.

461
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:50,900
Take a look.

462
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:53,460
Ask me if you have any questions.

463
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,100
Take your time.

464
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,660
Just rest for a few days first.

465
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:58,460
Then,

466
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:00,620
I'll have someone pick you up.

467
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:01,580
Mister,

468
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:02,900
you're going the wrong way.

469
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,580
Just stop by the ramp ahead.

470
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:07,140
I got you a first-class seat.

471
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:10,220
Don't be ridiculous.

472
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:12,140
I've never traveled in first class before.

473
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:14,220
It's fine.

474
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:15,940
Everyone starts somewhere.

475
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:19,380
Once you're in my guild,

476
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:21,820
you can sit in any jets you want

477
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:23,220
till you get sick of it.

478
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:26,340
Mister.

479
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:27,540
Just stop there.

480
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:50,300
Taoist Wang Ye.

481
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:50,940
It's not this one.

482
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:51,980
You're in the wrong hangar.

483
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:52,820
Come back to the car.

484
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:53,620
Boss Ye.

485
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,140
Du!

486
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:57,180
It's been a while.

487
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:01,060
I told you many times

488
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,140
to stop calling me that.

489
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:08,300
Is he

490
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,020
your chauffeur?

491
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:10,580
Thank you for bringing him here.

492
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:15,540
My pleasure.

493
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:16,540
Feng.

494
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:17,220
Are you going to the capital?

495
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:18,260
I can give you a lift.

496
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:20,180
It's okay,

497
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:20,980
Mr. Ye.

498
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:21,700
Sorry.

499
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:23,220
Taoist Wang Ye.

500
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:24,060
Uhm,

501
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:25,140
I should head back

502
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:26,820
and update my father.

503
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:28,420
I'll leave you to yourselves.

504
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:33,060
Taoist Wang Ye.

505
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:35,700
[The All-Encompassing Group]

506
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:37,860
See you

507
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:39,860
later.

508
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:51,860
[Capital]

509
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:57,380
Du.

510
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:59,900
Are we in the wrong place?

511
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:01,940
Our house has never been this big.

512
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:04,940
Mr. Wang bought another 30 acres of land last year

513
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:06,780
and expanded the area.

514
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:08,300
He's old now,

515
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:09,860
and you're always absent.

516
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:12,220
He thought this place was too empty,

517
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:13,140
so he built

518
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:14,820
several mansions

519
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:16,060
to attract more tenants.

520
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:17,700
Just to feel less lonely, you know?

521
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:20,860
Oh, didn't he feel tired?

522
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:31,380
Mr. Ye.

523
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:32,940
You...

524
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:34,140
You need a change of clothes.

525
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:35,940
Why not?

526
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:37,900
Mr. Wang is sick.

527
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,020
Try not to get on his nerves.

528
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:43,140
Put this on.

538
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:15,660
I'm back.

00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,300
I've missed you!

541
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:23,780
Let me see if you have put on some weight.

542
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:26,460
You're such a big boy now.

543
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:28,220
Ms. Zhao

544
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:29,380
found you a date.

545
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:30,460
I saw her photo.

546
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:30,980
She's beautiful.

547
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:31,740
Mom.

548
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:33,220
Where is Dad?

549
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:35,540
He's in the bedroom.

550
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:36,580
You see,

551
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:38,380
he hasn't been feeling well lately.

552
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:39,660
You...

553
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:41,780
Ye!

554
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:50,180
Dad.

555
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:52,900
Ye.

556
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:54,140
What happened to you?

557
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:56,580
We consulted the best doctor there is.

558
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:57,460
Your dad

559
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:59,740
has nervous breakdowns

560
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:01,660
from constantly worrying about you.

561
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:02,580
He has insomnia,

562
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:03,380
depression,

563
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:05,620
headache, and body aches.

564
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:06,460
And he...

565
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:07,420
Enough.

566
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:08,540
Stop.

567
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:09,700
Let me talk

568
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:10,940
to our son.

569
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:19,580
Dad.

570
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:22,780
Ye.

571
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:24,860
I'm fine.

572
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:26,140
I just

573
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:27,740
think a lot about you.

574
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:29,420
Several days ago,

575
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:31,500
Taoist Zhou

576
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:32,780
rang me up

577
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:33,940
and said

578
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:35,060
that you no longer

579
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:36,300
stayed in Wudang.

580
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,860
And that you would come home soon.

581
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:39,700
When I heard that,

582
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:42,540
my condition improved so quickly.

583
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:45,420
I left Wudang today.

584
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:46,780
You were already aware of it several days ago?

585
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:52,100
Taoist Zhou

586
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,260
and I

587
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:54,500
know each other for years.

588
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,180
We are very close.

589
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:57,660
I'm glad you're here.

590
00:29:58,260 --> 00:29:59,860
You can help me

591
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:00,900
run the business now.

592
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:02,220
Look

593
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:03,580
at my health.

594
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:07,780
I'm not long

595
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:09,100
for this world.

596
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:09,980
And

597
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:11,940
my memory

598
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:13,580
has been failing me lately.

599
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:19,300
Dad.

600
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:21,300
Where is your medicine?

601
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:24,300
Dad.

602
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:32,740
Nervous breakdowns,

603
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:34,700
depression,

604
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:36,740
and insomnia.

605
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:39,260
I don't see

606
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:41,100
any relevant medications at all.

607
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:46,700
But I do see supplements
such as Liuwei Dihuang pills,

608
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:51,980
boxthorn,

609
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,700
dried seahorse,

610
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:57,020
kangaroo essence.

611
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:03,460
And

612
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:06,420
these yellow pills.

613
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:09,380
My son.

614
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:09,900
Ye.

615
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:11,460
This is...

616
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:15,340
Dad.

617
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:18,740
The only sickness you have
seems to be sexual dysfunction.

618
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:20,620
You look very healthy.

619
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:24,100
Why did I feign sickness?

620
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:25,020
To make you

621
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:26,380
stay here, of course.

622
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:28,540
Look.

623
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:29,700
You're all healed.

624
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:31,100
You're annoying.

625
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:33,620
Take a look at these beads.

626
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:34,460
Are they good?

627
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:40,300
Where do you get them from?

628
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:42,300
I met a friend lately.

629
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,580
He gave them to me.

630
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:45,740
He said they were blessed.

631
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:47,900
A friend

632
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:49,460
whom you met lately?

633
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:06,140
Ye.

634
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:07,220
You want to join in the fun?

635
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,300
Let's invite your dad and Yi.

636
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:10,660
We can play eight rounds.

637
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,300
Mom.

638
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:13,980
Where are your friends?

639
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,220
They left.

640
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:15,900
My son is back.

641
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,220
So they had no reason to stay.

642
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:18,380
They can read the room.

643
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:20,540
You met them lately, too?

644
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:22,220
Yes. Why?

645
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:23,540
They are quite friendly.

646
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:24,940
They are not here for our money.

647
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:32,860
Money isn't what they want, all right.

648
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:36,780
Du.

649
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:38,380
You're an Outsider, too.

650
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:39,500
Have you found

651
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,300
anything unusual lately?

652
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:42,620
Did an Outsider visit us?

653
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:43,780
No.

654
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:44,980
Why do you ask?

655
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:47,220
I checked the lock.

656
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:48,860
I found traces of qi on them.

657
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:52,380
I checked my room too.

658
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:54,140
At first glance, nothing was out of place.

659
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:55,580
Until I saw

660
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:57,820
that the area I rarely touched

661
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:59,620
was clean

662
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:01,100
and spotless.

663
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:02,500
That's when I know

664
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:05,060
someone used qi to restore things

665
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:06,980
back to their original state
after they were done searching.

666
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:08,420
Did they

667
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:09,740
rummage through Mr. Wang's room too?

668
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:11,060
They are sleeping now,

669
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:12,660
so I haven't checked.

670
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:16,340
But when I opened my dad's drawer
in the afternoon,

671
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:17,900
it was quite messy.

672
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:19,220
There was no trace of qi.

673
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:21,580
Are they after Mr. Wang

674
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:22,900
or you?

675
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:24,060
Me,

676
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:26,580
of course.

677
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:28,820
What do they want from you?

678
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:34,140
I cannot tell you.

679
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:35,100
Du.

680
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:35,940
Tell me.

681
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:38,580
If something happens,

682
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:39,820
will you help me?

683
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:40,460
Sure.

684
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:41,900
Good.

685
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:44,580
Hire several Outsiders

686
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:46,180
to guard this place in secret.

687
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:47,980
Don't let my parents find out.

688
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:48,860
Don't worry.

689
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:49,980
Just leave that to me.

690
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:51,260
Okay.

691
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:01,860
What is your superpower?

692
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:02,460
Ordinary people

693
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:04,460
blink 10 to 20 times per minute.

694
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:06,060
Each blink will take 0.2 seconds.

695
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:07,260
My superpower

696
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:08,900
is that I don't need to blink.

697
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:10,060
Watch this, Mr. Wang.

698
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:16,060
Next.

699
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:21,540
Du.

700
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:23,540
What is this?

701
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:25,180
To make bubbles,

702
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:27,020
ordinary people will need to use detergent

703
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:29,220
or something soapy.

704
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:30,260
But not him.

705
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:31,620
He can produce bubbles on his own.

706
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:34,140
I see.

707
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:35,540
Next.

708
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,940
- Stop.
- Stop...

709
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:52,420
- Stop.
- Stop...

710
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:57,540
Mr. Wang.

711
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:58,380
Look.

712
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:00,220
The shirt was soaking wet just now.

713
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:01,580
Thanks to my ability,

714
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:03,420
it's dry now.

715
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:10,220
Where do you work?

716
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:11,340
In a laundromat.

717
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:13,260
Interesting.

718
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:17,180
Next.

719
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:22,340
Stop.

720
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:23,940
You may leave now.

721
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:25,220
Thank you.

722
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:29,500
Du.

723
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:33,340
Do you have any competent candidates?

724
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:34,540
What?

725
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,140
Are they not competent enough?

726
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,580
They are the cream of the crop.

727
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:41,740
They don't usually offer their service.

728
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:43,940
I went out of my way to bring them here.

729
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,180
Fine.

730
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:48,820
They will do.

731
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:49,860
Okay.

732
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:51,620
Give me two million yuan.

733
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,060
Two million yuan?

734
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:56,140
Well, they are professionals.

735
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:58,620
Two million yuan is a bargain already.

736
00:35:58,620 --> 00:35:59,700
Du.

737
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,580
I have no money.

738
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:04,740
You know what?

739
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:06,020
Why don't you take the money

740
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:06,740
from our family account?

741
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:07,660
I can't.

742
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:10,300
I'm just your father's assistant.

743
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:11,060
I cannot touch

744
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:13,100
your savings account.

745
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:13,660
You...

746
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:33,780
So that's what a real professional does.

747
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:36,700
Why don't you come in?

748
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:43,740
Lian?

749
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:47,340
Why are you two here?

750
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:48,780
You see.

751
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:50,220
We just drove here.

752
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:52,060
I wanted to ring the doorbell,

753
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:53,260
but I figured it was too late.

754
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:55,060
I was planning to spend a night in my car

755
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:56,860
before visiting you tomorrow.

756
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:58,500
Isn't it cold here?

757
00:36:58,500 --> 00:36:59,380
Find a hotel.

758
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:01,500
I'm too poor to afford it.

759
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:02,740
But you won the martial arts contest.

760
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:03,940
Well, yeah. But they offered me

761
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:06,060
either Tianshidu
or the Infinite Heavenly Talisman.

762
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:07,500
They didn't give me cash.

763
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:11,140
Since we all need money...

764
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:12,140
Come.

765
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:13,180
Let's make some money.

766
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:17,900
Zhang Chulan.

767
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:19,140
Aren't we supposed to stake out his place?

768
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:19,860
Why is he here?

769
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:24,900
You are here

770
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:27,940
to stake out my place?

771
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:29,940
Here's the thing.

772
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:32,220
We were supposed to follow someone,

773
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:34,140
but that someone was staking out your place.

774
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,860
Someone was staking out

775
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:39,180
in front of my place?

776
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:44,900
Let's go.

777
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:50,380
We're meeting Jin Yuanyuan.

778
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:51,420
She is the Queen of Investment.

779
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:52,380
She was a prodigy.

780
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:53,620
At the age of 19,

781
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:55,500
she's already helping her dad
to manage his assets worth several hundred million.

782
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:57,020
She also holds her drinks very well.

783
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:58,260
No one

784
00:37:58,260 --> 00:37:59,540
has managed to outdrink her.

785
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:02,140
Oh, Feng Baobao.

786
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:04,020
You can hold your drinks very well too.

787
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:04,900
Your task

788
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:05,900
is to entertain her.

789
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:09,660
What about me?

790
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:11,940
You will protect me.

791
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:12,860
From what?

792
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:16,740
Her love bombing.

793
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:23,780
Wang Ye.

794
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:25,420
So you returned after all those years of fun

795
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:26,500
on Mount Wudang.

796
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:34,220
A thermal bottle in a bar?

797
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:36,260
Excuse me.

798
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:37,260
Bring him some wine.

799
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:38,700
Cheers.

800
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:44,340
Ms. Jin.

801
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:45,580
I have a favor to ask

802
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:47,020
from you.

803
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:48,340
Can you lend me some money?

804
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:50,660
I will pay you back with interest.

805
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:52,700
Have I ever turned you down?

806
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:56,220
But explain this to me.

807
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:01,740
I confessed to you here last time.

808
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:03,220
And the next day, you became a monk.

809
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:05,300
Why did you do that?

810
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:09,580
What?

811
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:11,620
My duty called. I had no choice.

812
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:13,300
So if I confess

813
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:17,140
to you again tonight,

814
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:19,060
you'll run to another temple tomorrow?

815
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,540
Ms. Jin!

816
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:25,740
Do not worry.

817
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:27,220
After his stay in Mount Wudang,

818
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:28,380
Wang Ye has come to a realization.

819
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:30,620
That you are his soulmate.

820
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:33,060
They work for your dad?

821
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:35,540
No.

822
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:36,740
They are my friends.

823
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:38,020
They deliver things.

824
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:40,380
We work in logistics.

825
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:42,340
Wang Ye! You have friends now?

826
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:43,100
Cheers.

827
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:47,940
Your friend here can hold her drinks.

828
00:39:57,740 --> 00:39:59,020
How much do you want?

829
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:01,500
Two million yuan.

830
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:03,140
That's not a problem.

831
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:05,300
But shouldn't you

832
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:08,900
pay a deposit?

833
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:11,220
Such as?

834
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:13,380
I can be his guarantor.

835
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:14,340
Cheers.

836
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:27,820
It is beer.

837
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:40,900
Wang Ye.

838
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:42,380
Where did you meet her?

839
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:51,940
Cheers.

840
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:58,740
What do we do now?

841
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:04,060
Wake her up. I'll drink with her.

842
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:06,260
No need.

843
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:08,100
She already agreed to lend me the money.

844
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:09,380
However, she's completely wasted.

845
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:10,380
Yeah.

846
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:28,620
Aren't you good at divination?

847
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:30,820
You could even divine the lottery number.

848
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:32,700
Yet you couldn't divine that you'd puke
after one glass?

849
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:33,620
Money.

850
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:36,780
Money.

851
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:40,020
Money.

852
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:42,780
Money.

853
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:44,620
Here.

854
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:46,500
Money.

855
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:49,020
Clean up yourself.

856
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:52,500
Get inside.

857
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:53,940
Inside my car.

858
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:55,500
Get inside.

859
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:58,340
This stupid sports car
can't carry many passengers at all.

860
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:13,060
You're sober now?

861
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:18,860
Oh, right.

862
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:20,380
I forgot to ask you.

863
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:21,420
Why were you looking for me?

864
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:25,740
You must have heard

865
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:27,220
that I

866
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:28,780
refused to inherit Tianshidu.

867
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:33,140
What?

868
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:34,420
You refused?

869
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:36,820
I tried so hard
to stop you from seeking the truth.

870
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:38,700
And you turned it down in the end?

871
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:40,780
So I came to you.

872
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:43,420
Can you divine the truth for me?

873
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:45,900
Do you think I'm a fortune-teller?

874
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,340
Someone's following us.

875
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:57,500
I can take a few detours.

876
00:42:58,700 --> 00:42:59,180
It's no use.

877
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:00,260
They have been following us.

878
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:03,660
Let's draw them to a secluded place

879
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:04,460
and get rid of them.

880
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:08,740
It sucks

881
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:10,380
being followed all the time.

882
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:12,740
I am a jinx now.

883
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:15,180
I should have stayed out
of the whole Jiashen Calamity thing.

884
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:16,580
Where are we?

885
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:17,780
West Buzhimen Bridge.

886
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:21,700
Take it.

887
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:23,100
Okay.

888
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:51,660
You can drive very well.

889
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:53,140
I wonder if they could find their way out

890
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:54,700
before dawn.

891
00:43:55,060 --> 00:43:56,100
Of course.

892
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:56,980
My driving skill

893
00:43:56,980 --> 00:43:59,020
is NDT's last line of defense.

894
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:19,140
The tire exploded.

895
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:19,900
I know!

896
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:25,140
Chaos Golden Space Rip!

897
00:44:52,660 --> 00:44:54,340
I told you.

898
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:55,620
My driving skill

899
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:57,860
is NDT's last line of defense.

900
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:06,220
Who are they?

901
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:08,420
Great.

902
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:11,460
