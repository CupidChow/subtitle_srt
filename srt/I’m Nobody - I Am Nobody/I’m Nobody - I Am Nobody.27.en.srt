[Episode 27]

00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:31,380
[This is a work of fiction. Any resemblance

Everything is related to karma and destiny.

Follow me

11
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,460
if you two wish to know the truth.

12
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:29,060
It's been almost 80 years.

13
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:30,260
Where are we?

14
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:31,500
Back then,

15
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,220
we invented the Eight Supremes here.

16
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,420
I tried all kinds of methods

17
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:39,700
to return to this place

18
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,820
after escaping from the Lyu family.

19
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,020
However, I couldn't achieve my goal.

20
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:47,380
Is this the legendary Valley of 24 Terms?

21
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:57,700
Thank you for helping me

22
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:58,900
to return to this place.

23
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,380
You invented the Double Quan Palm here,

24
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:03,420
yet you couldn't enter this place by yourself.

25
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:05,700
The Valley of 24 Terms

26
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:08,260
isn't as simple as you think.

27
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:10,860
This is another dimension.

28
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:11,780
This place

29
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:14,100
is the true Outsiders' world.

30
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,900
It's the origin of all superpowers.

31
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,500
A power is flowing subtly in this world.

32
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,540
It guides the blood circulation of

33
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:22,980
all living beings here,

34
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,580
allowing humans to harness superpowers.

35
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,380
The Valley of 24 Terms

36
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,980
transcends time.

37
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:31,060
It influences your present,

38
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:32,900
past,

39
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,540
and future.

40
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:36,780
What a shame.

41
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:39,940
I've tried all kinds of methods all these years,

42
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:42,740
yet I could only wander around
the edge of the Outsiders' world.

43
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:45,500
It seems like the energy flow has become stagnant.

44
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:47,820
That's why this body could not grow.

45
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:49,220
I cannot enter the Valley of 24 Terms

46
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:51,420
with my powers alone.

47
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,300
I never expected you guys

48
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,180
to bring me back here one day.

49
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:56,780
Why did you have to come back?

50
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:59,220
Back then,

51
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,220
me,

52
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,420
Fourth Brother,

53
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:03,380
Dummy, and the rest,

54
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:04,540
the nine of us

55
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:06,420
stayed in the Valley of 24 Terms together.

56
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:07,940
We were isolated from the world

57
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:09,060
as we sought enlightenment together.

58
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:12,060
We were focused on finding our own paths.

59
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,940
The kind of camaraderie,

60
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:15,300
happiness,

61
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,220
and wholeness we experienced here,

62
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:19,260
you would never understand

63
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:21,500
if you didn't experience it yourself.

64
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,100
Double Quan Palm wouldn't have existed

65
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:26,580
if it weren't for this place.

66
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,460
Do you know what it feels like

67
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:30,140
when you achieve enlightenment?

68
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:31,620
It feels like

69
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,900
you can decide your own fate.

70
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,940
It felt as if you were one with the world.

71
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:38,100
You could feel the rhythm of the world.

72
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:40,340
It felt as if the world was dancing for you.

73
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,500
So, my grandfather invented

74
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,180
Qi Apotheosis here.

75
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:51,820
Fate has brought us together.

76
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:54,220
It's been so long since I was this happy.

77
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:57,340
But what is Qi Apotheosis?

78
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:58,540
I don't know.

79
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,540
Everyone has a different way
of achieving enlightenment.

80
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:04,580
The Eight Supremes

81
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:07,780
are more than just powerful superpowers.

82
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,380
More importantly,

83
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:10,060
it's a sign

84
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:12,620
of mastery of the world.

85
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:15,220
It's a sign of mastery toward your fate.

86
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:17,700
Maybe you'll understand this one day

87
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:18,940
and will be enlightened.

88
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:21,660
Maybe you won't be able to achieve enlightenment.

89
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,940
Dummy didn't impart his supreme to you, huh?

90
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:26,900
What a shame.

91
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:38,260
What about you?

92
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:39,700
What do you plan to do next?

93
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:51,700
I ended up becoming the person Huan hated the most.

94
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:54,060
I wish to return to the time

95
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,100
when Huan and I were still together.

96
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:59,060
I want to be my true self.

97
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:01,820
I want to be the good brother in Huan's heart.

98
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:04,380
I've hurt so many people

99
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,820
and committed so many evil deeds.

100
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:10,260
I've decided to turn myself in to NDT.

101
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,060
Zhang Chulan,

102
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,500
you mustn't follow in my footsteps.

103
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,700
You must protect the person
who means the most to you.

104
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,420
Protect Feng Baobao.

105
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,420
Go now.

106
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:33,370
[Lyu Liang was severely punished by NDT
for violating the Outsiders' regulations.]

107
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:34,220
[But due to his excellent behavior,
and he atoned for his crimes by doing good deeds,]

108
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:35,950
[a sentence reduction is granted in consideration
of the nature of the crime and his behavior.]

109
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:37,070
[Individuals associated with the Lyu family
have been charged with unlawful detention]

110
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,500
[and intentional harm against Duanmu Ying,
warranting severe punishment.]

111
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,450
[NDT imposed strict penalties
on the individuals involved.]

112
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,340
Is this me?

113
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:04,940
It's you.

114
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:07,660
I...

115
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:10,220
I look very happy.

116
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,180
Fourth Brother carved this.

117
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:28,500
Your father was known
for his peerless elegance back then.

118
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,340
He loved you very much.

119
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:31,940
However, you were caught in an accident.

120
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:32,860
Back then,

121
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:35,700
he gathered the eight of us
and returned to the Valley of 24 Terms

122
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,460
to save you.

123
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,700
Each of the Eight Supremes has its own strengths.

124
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:44,580
We could only rescue you

125
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,900
with the power of all eight individuals.

126
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,700
That was the only way

127
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,900
we could revive the original you.

128
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,140
However, you didn't show up.

129
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,540
I did want to show up.

130
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:01,140
Yet the Lyu family detained me.

131
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:02,580
I was responsible

132
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:03,420
for awakening

133
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:05,580
Feng Baobao's memories with my Double Quan Palm.

134
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:06,740
It's a shame that...

135
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,020
I will return

136
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:10,740
what I owed you last time.

137
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,260
Where are Ms. Bao's memories?

138
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:15,540
Back then,

139
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:18,500
they only managed to awaken your body.

140
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,660
Your memories

141
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:22,380
were kept in this cave all these years.

142
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:49,580
Baobao,

143
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:50,380
extend your hand.

144
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:53,220
(Father.)

145
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:54,900
(Baobao, come.)

146
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,980
(I brought you something nice.)

147
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:58,500
(You'll definitely like it.)

148
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:07,580
(Father, you're the best.)

149
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:27,740
The scattering qi

150
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:29,460
isn't coming into contact with the qi formation.

151
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:32,060
I can only maintain it for a while.

152
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:33,300
Baobao,

153
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,700
I will return everything to you.

154
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:37,420
Your family,

155
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:38,340
your past,

156
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:39,940
everything you desire,

157
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,020
they're all here.

158
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:43,460
Follow me.

159
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:46,700
Ms. Bao,

160
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,180
don't trust her yet.

161
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:50,220
She was the one who killed Xu Huan.

162
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:54,860
Zhang Chulan,

163
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:57,580
we've been through so much together

164
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:00,100
and known so many people.

165
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,980
Everyone has their own past

166
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:03,500
and their families.

167
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,300
You have your grandfather, too.

168
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:07,580
Although he has passed away,

169
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:09,700
at least he's still in your memories.

170
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:12,180
I saw that man

171
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,820
on the train just now.

172
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:15,700
I saw him

173
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,580
shedding tears for me.

174
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:18,940
However, I don't know who he is.

175
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:21,220
I want to know him.

176
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,580
I want to know

177
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,180
how my father used to dote on me.

178
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,660
I will cast the qi formation now.

179
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:00,860
Step back.

180
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:03,860
Don't disturb me when I'm restoring her memories.

181
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:38,980
Back then,

182
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:41,100
the eight of them

183
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:42,780
stood here

184
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:44,300
and revived you

185
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:47,380
while I was imprisoned in the Lyu family's cellar.

186
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:50,020
They tortured me through and through.

187
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:54,420
I was like a living corpse.

188
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,380
Even so, I believed

189
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:59,100
that my best buddies would come and save me.

190
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,060
However,

191
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:01,620
they didn't.

192
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:03,340
I was so naive.

193
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:12,140
I was too naive!

194
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:15,060
Feng Baobao, when I saw you,

195
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:18,420
I understood that they didn't care about me at all!

196
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:20,700
This world is filled with malicious intent!

197
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:21,820
This body of yours

198
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,660
houses the power of the Eight Supremes.

199
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:26,180
Only I deserve to possess it!

200
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:32,500
You have no idea

201
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,460
about the true power of the Eight Supremes.

202
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:35,940
Once I get my hands on it,

203
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,980
I will be invincible!

204
00:13:57,780 --> 00:13:59,260
Duanmu Ying, what are you doing?

205
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:18,740
Duanmu Ying,

206
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:19,980
what are you doing?

207
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:24,980
How can I implant my memories into her mind

208
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:26,580
without extracting hers in the first place?

209
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:28,100
Grandson of Dummy,

210
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,940
I'll show you!

211
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,100
Duanmu Ying,

212
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,140
stop!

213
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,540
(The qi barrier reflects my attack.)

214
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:15,900
You better

215
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:16,940
stop right now!

216
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:27,700
This qi formation is formed
with the power of the Eight Supremes.

217
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:30,580
Even Zhang Zhiwei couldn't dispel it!

218
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:35,700
(Zhang Chulan,)

219
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,140
(from today onward,)

220
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:38,580
(you're my slave.)

221
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:39,660
(Zhang Chulan,)

222
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,060
(you should follow me back.)

223
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:42,420
(Follow me.)

224
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:44,700
(I'll make you happy.)

225
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,780
(Doesn't it hurt when you hit yourself like that?)

226
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:48,260
(Tell me then.)

227
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:49,500
(What should I do?)

228
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,540
(You shouldn't hit yourself.)

229
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:53,580
(You should find those who hurt you)

230
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:54,700
(and hit them instead.)

231
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:57,180
(Zhang Chulan, there's no need to fear him.)

232
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:58,780
(Once you become my slave,)

233
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:00,300
(there's no need to hide)

234
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:01,780
(or escape.)

235
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,540
If you don't want to live like a loser,

236
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:05,220
you should stand up.

237
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:08,140
From now on, live like a decent human being.

238
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:10,860
(Crush all those who trouble you.)

239
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,260
(I've got your back.)

240
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:22,340
(Zhang Chulan, from today onward,)

241
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:24,540
you're my slave.

242
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:25,460
Okay, Ms. Bao.

243
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:26,380
From today onward, I, Zhang Chulan,

244
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,820
will be your slave.

245
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:30,940
Please don't treat me like a decent human.

246
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:33,300
Come. Light up the path ahead for your master.

247
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:35,540
(Roger that,)

248
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:36,580
(Master.)

249
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:39,500
Ms. Bao,

250
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:39,980
I know my fault now!

251
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:41,060
Ms. Bao!

252
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:41,940
Please don't kill me!

253
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:43,500
Ms. Bao!

254
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:45,740
Come back.

255
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:47,740
I also know that I might be battered up

256
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:51,980
if I keep this up.

257
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:54,060
However, if I don't keep this up,

258
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,740
I'll lose all of my dignity here.

259
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:00,220
(Feng Baobao,)

260
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:02,500
(this master-servant game is over.)

261
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:03,540
I told you

262
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:04,300
to come back!

263
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,980
I messed up.

264
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:14,820
Sorry, Zhang Chulan.

265
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:16,300
I apologize.

266
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:22,100
Ms. Bao,

267
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,620
why didn't you duck?

268
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:25,540
You told me to stand here.

269
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:28,620
Ms. Bao, wake up!

270
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:29,340
(I'll never run away again.)

271
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:31,300
From now on, I'll be your slave
without any complaints!

272
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:47,260
Baobao!

273
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:48,780
Baobao, what's wrong with you?

274
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:50,380
I don't know either.

275
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:53,300
Zhang Chulan,

276
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:55,620
I want to go home too.

277
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:56,780
(You have it.)

278
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:58,980
All of you have it.

279
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:00,460
It's inside here.

280
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:05,340
(Ms. Bao,)

281
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,940
(I will find the truth for you.)

282
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:11,060
(I will help you find the place that you belong to.)

283
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:33,620
(Feng Baobao,)

284
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:37,300
(I have one favor)

285
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,140
(to ask of you.)

286
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,060
(Can you please protect Zhang Chulan)

287
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:46,140
(on my behalf after my passing?)

288
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:47,100
Can you?

289
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:48,860
Yes, I can.

290
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:53,620
(He's only ten years old.)

291
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:54,980
Don't tell me

292
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:56,940
you're going to look after him

293
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,540
and wait for him until the end of time?

294
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:04,020
His grandfather is right.

295
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:05,980
I have plenty of time.

296
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:07,860
I can afford to wait for him.

297
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:09,100
(Feng Baobao,)

298
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:11,260
(if it's possible,)

299
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:13,340
(it's best not to let him
know about your existence.)

300
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:15,820
Stop moving! If not, I'll beat you up!

301
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:33,620
[Zhang Chulan, 4-10 Years Old]

302
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:54,580
[Zhang Chulan, 11-12 Years Old]

303
00:20:54,580 --> 00:21:00,700
[Zhang Chulan, 13-20 Years Old]

304
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:09,340
[Zhang Chulan, 21 Years Old]

305
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:13,060
[Zhang Chulan, 22 Years Old]

306
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,220
So...

307
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:31,540
So, you were by my side all along.

308
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,540
You were always there with me.

309
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:57,700
No!

310
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:11,980
Ms. Bao...

311
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:32,220
I'm sorry.

312
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:11,820
(What do you think)

313
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:12,500
(about Zhang Chulan?)

314
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,740
(All humans are the same.)

315
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:14,700
(Zhang Chulan.)

316
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,060
(The innocent carries the guilt of the guilty.)

317
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:16,940
(Zhang Chulan,)

318
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:17,700
(you shouldn't stand up again.)

319
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,540
(Zhang Chulan is a rising star.)

320
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:21,380
(How do you plan to pursue luck)

321
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:22,140
(and avoid danger?)

322
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:23,300
(The Tao follows nature.)

323
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,980
(What course should you follow?)

324
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:42,380
(Chulan,)

325
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:44,100
(you must hang in there)

326
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,100
(no matter what obstacles you face.)

327
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:45,900
(Don't give up.)

328
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:48,820
(To cultivators like us...)

329
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:50,780
(thought may be important,)

330
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:51,540
(but action is even more important.)

331
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:53,060
(We live)

332
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:54,620
(not necessarily to please others.)

333
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:55,060
(Only those)

334
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,420
(with pure hearts)

335
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:58,220
(who intend to protect all Outsiders)

336
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:01,140
(with everything they have will be acknowledged.)

337
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,140
(Zhang Chulan, you shameless brat!)

338
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:05,860
(When you absorb the power of the world)

339
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:07,260
(into your own body)

340
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:08,700
(and return it to the world generously)

341
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:11,180
(using your own way,)

342
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:13,380
(that's the definition of superpower.)

343
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:15,220
(Many people pursue their own interests)

344
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:15,900
(by hook or by crook.)

345
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:17,380
(If so, I'll stop them.)

346
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:18,780
(There are so many crooks out there.)

347
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:19,900
(How can you stop them all?)

348
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:23,460
(If so, I'll risk my life to stop them.)

349
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:32,660
(Am I truly going to die)

350
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:34,980
(and become a part of the starry universe?)

351
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,820
(But I think I can still hear everyone's voices.)

352
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:44,740
(Zhang Chulan.)

353
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:47,100
(Just like the universe and the stars,)

354
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:49,340
(I was already one with everyone long ago.)

355
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:51,620
(I had no way of letting you guys go long ago.)

356
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:32,060
Qi Apotheosis?

357
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:34,580
I'm just a nobody.

358
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:37,980
I can't protect the entire world.

359
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:39,140
I just wish to protect

360
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:41,460
the person I wish to protect.

361
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:46,540
Karma,

362
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:47,740
fate,

363
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:48,540
all of you think

364
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:51,620
that you can enjoy all the best things in life.

365
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:53,140
I don't believe it!

366
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:17,900
I've already lost Huan.

367
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:19,660
You can't afford to lose Feng Baobao now.

368
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:24,340
I just want the person in front of me.

369
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:25,740
That's my only desire!

370
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:53,300
(In the beginning, too profound;)

371
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:54,940
