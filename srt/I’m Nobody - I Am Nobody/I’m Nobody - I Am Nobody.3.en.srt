13
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:48,340
When I was a novice here,

14
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:49,900
I remember that we had to secretly import

15
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:51,620
advanced machines from overseas.

16
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:54,540
After years of R&D practice,

17
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:56,100
we're capable

18
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,860
of producing our own facilities now.

19
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:02,180
Back then, we had to learn from other countries.

20
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:04,300
But after years of endeavor,

21
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:05,060
many countries

22
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:06,980
have started to learn from us.

23
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:09,580
We stand on the shoulder of the giants,
that's our culture.

41
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:01,780
So, what is your research all about?

42
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:03,860
They are many topics

43
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,340
like the universe,

44
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:06,500

47
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:10,380
However, there's only one core research.

48
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:11,540
That is

but your grandfather was an Outsider too.

57
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:27,860
Outsiders are humans too.

58

We don't have misshapen body features.

59
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,700
You have come across many Outsiders
more than you thought

60
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,300
because you can't identify them.

61
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,940
The standard we use to identify an Outsider

62
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,660
is to see whether the person

63
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:40,620
can employ a kind of energy that commoners can't.

64
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:41,660
This energy,

65
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:43,380
according to the ancient people, it's called

66
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:44,180
qi.

67
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,180
This unique energy

68
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:50,180
can transform into abilities beyond commoners,

69
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:52,140
which's known as the "superpower".

70
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,580
We're researching the origin of qi.

71
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,740
Have you found the answer yet?

The Universe

74
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,220
is made of the Observable Universe

75
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:10,540
and Dark Universe.

76
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:13,180
We live in the Observable Universe,

77
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:14,900

78
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,220

79
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:16,820
while the remaining

80
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:18,780
eighty-five percent is Dark Universe.

81
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,020
(It's formed by dark matter.)

82
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:23,220
(Dark matter is universal energy)

83
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,900
(that's still oblivious to human science.)

84
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:29,620
However, our research has led us to realize

85
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:31,980
that between the Observable Universe
and Dark Universe,

86
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:34,100
there's an interaction of matters

87
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:35,860
in the form of energy.

88
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:36,940
And this energy

89
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:38,420
is the dark energy.

90
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:40,860
In fact, this energy

91
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:43,060
can be traced far back in our ancient culture,

92
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,340

00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:30,300
But there's always a spot in Mount Longhu

568
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:32,420
for him.

569
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,140
Certainly.

570
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:40,500
Our master had taken in so many disciples.

571
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,660
The three of us are tight with each other.

572
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,700
Hadn't he caused that trouble

573
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:48,820
and put me through this,

574
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:50,900
it would've been so wonderful

575
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,700
for the three of us to stay here together

576
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:54,540
till now.

577
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:58,260
I'll drink this to you.

578

You're in delicate health,

579
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:04,740
but you never forgot what Master had taught us.

580
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:06,660
You didn't take your life.

581
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:09,180
Both of us have turned a hundred
in the blink of an eye.

582
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:12,460
This is our blessing.

Congratulations.

586
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:40,820
I only found out today

587
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:42,420

588
00:27:57,660 --> 00:28:00,460
I really wish he was here with us.

under the alias Zhang Xilin.

592
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:18,340
In the end, he only had one grandson left.

593

His name is

Oh my, Lingyu.

597
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:33,460

601

and responds to us.

602
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:40,940
I'm very worried about them.

603

608

Jeez, how can you say that?

609
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:56,140
How can I do that to you?

610
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:58,380
We're all direct disciples of Master,

611
00:28:58,380 --> 00:28:59,100

620
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:15,460
I want you to have it.

621
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:16,700
Don't be afraid.

622

Too much seriousness.

It's fine if you don't understand.

and see if he's qualified.

To inherit Tianshidu.

00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:12,500

when there are so many
intelligent machines working?

Who are you?

00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:32,020
Zhang Xilin is your grandfather, right?

649
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:33,740
I'll get straight to the point.

650
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:34,900
Do you master the Qi Apotheosis?

651
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:38,140
I'll go straight to the point too.

652
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:39,100
No.

653
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:41,820
Didn't he teach you this?

00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:45,940
Why would the Sinister Pleasure seize me

657
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:47,780
if I know this?

658
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:49,540
Besides, I'm sure that my grandfather couldn't do

659
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:51,500
that ruddy Qi Apotheosis or whatsoever.

660
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:52,780

Your grandfather was a great one.

665
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:58,260
More than a decade ago,

666
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:00,700
a serious murder case
happened in Mount Siguniang.

667
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:03,380
More than ten dead bodies of elite Outsiders

668

were found there.

669

And the murderer...

00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:06,580
Stop.

00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:08,900
I've heard this before.

00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:09,900
You mean to tell me

673
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:11,660
that my grandfather was the murderer, right?

674
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:16,420
I've been investigating this case
for the past ten years,

675
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:19,220
and I was only told yesterday that he did it,

676
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:20,100
Zhang Xilin.

677
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:22,740
Every one of you claims

678
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:24,580
that my grandfather is the murderer.

679
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:26,180
Where's your evidence?

680
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:27,380
The murder case occurred

681
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:28,740
in Bailu.

682
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:29,900

right?

685
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:36,700
As you said,

686
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:38,780
it happened in Mount Siguniang in Lunan.

687
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:40,980
But my grandfather passed away at home
in Lubei.

688
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:43,060
Thousands of li between these two places,
you know?

689
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:44,460
So my grandfather had nothing

690
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:46,140
to do with the murder case.

691
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:51,860
Take a look at this.

692
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:52,620

693
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:54,220

who had over ten deaths on him.

701

You were always on the run

702
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:10,500

On my master's command,

756
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:07,220
we'll take Zhang Chulan with us.

757
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:13,500
Get in our way?

758
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:15,460
First come, first serve, you know?

759
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:17,660
Why?

760
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:18,540
Am I wrong?

761
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:20,180
They're not some ordinary Outsiders.

762
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:22,380
It's getting trickier.

763
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:26,980
Three Taoists

764
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:27,980
in late at night?

765
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:29,660
Are you doing some cosplay thing?

766
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:31,220
Let me tell you.

767
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:32,660
I'm

768
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:34,780
just an ordinary college student.

769
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:35,780
I have lectures tomorrow.

770
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:36,820
Bye, then.

771
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:37,940
Martial Uncle.

772
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:44,460
Don't waste your effort

773
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:45,740
on this fellow.

774
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:47,020
Yexing and I will test him

775
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:48,100
on what he has got.

776
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:51,140
No.

777
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:52,020
I give up.

778
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:56,500
Seriously?

779
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:04,100
You master Qi Apotheosis, don't you?

780
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:05,300
Fight back, come on.

781
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:06,020
I...

782
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:22,940
Martial Uncle.

783
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:23,700
Should we...

784
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:28,020
Continue.

785
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:52,060
Martial Uncle.

786
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:53,420
Give him a break.

787
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:54,220
Look at this guy.

788
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:55,420
He's just weak.

789
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:56,900
You're one to talk, huh?

790
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:59,020
What are you

791
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:00,060
to hit a weak guy?

792
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:01,940
Jiyun, Yexing.

793
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:03,780
Step back.

794
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:04,820
Martial Uncle.

795
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:05,900
This fellow simply can't...

796
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:06,980
I said, step back.

797
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:16,660
What

798
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:17,460
are you up to?

799
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:21,580
I can't see why

800
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:23,300
Master chose you.

801
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:28,500
You should've told me so.

802
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:30,100
Did your master have an interest in me?

803
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:31,100
How old is he?

804
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:32,300
What's his name?

805
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:33,020
I'll visit him

806
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:34,340
some other day.

807
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:35,420
Zhang Chulan.

808
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:36,020
Shut your trap.

809
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:37,580
[Gold Brilliance Spell]

810
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:51,020
What is Father trying to do?

811
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:53,300
He cares so much about Zhang Chulan,

812
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:54,380
but why?

813
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:55,940
He's never interested

814
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,820
in recruitment.

815
00:37:57,820 --> 00:37:59,860
Yet now, he's taking care of Zhang Chulan himself.

816
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:01,300
Is he

817
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:02,660
after the Qi Apotheosis too?

818
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:05,780
Partly of it.

819
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:07,340
But I think he values

820
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:09,140
the connection behind Zhang Chulan more.

821
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:10,980
Hear this.

822
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:13,260
I've looked into Zhang Xilin thoroughly.

823
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:15,620
Zhang Xilin is a fake identity.

824
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:18,380
He'd been trying to hide his past.

825
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:20,500
Also, Zhang Chulan isn't as innocent as he looks.

826
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:21,940
He wouldn't tell anyone

827
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:23,580
about the martial skills
his grandfather taught him.

828
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:24,740
But I found something

829
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:26,380
on the thralls

830
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:27,780
he took down.

831
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:30,220
The martial skills Zhang Xilin taught him

832
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:32,860
is the secretive art
of the Celestial Taoist Mansion in Mount Longhu,

833
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:34,220
Gold Brilliance Spell.

834
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:39,180
By any chance, Zhang Xilin...

835
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:41,980
He must have something to do with Mount Longhu.

836
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:43,100
You know them well.

837
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:44,540
Riff-raff from Sinister Pleasure

838
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:45,420
spread words

839
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:47,740
that Zhang Chula is the inheritor
of the Qi Apotheosis.

840
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:50,780
As a result, many greedy eyes are on Zhang Chulan.

841
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:51,940
Obviously, many Outsiders

842
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:54,100
seek to ensnare him.

843
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:54,740
As far as I'm concerned,

844
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:56,540
someone has already made their move,

845
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:57,740
(Celestial Taoist Mansion)

846
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:59,180
(and The All-Encompassing Guild.)

847
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:06,380
Both of us can do this.

848
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:08,060
Let's not get into the fight, dude.

849
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:09,460
Scratch that.

850
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:11,500
My grandfather taught me this when I was little.

851
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:12,820
We must be connected in some way.

852
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:14,060
Look at this.

853
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:24,780
Who on earth are you?

854
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:27,220
How do you know the Gold Brilliance Spell
of Mount Longhu?

855
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:33,340
I see, it's called Gold Brilliance Spell.

856
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:34,180
Also,

857
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:35,620
who is your grandfather?

858
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:37,020
Both of you

859
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:38,220
should go to Mount Longhu
and beg for forgiveness.

860
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:41,700
Dude.

861
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:44,020
Beg for forgiveness? That sounds harsh.

862
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:46,420
Gold Brilliance Spell is off-limits
to the public.

863
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:48,740
No matter who your grandfather is,

864
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:50,180
he's a traitor to Mount Longhu.

865
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:52,860
That explains

866
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:54,780
why you're such a twerp.

867
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:57,500
He must be one as well.

868
00:39:58,380 --> 00:39:59,580
Vileness does run in your blood.

869
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:03,460
My grandfather isn't a traitor.

870
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:06,700
Take your nonsense elsewhere.

871
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:17,740
Martial Uncle.

872
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:19,100
That's too hard on him.

873
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:21,060
