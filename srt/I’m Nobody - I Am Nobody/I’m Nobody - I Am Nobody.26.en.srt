00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:50,980
(the injuries they sustained
in Ganbei grassland)

13
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:52,100
by now.

14
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,500
Why didn't they join us for dinner?

15
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,060
Mr. Xia,

16
00:00:58,700 --> 00:00:59,900
are you free to speak?

17
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:02,700
We booked a room

18
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,660
because we wanted to eat in peace.

19
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:06,500
Lyu Liang,

20
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,660
since when you have become this detestable?

21
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:10,660
Leave.

22
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:17,660
I told you to leave. Didn't you hear me?

23
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:33,740
(What is Lyu Liang doing here?)

24
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:39,340
Seems like

25
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:41,780
I have no choice but to speak with you now.

26
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:43,780
Am I right?

27
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:10,540
Mr. Xia,

28
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:12,060
please clean the table.

29
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,580
We can have a nice chat after this.

30
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:16,700
Yes, sir.

31
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:19,060
Erzhuang, did you see that?

32
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,500
That's not the Lyu family's Soul Whisperer.

33
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,140
What was that?

34
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:24,380
(I'm not sure either.)

35
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:25,980
(We have to observe them before making a move.)

36
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:28,340
This is more like it.

37
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:30,980
We can only work toward the same goal

38
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:34,340
when we're united.

39
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,820
I've implanted the memory related to that woman

40
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:41,540
into your brain.

41
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,740
I only have one request.

42
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:48,580
Find that person

43
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,300
at

44
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,580
all costs.

45
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:55,340
Yes, sir!

46
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,740
(You must be careful when you go inside.)

47
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,420
Don't worry.

48
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,340
(Liang, wait for me!)

49
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:21,300
(Come after me!)

50
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:23,540
(I'm number one!)

51
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:25,100
(You cheated!)

52
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,540
These are what we have left.

53
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:37,700
You should take them.

54
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,660
It's only been a few days since we last met.

55
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:02,860
What's with the grand display?

56
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:05,580
Who are you?

57
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:09,380
So, you deleted your own memories as well?

58
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,100
Who gave that to you?

59
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:19,260
You.

60
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,140
Unlock your memory

61
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:22,580
and tell me the truth.

62
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,940
I gave you two pieces.

63
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:49,740
Where's the other one?

64
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:51,580
Lyu Liang,

65
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:52,700
you weren't using

66
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,540
the Lyu family's Soul Whisperer just now.

67
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:55,220
What was that?

68
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,220
You're still as shameless as always,

69
00:04:59,220 --> 00:04:59,860
Zhang Chulan.

70
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:02,100
Why don't you check this out first?

71
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:11,260
(No,)

72
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:12,100
(you mustn't go back.)

73
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,700
(We mustn't let Master know about this.)

74
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,060
(What have you learned)

75
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,540
(for you to say something like that?)

76
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:20,860
(Dummy.)

77
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:21,700
(Let's go.)

78
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:22,540
(We're running out of time.)

79
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:23,340
(Coming.)

80
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,420
One of them is my grandfather.

81
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:32,140
Who's the other person?

82
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:33,620
Duanmu Ying.

83
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:35,340
Just like your grandfather,

84
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:37,220
she is one of the 36 Thieves.

85
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:39,060
She is one of the creators of the Eight Supremes.

86
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:40,660
Her supreme

87
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:41,860
is called Double Quan Palm.

88
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:44,340
You asked me what I used just now, right?

89
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,540
I was using Double Quan Palm.

90
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,460
Soul Whisperer

91
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,900
is just a small part of Double Quan Palm.

92
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:53,860
Now, I wield one of the Eight Supremes too.

93
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:05,420
So, why are you looking for her?

94
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,020
I want to clarify something with her,

95
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:08,660
and I'll kill her after that.

96
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,180
Is she still alive?

97
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:20,340
Soul Whisperer.

98
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,780
Double Quan Palm.

99
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:27,980
Soul Whisperer.

100
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,100
Double Quan Palm.

101
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:33,460
Soul Whisperer?

102
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:38,980
Ms. Bao!

103
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:42,020
What's wrong?

104
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,140
Why are you so agitated?

105
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,580
Ms. Bao, don't you understand?

106
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,060
Soul Whisperer is Double Quan Palm!

107
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:47,100
What's the specialty of Soul Whisperer?

108
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,580
It can manipulate memories!

109
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:50,540
You were born out of nowhere

110
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:51,300
after the Jiashen Calamity.

111
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,020
You don't remember anything after you were born.

112
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:54,020
Have you ever suspected

113
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:55,420
that someone tampered with your memories?

114
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:56,340
Among the Eight Supremes,

115
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:57,580
Double Quan Palm is the only supreme

116
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:58,340
that can affect memories.

117
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:59,500
The wielder is called Duanmu Ying.

118
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:00,900
Memories?

119
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,580
I'm sure Duanmu Ying

120
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:03,660
knows your identity and background.

121
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:05,060
We have to locate her

122
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:05,780
before Lyu Liang.

123
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,260
How can we find her?

124
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:08,540
Erzhuang!

125
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,500
Erzhuang isn't replying to me.

126
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,220
Xu San.

127
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:21,950
[NDT]

128
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:34,620
Erzhuang is an entity

129
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,260
under the highest level of confidentiality
in the company.

130
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:38,100
Not only did you two steal my glasses,

131
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:39,500
but you're also making me
solve a troublesome issue for you?

132
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:40,660
San,

133
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,060
this concerns Ms. Bao's memories.

134
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,140
And the Xu family has been guarding over her

135
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:43,980
for two generations.

136
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:44,820
This time, we can finally

137
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:45,780
find out Ms. Bao's background.

138
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:46,900
What's stopping you here?

139
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,100
Chulan, you don't need to provoke me.

140
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:49,180
I know.

141
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,020
You want to locate Duanmu Ying

142
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:52,020
through Erzhuang,

143
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:52,860
am I right?

144
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:53,540
That's right.

145
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,380
And Lyu Liang is looking for Duanmu Ying as well.

146
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:56,940
That's why we need to locate Duanmu Ying

147
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:57,620
before him.

148
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,180
Chulan, you should think twice.

149
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:02,820
The person you're looking for

150
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,660
is one of the wielders of the Eight Supremes.

151
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:06,180
Even the Sinister Pleasure and Ten Elders

152
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:07,300
couldn't do anything about her.

153
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:11,260
San,

154
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,900
we're not here to negotiate a deal.

155
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,460
If you don't help us out,

156
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:15,740
we'll come up with a way ourselves.

157
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:16,620
You!

158
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:19,140
Xiang would definitely help me out

159
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:20,420
if he were still around.

160
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:32,460
Fine.

161
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:33,700
I'll bring you two to Erzhuang.

162
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,140
However, I don't know

163
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:36,180
if she's willing to help you two or not.

164
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,580
(Erzhuang is in the research lab.)

165
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:48,340
(You guys can go to her directly.)

166
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,300
Ms. Bao, Zhang Chulan,

167
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,380
hello.

168
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:06,580
We finally meet again.

169
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:09,940
This is me,

170
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:10,900
Erzhuang.

171
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:18,540
Don't feel sorry for me.

172
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,100
I'm already used to it.

173
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,580
What do you wish to ask?

174
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,660
How did you end up like this?

175
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:27,060
Something happened to me

176
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:28,020
some time ago.

177
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,380
I ended up like this.

178
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:33,740
My father utilized all of his resources

179
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,180
to create this machine.

180
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:37,180
Therefore, I managed to survive.

181
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:39,380
As repayment,

182
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:40,740
I have to help NDT

183
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,740
to manage their system and data.

184
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:44,020
Anyway,

185
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:46,420
I was able to stay alive.

186
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,340
However, I'm living in a different way

187
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:49,980
from you guys.

188
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:51,500
What about you?

189
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,140
Do you wish to live like this?

190
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:56,500
I thought it was fun when I was young.

191
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,660
I gradually realized

192
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:59,100
that

193
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,620
although there was nothing and no one
I couldn't find

194
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:02,620
in the world,

195
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:03,620
I could only

196
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:05,260
stay trapped in this dark room.

197
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:06,620
I couldn't go anywhere.

198
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:09,380
(Delicious food, fun games,)

199
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,260
(interesting people,)

200
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,140
they have nothing to do with me at all.

201
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:15,500
My father taught me the Out-of-Body Technique

202
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,460
as he was afraid that I might be bored.

203
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,380
I could leave my body
by transforming my consciousness

204
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:20,740
into electromagnetic waves.

205
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:22,980
That's the reason you see me everywhere.

206
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:26,540
Did you guys know?

207
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:28,380
I watched a lot of your videos

208
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:30,460
during the Outsider Martial Arts Contest.

209
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:31,540
I wanted to join the contest with you guys

210
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:33,020
in Mount Longhu so badly.

211
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:35,500
But I knew

212
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:36,900
that it was just my wishful thinking.

213
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:39,860
In the end, I'm just a cripple.

214
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,540
I can't even get dressed or eat by myself.

215
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:45,540
It's fine.

216
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,660
I'll bring you to
the Outsider Martial Arts Contest

217
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:48,500
next time.

218
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:49,780
You don't even need to fight.

219
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,780
I'll bury all of your opponents for you.

220
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:52,860
You'll definitely be the champion.

221
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:54,620
Am I right, Zhang Chulan?

222
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:58,380
That's right.

223
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:00,540
Thank you guys so much.

224
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:01,380
Erzhuang...

225
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:02,340
I know.

226
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:04,220
You guys still want to know about Duanmu Ying.

227
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,020
I can tell you guys everything
about her right now.

228
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,860
Duanmu Ying's Double Quan Palm

229
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,140
has two effects.

230
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:12,260
(First, it can alter one's memories and cognition.)

231
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:15,340
(Second, it can alter one's body.)

232
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,540
(It can even regrow limbs.)

233
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:21,100
My father has been looking for clues
related to Double Quan Palm

234
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,620
ever since I got into an accident.

235
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:24,860
He hoped that he could restore my body

236
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,220
with the Double Quan Palm.

237
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:28,860
That's when he found out
the Lyu family's Soul Whisperer.

238
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:31,020
However, it wasn't a complete version
of Double Quan Palm.

239
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:34,020
It can only extract and replicate memories.

240
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,380
It cannot restore our bodies.

241
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:38,500
(The complete Double Quan Palm)

242
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,900
(is more comprehensive.)

243
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,260
(One palm can restore our bodies)

244
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:43,860
(while the other can manipulate our memories.)

245
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:46,020
(Not only can it extract and replicate memories,)

246
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:47,540
(but it can also delete them.)

247
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,860
After that, my father received
a report from someone.

248
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:53,260
(He found out that Duanmu Ying
was imprisoned in the Lyu family.)

249
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:56,380
He came up with a way to save her

250
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:57,660
and brought her back to the company.

251
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:00,020
Since you guys have already found Duanmu Ying,

252
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,740
why are you still in this state?

253
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,740
It's complicated.

254
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:05,540
I don't know

255
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:07,220
the exact reason either.

256
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:08,340
I hope you guys

257
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:09,740
can reveal the truth behind everything.

258
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,380
I would've joined you guys in the investigation

259
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:14,020
if it weren't for my disability.

260
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:16,460
Go now.

261
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:17,620
We'll definitely meet again

262
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:18,740
in the future if there's a chance.

263
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:20,140
Yeah.

264
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:51,100
Erzhuang sent us the address.

265
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,140
It's a property under the company's name.

266
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:53,940
I'm sure there are security guards there.

267
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,260
What should we do then?

268
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:56,900
We have to get help.

269
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:58,980
What about San and Si?

270
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,620
This case has drastic implications.

271
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,220
We mustn't implicate them.

272
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,500
Why aren't they here yet?

273
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:21,660
I'm done waiting.

274
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:23,220
Ms. Bao, wait just a little longer.

275
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,380
This is the company's territory after all.

276
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:25,100
It's dangerous.

277
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:27,100
Our help will be here soon.

278
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,020
What's going on?

279
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:42,620
Where is he?

280
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:44,220
Chulan!

281
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:45,940
Ms. Bao!

282
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:47,260
Chulan!

283
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:48,780
He's over there.

284
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:52,220
Chulan, Ms. Bao,

285
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:52,980
long time no see.

286
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:55,060
Chulan.

287
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:55,940
What are you doing?

288
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:56,540
Don't be shy.

289
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:59,260
Turn off the sound system and go there!

290
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:01,180
No problem.

291
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:02,740
You should've told us earlier.

292
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:03,700
I told you three

293
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,460
to keep a low profile.

294
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:06,900
What's with the getup?

295
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:09,220
It depends on the occasion, you know?

296
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:10,900
We mustn't embarrass Ms. Bao.

297
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,860
Is this your so-called "help"?

298
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,380
Get your equipment and follow my order!

299
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,260
There are plenty of people inside.

300
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:42,740
I'm sure there's an ambush.

301
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:44,500
It sounds like all of them are experts.

302
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,140
I hear blunt weapons hitting the ground.

303
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:48,060
Seems like everyone is armed.

304
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:49,100
Someone is approaching the door.

305
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:49,780
Ms. Bao!

306
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:04,620
We'll cover your back.

307
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:05,940
You two should find a chance to escape.

308
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:10,380
Stop playing!

309
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:13,300
Time to watch our show!

310
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:14,740
Here I am!

311
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:15,980
Misters and madams,

312
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:19,260
the three of us came here today

313
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:21,300
to deliver warmth and wellness

314
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,300
to you guys.

315
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:24,900
What is this?

316
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,500
What are you guys doing?

317
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,780
Excuse me.

318
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:29,540
What are you guys doing?

319
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:30,580
No salesmen allowed.

320
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:31,700
We aren't salesmen.

321
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,740
We're here to deliver wellness and warmth.

322
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:35,220
We're here to deliver warmth.

323
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:36,860
Ms. Bao,

324
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:38,140
I've searched the rest of the area.

325
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,500
I couldn't find Duanmu Ying.

326
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:41,740
This is the only place we haven't searched.

327
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,820
Let's search it thoroughly.

328
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:09,860
Zhang Chulan.

329
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:20,140
That's her.

330
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:25,900
Old madam,

331
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,580
we aren't crooks.

332
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,260
My name is Zhang Chulan.

333
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:30,420
My grandfather is Zhang Huaiyi.

334
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:37,780
So, she has my memories?

335
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:40,580
I don't even know

336
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:42,900
if she has her own memories right now.

337
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,900
Didn't you notice that she's acting the same way

338
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,540
as the villagers did in the Lyu Village?

339
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:53,900
I understand now.

340
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,060
I understand why

341
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:56,140
Erzhuang's father sent her to a nursing home

342
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,500
instead of imprisoning her.

343
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,780
She has no qi at all.

344
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:05,220
No matter what,

345
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:06,620
we should bring her back first.

346
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,420
We'll think of what to do later.

347
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:13,940
Guys, it only costs 50 yuan.

348
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:15,380
Here's the QR code if you wish to make a payment.

349
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:17,460
Please take them!

350
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:30,940
Let us dance!

351
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:41,620
Let us do it.

352
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:42,500
Up!

353
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:46,860
Let's go.

354
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,100
Is this an unmanned vehicle?

355
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:55,740
The van is actually moving?

356
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:57,020
Did we call for help just now?

357
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,340
Does it look like it?

358
00:17:58,660 --> 00:17:59,860
Is the van that advanced?

359
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,260
Thanks, Zhang Chulan.

360
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:02,420
I'll treat you to a meal next time.

361
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:05,580
Who's that?

362
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:06,980
Mr. Zhang, did you bring your chauffeur here?

363
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:07,980
Amazing.

364
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:09,380
After him!

365
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:14,500
Ms. Bao,

366
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,420
we don't need to go after him.

367
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,540
My phone is in the van.

368
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:17,300
Erzhuang

369
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,140
can help us

370
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,020
to track down his real-time location.

371
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:26,500
[Lyu Family Mansion]

372
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,300
I'm addressing you as my elder.

373
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:30,540
You should stop pretending to be muddle-headed.

374
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,580
Take a good look.

375
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,860
You were imprisoned here for several decades.

376

Doesn't it feel familiar?

377
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:47,060
Where exactly is my sister?

378
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:54,700
Both you and I are wielders of Double Quan Palm.

379
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:56,780
I don't need to waste my breath with you.

380
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:22,220
This is my sister's memory.

381
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:22,980
Why do you have it?

382
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:26,980
Where did you keep Huan?

383
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:28,420
Tell me.

384
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,100
Is Huan dead or alive?

385
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:30,900
Tell me

386
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,300
and I'll set you free right now!

387
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:37,900
Lyu Liang,

388
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:39,180
by doing this,

389
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:40,060
you're acting just like your great-grandfather.

390
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:42,260
Zhang Chulan,

391
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,620
you better stay out of this.

392
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:47,740
This is

393
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:48,460
our private matter.

394
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,260
You spent so much effort

395
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:51,580
and took such a huge detour

396
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:52,700
just to find your sister, huh?

397
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:55,740
I'm so disappointed in you.

398
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,660
Do you still remember

399
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:00,620
the day your sister fell off the cliff?

400
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:04,700
(She never fell off the cliff in the first place.)

401
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,340
Duanmu Ying altered their memories

402
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:08,700
and framed me for her death.

403
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:11,300
However, I will never forget about that day.

404
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:15,810
It happened during the beginning of winter
eight years ago.

405
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:17,780
If so, did you know

406
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:19,700
how Duanmu Ying was able to leave the Lyu Village?

407
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,180
(I saw it in my great-grandfather's memories.)

408
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,700
Someone from the company took her away.

409
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,900
The company received an anonymous report

410
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:34,980
saying that Duanmu Ying was detained
in the Lyu Village

411
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:37,140
two days after your sister's death.

412
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:38,420
Who made the report?

413
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:40,140
I don't know either.

414
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:40,940
However,

415
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,780
I retrieved the voice recording
before I came here.

416
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:44,180
Listen.

417
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48,940

425

426

I need to tell him.

Is this you, Lyu Huan?

you told me just now,

I wasn't listening

449
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,180
as I had something on my mind just now.

450
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:39,180
Could you repeat it for me?

451
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:40,780
According to my brother, Lyu Liang,

452
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:42,460
if you get rid of Cola

453
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:45,020

454
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,540

455
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,900

457
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:56,020

00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,900

460
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:16,060

that your sister's remaining consciousness,

is inside her body?

475
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:05,300
So, to you,

00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:07,060
