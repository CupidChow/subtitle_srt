1
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:09,540
Now that Xu Xiang is dead,

2
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:12,220
the entire Outsiders' world is in chaos.

3
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:13,250
Chief Celestial Taoist,

4
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:15,620
now that Xu Xiang is dead,
Mount Longhu has lost its protection.

5
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:18,210
But the Outsider Martial Arts Contest
isn't over yet.

6
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:20,330
What if the villains

7
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:22,620
of the Sinister Pleasure

8
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:24,850
take the opportunity to sneak inside?

9
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:28,900
Don't worry.

10
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:31,780
Although Mr. Xu has met his demise,

11
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:33,650
the company

12
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:35,500
has already dispatched
a new person in charge here.

13
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:36,690
A new person in charge?

14
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:38,050
Sorry about that, guys.

15
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:38,900
I'm late.

16
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:42,050
Say,

17
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:43,900
NDT has run out of personnel, hasn't it?

18
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:45,050
They actually dispatched you two

19
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:46,500
to take over your father's job?

20
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:48,690
Your father fell for the Sinister Pleasure's trick

21
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:50,370
even though he was a veteran.

22
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:52,940
This responsibility is too heavy.

23
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:55,770
You two

24
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:57,050
can't afford to bear the responsibility.

25
00:00:57,050 --> 00:00:59,260
I know my brother and I

26
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:00,620
are way inferior to our father.

27
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:02,300
However, speaking of our strengths,

28
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:04,330
we still possess a tiny bit
sense of righteousness.

29
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:05,290
However, the world is too vast.

30
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:06,770
We can't watch over the entire world.

31
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:08,410
However, we will never slack off

32
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:10,570
as long as it's within our abilities.

33
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:13,180
My father worked for NDT for half of his life.

34
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:15,050
He encountered countless dangers.

35
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:17,100
Why was he able to persist for so long?

36
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:18,930
It's all because of his determination.

37
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:20,740
We're still young

38
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:21,660
and lacking in many aspects.

39
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:23,540
However, I can promise you guys this.

40
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:25,820
We won't allow any other accidents to happen

41
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:28,050
during the Outsider Martial Arts Contest.

42
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:31,660
Do you guys have any questions?

43
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:35,820
If so, I'll leave this to you two.

Chief Celestial Taoist,

53
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:14,130
I've brought them here.

54
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:17,850
Chulan,

55
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:19,730
pay your respects.

56
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:22,540
When it comes to seniority,

57
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:25,380
this man is considered your grandmaster as well.

58
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:26,940
This is Tian Jinzhong.

59
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:28,890
Back then, me,

60
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:31,290
Jinzhong,

61
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:32,980
and your grandfather, Huaiyi,

62
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,690
were best friends on Mount Longhu.

63
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,220
Grandmaster Tian.

64
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:39,570
I have to kowtow to you then.

65
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:42,820
It's my first time being this close
to such an embarrassing act.

66
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:44,690
I think I know what a boot-licker means now.

67
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:50,980
This must be Mr. Lu Jin.

68
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:52,660
I have to kowtow to you too.

69
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:53,450
No need.

70
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:54,010
Spare the formalities.

71
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:56,170
I don't deserve it.

72
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:57,450
Don't say that, Mr. Lu.

73
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:59,010
Of course, you deserve it.

74
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:00,780
The Outsider Martial Arts Contest
wouldn't be this exciting

75
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:03,500
if you didn't take out
the Infinite Heavenly Talisman.

76
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:07,010
Zhang, Tian.

77
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:08,410
This brat is mocking me.

78
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,260
He's pretty daring.

79
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,100
Of course.

80
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,730
I'm his grandmaster, after all.

81
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:16,130
Fine then.

82
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:18,980
I guess I landed you in trouble.

83
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:20,260
Now, I owe you a favor.

84
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:22,940
I'll promise you one thing.

85
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:25,100
I'll fulfill your request

86
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:27,060
as long as it's not harmful or immoral.

87
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,130
Thank you, Mr. Lu.

88
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:32,260
By the way,

89
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:34,820
who is this?

90
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:38,260
She's my colleague in NDT.

91
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,340
She's a contestant as well.

92
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:00,130
Lu.

93
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:02,010
Let's get straight to business.

94
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:02,660
Alright.

95
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:04,380
We interrogated Yu Huadu.

96
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:05,570
We found out that Hu Jie

97
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:07,660
was the puppet of the Four Crazies.

98
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:09,130
The Sinister Pleasure manipulated

99
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:11,260
Yu Huadu's hatred for Xu Xiang

100
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:12,610
and used him

101
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:13,940
to kill Xu Xiang.

102
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:16,930
However, Yu Huadu

103
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:19,250
has no idea about what the Sinister Pleasure

104
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:20,490
is planning.

105
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:22,140
In your opinion,

106
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:24,490
why did the Sinister Pleasure

107
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:25,460
make their appearances here?

108
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:27,610
They certainly wanted to obtain
your Infinite Heavenly Talisman.

109
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:29,540
That is surely one of their targets.

110
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:31,700
I'm talking about the main target

111
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,170
besides that.

112
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:37,170
Don't tell me you're saying

113
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:38,930
that they're targeting me.

114
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,340
No matter if it's you
or the Infinite Heavenly Talisman,

115
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:44,100
both you and the item will act as bait.

116
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,340
As long as sorcerers
of the Sinister Pleasure take the bait,

117
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:47,930
we'll capture all of them

118
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:49,460
on Mount Longhu.

119
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:51,930
Chulan,

120
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:54,490
you've met both of your elders.

121
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:56,610
Don't worry.

122
00:04:57,410 --> 00:04:59,050
The contest will resume.

123
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:01,290
You should head back and rest.

124
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:02,730
Baobao.

125
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:08,850
Chulan,

126
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:10,370
you may speak.

127
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:13,290
Grandmaster,

128
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:14,850
Lyu Ci told me

129
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:17,050
that my grandpa colluded
with sorcerers of the Sinister Pleasure.

130
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:18,050
Is that true?

131
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:20,700
Grandmaster, I know

132
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,410
that you're only willing to tell me about it

133
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:23,340
after I win the Outsider Martial Arts Contest.

134
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,050
But this incident is too...

135
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:33,220
Zhang,

136
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:36,490
look at how desperate you're making him.

137
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:38,850
I don't know why you're hiding

138
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:41,290
that stupid incident from him.

139
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:44,100
I'm not from the Celestial Taoist Mansion.

140
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,050
So I don't need to obey your sect rules.

141
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:47,980
I'll tell him if you don't want to.

142
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:51,610
You guys, leave the room.

143
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:53,490
Leave now.

144
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:06,290
I didn't intervene

145
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:07,930
in the incident back then.

146
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:09,340
I don't know about the details.

147
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,580
However, regarding the incident
with your grandfather,

148
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:15,460
it was true.

149
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,340
Your grandfather did collude

150
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:20,100
with sorcerers of the Sinister Pleasure.

151
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,170
It's more than just collusion.

152
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:24,020
They even became sworn brothers.

153
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:26,580
Of course, your grandfather
wasn't the only member to do so.

154
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:29,540
Back then, there were members
from other righteous sects

155
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:31,810
who took part in the ceremony.

156
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:39,100
Lian's grandfather was truly a bold person, huh?

157
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:39,900
Everyone.

158
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:43,540
You guys are eavesdropping
on the grandmasters' conversation

159
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:44,610
under broad daylight.

160
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:48,610
Yu, Qing, shut up.

161
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:50,850
I'll give each of you
one sandalwood bracelet later.

162
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:02,580
Why is there no sound now?

163
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,220
Guys, don't fight back!

164
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:19,850
That's my grandpa's Infinite Heavenly Talisman!

165
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:21,780
Grandpa, we are sorry!

166
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:24,020
Please let us off!

167
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:31,580
You don't need any altar

168
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:32,540
or utilize your qi, huh?

169
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:33,700
Lu,

170
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,810
you could cast it at will just now.

171
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:38,780
Have you mastered

172
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:40,930
the Infinite Heavenly Talisman?

173
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:42,370
Tian, you flatter me.

174
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:43,980
I haven't mastered it completely.

175
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:48,100
Chulan,

176
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:49,900
this is Infinite Heavenly Talisman,

177
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,250
a talisman created by my best friend,

178
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:54,020
Zheng Zibu from

179
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:55,220

(Feng Zhenghao.)

187
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,490
All of them were present at the ceremony.

188
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,220
A total of 36 individuals

189
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:11,700
joined the ceremony.

190
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:13,220
(People refer to them as)

191
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,250
(The 36 Thieves.)

192
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:15,420
[The 36 Thieves]

193
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:18,700
(Although the pact they made was discreet,)

194
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,700
(people still caught hold of the news.)

195
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:22,930
(All righteous sects)

196
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,980
found it tricky

197
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,490
when they saw their members

198
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:28,170
colluding with sorcerers.

199
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:29,930
Therefore,

200
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:30,780
they formed an alliance

201
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,100
(and issued a kill order)

202
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,610
(on The 36 Thieves.)

203
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:36,300
(They mentioned nothing
about the reasons and crimes)

204
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:37,610
(of the hunting.)

205
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:38,730
(They did it)

206
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:40,060
(in order to protect)

207
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:41,700
(their sects' reputation.)

208
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,650
(They hoped that all 36 of them)

209
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:45,820
(would vanish forever.)

210
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:48,850
Back then, I was the eldest son of the Lu family.

211
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:51,060
I knew what was going on.

212
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,850
However, as it involved many people,

213
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:57,250
I dared not help Zheng Zibu out.

214
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,250
They said I had never done anything bad.

215
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,490
Such nonsense.

216
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:06,730
Grandmaster,

217
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:11,100
if so, how did you treat my grandfather back then?

218
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:13,370
I wasn't the only one.

219
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:15,250
This guy was involved in the incident too.

220
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:17,420
Back then, only the two of us,
who were from Celestial Taoist Mansion,

221
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:19,100
left the mountain

222
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,220
and pursued your grandfather.

223
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:23,100
Grandmaster Tian,

224
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:24,300
what about you?

225
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:25,460
Idiot.

226
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:27,460
Don't overthink it.

227
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:31,460
I've let down many people in my life.

228
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:33,130
However,

229
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:34,580
I didn't let your grandfather down.

230
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:36,370
The collusion between
your grandfather, Zhang Huaiyi,

231
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:38,700
and the sorcerers of the Sinister Pleasure

232
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:41,100
did bring our sect

233
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:43,700
plenty of trouble.

234
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:46,060
I still remember

235
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:47,940
that sect leaders from other sects

236
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:49,100
kept putting pressure on my master.

237
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:51,420
He was the Chief Celestial Taoist back then.

238
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:52,770
His name is Zhang Jingqing.

239
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:55,180
[Year of Jiashen]
(However, your founding ancestor was known)

240
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:56,820
(for defending his disciples.)

241
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:59,530
(He ordered both of us to look for Huaiyi.)

242
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:02,060
[Zhang Qingjing, the 98th Chief Celestial Taoist]
(As long as we could bring Huaiyi back in secret,)

243
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:04,010
(he could punish him)

244
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:04,940
(according to the sect rules.)

245
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:06,180
(Other sects would have no way)

246
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,370
(to interfere)

247
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:09,530
(with the private affairs of our sect.)

248
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:11,340
Back then, Zhiwei and I

249
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:12,820
split up

250
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,180
to look for your grandfather,

251
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:15,340
Zhang Huaiyi.

252
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:18,180
However, we couldn't find him in the end.

253
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:20,340
Not only that, but I was also attacked

254
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:23,100
when I was looking for him.

255
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:26,980
Qing.

256
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,130
Yes, sir.

257
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:36,770
Second Grandmaster.

258
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:37,820
Lend me a hand.

259
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:42,010
Even now, I don't know who they are.

260
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,010
They interrogated me

261
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:45,220
to find out the whereabouts of Zhang Huaiyi.

262
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:46,940
I had no idea.

263
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:48,340
But they didn't believe me.

264
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:50,220
Thus,

265
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,530
they damaged my meridians

266
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:56,580
and chopped off my limbs.

267
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:00,530
Now,

268
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,980
I'm a useless cripple.

269
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:18,370
Grandmaster Tian,

270
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,460
so, you became like this
because of my grandfather.

271
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:24,850
Chulan,

272
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:26,820
I'm not telling you this

273
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,490
to complain about the hardships I endured.

274
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,580
After I was wounded,

275
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:33,180
there was no way for me

276
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:34,850
to practice martial arts.

277
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:38,100
However, this allowed me to focus solely

278
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,530
on practicing my static qigong.

279
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:42,610
After all these years,

280
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:44,130
my mastery of static qigong

281
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,610
has made tremendous leaps and bounds.

282
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:50,370
I've heard about it too.

283
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:52,340
You never slept a wink here

284
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:54,180
over the several decades.

285
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:58,490
When you're brimming with qi,
you don't crave food.

286
00:11:58,490 --> 00:11:59,940
When you're brimming with spirituality,

287
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:01,300
you don't crave sleep.

288
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:03,250
Now,

289
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:06,100
I'm brimming with both qi and spirituality.

290
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,580
I don't need sleep

291
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:09,850
to sustain myself.

292
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:11,980
Grandmaster Tian,

293
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:13,100
you do look on the bright side of things, huh?

294
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,180
Child,

295
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,890
I don't know how you've spent your life out there

296
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:20,220
all these years,

297
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:22,370
but I know

298
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:25,340
that it must've been tough.

299
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:31,100
Naturally, your grandfather knew

300
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,420
that Master could defend him

301
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:34,490
once he returned to the sect.

302
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:36,420
But he didn't.

303
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:39,730
He was afraid he might drag the sect down.

304
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,770
That was why he would rather run and hide

305
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:44,490
for the rest of his life.

306
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:56,460
Child,

307
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:00,730
don't blame your grandfather for this.

308
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:10,370
I don't blame him at all.

309
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:13,420
I just wish to ask him

310
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:16,370
why he kept hiding the truth from me.

311
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:19,610
He had no one to depend on back then.

312
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:24,610
There were some things that he could not tell you.

313
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,730
That fool,

314
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,370
he didn't need to resort to this.

315
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:35,010
You wouldn't need to suffer that much

316
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:35,940
if he brought you

317
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,100

to get rid of you in this match.

374

if I'm not mistaken,

Zhang Chulan will be poisoned

Countless lightning bolts spark
all around Zhang Chulan's body.

Tang Wenlong with the bolts.

these lightning bolts remotely

00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:07,750
you're something else.

559
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:08,670
Not bad at all.

560
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:09,270
You know what?

561
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:11,470
Your odds are one against 250 now.

562
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:13,030
If you do win the contest,

563
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:14,380
I have to escape to the Moon
because of all the bets I took.

564
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:16,030
Isn't that better?

565
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:17,820
You can practice speaking
the moon language on the Moon.

566
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:19,190
Zhang Chulan

567
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:21,030
is the focus of attention indeed.

568
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:22,710
By the way,

569
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:24,190
I heard that you fought him before.

570
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:25,710
Was he truly as unbearable

571
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:26,750
as the rumors claim?

572
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:29,230
I'm always curious about something.

573
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:30,860
Have you always hated

574
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:32,140
Zhang Chulan?

575
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:34,030
I don't hate him.

576
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:34,910
You do.

577
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:36,860
And it's very obvious.

578
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:38,910
Don't tell me it's because he knows how to use

579
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:41,030
your Five Elements Yin Lightning?

580
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:45,990
Zhuge,

581
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:46,510
where are you going?

582
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:48,990
You guys are gossiping.

583
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:51,430
I'm uninterested

584
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:52,100
in gossip.

585
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:53,270
Please excuse me.

586
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:57,710
Let's talk about Zhang Chulan.

587
00:25:57,710 --> 00:25:59,030
Even if he does master
the Five Elements Yang Lightning

588
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:00,190
with his perfect body,

589
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:00,950
he still can't affect your position

590
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:02,510
on Mount Longhu.

591
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:04,030
Xue,

592
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:05,340
stop trying to provoke me with your words.

593
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:06,670
[Enhance Hearing]

594
00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:07,780
I knew that.

595
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:08,910
I always knew that.

596
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:11,990
I just dislike the kid.

597
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:14,820
Back then, I committed a huge mistake

598
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:15,580
all because of one wrong thought.

599
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:17,710
Therefore, I wasn't able to inherit

600
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:19,380
the Five Elements Yang Lightning,
which is perfect in my heart.

601
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:21,270
But I can't blame anyone else for that.

602
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:23,710
I deserved it.

603
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:25,990
And now, I'm venting my anger on Zhang Chulan.

604
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:28,270
That proves
that my level of cultivation isn't enough.

605
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:30,300
We've known each other for a long time.

606
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:31,430
Why don't you tell me

607
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:33,430
who drew first blood

608
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:34,750
from you?

609
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:37,380
(So, Zhang Lingyu)

610
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:38,820
(has such a dark history.)

611
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:42,140
I swear that I won't tell anyone.

612
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:43,060
That's impossible.

613
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:44,100
You're only asking me this

614
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:44,910
so that you can spread the secret.

615
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:48,140
I won't tell anyone.

616
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,100
I'm begging you.

617
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:50,470
Please tell me.

618
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,670
Indeed. I should find a chance

619
00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:54,750
to apologize to Zhang Chulan.

620
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:56,340
Zhang Chulan,

621
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:58,710
I'll teach you a Jinwei saying.

622
00:26:58,710 --> 00:26:59,750
If you pronounce it wrong,

623
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:00,230
you have to drink.

624
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:01,060
No problem!

625
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:02,670
Drink up!

626
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:04,380
Fire persimmon.

627
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:05,780
Five persimmons.

628
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:06,340
You're wrong!

629
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:10,950
Drink up!

630
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:13,620
Lian!

631
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:20,670
Bottoms up!

632
00:27:27,670 --> 00:27:32,620
Lian!

633
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:37,430
Lian!

634
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:38,230
Wait.

635
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:46,380
Lian,

636
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:48,780
what does your seal

637
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:50,140
look like?

638
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:54,580
What does it look like?

639
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:57,620
(Zhang Chulan,)

640
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:00,820
show us your seal.

641
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:02,470
My seal?

642
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:03,860
Why do you want to see that?

643
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:04,580
You misunderstood me.

644
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:06,270
I'm not interested in you.

645
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:08,060
That seal is an Outsiders' technique
that will soon be lost.

646
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:09,140
We just wish

647
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:11,380
to observe it closely.

648
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:14,090
Observe it closely?

649
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:16,030
Do you believe that I'll poke your face with it?

650
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:17,060
I'm going to throw a fit!

651
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:18,340
Gold Brilliance Spell

652
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:19,060
Calm down!

653
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:20,230
Don't be angry.

654
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:21,340
Well...

655
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:22,820
That's not what we meant.

656
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:23,750
However, such an Outsiders' technique

657
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:24,860
has been lost for a long time.

658
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:27,100
And there's no record of it
in the ancient manuals.

659
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:27,780
That's right.

660
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:29,190
We just don't want to miss out on the opportunity

661
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:30,990
to observe it closely.

662
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:34,100
Just for a little while.

663
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:39,820
We're buddies, right?

664
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:41,820
I'll show it to you guys.

665
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:43,750
Let's go!

666
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:51,710
Xue!

667
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:53,030
We did it! Hurry!

668
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:57,270
Zhang Chulan,

669
00:28:57,270 --> 00:28:58,780
you're a man who's going to achieve great things.

670
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:00,540
You shouldn't mind such minor details.

671
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:01,540
Zhang Chulan,

672
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:03,060
now, no one else has the right

673
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:04,910
to bear the seal except for you.

674
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:05,580
That's right.

675
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:07,380
You have to expand our horizons today.

676
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:09,140
Show us something new.

677
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,780
Do you guys wish to see it that much?

678
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:14,540
We do!

679
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:20,990
If so,

680
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:22,990
I'll show it to you guys!

681
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:34,060
I saw it!

682
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:35,030
I saw faint qi symbols

683
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:36,540
flowing on it.

684
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:38,540
But it's a little...

685
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:48,750
It's too blurry!

686
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:51,300
It's simple if you don't want it to be blurry.

687
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:52,190
I just need to utilize

688
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:54,430
the true qi in my body.

689
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:58,860
Gold brilliance,

690
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:00,300
cover my body.

691
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:03,780
See the invisible,

692
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:04,860
hear the unhearable.

693
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:06,860
Here you go!

694
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:21,670
Indeed.

695
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:22,620
That seal

696
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:24,190
is made with unique symbols.

697
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:26,430
This is so wonderful!

698
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:28,710
It's totally different
from the superfluous design they make nowadays.

699
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:30,620
All these symbols show hints of Classicism.

700
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:31,470
They're uniquely modest!

701
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:33,030
And they're filled with mysterious beauty!

702
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:35,060
This isn't Classicism!

703
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:35,540
This is...

704
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:36,380
This...

705
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:38,300
This is Bohemianism!

706
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:40,340
What do you think?

707
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:42,860
I'm a cool dude, right?

708
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:44,510
I will make you guys speechless!

709
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:46,750
Friendship forever!

710
00:30:57,510 --> 00:30:58,750
What was I thinking?

711
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:01,710
I actually wanted
to apologize to a person like him?

712
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:03,670
Master was wrong.

713
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:06,950

00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:23,270
What's wrong with your eyes?

746
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:25,860
It's so lively over there.

747
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:28,230
(Lu just had to punch me in the eyes.)

748
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:29,270
Aren't you joining them?

749
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:32,300
I don't even have enough sleep during daytime,

750
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:33,820
let alone during nighttime.

751
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:35,510
How about one sip?

752
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:40,580
It's pretty nice.

753
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:42,300
Come, let me help you.

754
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:45,510
Wang Ye.

755
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:49,860
You came to me at such a late hour.

756
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:51,310
What are you up to?

757
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:52,470
I'm not up to anything.

758
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:53,510
I'm here

759
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:54,790
to resolve your issue for you.

760
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:56,900
Resolve my issue for me?

761
00:33:57,550 --> 00:33:59,750
I came here to tell you

762
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:02,030
that you don't need to fret about
Zhang Chulan for now.

763
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:03,510
At least he won't be eliminated

764
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:04,660
before he faces me.

765
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:06,550
I know

766
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:08,390
you care about Zhang Chulan very much.

767
00:34:08,910 --> 00:34:10,510
However, as the Chief Celestial Taoist
from Celestial Taoist Mansion,

768
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:12,830
you're thinking about interfering
with your junior's affairs, am I right?

769
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:14,030
Chief Celestial Taoist,

770
00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:15,950
please don't do it.

771
00:34:15,950 --> 00:34:16,990
Forget about doing it.

772
00:34:16,990 --> 00:34:18,430
Don't even think about it.

773
00:34:18,430 --> 00:34:19,700
Once you do it,

774
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:21,430
not only will Celestial Taoist Mansion's
reputation be ruined,

775
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:22,910
but your destiny will also

776
00:34:22,910 --> 00:34:24,580
be altered.

777
00:34:26,950 --> 00:34:27,910
What?

778
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:29,580
You...

779
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:41,740
You shouldn't be

780
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:44,300
so curious about me.

781
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:46,100
It's bad for you.

782
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:47,700
You're right.

783
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:49,870
And I don't want to cause trouble for myself.

784
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:51,100
But Wang Ye,

785
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:51,950
judging from your tone,

786
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:54,700
it seems like you joined this contest
because of Zhang Chulan.

787
00:34:54,910 --> 00:34:55,830
That's right.

788
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:57,580
However, my intention

789
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:58,660
is the opposite of yours.

790
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:00,140
I'm here

791
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:01,830
to stop him from being the champion.

792
00:35:01,830 --> 00:35:03,100
I'm here to stop him from inheriting Tianshidu.

793
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:04,990
You have your own reasons

794
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:06,100
for wanting Zhang Chulan to be the champion.

795
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:07,700
And I have

796
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:09,100
my own reasons

797
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:10,620
for stopping him.

798
00:35:11,990 --> 00:35:13,030
If you want to eliminate him,

799
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:14,620
you have to eliminate Zhuge Qing first.

800
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:16,660
Even if it's Zhang Lingyu we're talking about,

801
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:19,070
I dare not guarantee

802
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:21,550
that he'll win against Zhuge Qing.

803
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:23,390
Are you confident that you can win against him?

804
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:25,580
About that,

805
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:27,830
I guess so.

806
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:29,740
Why don't I

807
00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:32,620
give you a test?

808
00:35:32,950 --> 00:35:34,220
Hmm.

809
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:35,260
Alright.

810
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:37,990
Pardon me for the rudeness, then.

811
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:44,990
Chaos Golden Space Rip!

812
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:51,870
He's strong.

813
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:56,220
I only used Chaos Golden Space Rip once
against that old man.

814
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:57,740
And I'm almost collapsing from exhaustion.

815
00:35:58,870 --> 00:36:00,870
Is this the power of a Celestial Taoist?

816
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:08,700
This is pretty interesting.

817
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,350
I was actually detached

818
00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:12,140
from the world momentarily.

819
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,760
You manipulate time

820
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,450
to force your opponent to follow your rhythm.

821
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:19,220
I was wrong about you.

822
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:24,240
I assume

823
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:26,410
Yunlong wasn't your only teacher.

824
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:30,810
Wang Ye,

825
00:36:31,730 --> 00:36:33,290
you can pursue whatever you intend to do.

826
00:36:35,810 --> 00:36:38,160
Whether or not Zhang Chulan can proceed,

827
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,370
that doesn't depend on you

828
00:36:39,370 --> 00:36:40,330
or me.

829
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,890
It depends on no one but himself.

830
00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:43,930
Chief Celestial Taoist,

831
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:45,770
pardon me for my rudeness.

832
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,450
