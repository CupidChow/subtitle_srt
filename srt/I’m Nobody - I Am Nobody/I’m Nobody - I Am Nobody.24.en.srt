185
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,300
See who's the mastermind behind him."

186
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:12,700
So, we just came here

187
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:13,540
to turn on the PC for you?

188
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:14,580
Is that all?

189
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:16,780
That's right.

190
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,500
Are you too poor to surf the Internet?

191
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,180
Or are you still a kid?

192
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:22,460
Why must we come all the way here

193
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:24,100
for a trivial matter like this?

194
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:29,200
[I'm so angry!]

195
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:31,620
Ms. Bao,

196
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:34,180
she's pretty capable.

197
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:35,580
But she has a terrible temper.

198
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,500
(Zhang Chulan,)

199
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,020
(do not badmouth me behind my back!)

200
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,100
Ms. Bao,

201
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,700
she's right beside us.

202
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,500
She can hear us.

203
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:52,220
(Zhang Chulan, stop looking for me.)

204
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:55,940
(I'm right beside you.)

205
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:02,020
What a pervert!

206
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:02,820
Who is this guy?

207
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:03,340
Who is that?

208
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:04,460
Who's this?

209
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:07,620
(Let's go!)

210
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:10,940
My dear lady,

211
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:12,780
it's all my fault, okay?

212
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:24,300
I don't know how old I am too.

213
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,500
Let me count.

214
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:27,580
Ms. Bao,

215
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:29,660
don't reveal everything to an outsider.

216
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:30,820
We don't know her.

217
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:41,220
[Part-Timer of NDT Northeast China, Gao Erzhuang]
(Return the phone to Ms. Bao!)

218
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,020
You think you're capable, huh?

219
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:51,820
Come out if you dare!

220
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:52,860
Show yourself!

221
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,100
Come out, Invisible Girl!

222
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,980
Come out!

223
00:10:58,820 --> 00:10:59,660
Why are you shouting?

224
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:02,780
It's nothing.

225
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:06,660
I've already interrogated him.

226
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:08,540
That programmer named Qin Peng,

227
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:10,540
he only joined the Sinister Pleasure last month.

228
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:10,940
This was

229
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:12,380
the first mission he received
from his superiors.

230
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,420
He didn't even know

231
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:14,940
that he was hacking into a company's system.

232
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,980
If so, who gave him the order?

233
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,140
He said he forgot.

234
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:19,380
He forgot?

235
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,540
He truly forgot everything.

236
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,140
I used all kinds of ways

237
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,060
to make him tell me the mastermind's name,

238
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:24,380
gender, and appearance.

239
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:25,660
But he couldn't remember anything.

240
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:30,780
(Could it be that it's related to Lyu Liang?)

241
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:33,580
The hackers I caught

242
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:34,860
were just like Qin Peng.

243
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,500
They forgot everything about the person
who gave them the task.

244
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:41,660
Was his memory

245
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:42,940
tampered by someone?

246
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:44,820
It should be the effect of a certain superpower.

247
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,020
I'll report this to our higher-ups.

248
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:48,180
You guys can stay out of this now.

249
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:48,900
But...

250
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:49,900
No more buts.

251
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,580
We already caught the suspect.

252
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:52,940
You and Baobao can take a break now.

253
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:53,700
You may go.

254
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:08,260
You should leave too.

255
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:08,740
Continue to investigate

256
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:10,740
how Qin Peng's memories were wiped away.

257
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:25,020
Are you sure he's asleep?

258
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:25,740
Don't worry.

259
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:26,460
He'll be unconscious

260
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:28,340
until tomorrow afternoon.

261
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:32,380
Ms. Bao.

262
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:34,900
It's fine as long as I don't take the pork belly.

263
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,940
Why do you need his glasses?

264
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:45,060
Do you have nearsightedness too?

265
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:48,420
Whenever we interacted with Erzhuang,

266
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:49,700
it felt like she was by our side.

267
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,180
She knew everything about us.

268
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:52,580
It was like she could see us.

269
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:55,860
However, we couldn't see her.

270
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,820
San was the only one
who could interact with her in person.

271
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,580
So, according to my deduction,

272
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,580
I'm sure San has a certain method he uses

273
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:03,740
to communicate with her.

274
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:04,900
I've observed him for some time.

275
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,460
And I finally found out.

276
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:09,660
This is the secret to communicating with Erzhuang.

277
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:13,900
Let me see

278
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:16,100
what Gao Erzhuang looks like.

279
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:17,780
Zhang Chulan,

280
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:19,300
you're so ugly with glasses.

281
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:23,780
You look so ugly with glasses.

282
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:29,260
I knew you weren't human!

283
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:30,900
Speak for yourself.

284
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:32,340
Are you talking to me?

285
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:34,220
Nope.

286
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:35,580
So,

287
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:37,900
are you AR or AI?

288
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,740
Or are you a Pokemon?

289
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:44,500
Erzhuang,

290
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,780
since when you were here?

291
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:46,700
Are you hungry or not?

292
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:47,820
Nope.

293
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:50,460
Why does he look so silly?

294
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:52,140
He's pretty silly.

295
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:53,940
He's not as intelligent as me.

296
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:06,380
Erzhuang,

297
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:07,420
you're actually

298
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:08,700
the center system of NDT,

299
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:09,220
right?

300
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:10,780
Erzhuang?

301
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:12,260
So, you knew everything

302
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,220
from the system being hacked

303
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,140
to our info being stolen,

304
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:15,140
including the delivery mishap,

305
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:15,860
am I right?

306
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:19,180
Handling the delivery information

307
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:20,180
is just a small part

308
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:21,020
of my task.

309
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:23,700
So, why did the Sinister Pleasure

310
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:24,980
steal all those intel?

311
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:26,020
What's their motive?

312
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:28,420
Why should I tell you?

313
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:29,540
Erzhuang?

314
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:30,940
What's in it for me if I tell you?

315
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:34,860
What do you want?

316
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:39,420
That's tough.

317
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:40,660
What about this?

318
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:42,820
Choose your favorite dish

319
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:43,900
and describe its taste to me.

320
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:45,660
The more specific it is, the better.

321
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,140
You...

322
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:49,980
You're not kidding me, right?

323
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:50,780
Erzhuang?

324
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:52,020
Look at me.

325
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:53,580
I can't even take food.

326
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:54,660
Are you not willing to do so?

327
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:55,780
I'll leave then.

328
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:57,500
Don't.

329
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:11,660
What does it taste like?

330
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:13,140
It's a little salty.

331
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:14,180
Is that all?

332
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:34,820
It's tender,

333
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:35,660
crispy,

334
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,060
and has a satisfying meat taste.

335
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:38,580
It melts in your mouth.

336
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:40,180
It's so smooth and sweet.

337
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:41,180
What a pleasant aftertaste.

338
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:43,780
This isn't just an ordinary skewer.

339
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:47,060
It's the taste of life.

340
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:50,900
As I continue to chew on it,

341
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,540
I tasted its rich flavor.

342
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:54,780
It's as if I'm on the plains

343
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:56,820
right now.

344
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,260
I see the shepherds herding their sheep

345
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:00,140
as wild horses run across the plains.

346
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:03,260
The grass bends low,
the cattle and sheep, to show.

347
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:06,500
Wait.

348
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:10,540
I also taste the distant mountains and forest.

349
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:14,940
You described the taste of my lamb skewer.

350
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:16,420
That's enough.

351
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:19,540
(I finally know how it feels like to taste.)

352
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:22,420
I'll tell you about it then.

353
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:24,900
The intel that the Sinister Pleasure has stolen

354
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,540
is related to the creators of the Eight Supremes.

355
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:27,380
[Six Vault Immortal Thievery, Qi Apotheosis,

360
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:33,180
Everything related to them is inside.

361
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,820
Why do they need it?

362
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:36,540
I have no idea either.

363
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:38,500
I got hold of another piece of news.

364
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:40,020
The Sinister Pleasure

365
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:41,660
has a new sect leader.

366
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:42,940
A new sect leader?

367
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:44,580
I thought they only had interim leaders
before this?

368
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:46,540
It's a new sect leader,

369
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:47,580
not an interim leader.

370
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:48,380
Interim leader?

371
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:49,260
New sect leader?

372
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:50,380
Make yourself clear.

373
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,260
That's all the info I can provide to you

374
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:53,820
for the food description you gave me.

375
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:54,940
Goodbye.

376
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:55,660
Don't...

377
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:00,420
She did leave.

378
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:04,940
Why did the sect leader of the Sinister Pleasure

379
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,500
steal intel related to the Eight Supremes?

380
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,020
What secret is hidden behind the Eight Supremes?

381
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,380
I could've asked Grandmaster about this

382
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:10,580
if he weren't on a retreat.

383
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:11,740
But he's on a retreat now.

384
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:12,780
Who else can I ask about this?

385
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:26,100
Hello?

386
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,300
Linglong, it's me.

387
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:29,780
I've missed you guys. It's been
several months since we last met.

388
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:32,340
Me too.

389
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:34,940
Who's calling you?

390
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:36,820
Who is it?

391
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:42,300
Chulan.

392
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:44,460
What? Chulan?

393
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:46,700
Why are you being so close to him?

394
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:47,980
Stay away from him!

395
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,940
No one in Mount Longhu

396
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:52,740
are decent beings!

397
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:55,020
All of them are dishonest.

398
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:56,260
All of them are liars!

399
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:58,500
Linglong,

400
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,740
tell Mr. Lu

401
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:02,020
that I met Grandmaster a few days ago.

402
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:03,740
He felt sorry.

403
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:04,780
What about this?

404
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:06,860
I'll visit Mr. Lu tomorrow

405
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:08,060
and apologize to him on my grandmaster's behalf.

406
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:13,300
Are you saying your grandmaster
wants to apologize to me?

407
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:15,340
Sure. Come then.

408
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:17,780
I'll see how your grandmaster
will apologize to me.

409
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:24,340
Chulan.

410
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:27,100
Here's my advice.

411
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,260
You better don't spout nonsense

412
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:29,020
when you see Grandmaster.

413
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:30,220
He's in a bad mood lately.

414
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:31,100
I know.

415
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,940
He's had a misunderstanding
with my grandmaster, right?

416
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:34,500
It's not just that.

417
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:38,220
I don't know what's wrong

418
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:40,100
with these elderly folks lately.

419
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:42,100
He visited Taoist Fang Dongtian

420
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:44,020
some days ago.

421
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,140
Taoist Fang

422
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:47,460
passed away just after a few days.

423
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,460
I also heard

424
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,060
that Taoist Lu from Mount Wudang

425
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:51,060
had passed away

426
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:53,060
too.

427
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:54,060
The survivors of Year of Jiashen

428
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:55,340
are getting lesser and lesser.

429
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:58,020
But don't worry.

430
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:59,980
I'll definitely make your grandmaster happy.

431
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,220
I'll drink with him later.

432
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:03,700
Ms. Bao,

433
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:04,300
I'll leave that to you.

434
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:05,860
No problem.

435
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:07,260
Good.

436
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,980
Grandpa, Zhang Chulan is here!

437
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:11,860
Come.

438
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:13,500
Grandpa,

439
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,580
Zhang Chulan is here.

440
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:17,740
They're here?

441
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:18,980
Feng Baobao is here too.

442
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:20,700
Linglong,

443
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,540
entertain that lass for me.

444
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:24,300
I need to speak with Zhang Chulan in private.

445
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:27,140
Ms. Bao,

446
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:29,060
let's go and play with my cat in my room.

447
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:29,740
Come on.

448
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:48,220
You do look like a member of Zhang Zhiwei's gang.

449
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,780
You look detestable no matter how I look at you!

450
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:55,340
Mr. Lu.

451
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:57,820
Mr. Lu,

452
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:59,980
Xu San and Xu Si told me

453
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:01,300
that the Ten Elders

454
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,300
dared not speak

455
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,140
when they saw Grandmaster
in the Ganbei grasslands.

456
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,860
Mr. Lu, you are the mightiest man there exists.

457
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:08,380
Only my grandmaster is a match for you.

458
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:09,380
You two were equal in prowess.

459
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:11,340
You two didn't even blink after fighting
for five days and nights.

460
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:12,580
You two fought until the blue skies...

461
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:13,900
Enough!

462
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:14,860
Stop flattering me!

463
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:16,780
Your grandmaster could kill me in one blow!

464
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:19,700
I've already straightened out my thoughts.

465
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:21,820
I'm not angry at the fact that he hit me.

466
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:25,380
I'm angry that he sealed himself away
on Mount Longhu

467
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:28,100
without caring for his old buddies.

468
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:30,740
Tell me.

469
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,740
I'm already at this age.

470
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:34,500
I...

471
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,180
Look at

472
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:37,820
the number of friends I have left.

473
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:38,900
Look.

474
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:41,940
[Taoist Zhang]
These people are my only friends now.

475
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,420
Mr. Lu,

476
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:51,180
if you're angry about that,

477
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:54,220
I can be your friend

478
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,900
if my grandmaster cannot leave the mountain.

479
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:57,180
You want to be my friend?

480
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:58,340
Forget about it.

481
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,780
You would've landed me

482
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:01,020
in trouble with your cunning nature

483
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:03,260
if I were several decades younger.

484
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:03,940
Enough.

485
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:04,980
Just tell me.

486
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:05,860
What do you need?

487
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:09,740
I truly came here just to visit you.

488
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:12,620
I brought you some supplements too.

489
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:14,340
Wishing you a long life of 100 years.

490
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:15,180
Shut up!

491
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:17,100
I'm already 110 years old!

492
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,580
You still wish me a long life of 100 years?

493
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:21,220
Then I wish you a long life of 200 years.

494
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:30,660
Good.

495
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:33,780
Good.

496
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:35,300
Tell me.

497
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:36,580
What do you want to ask?

498
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:38,780
You're being so straightforward

499
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:40,540
that I'm too embarrassed to ask you anything.

500
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:42,060
Initially, I wanted to ask you

501
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:43,700
about the Jiashen Calamity.

502
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,780
But I know you won't tell me about it.

503
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:46,700
That's why I wish

504
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:47,860
to know if you can tell me

505
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:49,180
about the Eight Supremes instead.

506
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:51,540
Speaking of the Eight Supremes,

507
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,940
it all started with The 36 Thieves.

508
00:21:58,740 --> 00:21:59,660
Meow.

509
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:03,940
Meow.

510
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:09,620
Meow.

511
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,300
Ms. Bao,

512
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:13,140
you don't play with cats like that.

513
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,140
Come.

514
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,900
Is it that simple?

515
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:30,220
Ms. Bao,

516
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:31,700
why were you guys looking for Grandpa?

517
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:33,260
Did something happen to the company?

518
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:34,540
Let me try.

519
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:47,580
This is the name list of The 36 Thieves.

520
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:49,900
You're very close with the Feng family.

521
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:53,140
I'm sure you know Feng Tianyang,
who is Feng Zhenghao's grandfather.

522
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:54,140
I've also witnessed

523
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:55,020
their family technique,

524
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:55,860
Dispatch of Detained Spirits.

525
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:57,900
Feng Tianyang

526
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:00,300
offered this name list to Wang Ai's family

527
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:02,540
when he was captured by them.

528
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:04,740
The Infinite Heavenly Talisman

529
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:05,820
was imparted to me

530
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,380
by my buddy, Zheng Zibu, before he died.

531
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:08,820
But back then,

532
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,980
the so-called Eight Supremes,

533
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:12,380
it was just a name.

534
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:14,020
We had no idea

535
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:15,500
what the abilities were like.

536
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,500
Chulan,

537
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:19,620
in the Outsiders' world,

538
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:22,340
an ability can only be referred to as a supreme

539
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:25,780
after at least 100 years of polishing

540
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,700
and passing down.

541
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,540
However, these eight people

542
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:32,460
actually produced eight supremes overnight.

543
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:33,460
I'm sure there's definitely

544
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:35,460
a catch to it.

545
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:38,860
In order to extract the truth
about the Eight Supremes

546
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:40,460
[Endless and Everlasting](from Feng Tianyang,)

547
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:41,740
(many well-established figures)

548
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:43,420
(gathered around.)

549
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:44,500
[Master Luo Pingxin]
(Initially, they thought)

550
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,740
[Master Luo Pingxin]
(they could extract the truth easily)

551
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,460
(just by interrogating)

552
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:49,780
(Feng Tianyang.)

553
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:54,060
(However, no one expected)

554
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,140
[Physician Miao Jiang]
(all the elders)

555
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:56,820
[Physician Miao Jiang]

556
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:57,420
(to fail)

557
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:58,420
(the interrogation)

558
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:00,100
(in the end.)

559
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,220
[Previous Chief Celestial Taoist, Zhang Jingqing]
(The previous Chief Celestial Taoist,)

560
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:06,660
(which was your grandmaster's master,)

561
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:07,940
(he was there as well.)

562
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:09,660
(He once persuaded the rest)

563
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:11,220
(to stop the interrogation.)

564
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:11,940
(However,)

565
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:14,260
(those people wouldn't hear him out.)

566
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:17,100
I shall not conspire with
shallow beings like you all.

567
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:18,980
Farewell.

568
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:20,140
You!

569
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:22,260
They spent half a month interrogating him,

570
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:23,980
yet they couldn't find out

571
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:25,900
where the Eight Supremes came from

572
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,300
and what the truth was.

573
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:28,740
In the end,

574
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:31,060
they only got the name list of The 36 Thieves.

575
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:32,500
Back then,

576
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,940
only nine out of The 36 Thieves

577
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,740
managed to survive.

578
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:37,500
I wrote their names

579
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,220
on the last page of the name list.

580
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,540
Those nine people

581
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:43,220
mastered the Eight Supremes.

582
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,380
Nine people?

583
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:46,580
But there were only eight supremes?

584
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:48,660
Initially, there were nine of them.

585
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:51,740
Eight of them mastered their supremes.

586
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,300
And they also gave a name

587
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:54,940
to their supremes.

588
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:57,580
The last one was trying his best
to invent a supreme.

589
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:59,460
If so, has he managed

590
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:01,220
to invent his own supreme?

591
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:02,420
It was Wu Gensheng.

592
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:03,900
[Wu Gensheng]

593
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,740
Wu Gensheng's skills

594
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:08,020
were already incomprehensible.

595
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:10,060
His technique was on par with

596
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:11,420
the Eight Supremes.

597
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:12,940
It's because

598
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:16,540
he was the number one martial artist

599
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:17,940
in the world back then.

600
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:21,620
Doesn't that make him
as powerful as my grandmaster?

601
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:25,260
Wu Gensheng?

602
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:28,140
Is Wu even a valid surname?

603
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:31,900
Wu Gensheng is a nickname he gave himself.

604
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:34,140
No one knew what his real name was.

605
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:36,460
He was a madman.

606
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:38,700
He said he was born from the celestial root.

607
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,500
He had no worries, doubts,

608
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,660
temperaments, roots,

609
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:45,100
past, or future.

610
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:46,740
Even his skills became a thing of its own

611
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:49,100
without any proper namesake.

612
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:52,420
Some people

613
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:54,780
said that he was born

614
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:55,860
from a corpse.

615
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:58,100
Some people said

616
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:00,420
he was an illegitimate son
who was abandoned by a noble family.

617
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:02,780
What made people notice him

618
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:04,300
was his position
as the Sinister Pleasure's sect leader

619
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:06,380
after the seat

620
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:08,540
had been vacant for centuries.

621
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:11,180
Since then,

622
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:13,380
those madmen

623
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:15,140
had a leader.

624
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:17,700
The sect leader of Sinister Pleasure?

625
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:19,220
What?

626
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:21,420
It's nothing.

627
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:24,420
You see, our company's system
was hacked a few days ago.

628
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:25,980
After our investigation,
we found out that the mastermind

629
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:27,260
was the new sect leader of the Sinister Pleasure.

630
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:28,460
He even stole intel

631
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:30,260
related to the Eight Supremes from our company.

632
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:31,580
Something's wrong.

633
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:35,740
Wu Gensheng vanished

634
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:37,060
after the Jiashen Calamity.

635
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:38,060
His whereabouts were nowhere to be found.

636
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:40,660
After that,

637
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:42,060
every leader

638
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:43,300
of the Sinister Pleasure

639
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:46,380
only dared refer to themselves
as interim leaders.

640
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:48,060
No one ever dared refer to themselves
as the sect leader.

641
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:51,020
Could it be that he has made a return?

642
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:52,700
What?

643
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:56,940
I was just saying.

644
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:58,780
How old is he then?

645
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:00,620
He's several decades older than me.

646
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:02,380
I think he should be dead by now.

647
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:07,580
I do wish that he's still alive.

648
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:13,900
Wu Gensheng!

649
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:16,260
I have to kill you myself!

650
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:19,140
You're welcome to try it anytime.

651
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:26,380
Ms. Bao,

652
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:27,020
Linglong,

653
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,580
let's have a hotpot.

654
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:37,260
Zhang Chulan.

655
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:40,340
Didn't you say you were going to drink
with Grandpa?

656
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:42,500
I have to drive later.

657
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:46,580
Cheers.

658
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:48,660
Come.

659
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,460
Let's drink.

660
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:00,100
Mr. Lu.

661
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:02,700
The Eight Supremes have now resurfaced.

662
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:05,900
[Qimen Manipulation]
(Zhou Sheng imparted Qimen Manipulation to Wang Ye.)

663
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:07,840
(Zheng Zibu imparted
the Infinite Heavenly Talisman to you.)

664
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:08,820
[Infinite Heavenly Talisman]

665
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:11,180
(And you've imparted it to Zhang Lingyu.)

666
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,060
[Dispatch of Detained Spirits]
(Feng Tianyang's Dispatch of Detained Spirits)

667
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:15,220
[Dispatch of Detained Spirits]
(were used by both the Feng and Wang family before.)

668
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:16,180
[Qimen Manipulation, Infinite Heavenly Talisman,]
(These three supremes)

669
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:17,700
[Dispatch of Detained Spirits]
(have been made known to the world.)

670
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:20,060
(However, there are five other supremes
that haven't been made known.)

671
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:21,340
[Double Quan Palm]
(Duan Muying's Double Quan Palm.)

672
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:22,980
[Divine Forge]
(Ma Benzai's Divine Forge,)

673
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:24,420
[Daluo Dongguan]
(Gu Qiting's Daluo Dongguan,)

674
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:26,380
[Six Vault Immortal Thievery]
(Ruan Feng's Six Vault Immortal Thievery,)

675
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:28,740
[Qi Apotheosis]
(and my grandfather's Qi Apotheosis.)

676
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:29,140
[Six Vault Immortal Thievery, Qi Apotheosis,
Double Quan Palm, Divine Forge,]

677
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:31,900
[Daluo Dongguan, Wang Ye (Qimen Manipulation),]
(What are these five supremes about?)

678
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:32,580
[Zhang Lingyu (Infinite Heavenly Talisman),
Feng Xingtong (Dispatch of Detained Spirits)]

679
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:35,260
After those eight people
mastered the Eight Supremes,

680
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:37,100
they only revealed the names of their supremes

681
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:38,780
to one other.

682
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:40,820
As for their abilities,

683
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:42,540
even they didn't know.

684
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:45,260
Mr. Lu,

685
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:46,300
back then, capable martial artists like you

686
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,540
could be found everywhere

687
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:48,380
in the Outsiders' world.

688
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:49,660
Why are the eight of them the only ones

689
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:51,100
who mastered the Eight Supremes?

690
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:54,260
I did hear this from Feng Tianyang before.

691
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:57,060
They mastered the Eight Supremes

692
00:28:57,060 --> 00:29:00,140
in a place called the Valley of 24 Terms.

693
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:01,740
He said

694
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,940
that there were once deities
who made their ascensions there.

695
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:06,980
And they left behind a mysterious qi formation.

696
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:07,860
A qi formation?

697
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:08,300
That's right.

698
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:10,220
Through manpower manipulation,

699
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:11,740
the flow of qi is altered

700
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:13,740
and superpowers can be accessed.

701
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:16,020
He said the Valley of 24 Terms

702
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:17,060
could defy fate,

703
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:18,540
revive the dead,

704
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:19,860
even help one to ascend to deityhood.

705
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:22,940
(Revive the dead?)

706
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:33,020
Mr. Lu,

707
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:34,340
does such a magical place truly exist?

708
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:35,540
Why don't you bring me there?

709
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:37,540
I don't know where it is.

710
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:39,580
Elderly folks like us

711
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:41,180
searched the entire world for it.

712
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:43,420
But we couldn't find the Valley of 24 Terms.

713
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:44,900
Forget about us.

714
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,180
Even a resourceful and powerful company

715
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:48,620
like NDT

716
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:49,860
couldn't find the place

717
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:51,860
after decades of research.

718
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:53,700
I think

719
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,940
Feng Tianyang made up that lie

720
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:58,780
so that he could survive.

721
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:02,940
If that was a lie he made up,

722
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:04,020
how could there be eight people

723
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:05,420
mastering the Eight Supremes at the same time?

724
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:14,220
Mr. Lu, let's drink.

725
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:15,980
Come.

726
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:23,980
By the way, Mr. Lu,

727
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:25,380
didn't you say

728
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:26,380
they used everything they could

729
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:28,060
to interrogate Feng Tianyang?

730
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:28,900
If so, why didn't they use

731
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:30,180
the Lyu family's Soul Whisperer on him?

732
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:31,460
Forget about it.

733
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:33,140
The Lyu family
hadn't invented the Soul Whisperer

734
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:35,220
before the Jiashen Calamity.

735
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:40,380
They didn't have the Soul Whisperer back then?

736
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:43,380
If so, when did they invent
the Soul Whisperer then?

737
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:47,100
