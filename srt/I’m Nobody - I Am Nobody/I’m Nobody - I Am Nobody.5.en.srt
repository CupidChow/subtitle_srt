00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:02,340
passed

192
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:03,780
the Dispatch of Detained Spirits down to me.

193
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:05,900
It's one of the Eight Supremes as well.

194
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,620
Eight Supremes?

195
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:11,060
Can I see it?

196
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:13,660
When you become a member
of The All-Encompassing Guild,

197
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,460
I will show you everything.

198
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:17,380
This is also why

199
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:19,220
I want you to join the Feng family.

200
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,940
We are both descendants
of the holders of the Eight Supremes.

201
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:22,420
Become part of my family.

202
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:23,420
Let us uncover the truth

203
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,820
together.

204
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:30,500
I told you. No need to make a decision now.

205
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,500
You can rest up here.

206
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,140
Consider this

207
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:34,420
your home.

208
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:36,460
Get some rest.

209
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:43,940
Dad!

210
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:44,900
Are you actually going to make me

211
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,300
date that brat?

212
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:48,340
Brat?

213
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,100
You think the NDT Express

214
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:53,100
would take an interest in a mere boy?

215
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:54,940
Zhang Chulan is worth far more

216
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:56,540
than you can imagine.

217
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:57,580
Right now,

218
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:59,060
he had a fallout with NDT Express

219
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,140
and has no one to turn to.

220
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,020
This is the best opportunity
for us to rope him in

221
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,740
with the minimum cost.

222
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,900
By minimum cost,

223
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,300
do you mean me?

224
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:14,940
Yes,

225
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:17,260
but it's not only you.

226
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:18,260
Compared to what Zhang Chulan

227
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:19,900
brings to the table,

228
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,340
all costs

229
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:22,300
are trivial,

230
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,180
including myself.

231
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:27,780
Right now, Zhang Chulan

232
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:28,780
is a blind box.

233
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:30,300
If the Qi Apotheosis is in his possession,

234
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,180
with the Feng family's
Dispatch of Detained Spirits,

235
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,060
we will be closer

236
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:34,820
to uncovering the true secret

237
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,940
of the Jiashen Calamity than anyone else.

238
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:39,380
I've told you many times.

239
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,820
This is the greatest treasure in the world.

240
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:44,180
The weight of this deal

241
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:45,780
is worth more than every investment

242
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:47,540
The All-Encompassing Group has ever made.

243
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,500
The opportunity is right before us.

244
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,020
How can we not seize it?

245
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:52,660
What about me?

246
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:54,620
So I'm just

247
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:56,460
a bargaining chip to you?

248
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:01,500
I have many ways

249
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,060
to make Zhang Chulan stay.

250
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,380
There is only one reason

251
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:07,820
why I involved you.

252
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,100
It's for your future happiness.

253
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,300
What future happiness will I have

254
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,740
dating someone like him?

255
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,020
One mustn't judge a book

256
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,580
by its cover.

257
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:23,900
Zhang Chulan

258
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:26,300
might seem useless now,

259
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,300
but there is one thing I am sure of.

260
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,900
His heart is in the right place.

261
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:33,020
He is someone trustworthy.

262
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:33,980
Come here, Shayan.

263
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:38,940
In our position,

264
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,820
a lot of people and matters

265
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:43,540
are not what they used to be.

266
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:46,180
The people who approach you
have their own agenda.

267
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:47,620
It's even harder to judge

268
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:49,300
if someone

269
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,620
is worth trusting.

270
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,940
Zhang Chulan doesn't try to woo you

271
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:55,340
or hide his vulgarity

272
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:56,820
and tactlessness

273
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,860
because he has

274
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:00,260
no designs for you.

275
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,260
But I don't like him!

276
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:04,740
Shayan,

277
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:07,780
you're the only one

278
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:09,940
who doesn't know
the Dispatch of Detained Spirits in this family.

279
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,460
But you should know

280
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:14,300
that I've never held it against you.

281
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,220
Isn't that right?

282
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:23,820
[NDT Express]

283
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,220
I messed up…

284
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,460
Zhang Chulan left…

285
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:29,340
I messed up…

286
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,100
(Sorry.)

287
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,780
(The number you have dialed
is currently unavailable.)

288
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:33,500
I messed up…

289
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,740
Zhang Chulan left…

290
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:36,180
That Zhang Chulan is something.

291
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:36,780
I messed up…

292
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:38,460
He turned our Baobao into a depressing mess.

293
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:40,460
He was brought
to The All-Encompassing Guild last night.

294
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,660
Zhang Chulan left…

295
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:43,540
I messed up…

296
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:45,300
Hey, Wang.

297
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:47,540
How much does it cost to remove a leg these days?

298
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:50,660
Can you stop fooling around?

299
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:52,100
What if he actually joins
The All-Encompassing Guild?

300
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,500
Why are you so riled up?

301
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,140
Just have Baobao bring him back.

302
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,860
It's not that big of a deal.

303
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:59,180
It's not that easy.

304
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:01,180
He left because he had a fallout with Baobao.

305
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:02,220
I messed up…

306
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:04,020
Zhang Chulan left…

307
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:05,900
Whoever started the trouble
is the one who should end it.

308
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:06,940
Talk to her.

309
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:08,020
Not a chance.

310
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:12,260
Baobao has never given in to anyone
in all these years!

311
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:14,660
What do you suggest we do, then?

312
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:15,420
How are we going to explain it

313
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:16,820
to Dad

314
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,220
if he joined The All-Encompassing Guild?

315
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:20,820
I'll apologize to him.

316
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,380
I'll find Zhang Chulan

317
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:26,980
and tell him I was wrong.

318
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,660
Wait, Baobao!

319
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,220
You can't go like that.

320
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:32,780
Let me give you a makeover.

321
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:34,380
A makeover?

322
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:43,820
An apology should be passionate.

323
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,220
Look how lively she is!

324
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,100
You don't apologize dressed like that!

325
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:50,620
Baobao, put your hand down.

326
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:55,460
Si,

327
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:56,900
I find your taste these days

328
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:59,100
highly disagreeable.

329
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,260
It's too dirty.

330
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:02,060
My taste?

331
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,260
If it were up to me,

332
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,380
I'd get some guys

333
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:06,620
to beat him up

334
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,300
and drag him back.

335
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:09,540
Don't like my way?

336
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:11,620
You do it, then.

337
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:19,660
Baobao

338
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:20,980
has a good complexion.

339
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:22,260
She just doesn't know how to dress herself.

340
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:23,740
Look.

341
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:25,780
She looks lovely.

342
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:28,020
With her tall figure,

343
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:29,100
doesn't she look like

344
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,820
a knowledgeable beauty in the city?

345
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:34,460
San,

346
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:36,820
I knew you had an eccentric aesthetic,

347
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:39,540
but I didn't think it would be this bad.

348
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:42,700
Is Baobao going to a job interview?

349
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,420
An apology should be sincere.

350
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:45,980
More importantly,
the person receiving the apology

351
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:47,340
should be able to feel her sincerity.

352
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:48,500
Fine.

353
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:50,660
You win, San.

354
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:54,820
You wanted to see me, Xu Si?

355
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:57,460
Baobao.

356
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,700
Calm down, Baobao.

357
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:00,460
She's one of us.

358
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:01,820
Calm down.

359
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:05,180
Right.

360
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:05,940
Bao,

361
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,980
I've already accepted NDT Express' punishment.

362
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:09,260
I'm on probation.

363
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:10,980
Please give me a chance

364
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:12,420
to redeem myself!

365
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:15,500
Win-win.

366
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,260
Save the pleasantries for later.

367
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:17,820
Liu Yanyan,

368
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:19,420
give us a hand.

369
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,700
She doesn't need too much work.

370
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:29,340
The key is

371
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:31,340
a clean and good posture.

372
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:33,500
So heels are essential.

373
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,260
They make your physique look taller,

374
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:36,620
your body shape better,

375
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:38,060
and your booty firmer.

376
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:39,860
Baobao!

377
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:42,500
Are you sure about this?

378
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:44,780
Baobao,

379
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,020
you have to be careful.

380
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:49,020
The The All-Encompassing Guild is an Outsider group.

381
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:51,060
Its members are all strong Outsiders.

382
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:58,580
Feng Baobao,

383
00:14:58,580 --> 00:14:59,780
don't tell me

384
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:01,220
you've never worn heels…

385
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:19,460
(Ms. Bao,)

386
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:21,580
(if I use superpowers,)

387
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:23,740
(does that make me an Outsider?)

388
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:25,620
(Should I be a normal person)

389
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:26,980
(or an Outsider tomorrow?)

390
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:29,700
I said, come back!

391
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:30,940
(Zhang Chulan.)

392
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:33,460
This is Mr. Liang.

393
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:35,660
He's an expert traditional Chinese medicine physician
hired by The All-Encompassing Guild.

394
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:37,140
He specializes in muscle and vein therapy.

395
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,540
He's an Outsider himself.

396
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:40,020
Let him help you relax.

397
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,300
It will help with your qi circulation.

398
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:45,900
I'm sorry for what I did before.

399
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,260
Please don't take it personally.

400
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:52,140
I'll make myself comfortable, then.

401
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:01,900
How about it?

402
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:04,500
Join us,

403
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,020
and you can enjoy this every day.

404
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:10,100
What have I done

405
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,220
to warrant Miss Feng

406
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,460
making such elaborate arrangements for me?

407
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:15,940
Is this all Chairman Feng's idea?

408
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:21,860
Mr. Liang,

409
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:22,980
leave us.

410
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:34,700
It doesn't matter

411
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:35,660
if it's my father

412
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:38,260
or me.

413
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:40,540
What matters is

414
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:42,820
I can make you feel even better.

415
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:45,780
What are you doing?

416
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:49,020
This is my sincerity.

417
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,380
Can you feel it?

418
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:52,220
Not in the slightest.

419
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:54,340
You're a far cry from Mr. Liang.

420
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:55,540
Is that so?

421
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:00,500
Don't you like it?

422
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:01,940
I don't.

423
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:04,780
How about this?

424
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:06,260
What about this?

425
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:06,940
Enough…

426
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:07,980
Do you like it?

427
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:08,980
What about now?

428
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:09,980
Do you like it?

429
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:11,380
Yes…

430
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:13,340
It feels great…

431
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:32,900
Miss! Are you all right?

432
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:34,820
Can I help you?

433
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,900
Can you get me Zhang Chulan?

434
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,500
I don't know that person.

435
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,500
Which department is he from?

436
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,540
I'll look him up for you.

437
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:43,300
Can I see Chairman Feng, then?

438
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:44,420
He should know.

439
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:45,100
Sorry.

440
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,100
The chairman has an important meeting.

441
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,180
He won't be receiving any guests.

442
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:50,780
Misters,

443
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:52,220
what are you doing?

444
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:53,380
Are you dumb, miss?

445
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:54,340
We're escorting you out.

446
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:56,460
I asked you a question politely.

447
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:57,620
But you want to use force on me?

448
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:58,740
I can't accept this.

449
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:13,500
Sorry

450
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,420
for taking out your joints,

451
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,140
but

452
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:17,740
I have to see Zhang Chulan.

453
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:23,980
[No authorization. Please contact staff.]

454
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,140
Intruder!

455
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:55,780
[The Three Cadres of The All-Encompassing Guild]

456
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:20,020
Mr. Liang's

457
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:21,460
and my skills

458
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,340
should be enough to convince you to stay.

459
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,180
Never in my wildest dreams

460
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:27,620
could I ever imagine
that the young lady of the Feng family

461
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:30,460
would give me a massage.

462
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:32,580
Don't you like it?

463
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:37,220
Too many things have happened this week.

464
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:39,980
All of a sudden, I'm liked by so many.

465
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:41,140
They all want me to join them.

466
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:43,460
NDT Express,

467
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:44,580
The All-Encompassing Guild,

468
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:45,700
and Mount Longhu.

469
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:49,580
Suddenly, I've been given so many options.

470
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:51,340
But when I think about it,

471
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:53,380
they're not choices at all.

472
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:54,180
You guys

473
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:56,460
forced them on me.

474
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,220
What do you mean?

475
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:00,500
Are you saying I'm coming on to you?

476
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:04,140
Can I get a foot massage?

477
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:16,500
The Feng family does value your potential.

478
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:18,180
But

479
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:19,940
which of those other factions doesn't?

480
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:22,100
At least we're upfront,

481
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,140
and our offer is great.

482
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:24,180
Great?

483
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,620
I am my father's most prized daughter.

484
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:29,380
If nothing else,

485
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:32,740
I will be the heir to The All-Encompassing Guild.

486
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:35,220
Do you think I'm not good enough for you?

487
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:36,100
Okay.

488
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:37,140
Okay.

489
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:38,900
You are.

490
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:40,620
You are.

491
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:42,820
Chairmen Feng would use his daughter

492
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:44,580
as a bargaining chip

493
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:45,620
for someone like me?

494
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:47,060
Here's the problem, Miss Feng.

495
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:50,060
Are you really worth that much to him?

496
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:52,700
There are a lot of things you don't know.

497
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:53,940
What don't I know?

498
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:54,940
It's all for the Qi Apotheosis, right?

499
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:55,700
I told you

500
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:56,780
I know nothing about it,

501
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:58,540
but none of you would believe me!

502
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:00,420
I see Chairman Feng is determined

503
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:01,780
to take a risk with you.

504
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:02,500
You can't win unless you take risks.

505
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,700
I know that.

506
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:04,740
But what if he loses?

507
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:06,700
Chairman Feng is a smart businessman.

508
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,140
He must be aware of that.

509
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:10,340
I'm curious as to how he talked you into this.

510
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:11,580
Did he tell you

511
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:13,820
this was all for your own good?

512
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,380
I was right.

513
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:20,180
Chairman Feng wouldn't make you

514
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:20,940
approach someone you don't even know

515
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:22,620
if he really cared about you!

516
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:23,180
Stop lying to yourself,

517
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:24,660
Miss Feng!

518
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:25,580
You're just a pawn

519
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:27,260
in his schemes!

520
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:29,180
You might not even be worth as much as me.

521
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:30,460
He would sacrifice his precious daughter

522
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:32,180
for someone like me.

523
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:32,980
All he probably did

524
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:34,380
was say a few meaningless things

525
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:35,700
to convince you to do this…

526
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:42,660
Who do you think you are

527
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:43,980
to compare yourself to me?

528
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:47,020
I decide what I'm worth.

529
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:50,940
Zhang Chulan,

530
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:54,420
you've exhausted my patience.

531
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,180
One way or another,

532
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:57,900
you're staying.

No one can stop her.

536
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:05,860
She's about to break into the chairman's office.

537
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:10,420
Stop right there,

Well,

your enthusiasm is a little too much

for me to handle.

542
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,020
I'll be leaving now.

543
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,900
What was that?

544
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,020
How did you hit me from so far away?

545
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:36,460
Teleportation?

546
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:39,420
That's right.

568
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:52,900
I'll be right there.

569
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:57,820
Terribly sorry,

570
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:00,420
Master Jia.

571
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:01,540
Something urgent came up.

572
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:03,260
Please give me a moment.

573
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:04,220
Problem with an intruder?

574
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:06,820
A strong one from the Sinister Pleasure?

575
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:10,500
Apparently, it's someone from the NDT Express.

576
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:11,740
Goes by the surname Feng.

577
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:13,180
Chairmen Feng,

578
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,980
Since I've decided
to join The All-Encompassing Guild,

579
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:17,340
I'll take care of this small matter

580
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:18,700
for you.

581
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:25,980
Where's Zhang Chulan?

582
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:27,780
Where's Zhang Chulan?

583
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:29,700
Zhang Chulan?

584
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:31,740
[Jia Zhengyu of the Jia family in Shaanxi]
(I was born with a purpose,)

585
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:33,060
(and I'll deploy my talent to the fullest,
for my life's course.)

586
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:37,900
(A thousand teals of gold may be squandered,
but they will be recovered.)

587
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:44,100
Do you know where Zhang Chulan is?

588
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,660
This is disappointing.

589
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:47,380
I thought I would be up
against a formidable opponent.

590
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,220
But it turned out

591
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:50,220
to be a little lass.

592
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:52,020
You're not worth my time.

593
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:55,460
No one will tell me where Zhang Chulan is.

594
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:57,780
I'm getting

595
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:59,140
annoyed.

596
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:00,500
Complaints aside,

597
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:02,340
this is my job.

598
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:03,540
All right.

599
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:28,460
Torrential Palm!

600
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:45,460
So that's Jia Zhengyu from the Northwest?

601
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:47,220
The chairman has a good eye.

602
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:48,820
He is on a different level.

603
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:52,140
He overpowered that lass all by himself.

604
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:53,340
He is good.

605
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:56,700
I didn't let that palm land fully on me…

606
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:59,020
But why is my body numb?

607
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:00,700
Little lass,

608
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:03,340
what do you think of my Torrential Palm?

609
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:08,780
(It's qi.)

610
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:09,780
(The key lies)

611
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:11,900
(in the qi wrapped around his hands.)

612
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:13,420
(Qi that flows like water.)

613
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:14,580
(Its attack)

614
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:16,860
(seeps into your skin like water)

615
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:18,780
(and damages your internal fluids and organs.)

616
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:21,620
(Even an iron wall is defenseless against it.)

617
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:24,460
Well, little lass?

618
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:25,900
Wait.

619
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:27,260
Don't talk to me right now.

620
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:28,660
My brain fluid's all turned over.

621
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:32,140
All good now.

622
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:36,460
What…

623
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:37,940
What technique is that?

624
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:38,900
Your head's invincible!

625
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:41,700
(The only drawback of the Torrential Palm is)

626
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,460
(that it cannot kill a foe in one go.)

627
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:46,140
[Object Manipulation]

628
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:57,740
Is that hidden weapon your other trick?

629
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:00,500
Hidden weapon?

630
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:02,460
This is no hidden weapon, little lass.

631
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:03,700
This is the Dragon-Piercing Awl.

632
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:10,300
(No.)

633
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:12,020
(This isn't telekinesis.)

634
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:14,660
(Telekinetic powers)

635
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:16,700
(cannot execute attacks with such precision.)

636
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:18,140
(This guy knows object manipulation.)

637
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:32,540
Young Master,

638
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:33,900
what is he using?

639
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:36,140
This is object manipulation.

640
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:37,980
Users constantly imbue

641
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:39,220
a specific object with qi

642
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:40,340
using a secret technique

643
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:41,620
from a young age.

644
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:43,620
That enables them to control the item

645
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,860
and turn it into their weapon.

646
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:46,460
Of course,

647
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:47,940
telekinetic power users can do the same,

648
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:49,140
but it will not be as accurate

649
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:50,420
as objection manipulation,

650
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:51,620
and it consumes a high amount of qi.

651
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:52,700
If it takes

652
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:53,340
significant power

653
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:54,340
for a telekinetic user

654
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:55,940
to move an object,

655
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:56,780
then it's as easy as moving a few fingers

656
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:59,260
for an object manipulator.

657
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:03,340
In ancient times,

658
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:04,540
if an object manipulator

659
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:05,820
was seen by the ordinary folk,

660
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:07,180
myths and rumors would be spread,

661
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:10,980
giving them another name,

662
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:12,740
sword master.

663
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:16,460
Little lass,

664
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:17,820
you're a real pain.

665
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:20,460
You managed to hold your own against me
for so long.

666
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:21,900
I almost don't want to destroy you.

667
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,060
Mister,

668
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:24,620
you're tough too.

669
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:27,340
It has been a long time

670
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:29,220
since I've encountered a foe
that gives me a headache.

671
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:31,260
Just a headache?

672
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:32,700
You say that as if you have ways

673
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:33,620
to deal with me.

674
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:35,300
Not exactly.

675
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:37,620
I came to look for Zhang Chulan.

676
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:38,700
For some reason,

677
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:40,460
Liu Yanyan made me wear these.

678
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:42,700
She said it would make my booty look firmer.

679
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:43,700
I don't get it.

680
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,140
But if Zhang Chulan likes them,

681
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,540
I don't want to take them off.

682
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:49,460
But

683
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:50,740
you're too tough.

684
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:52,700
I can't win if I wear these.

685
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:09,020
I've destroyed your Gold Brilliance Spell.

686
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:10,860
Without its protection,

687
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:11,940
you won't last against my fists.

688
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:17,020
What's so funny?

689
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:18,940
Did you take a hit too hard to your head?

690
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:22,060
Miss Feng,

691
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:24,780
this fight is exhausting

692
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:26,180
and a waste of time.

693
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:27,380
Why don't we make a bet?

694
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:28,260
A bet?

695
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:29,380
On what?

696
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:36,860
If I can resist

697
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:38,500
your elusive punches,

698
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:39,900
I win,

699
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,220
and you let me go.

700
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:43,020
If I lose,

701
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:44,780
I'll join The All-Encompassing Guild.

702
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:47,660
You?

703
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:49,460
Defeat my Hundred Step Fist?

704
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:50,820
Deal.

705
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:55,380
You lost.

706
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:01,540
You don't play fair!

707
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:03,260
We didn't say when we were starting.

708
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:07,180
(Got him in the teeth.)

709
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:08,940
I'm ready.

710
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:09,820
Let's begin.

711
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,860
I'll see how you defeat me.

712
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:15,660
Impossible!

713
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,900
How did you know where my throws would be?

714
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:21,140
Let's see how you deal with it this time.

715
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:36,060
Miss Feng,

716
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:37,020
you lost.

717
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:38,660
How?

718
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:40,380
Figure it out yourself.

719
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,540
I'm leaving.

720
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:42,540
Wait.

721
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:45,540
You're not going back on your word, are you?

722
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:47,580
I, Feng Shayan, never go back

723
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:48,940
on my word.

724
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:50,020
Leave if you want.

725
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:51,460
But I have a question.

726
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:54,020
I've only ever seen
Lightning Techniques used as a defense,

727
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:55,180
but I've never known it

728
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:56,420
to be able to predict moves.

729
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:59,100
Oh, this?

730
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:01,020
[Little White Worm]
I call this Little White Worm.

731
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:02,020
I came up with it myself

732
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:02,940
after I learned the Lightning Technique.

733
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:04,740
Now I know why my father

734
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:06,460
wanted me to recruit you.

735
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:07,660
Fine.

736
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:08,340
Wait and see.

737
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:09,940
The next time you and I duel,

738
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:12,020
I'll defeat that skill of yours.

739
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:13,740
Look at yourself right now.

740
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:15,940
Your entire posture relaxed

741
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:17,420
once you decided to let me go.

742
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:20,500
You don't want to date me at all.

743
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:24,300
You rascal!

744
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:26,820
You've been trying to provoke me
from the beginning, haven't you?

745
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:31,140
Oh, right.

746
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:32,940
I have another question.

747
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:35,020
If it weren't for your father,

748
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:36,660
would you care if I stayed or left?

749
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:38,700
Why would I?

750
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,060
I just didn't want you

751
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:41,980
to walk away so easily.

752
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:43,180
You can't stop me anyway.

753
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:46,980
Honestly,

754
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:48,540
I just want someone who cares about me.

755
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:50,460
(She doesn't need powerful parents,)

756
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:51,860
(money,)

757
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:53,220
(or authority.)

758
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:54,260
(As long as she cares about me.)

759
00:31:58,060 --> 00:31:59,260
That's all that matters.

760
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:22,140
Mister,

761
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,660
you have no idea how terrifying these are.

762
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:26,620
It would take me years

763
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:27,860
to master fighting in these.

764
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:32,900
(Is my first battle at The All-Encompassing Guild)

765
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,620
(going to be a disgrace?)

766
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:35,980
(We've fought for so long.)

767
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:38,060
(Isn't this girl tired yet?)

768
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:38,540
(I shouldn't have)

769
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:40,580
(stepped in for Feng Zhenghao.)

770
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:43,700
This is boring.

771
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:44,860
I'm done.

772
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:46,380
It's pointless to fight you.

773
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:49,140
I'm just looking for Zhang Chulan.

774
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:50,460
Can you let me pass?

775
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:52,420
(She gave up.)

776
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:53,620
(Thank heavens.)

777
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:54,540
(My reputation)

778
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:55,660
(is saved.)

779
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:57,220
You've done well to last this long.

780
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:59,540
I've got a soft spot for the talented.

781
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:02,180
(I have to make myself look good)

782
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:02,860
(in front)

783
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:04,260
(of the chairman.)

784
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:06,100
Consider it a reward.

785
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:07,460
Beg me,

786
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:08,980
and I'll think about it.

787
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:12,340
Please…

788
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:13,500
Please let me pass.

789
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:16,180
Please…

790
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:18,420
Don't you know how to ask someone for a favor?

791
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:19,740
Kneel.

792
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:24,540
You're kneeling.

793
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:25,300
I can go now.

794
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:31,700
I told you to kneel before me!

795
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:33,580
Not the other way around!

796
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:39,100
You're annoying.

797
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:52,140
By the way,

798
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:54,380
can we talk about something?

799
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:56,660
Speak.

800
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:57,380
You've got magical hands.

801
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:58,100
Let's add each other on WeChat.

802
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:59,380
I'll refer you to some clients.

803
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:00,900
Die!

804
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:09,620
Heels

805
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:11,860
really are terrifying.

806
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:43,740
Zhang Chulan…

807
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:49,260
Ms. Bao?

808
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:52,820
Are you the crazy lady

809
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:54,820
they were talking about?

810
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:56,620
Are you here

811
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:58,860
to take me back?

812
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:01,260
Zhang Chulan,

813
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:02,780
come home with me.

814
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:07,580
You want me to go with you just like that?

815
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:08,300
What do you take me for?

816
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:10,540
I'm sorry.

817
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:12,420
I apologize, Zhang Chulan.

818
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:22,060
Did I hear that right?

819
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:24,020
You, Feng Baobao,

820
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:25,460
actually apologized to me?

821
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:28,260
You were right.

822
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:30,260
I shouldn't decide what you do with your life.

823
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:40,580
So,

824
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:42,780
you

825
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:44,580
barged into The All-Encompassing Guild
all on your own

826
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:47,620
to bring me back?

827
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:52,420
You expect me

828
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:53,140
to go back just like this?

829
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:54,380
I'm not an idiot.

830
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:58,300
If you're here to apologize,

831
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:01,340
that means you'll do what I say, right?

832
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:02,940
Yes.

833
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:07,220
You'll do whatever I ask!

834
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:13,020
Let me think about it.

835
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:13,820
You'll stand here

836
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:14,980
until I come up with something.

837
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:19,700
Now you know what I'm made of.

838
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:23,180
After everything he's said and done,

839
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:25,220
all he did was make her stand.

840
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:27,900
Just how scared of her

841
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:29,780
is he?

842
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:41,340
Mr. Feng,

843
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:43,540
you've been very nice to me.

844
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:44,900
But I have to go.

845
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:46,620
It's true I had a misunderstanding

846
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:47,740
with the company,

847
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:49,300
but I signed the contract.

848
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:51,100
Please understand.

849
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:54,460
So this is your decision?

850
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:57,820
Zhang Chulan,

851
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:01,460
do you think you can come and go

852
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:02,740
as you please

853
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:04,300
in The All-Encompassing Guild?

854
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:14,260
Is this

855
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:16,540
one of the legendary Eight Supremes,

856
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:17,980
the Feng family's ultimate skill,

857
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:19,780
Dispatch of Detained Spirits?

858
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:22,980
This skill allows the user

859
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:25,220
to recapture qi spirits and primordial spirits

860
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:26,380
for his own use

861
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:28,380
and enhance his power.

862
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:29,980
Zhang Chulan, let me handle this.

863
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:31,100
Ms. Bao,

864
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:33,020
I told you to stand there.

865
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:35,140
There are some things I have to settle by myself.

866
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:36,860
Zhang Chulan,

867
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:39,380
don't force my hand.

868
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:45,420
(Such pressure…)

869
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:46,700
(So this is the true power)

870
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:48,380
(of the legendary Eight Supremes…)

871
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:51,900
Even I have never seen

872
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:53,260
the primordial spirit my father summoned.

873
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:55,460
Its bloodlust is strong.

874
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:57,180
He's not actually going
to kill Zhang Chulan, is he?

875
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:01,780
(What do I do now?)

876
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:02,740
Zhang Chulan,

877
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:04,380
don't be a fool. Surrender!

878
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:09,060
Sorry, Chairman. My mind is made up.

879
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:17,660
Little brat,

880
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:19,660
you're not playing fair.

881
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:22,340
You knew I wouldn't kill you

882
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:23,540
on the spot,

883
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:25,220
given my high standing.

884
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:27,540
You're the real deal, sir.

885
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:28,580
You've seen through

886
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:30,460
my every thought.

887
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:32,780
Even so,

888
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:34,180
you actually stood firm

889
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:36,060
in the face

890
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:37,700
of my qi.

891
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:38,780
That's a rare sight.

892
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:44,420
I like you even more now.

893
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:49,500
Go with her.

894
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:52,260
Thank you, sir.

895
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:52,900
I'm going to become

896
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:54,420
a man like you!

897
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:01,780
Who is he?

898
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:02,420
Don't know.

899
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:04,340
A man that fought me.

900
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:05,460
Little lass,

901
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:09,620
we're not done yet!

902
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:11,900
He is persistent.

903
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:13,460
What do we do? Do we fight?

904
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:14,540
Master Jia,

905
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:16,260
forget it.

906
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:17,420
Go back and get yourself treated.

907
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:19,740
Feng Zhenghao,

908
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:21,700
don't talk to me like that!

909
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:25,060
But

910
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:26,580
if you attack him,

911
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:28,540
you can probably take him out in one hit.

912
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:29,660
Die!

913
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:32,260
All of you!

914
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:53,180
Ms. Bao…

915
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:57,580
Why didn't you dodge?

916
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:01,300
You told me to stand.

917
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:11,900
See?

918
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:13,300
I didn't move.
