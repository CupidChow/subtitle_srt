[My eyes! I need to clean my eyes.]
(His physique looks pretty decent.)

190
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,500
[May I never run into a pervert like this.]
(I think I've seen this guy before.)

191
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,340
[Heavens! I can't bear to look at it.]

192
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:23,380
(Oh, my eyes...)

193
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:26,740
If you see this Bum-naked Hero

194
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:29,020
under the full moon,

195
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:29,820
you'll meet your true love.

196

[Appearance of Bum-naked Hero shocked the campus.]
True love?

197

[Anyone who saw this person]
This is shocking.

198

[will not stay single anymore this year.]
That snow-white buttock

199
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,580
is the shining beacon of hope

200
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:35,380
for us single folks.

201
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:37,220
Look. My angel is actually out and about

202
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:38,700
with bandages.

203
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,100
What a dedicated effort to spread love.

204
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,180
I'm telling you it's not wrong to believe him.

205
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:41,940
Our true love depends entirely on him.

206
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:42,660
Oh.

207
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:44,980
That was you, right?

208
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,420
Is your arm better now?

209
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:58,740
I'm in good health.

210
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:05,020
Who did it?

211
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:08,260
It was me.

212
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:09,540
Do you have a problem with that?

213
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:17,540
Nothing.

214
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:19,340
Just be careful next time.

215
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,540
Excuse me.

You sounded cocky earlier.

219

Luckily, you're pretty

220

Resident Supervisor, you're back early.

222
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,460
I didn't see him all day.

223
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:12,820
I think he's already asleep.

224
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:13,620
Should we invite him to go online later?

225
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,180
No need.

226
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:15,500
He's odd and anti-social.

227
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,620
He even sneaks around to avoid us
when going to the toilet.

228
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,500
He doesn't have a single friend.

229
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,260
I'm telling you,

230
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,820
don't bother with this unlucky guy.

231
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:24,820
Nothing good ever happens.

232

Chulan.

233
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,300
Have you been feeling unlucky

234

where everything seems to go wrong lately?

235
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:34,300
Am I right?

236
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,740
No.

237
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,020
Take this.

238
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,420
Look at you pouting your lips.

239
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,580
You can practically hang
a soy sauce bottle there.

240
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:44,500
Do you think I didn't notice?

241
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,380
Listen.

242
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:47,420
Fate

243
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,700
is predestined.

244
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,220
It's beyond your control.

245
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,460
No one can change it.

246
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,060
But luck

247
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:55,700
is different.

248
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:56,700
Look at these.

249
00:09:58,700 --> 00:09:59,740
These peaks represent

250
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:01,860
hardships in life.

251
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:02,740
We may not know

252

where they will turn in the end.

253
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,260
But wave after wave,

254
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:08,060
they go up and down.

255
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:09,460
This shows

256
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:10,860
when you're at your unluckiest time,

257
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,340
you must hang in there.

258
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:14,380
It's during this persistence

Attention, everyone.

276
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:24,940
Today, we're going to talk

277
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:26,460
about divination.

278
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:27,420
The art of divination

279
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,500
requires adaptability.

280
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:31,820
I've been looking for you all morning.

281

285

and be back in the evening.

286
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,140
Then you'll come with me to meet someone.

287
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:43,780

00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:52,860
thinking they could fool everyone.

00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:48,620
I wasn't texting anyone.

377
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:49,580
Then...

378
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:54,140
Could it be your girlfriend checking up on you?

379
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:56,260
I don't have a girlfriend.

380
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:58,100
Really?

381
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:01,180
Yeah.

382
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:02,660
Why would I lie to you?

383
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,540
That's fortunate to hear.

384
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:05,900
I don't have a boyfriend either.

385
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:08,860
Chulan,

386
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:10,940
I was quite happy

387
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:12,820
when you said you don't have a girlfriend.

388
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,260
I'll go faster, okay?

389
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:22,020
Okay.

390
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:25,060
Chulan, you're great at this.

391
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:14,300
Where's my Grandpa's body?

392
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:20,260
When did you find out?

393
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:23,420
I went to the Faculty of Classical Chinese Studies

394
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:24,260
to look up your name.

395
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:25,860
But your name wasn't listed.

396
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,580
I started to feel suspicious then.

397
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:30,340
My mind was telling me

398
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,980
that a romantic encounter out of nowhere

399
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,540
would never be my turn.

400
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:35,700
But guess what? It was a plot!

401
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,740
One can never truly hide their true colors.

402
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,260
So tell me.

403
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:48,140
What's your purpose?

404
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,300
Bring his grandson here,

405
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,220
dead or alive.

406
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:52,740
Then,

407
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:53,740
you can join us.

408
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,460
What the heck?

409
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,420
You even gathered help?

410

[Liu Yanyan, Thrall Master of Xiangxi]

411
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:17,260
Who are you trying to scare with those masks, huh?

412
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:18,380
Do you think I'm a pushover

413
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:19,740
that anyone can push me around, huh?

414
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:23,980
What is this?

415
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,340
How did you manage to control me?

416
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:32,740
They've made their move.

417
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:37,380
I heard there are some mysterious people
infiltrating this city.

418
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:38,700
It looks like the news is true.

419
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:42,140
Do you mean those from Sinister Pleasure?

420
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:44,060
Don't be careless.

421
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:45,380
We're not dealing with someone mediocre this time.

422
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:46,540
Get ready to work.

423
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:24,380
Excuse me, where is this place?

424
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,740
Sure enough,

425
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:38,100
you're the descendant of that respected senior.

426
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:40,340
It's the same power.

427
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,500
Even though it's sealed,

428
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:46,500
I can still feel the immense power within you.

429
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:01,300
Is this a seal?

430
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:05,820
I never expected Zhang Xilin
would come up with this move.

431
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:08,860
Not a bit of his primordial energy has leaked out.

432
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:18,140
Xia He,

433
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:19,980
you're not planning to do it here, are you?

434
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:21,820
At least, let me do what I need.

435
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:22,700
After that,

436
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:23,980
you can do whatever you want with him.

437
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:28,740
Then you better be quick

438
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:30,620
and don't spoil him.

439
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:32,740
I'll begin, then.

440
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,060
What are you doing?

441
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,940
We just want to search for something.

442
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,500
Like what?

443
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,300
Your memory, of course.

444
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:46,500
Memories?

445
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,980
What kind of memories?

446
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:50,260
Every memory of your grandfather.

447
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:51,700

450
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:55,180
do you decide that?

451
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,740
Allow me to introduce myself.

452
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:05,580
I'm Lyu Liang from Sinister Pleasure.

453
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:08,300
I can directly inquire
about someone's primordial spirit

454
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,980
and examine their primordial spirit.

455
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,820
I won't extract all of your primordial spirit.

456
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,460
I only need to grasp
certain parts of your memories,

457
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:14,300
and that will be sufficient.

458
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:16,860
Relax a bit.

459
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:18,620
It'll be over soon.

460
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:21,300
I've brought Zhang Chulan here.

461
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,980
Isn't it time to fulfill your promise?

462
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:25,500
Can I join you now?

463
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,540
Congratulations.

There's no initiation ceremony,

469
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:34,100
or things like tattoos?

470
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:38,860
No need for all that trouble.

471
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:41,060
You only need to declare to the outside world
that you're a member of the Sinister Pleasure.

472
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:41,820
That's all.

473
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,420
Then why did you make me go through the trouble?
