I guess

00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,580
he'll only act until all of them are exhausted.

No, you don't.

does it worth?

I can't believe he won the match with this method.

that the commentators

646
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:19,980
and not join the contest?

647
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,380
Because I can only attract the lightning

00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:26,580
with slow and small heat.

763
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:27,020
Look, the juice oozes out.

764
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:28,140
I'm running late.

765
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:31,700
She didn't pay me.

766
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:35,340
Dear Taoists.

767
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:36,540
I'm so sorry.

768
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:37,900
Xu's Restaurant

769
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:38,740
is packed.

770
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:43,620
Well,

771
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:44,780
let's chat a little over some beers.

772
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:46,540
First, I'll make myself clear.

773
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:47,860
For what I'm going to tell you later,

774
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:49,020
you two

775
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:50,940
can never expose me.

776
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:51,620
Of course, I won't.

777
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:52,580
Don't worry.

778
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:54,100
Sit...

779
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,300
I, Zhang Chulan,

780
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:57,740
am very tight-lipped.

781
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:59,140
Zhang Chulan.

782
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:01,220
You're wrong about one thing.

783
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:01,740
What's it?

784
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:02,740
The reason

785
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:04,020
why Martial Uncle

786
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:05,420
ices you out

787
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:07,140
isn't because he loathes you.

788
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,900
Instead,

789
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:09,340
he's jealous of you.

790
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:11,340
Jealous of me?

791
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:12,540
Look,

792
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:13,420
I told you so.

793
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:15,460
Chief Celestial Taoist shows favor to you,
who's not a disciple.

794
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:16,100
That's why Martial Uncle

795
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:17,060
gets jealous.

796
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:18,700
Jeez, wrong.

797
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:20,900
It's not about that.

798
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:22,260
What's it, then?

799
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:27,940
Because

800
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:29,060
of the Lightning Techniques.

801
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:31,220
Lightning Techniques?

802
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:32,060
I thought

803
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:33,020
both of us knew that.

804
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:34,140
Have you found

805
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:36,100
the difference

806
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:37,260
between the Lightning Techniques of yours?

807
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:40,580
[Yin Lightning, Yang Lightning]

808
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:42,860
His is black.

809
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:44,220
That's right.

810
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:45,340
That's called

811
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:45,980
Five Elements Yin Lightning.

812
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:48,060
Per the rules of Mount Longhu,

813
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:48,700
the Chief Celestial Taoist

814
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:50,300
can impart the Lightning Techniques

815
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:51,180
to his desired disciple.

816
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:52,340
However,

817
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:53,740
it's can only be half of it.

818
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:55,180
For the complete version
of Five Elements Lightning Techniques,

819
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:57,580
only the successor
of the Chief Celestial Taoist

820
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:58,580
is eligible to have it.

821
00:32:58,580 --> 00:32:59,380
Besides, only certain people

822
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:00,580
can acquire the other half
of the Lightning Techniques.

823
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:01,460
No doubt,

824
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:02,460
their strength must be top-notch.

825
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:03,700
However,

826
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:05,900
there's a demanding term.

827
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:07,860
The cultivator must be

828
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:09,420
a virgin.

829
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:10,220
Do you understand?

830
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:10,900
I do.

831
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:14,580
Oh, he doesn't.

832
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:16,780
Well, you can't...

833
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:17,540
You can't do this

834
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:18,460
and that.

835
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:20,580
Afterward, the seniors discovered

836
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:22,180
that many started the cultivation

837
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:23,900
at an older age,

838
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:25,500
and only very few of them

839
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,660
met this requirement.

840
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:29,700
Hence, they modified the said half.

841
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:31,100
For those non-virgins,

842
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:32,340
they can practice

843
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:34,020
Five Elements Yin Lightning.

844
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:35,540
While the half

845
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:36,340
you cultivated

846
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:38,540
is the original Lightning Technique,

847
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:40,260
Five Elements Yang Technique.

848
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:42,260
This is the reason

849
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:44,660
why Martial Uncle gets jealous of you.

850
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,100
Even he

851
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:50,380
got a love life.

852
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:03,540
Grandpa.

853
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,580
You know what?

854
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:09,980
Even Zhang Lingyu got a love life.

855
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:13,940
I don't want to cry.

856
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:15,500
But even that fellow

857
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:17,260
got a love life.

858
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:18,900
Why are you crying?

859
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:26,620
Don't ask.

860
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:27,580
Come with me.

861
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:29,460
I'll make you happy.

862
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:54,900
Ms. Bao.

863
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:56,420
Where are you taking me to?

864
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:57,380
We haven't arrived yet.

865
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:00,380
Maybe we can go back to the hotel room?

866
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:13,820
Shan Shitong?

867
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:14,540
Are you

868
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:15,460
happy now?

869
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:16,860
You tied him up and brought him here?

870
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:17,540
Yeah.

871
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:18,420
I'm going to start working now.

872
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:20,580
Later, I'll dig a hole over there

873
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:21,660
and bury him inside.

874
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:22,740
Are you insane, Ms. Bao?

875
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:23,980
He will die.

876
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:25,020
I'll leave his head outside.

877
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:26,020
He won't die.

878
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:28,140
I've inspected this place.

879
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:29,220
No one comes here.

880
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:30,820
Besides, I bought him
some chicken drumsticks and milk tea.

881
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:31,700
He won't go hungry.

882
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:35,180
I got it now.

883
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:37,460
So, this is your reason here.

884
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:40,380
To remove any obstacle on my way
to the championship.

885
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:41,740
You just figured this out now?

886
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:43,300
But this is too despicable.

887
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:44,180
If anyone were to find out about this,

888
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:45,500
my good reputation would be ruined.

889
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:47,380
Do you even have a good reputation?

890
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:49,260
None of your business.

891
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:50,220
You can't do this.

892
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:52,900
They always say I'm silly.

893
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:53,980
But I'm not silly at all.

894
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:55,100
Most of the time,

895
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:56,420
I know I'm witty.

896
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:58,020
Witty, my foot.

897
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:59,060
If I can fight you,

898
00:35:59,060 --> 00:35:59,620
I would like to find out

899
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:00,820
what it is

up top!

901
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:03,220
Also, where did you get that shovel from?

902
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:04,460
Do you really like burying people?

903
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:05,700
We'll get kicked out of here

904
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:06,740
if he tells on us

905
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:08,300
when he gets out!

906
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,700
It's not right to bury people.

907
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:11,220
I've told you many times.

908
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:11,820
It's fine.

909
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:12,540
If he tells on us,

910
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:13,540
we can deny it.

911
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:15,260

912

Shut your mouth
