What does Sinister Pleasure want?

33

You must have

34
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:38,140

37
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:43,340
To keep their power from disappearing,

38
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:44,300
they will commit murders.

39
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:46,420
But the more they kill,

40
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:47,820
the more qi they lose.

41
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,820
Eventually, they lose their humanity.

42
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:54,140

Several years ago,

90
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,860
to perfect the Flowing Rainbow,

91
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:19,980
I traveled around

92
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:22,820

for my analysis.

93
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,260
I've been to this nation

94
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:26,580
where the punishment for felons

95
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:27,340
is the removal

96
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,540

97
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:30,820

99
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:35,300
and even what kind of person they were.

100
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:38,620
For those criminals, their qi

101
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:41,140
will turn transparent and colorless

102
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,260
after the procedure.

103
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:43,900
They essentially remove

104
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,140
their primordial spirit,

105
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:46,340
dignity,

106
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:47,060
and pride.

107
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:49,740
They are robbed of what makes them humans.

108
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:52,020
And Feng Baobao is in this state now.

109
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,220

♪Lonely and desolate♪

194
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:17,860
I'm afraid of the mountain.

195
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:18,620
If we don't forage,

196
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:19,780
what do we eat?

197
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:20,620
Right.

198
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:24,860
Miss,

199
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:26,220
why are you here all alone?

200
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:27,540
It's getting dark.

201
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:28,900
It will be dangerous.

202
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:30,700
You don't look local.

203
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:35,460
She's

204
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:37,660
quite beautiful, isn't she?

205
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,180
What are you doing?

206
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:40,540
Don't do this!

207
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:41,740
This isn't right.

208
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:43,300
She doesn't mind.

209
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:43,740
Stop it.

210
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:44,180
Stop.

211
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:45,820
You two!

212
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:46,700
What are you doing?

213
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:47,300
Chase them!

214
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:48,940
Perverts! How dare you!

215
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:54,660
Don't come back!

Are you all right?

218
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:08,180
Miss.

219
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:09,700
What is your name?

220
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:11,700
Let us walk you home.

221
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:21,300
Come inside.

222
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,020
I'll get you some warm water.

223

[Xu Xiang, 8 years old]

This is our son.

229
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:59,060
His name is Xu Xiang.

230
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,660
You can call him Xiang.

231
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:04,540
Come.

232
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:07,740
I have warm water here.

233
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:14,460
Come on.

234
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:15,740
Have something warm.

235
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:19,900
Warm water.

236
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:27,660
What a poor girl.

237
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:29,340
She seems to have lost her memory.

238
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:31,940
And she is mute.

239
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:36,020
She is dressed

240
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:39,020
like a young lady from a wealthy family.

241
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:40,540
Let's head to the town tomorrow

242
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:42,780
to check which family lost a daughter.

243
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:44,900
Okay.

244
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:47,260
I'll get her some food.

245
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:49,980
Maybe she's starving.

246
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:57,620
(Miss.)

247
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,380
Go to bed.

248
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:00,220
Tomorrow,

249
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:01,580
my husband will head to the town

250
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:02,860
to find your family.

251
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:07,220
You're safe now.

252
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:09,260
If you need something, let us know.

253
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,060
We'll protect you.

254
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:15,300
Come on.

255
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:35,700
One.

256
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:36,300
Two.

257
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,020
Three.

258
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:43,020
Enough.

259
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:44,700
It's too tough.

260
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:45,980
Then don't chop it.

261
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:46,740
Come in.

262
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:47,860
After you.

263
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:48,780
Hurry up.

264
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:49,900
Come on.

265
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:55,780
Close the door.

266
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:57,820
Close the door.

267
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:01,140
Did you go to the town?

268
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:02,180
Yes.

269
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:03,460
No one lost a daughter.

270
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:05,220
The town hall

271
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:07,180
did ask me to bring her to them tomorrow.

272
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:08,660
The town hall?

273
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:10,220
They can take her in?

274
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,260
No idea.

275
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,060
That place is for official business.

276
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:17,420
If her family doesn't show up,

277
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:19,060
she'll be thrown around like a ball.

278
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:20,380
I feel bad.

279
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:21,780
But we can't

280
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,620
let her stay here for long.

281
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:25,780
People will talk.

282
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:26,780
Besides,

283
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:28,780
that's one more mouth to feed.

284
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:30,540
So?

285
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:32,380
I don't care.

286
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:33,420
Give me a solution.

287
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,380
What can I do?

288
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:36,940
Just forget it.

289
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:37,820
I'll send her

290
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:39,100
to the town hall tomorrow.

291
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,580
Wow!

292
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:42,460
Do it again.

293
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:43,420
Hurry.

294
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:44,100
Again.

295
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,580
Wow!

296
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:46,380
Again.

297
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:49,020
Wow!

298
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:49,740
Do it again.

299
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,900
Hurry.

300
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:53,500
Chop one more.

301
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:55,140
Wow!

302
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:55,940
Again.

303
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:56,940
Hurry.

304
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:57,700
Again.

305
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:58,140
Wow!

306
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:59,380
Your back is acting up.

307
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,660
Should we keep her?

308
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:04,980
(My dad)

309
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,900
(even visited the neighboring towns)

310
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,420
(to ask around.)

311
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:12,260
(He got nothing on this woman.)

312
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:16,380
(And so, she stayed in my house.)

313
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:19,060
(Back then, many people sought refuge)

314
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:22,740
(in the woods.)

315
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:27,380
(Since she refused to speak)

316
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,940
(or answer our questions,)

317
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,980
(we called her Wu.)
(*Wu as in nothing)

318
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:36,820
(Before my family fell from grace,)

319
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:40,460
(they were a literate bunch.)

320
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:43,180
(And so, teaching Wu how to speak)

321
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:46,100
(became my mother's task.)

322
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,020
That is a dog.

323
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:50,820
Dog?

324
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:01,780
Stop chasing him.

325
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:03,100
You're scaring him.

326
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,420
(My mother said)

327
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:04,940
(that Wu)

328
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:07,860
(might have forgotten everything)

329
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:10,300
(due to trauma.)

330
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,020
(She even)

331
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,660
(had proof.)

332
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:29,260
Xu!

333
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:30,380
Xiang.

334
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:35,100
This is...

335
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,260
What did she write?

336
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:37,500
[Feng Baobao.]

337
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,300
Feng Baobao?

338
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:41,380
Feng Baobao.

339
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:43,300
This is the only thing that came to my mind.

340
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,580
I think this is my name.

341
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:46,780
I knew it.

342
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:47,940
A pretty woman like you

343
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,340
definitely can speak.

344
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:50,820
She can write too.

345
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:54,300
(My mom became enthused.)

346
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,380
(She began to teach Wu and me)

347
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:56,780
(how to read and write.)

348
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:59,420
(She gave up once)

349
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:00,940
(because she deemed me)

350
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,580
(too stupid for it.)

351
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,140
Xiang, look at Wu.

352
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,580
Then look at you.

353
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:06,020
Mom.

354
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:08,060
You know my noggin doesn't work.

355
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:08,940
Besides,

356
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,260
Wu knows how to write.

357
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:11,380
She just forgot about it.

358
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:13,300
But now, she recalled it.

359
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:15,780
Wu,

360
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,460
other than your name,

361
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,260
did you recall anything

362
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:20,140
about your past?

363
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:23,740
Your past.

364
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,220
Wu?

365
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:36,580
Are you okay?

366
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:37,580
Wu.

367
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:40,220
What happened?

368
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,380
Go get Mr. Xu.

369
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:42,980
He used to be a physician.

370
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:43,780
Wu.

371
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:44,660
Are you okay?

372
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:45,420
Wu!

373
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,020
Mom.

374
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:08,820
Mr. Xu is here.

375
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:09,780
Here we are.

376
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:10,340
Slow down.

377
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:11,820
Mom.

378
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:14,100
What is Wu doing?

379
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:17,300
I don't know.

380
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,860
She got up

381
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:20,620
and sat down like that.

382
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,260
Her palms face the Heaven.

383
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,620
Perhaps she is cultivating qi?

384
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:25,900
Cultivating qi?

385
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:26,660
Qi?

386
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:28,740
Cultivating qi

387
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:29,780
is what

388
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:31,740
Mystics do.

389
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:32,780
When I was younger,

390
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:34,540
I wanted to cultivate qi under a mentor.

391
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:35,580
I knelt before his abode

392
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:37,020
for three days.

393
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:38,380
He

394
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:40,540
took me in as his disciple in the end,

395
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:42,820
but regrettably,

396
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:43,740
I did not have the talent for it.

397
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:44,780
(That was)

(getting to know qi.)

400
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:48,540
(At that moment,)

401
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:50,780
(I could only feel)

402
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:52,180
(a revitalizing breeze)

403
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:54,900

Don't tell anyone

406
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,660

407
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:02,780
You wouldn't want any trouble.

408

This woman

409

410
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:09,340
than you imagined.

411
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,420
Wu, what happened to you during the day?

412
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:17,340
No idea.

413
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:19,140
My head felt like bursting.

414
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:20,340

416
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:23,060
And then?

417
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,340
And then I meditated.

418
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:25,660
I felt better after a while.

419
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:26,900
Who taught you that?

420
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,340
The qi thing.

421
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:29,780
I don't know.

422
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:31,580
I guess I learned it in the past.

423
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:33,060
It allows me

424
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:35,420
to stir everything inside me.

425
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:36,260
Once it flows smoothly,

426
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:37,300
the pain goes away.

427
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:38,580
It feels good.

428
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:39,740
No wonder.

429
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,820
You have it inside you too.

430
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:43,020
I can feel it.

431
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:44,020
Me?

432
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:45,860
You don't trust me?

433
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:46,860
Do it with me.

434
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:02,820
There's nothing.

435
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:04,260
I have been sitting like this for a while,

436
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:06,140
and I feel nothing.

437
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:07,020
How odd.

438
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:09,740
I can feel it when I sit like this.

439
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:11,780
Meditate. I'll check on you.

440
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:19,580
I see it now.

441
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:20,780
Your thoughts are all over the place.

442
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:22,260
Your mind needs to be calm.

443
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:23,020
Come on!

444
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:25,180
How can you tell that my thoughts
are all over the place?

445
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:26,820
Of course I can.

446

what you're thinking about,

448
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:30,180
but I can feel

449
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:31,580
that you're not calm.

450
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:34,380
That thing is like water.

451
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:37,100
Distractions will scatter it.

452
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,660
When you're calm,

453
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:40,900
it starts to gather and assemble

454
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:41,620
inside you.

455
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:42,340
Gather

456
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:43,340
and assemble.

457
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:45,180
It then stays in your tummy.

00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:47,060
should give up on Wu.

581
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:48,580
Her noggin isn't good enough

582
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:49,580
to understand you.

583
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:50,340
I

584
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:51,260
can decide

585
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:52,500
for her.

586
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:53,420
We

587
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:54,900
have a lot of ducks here.

588
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:57,500
But we only have one Wu.

589
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,740
This doesn't make sense.

590
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:01,060
Wu isn't even your daughter.

591
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:02,380
How can you decide for her?

592
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:04,340
Wu isn't my daughter.

593
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:06,180
So I can't marry her off to anybody.

594
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:07,740
Second Aunt,

595
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:09,020
what if one day

596
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,260
her parents

597
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:11,580
showed up?

598
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:12,820
Imagine.

599
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:14,860
How am I supposed to face them?

600
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:16,500
Nonsense!

601
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:17,780
You just want to keep her

602
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:19,940
for your son.

603
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:21,700
Second Aunt.

604
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,500
I don't know about that.

605
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:25,100
I do know that she isn't

606
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,700
going to be your daughter-in-law.

607
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:27,980
Have fun

608
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:29,260
raising those two idiots

609
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:30,700
all your life, then.

610
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:32,420
Unbelievable!

611
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:34,300
Curse it!

612
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:35,940
This is getting on my nerve!

613
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:39,380
Come inside.

614
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:46,820
Listen, just now, you were...

615
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:48,740
Are you stupid?

616
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:52,020
Her son is dull.

617
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:54,020
And so is she.

618
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:55,860
No one in their right mind

619
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:57,460
would marry their daughter to her son.

620
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:58,380
You

621
00:28:58,380 --> 00:28:59,460
are trying to ruin Wu's life?

622
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:01,300
But Wu

623
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:02,660
can't stay with us forever.

624
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:04,260
She's an adult now.

625
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:05,020
It's

626
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:06,100
not right.

627
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,380
When I'm free tomorrow,

628
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:09,460
I'll take to her to the town.

629
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:11,020
I'll find her a husband. All right?

630
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:13,660
I guess that's the only option we have.

631
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:25,180
Dad, Mom,

632
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,260
even if we can't find her family,

633
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:28,860
we can't throw her away.

634
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:34,180
Can we

635
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:36,860
adopt her,

636
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:38,500
then?

637
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:42,100
So Second Aunt is right.

638
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:42,860
You do

639
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:44,420
fancy her.

640
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:46,780
Perhaps

641
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:48,220
I can adopt her as my goddaughter.

642
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:49,420
You'll have a sister.

643
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:50,580
Mom!

644
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:54,340
I've been thinking.

645
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:56,660
If we cannot find her family,

646
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:58,460
we can only accept her

647
00:29:58,460 --> 00:29:59,500
as our family.

648
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:01,900
What do you mean?

649
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:04,100
Are you saying that she's stupid

650
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:05,860
or that Xiang is not good enough for her?

651
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:07,780
No, I don't think she's stupid at all.

652
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:09,940
I just think that she's so distant.

653
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:11,100
So cold.

654
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:13,020
Even a dog

655
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,580
will show gratitude.

656
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:17,620
Does she

657
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:18,780
treat us

658
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:20,700
as her family?

659
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:23,060
You're quite emotional, aren't you?

660
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:24,100
No, I'm not.

661
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:26,020
Wu.

662
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:28,700
Do you like us?

663
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:29,660
Do you like Xiang?

664
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:32,380
Like?

665
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:36,500
What is "like"?

666
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:40,500
See? She doesn't know what affection is.

667
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:43,100
I was just joking.

668
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:44,180
Like...

669
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:48,220
I like...

670
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:51,980
Like...

671
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:55,980
Wu.

672
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:57,380
Like...

673
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:58,660
Wu...

674
00:30:58,660 --> 00:30:59,460
Like...

675
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:00,460
Okay.

676
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:01,460
We forget it.

677
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:03,740
Like...

678
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:05,580
Forget it.

679
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:06,700
Like...

680
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:09,500
Like...

681
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:14,300
Like...

682
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:15,740
What is "like"?

683
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:17,060
All right.

684
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:19,460
Wu.

685
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:20,820
Stop thinking about it.

686
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:25,460
I was just saying. Don't take it to heart.

687
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:26,020
There, there.

Thank you.

701
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:18,620
(Wu.)

702
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,940
We'll get to see the family photo

704
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:24,380
Family photo?

705
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:26,220
What is that?

706
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:28,700
It's a photo of all of us together.

707
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:30,180
Dig in.

708
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:30,620
Wu.

709
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:32,540
You have been here for five years now.

710
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:33,380
We don't know

711
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:34,780
when your birthday is.

712
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:36,220
I was thinking.

713
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:38,020
We should use the date of your arrival

714
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:39,220
as your birthday.

715
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:42,500
Wu.

716
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:43,860
Happy birthday.

717
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:50,380
What is a birthday?

718
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:51,940
Birthday is the day

719
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:53,500
you get to eat many good things.

720
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:54,340
On my previous

721
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:55,020
birthday,

722
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:57,220
Mom boiled me two eggs.

723
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:58,380
Two eggs.

724
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:00,380
Have some more.

725
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:02,540
So all this food is for me?

726
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:04,260
Well, yes.

727
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:05,500
Eat.

728
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,620
Mine.

729
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:10,340
Mine.

730
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:57,420
Xiang.

731
00:33:58,180 --> 00:34:01,260
I kept one last slice of meat for you.

732
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:11,700
Is it delicious?

733
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:14,100
Say thank you, then.

734
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:15,780
Thanks, Wu.

735
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:38,740
(Wu)

736
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:41,620
(became our fondest family member.)

737
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:45,700
But the blissful days

738
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:50,100
were soon interrupted

739
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:51,580
by a tragedy.

740
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:58,340
Don't resist!

741
00:34:58,340 --> 00:34:59,460
Move it!

742
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:00,780
Take

743
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:02,260
all food

744
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:03,620
and valuables.

745
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:05,180
Hurry up.

746
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:06,820
Don't resist!

747
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:07,300
Stay there!

748
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:11,820
That's our lamb!

749
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:12,900
Sit back down!

750
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:16,620
Gather these villagers

751
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:17,700
later

752
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:19,460
and burn them alive.

753
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:21,420
Leave no survivor, lest they expose us.

754
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:22,820

Please.

769
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:58,740
She's young.

00:35:58,740 --> 00:35:59,180
Spare her...

What do you think of her?

775
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:35,060
Stay right there!

776
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:39,380
Xiang!

777
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:43,300
What a cruel world!

778
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:47,660
This is not fair!

779
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:53,740
This is not fair!

780
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:01,060
Ms. Zhao.

781
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:03,860
For some reason,

782
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:05,420
when I see you cry,

783
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:07,060
I feel sad.

784
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:08,860
This place

785
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:10,020
hurts.

786
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:13,300
I don't want to see you cry.

787
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:14,820
I don't want to see Mr. Xu

788
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:15,820
and Xiang

789
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:16,780
getting hurt.

790
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:18,980
I want to see you smile.

791
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:21,820
I want to hear you sing.

792
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:25,260
Does this mean I like all of you?

793
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:26,220
Ms. Zhao.

794
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:27,300
I like you.

795
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:28,340
I like Mr. Xu.

796
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:29,780
I like Xiang.

797
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:32,700
Wu.

798
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:37,340
I envy you at times.

799
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:40,420
You can stay ignorant.

800
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:46,780
Ms. Zhao.

801
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:48,500
I don't want you to cry.

802
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:50,020
I want you to be happy.

803
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,260
How can I make you happy?

804
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:55,580
My husband is dead.

805
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:58,300
What do you think

806
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:00,460
can make me happy?

807
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:03,340
Ms. Zhao...

808
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:05,980
All right.

809
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:12,740
I want all of them dead!

810
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:16,580
That woman

811
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:17,820
is feisty.

812
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:18,940
I dig that.

813
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:35,980
All right, Ms. Zhao.

814
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:37,660
I'll kill all of them.

815
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:38,780
You pack a punch,

816
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:39,700
lass.

817
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:40,580
You're trained?

818
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:53,100
(My mother thought)

819
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:55,100
(the bloodbath)

820
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:56,820
(would)

821
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:58,740
(traumatize me.)

822
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:00,340
(Little did she know)

823
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:02,060
(that for someone)

824
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:02,820
(who has one foot)

825
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:05,820
(in the Outsiders world like me,)

826
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:08,860
(what I saw)

827
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:12,140
