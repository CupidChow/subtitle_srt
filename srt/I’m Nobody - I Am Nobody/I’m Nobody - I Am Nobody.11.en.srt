00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,270
[Rong, local bully]
Visit us again.

190
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:35,480
[Rong, local bully]
Let's not talk about other places.

191
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,880
[Rong, local bully]
But I'm in charge here.

192
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,960
[Rong, local bully]
This is mine.

193
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,480
I'll make you a home here, okay?

194
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,480
No.

195
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:44,240
I have only one wife now,

196
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,510
yet it's already overwhelming to handle her.

197
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:47,120
Why not?

198
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,150
True men mustn't say no.

199
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:50,510
You must be capable.

200
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:52,270
No.

201
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:54,790
What are you doing?

202
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:55,910
I'm paying.

203
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:57,030
What are you paying for?

204
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:58,150
I'm in charge here.

205
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:00,120
Miss.

206
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,240
What would you like to order?

207
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:03,630
Two servings of Char Siu Bao.

208
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:05,910
Char Siu Bao.

209
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:07,360
Okay.

210
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:09,390
Hey.

211
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:11,360
Stop!

212
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:29,270
The buns are here.

213
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,750
Are these for us?

214
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:43,390
No.

215
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:44,750
When in society,

216
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,360
you must be loyal.

217
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:50,200
Baobao shall eat it first.

218
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,270
When Baobao is full,

219
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:52,670
then we'll eat.

220
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,430
Baobao.

221
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:23,510
Are you making a fool out of us?

222
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:25,790
I'm sorry.

223
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:27,030
I'm too hungry.

224
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:27,880
There's a lot of food there.

225
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:28,960
I'll get you more food.

226
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,200
Hold on.

227
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:32,670
She's not just stealing the food,

228
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:33,720
she's stealing it in broad daylight!

229
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:36,000
Miss.

230
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,960
Two more servings, please.

231
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,510
I have no idea what she looks like.

232
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,030
She brought away over a dozen servings of buns.

233
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,630
How do I put it into words?

234
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:44,320
Boss.

235
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,150
Find someone to send me to the airport.

236
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,630
It's her!

237
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:49,600
Why are you taking my buns again?

238
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,200
Are we enemies?

239
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,270
Catch her, sir!

240
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:52,360
It's her. Catch her.

241
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,120
It's just buns. She's not a thief.

242
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,080
Young lady.

243
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,960
Why are you wandering the streets alone at night?

244
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,430
Are you lost?

245
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:10,840
Where is your family?

246
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:11,960
Family?

247
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,790
I'm looking for my family.

248
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:16,750
Do you know me?

249
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:19,550
Follow me.

250
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:20,670
I'll bring you to meet your family.

251
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:21,960
Is that all right?

252
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:22,790
Come on.

253
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:32,630
Miss.

254
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:35,120
Do you know where my family is?

255
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,430
Of course.

256
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:38,150
I'll bring you to them tomorrow, okay?

257
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:40,720
Alright.

258
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,600
Be good. You can sleep here tonight.

259
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,240
Liu.

260
00:12:58,880 --> 00:12:59,240
How is it?

261
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,150
You said you got a high-quality one.

262
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:01,080
That's her.

263
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,550
Is she the one who is mentally ill?

264
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:04,430
Yes.

265
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:05,120
Well,

266
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,670
where is my family?

267
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:10,960
She looks fine.

268
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,200
It's okay if she's dumb.

269
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,960
As long as her body is fine.

270
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:17,360
When she falls into the hands of those bosses,

271
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,270
she'd turn mad anyway.

272
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,200
Where is my family?

273
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:23,150
No one knows you here.

274
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:24,240
And no one is your family.

275
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,670
Do you get it?

276
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,550
Not here.

277
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,390
They're not here.

278
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:33,600
Young lady.

279
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,790
We can't find your family,

280
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:35,550
but we can find you

281
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:37,120
a new family.

282
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,000
If you can't find my family,

283
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,200
I won't go with you.

284
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,360
You can't just leave as you please.

285
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,630
Go after her!

286
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:51,000
She's a good one.

287
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:56,080
Girl.

288
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,670
They're dumb.

289
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:00,840
They're clueless.

290
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,240
I'm different.

291
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,240
I know about everything.

292
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,080
Do you?

293
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,030
Yes.

294
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:11,320
Just give me your hand

295
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,360
and take the injection.

296
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,430
Then, you'll know too.

297
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:15,480
Is that true?

298
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,430
Yes.

299
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:17,790
It's absolutely true.

300
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:27,550
What is this?

301
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:28,960
I still don't know about anything.

302
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,600
She has the entire jab.

303
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,550
Even an elephant would be anesthetized now.

304
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:33,750
Where is my family?

305
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:34,270
Enough.

306
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:35,630
Get the others.

307
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:42,840
Are you fooling around?

308
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:46,270
Hurry up and tell me.

309
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:47,880
Didn't you say that you know where my family is?

310
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:48,480
Tell me now.

311
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:51,600
Who is she?

312
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,080
Tell me.

313
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:55,910
(Wu.)

314
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:57,320
(You can hide here for the time being.)

315
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,150
Once Xiang and I

316
00:14:58,150 --> 00:14:59,360
have found your family, we'll come for you.

317
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:02,000
Aren't you my family, Ms. Zhao?

318
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,360
I'm sorry.

319
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,080
(We're leaving.)

320
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,720
(Wait for us here.)

321
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:09,510
Hit her!

322
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:15,510
Liu.

323
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:17,600
Let's just

324
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,630
let her go, okay?

325
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:19,480
Let her go?

326
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,880
Are you out of your mind?

327
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,030
All this while,

328
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:23,550
have we had any good products like her?

329
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:25,240
Now that we got our hands
on such a high-quality one,

330
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,550
we can make a lot of money by selling her.

331
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,030
That's enough.

332
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,670
Tell me.

333
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,480
Who am I?

334
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:41,840
(Rong helped me to find)

335
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,840
(traces of Wu in no time.)

336
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:46,750
(She was kidnapped by the human traffickers.)

337
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:49,720
Does the girl look like this?

338
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,240
Have a closer look.

339
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:52,840
Yes.

340
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,240
It's her.

341
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,120
Where is she?

342
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:55,320
Where is she now?

343
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:58,480
(We pretended to be buyers.)

344
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,200
(In a basement,)

345
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,600
(I saw Wu.)

346
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,840
Hu.

347
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:04,360
She's clean.

348
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,080
She's still untouched.

349
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:10,720
Is this considered clean?

350
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,750
You call her untouched?

351
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:15,150
Calm down, Hu.

352
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:16,840
It's just minor injuries.

353
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,630
She's definitely clean.

354
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,430
Wu.

355
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:31,510
It's a deal, Mr. Xu.

356
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:33,030
Two hundred thousand dollars.

357
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:34,240
Tomorrow evening at 10.

358
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,150
They'd need to check your background.

359
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:37,480
Don't worry.

360
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,790
Rong has settled everything for you.

361
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,080
Just wait till tomorrow.

362
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,750
Tomorrow, you'll be sent away.

363
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:47,840
Thank you.

364
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,880
What?

365
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:52,960
"Thank you"?

366
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,510
Are you all right?

367
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:56,390
Do you think that when you're there,

368
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:57,150
you can live a good life?

369
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:00,240
How naive of you.

370
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:03,150
You didn't lie to me.

371
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:07,430
You found someone who knows me.

372
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,990
Thank you.

373
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,360
You're so naive.

374
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,600
I'm selling you away.

375
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,390
Why are you grateful to me?

376
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,630
You're crazy.

377
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:23,280
What a psycho.

378
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,280

joined the company,

that Wu's background is related

Nonetheless,

546
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:09,850

548
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:23,610
We're here.

550
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:38,170
I would like

551
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:39,810
to ask you for a favor.

552
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,360
When I'm gone,

553
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,570
please protect Chulan on my behalf.

554
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:48,000
If possible,

555
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,850
don't let him know about your presence.

556
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,370
Why?

557
00:25:53,370 --> 00:25:55,000
I don't want him

558
00:25:55,650 --> 00:25:57,410
to think that he's special.

559
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,850
And I don't want him

560
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:02,570
to get involved

561
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:04,570
in the chaos of the Outsiders' world.

562
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:06,650
Is that all right?

563
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:08,480
I can do you this favor.

564
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:10,410
However,

565
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:12,760
can I find my family if I do so?

566
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:16,130
Just stay by Chulan's side,

567
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,720
then you'll find out the truth.

568
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,440
Old man.

569
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,680
Pardon me for asking,

570
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,370
but why should we trust you?

571
00:26:24,370 --> 00:26:25,930
I'm the culprit

572
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:28,000
of the Jiashen Calamity.

573
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,680
Is this

574
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,000
enough?

575
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:37,200
You can choose to trust me,

576
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,000
or

577
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,440
choose to continue your aimless search.

578
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:42,410
The choice

579
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:43,480
is yours.

580
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,610
Why would you believe

581
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:47,520
that we'll do as you say?

582
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,200
I don't believe you.

583
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,960
But I believe in Feng Baobao.

584
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,720
Feng Baobao.

585
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:57,360
Do you believe me?

586
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:00,000
I believe you.

587
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,280
Thank you.

588
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:07,520
Feng Baobao.

589
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,130
I can't do this anymore.

590
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:09,810
I'm

591
00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:13,040
holding on my innate qi.

592
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,330
Please end my life.

593
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:16,520
If I do as you say,

594
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,570
when can I find the answers of my past?

595
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:19,240
That

596
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,960
depends on your luck.

597
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,410
Besides,

598
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:24,520
Feng Baobao,

599
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:28,890
does time carry any meaning to you?

600
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,000
Okay.

601
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,410
I promise.

602
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:33,480
Thanks.

603
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,680
Feng Baobao.

604
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,810
When Chulan

605
00:27:38,410 --> 00:27:40,960
steps into the Outsiders' world,

606
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,890
when

607
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:43,760
he needs

608
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,720
power,

609
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,280
please pass this to him.

610
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,960
I have absolute faith in you,

611
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:52,760
Baobao.

612
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:56,650
Wu.

613
00:27:56,650 --> 00:27:57,370
It's all right.

614
00:27:57,370 --> 00:27:59,330
He's just giving me something.

615
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:00,760
Do it, Baobao.

616
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:02,760
To be able to die in your hands,

617
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:05,480
that's considered a good ending for me.

618
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:07,810
Hurry up.

619
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:10,090
Think of it as I'm just clearing out

620
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:12,960
the paths for Chulan

621
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,890
and the offspring of the Jiashen Calamity.

622
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,200
I'm

623
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,650
contented!

624
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:21,520
Hurry up.

625
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,440
Do you

626
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,130
want me

627
00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:27,520
to kneel and beg you to do this?

628
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:49,720
The year of Jiashen.

629
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:55,280
If only I hadn't boarded the train,

630
00:28:58,410 --> 00:29:00,480
things would have turned out differently, then.

631
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,810
The year of Jiashen.

632
00:29:01,810 --> 00:29:03,000
What train?

633
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,610
Well...

634
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:10,090
I'll entrust Chulan with you.

635
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,040
Grandpa.

636
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,680
You're back, Grandpa.

637
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:30,890
What's wrong?

638
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,130
Grandpa.

639
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,520
Grandpa!

640
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:39,650
Grandpa!

641
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:41,570
Grandpa!

642
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,930
Please wake up!

643
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:45,200
Let's go home, Grandpa!

644
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:48,480
Grandpa!

645
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,570
Let's go home, Grandpa!

646
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:52,850
He's only ten.

647
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:54,000
Are you going

648
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,170
to look at him

649
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:57,440
and wait?

650
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,200
His grandpa is right.

651
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,170
I have plenty of time.

652
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:04,410
I can wait.

653
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,930
(From that day onward,)

654
00:30:08,930 --> 00:30:11,680
(Baobao has been staying by your side,)

655
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:15,000
(protecting you in secret.)

656
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,520
Don't move or I'll hit you.

657
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,330
She waited

658
00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:26,440
for over a decade.

659
00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:27,930
Chulan.

660
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:29,440
Do you understand now?

661
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,200
That's the story

662
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:35,090
of your grandpa and Wu.

663
00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:36,520
The story sounds bizarre.

664
00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:38,760
How could I believe in that?

665
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:42,040
You don't have to believe it now.

666
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,610
Stay at the company for the time being,

667
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,850
stay by Wu's side and observe.

668
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:51,650
Mr. Zhang is right.

669
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,650
Since our encounter,

670
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:55,130
I can feel

671
00:30:55,130 --> 00:30:57,850
that something that has been stagnant for years

672
00:30:57,850 --> 00:30:59,330
has started to move again.

673
00:30:59,330 --> 00:31:00,930
Chulan.

674
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:03,000
You asked me

675
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,810
about the benefits

676
00:31:05,810 --> 00:31:08,330
of joining the Outsider Martial Arts Contest.

677
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:12,000
Listen now.

678
00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:14,890

680

we're not gaining anything from it.

681
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:23,720
However, this could help Wu

682
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,890
