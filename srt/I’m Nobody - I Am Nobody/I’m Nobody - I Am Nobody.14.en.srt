Hello, son?

18
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:10,060
Mom, you sure have great timing.

19
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:11,860
Why did you choose to call me now?

20
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:14,100
Have you eaten your meal?
Don't just eat meat, okay?

21
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:15,740
I have fruits every day.

22
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:16,580
I have vegetables, too.

23
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:16,980
I didn't just eat meat.

24
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:17,620
Hey.

25
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:20,580
You have to get a balanced diet.

26
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:20,980
Balance the nutrition.

27
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:21,380

00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:23,620
-Okay.
-Don't just eat meat.

30
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:24,220
I didn't.

31
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:25,900
And, remember.

32
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:27,660
Never use the toothbrushes
the hotels prepare for you.

33
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:28,340
They're unhygienic.

34
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:30,740
I didn't use them.

35
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:32,020
Mom, it feels like

36
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:33,940
you think I can't survive without you.

37
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:34,980
I'm just worried.

38
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:35,340

You've never been so far away in your life.

45
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:43,780
-I'm so worried.
-I can survive without you.

46

What about your meals?

47
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:50,620

49
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:55,980
You want to kill me?

50
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:56,620
I'm fine with you punching me.

51
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:57,660
But don't break my phone.

52
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:58,340

53
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:59,780
that my mother will overthink things

54
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:00,900
if I hung up her call just like that?

55
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:01,980
She'll think that something's happened to me,

56
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:02,900
or I'm hiding things from her.

57
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:03,580
Anyway,

58
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:04,540
she'll think of the worst

59
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:06,300
whenever I'm not by her side.

60
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:07,060
This...

61
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:08,940
Give me your phone.

62
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:10,500
Come on.

63
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,900
Are you sick in the head?

64
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,260
Why would anyone bring a phone
to a martial arts contest?

65
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:14,180
I would!

66
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:15,340
She'll think that I'm in trouble

67
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,900
if I don't answer her call.

68
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:17,580
This...

69
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:18,580
Forget it.

70
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:19,380

71
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:21,060
can any of you lend me your phone?

72
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:24,700
Can anyone lend me the phone?

73
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,620
Kid,

74
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:31,940
here.

75
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,060

76
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:34,420

77
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:36,260
Thank you, mister.

78
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,660
Don't mention it.

79
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:41,540
Mom.

80
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:43,300
My son, why did you hang up?

81
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,100
Why is he on the phone again?

82
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:45,940
Are you in a match?

83
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:46,380
Yes.

84
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:48,260
Don't get yourself hurt, okay?

85
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:49,260
You must be careful.

86
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:50,180
Stop nagging.

87
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:51,020
My opponent is waiting for me.

88
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:52,180
Will the match begin soon?

89
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:53,300
Yes.

90
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,180
Is the opponent strong?

91
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,140
It's a girl.

92
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:55,980
She's hard to deal with.

93
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,660
Is she pretty?

94
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,100
Pass the phone to her.

95
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,740
Maybe I can get you a wife.

96
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:02,020
No way.

97
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:03,300
I'm no longer a kid.
I don't need you to do that for me.

98
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,220
Son,

99
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:05,260
be a good boy.

100
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,220
I'm not a two-year-old boy, you know?

101
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,700
I'm over 20 years old now.

102
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:08,580
It's a chance, you know?

103
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:09,540
Fine.

104
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:10,260
Hurry.

105
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,460
Pass it to her.

106
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,220
Hurry.

107
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:15,060
Hey,

108
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,900
my mother needs to speak with you.

109
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,260
Are they dating now?

110
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:30,380
Hello, girl.

111
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:31,700
I'm Liang's mother.

112
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:32,740
Hello, Madam.

113
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:33,900
Do you have a boyfriend?

114
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,300
What do you think about my son?

115
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,820
I know he's not obedient.

116
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:37,700
Yes.

117
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,420
Boys mature much later than girls.

118
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,940
I think he's still in his rebellious phase.

119
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:42,020
That's right.

120
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:43,500
But my son is excellent

121
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,540
in other aspects.

122
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:46,820
Consider him, okay?

123
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,420
Visit the Jia Village

124
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:49,740
once the match is over, okay?

125
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:50,660
Okay, Madam.

126
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:55,020
Your mother told me
to destroy you with all my strength

127
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:57,100
so that you could head home earlier.

128
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,140
Am I even your biological son?

129
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:01,540
I'm finally out of the village for once, you know?

130
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:02,540
My son,

131
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:03,460
be a good boy.

132
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:04,740
Let the lady win.

133
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:06,660
Show her your gentlemanly demeanor.

134
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:07,780
Win her heart

135
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,140
and bring her home.

136
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:10,980
Alright, I got it.

137
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:13,300
Remember, don't use your full strength.

138
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:17,060
Can we begin now?

139
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:53,140
It's time for you to admit defeat
after wasting so much time.

140
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:55,260
Your matchmaking partner is still waiting for you.

141
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,620
I can't just return home like this.

142
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:59,260
My next match

143
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:01,060
will be against Feng Baobao.

144
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:02,500
I have to avenge my brother.

145
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,500
If you truly wish to seek revenge

146
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,860
against Feng Baobao,

147
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:07,060
you should try your best instead.

148
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:29,140
(These two are quite hard to deal with.)

149
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,500
(But it's not like I don't stand a chance to win.)

150
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:39,260
Ms. Bao.

151
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:42,860
Can you truly do that in secret

152
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:43,820
without getting us into any trouble?

153
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:45,940
I've done this plenty of times.

154
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:48,020
You don't need to worry.

155
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:51,620
Sorry for the trouble, then.

156
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,060
Although it's a little unkind,

157
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:54,740
we should let Mr. Wang

158
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:56,180
stay in the pit for some time.

159
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,500
Leave it to me.

160
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,420
Let's go.

161
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:01,180
Are you not going to observe the match?

162
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:03,060
The winner will be up against you, you know?

163
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,500
I'm fine with either of them.

164
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,940
Neither of them can defeat me, anyway.

165
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,580
I'll go meet Wang Ye.

166
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,020
Indeed.

167
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,100
You're no longer a young boy,

168
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,380
and you still have to listen to your parents
for everything in life.

169
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:19,380
You don't look cool enough.

170
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,860
If your parents are capable,

171
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:24,300
it's an easy way to live.

172
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,300
After all, they're more capable

173
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,660
than you and I.

174
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:27,940
Is there something wrong

175
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:29,380
with taking the path they laid for you?

176
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:30,860
You should listen to your mother.

177
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:32,260
As for Feng Baobao,

178
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:34,100
I'll deal with her for you.

179
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:37,500
Ms. Feng,

180
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,100
I truly

181
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,780
don't wish to injure a girl like you.

182
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,340
But as a girl,

183
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,140
you're already amazing

184
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,580
for injuring me to this extent.

185
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,620
The winner of the next match
will go up against Feng Baobao.

186
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:47,860
I have to confront her myself.

187
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,380
I've already told you before.

188
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:51,820
Feng Baobao is my prey.

189
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:52,660
Don't steal her from me!

190
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:08,540
This lady is awesome.

191
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:09,900
Seems like my sister

192
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,700
is serious about defeating Jia Zhengliang.

193
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,780
I've never seen her being this serious before.

194
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:23,820
Ms. Feng, you're truly amazing.

195
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:25,620
It's my first time

196
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:26,580
using all 12 flying knives

197
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,220
in a 1V1 match.

198
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,020
Seems like you don't
intend to listen to your mother

199
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:31,980
and head home, huh?

200
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:34,300
I was talking about useless stuff just now.

201
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,620
I was sloppy.

202
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:36,540
I'm sorry.

203
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:39,300
I was sloppy, too.

204
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:41,660
I'm sorry.

205
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:52,020
You wish to hurt me

206
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:53,220
with my knife?

207
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:04,900
Shayan,

208
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,260
that's enough.

209
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,340
Your father has already spoken.

210
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,660
Hurry and admit defeat.

211
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:22,100
Admit defeat?

212
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:25,020
It's too early for that.

213
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:26,820
(Dad,)

214
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,420
(this time, I won't listen to you.)

215
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:29,340
(I will never admit defeat.)

216
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,620
This match alone

217
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:36,140
is worth the ticket price.

218
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,660
It's full offense versus full defense.

219
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:39,180
They're using their full strength.

220
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:41,300
What a satisfying match.

221
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,220
It feels like

222
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:43,700
both of them are betting on everything they have

223
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,940
to avoid defeat.

224
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:47,740
Seems like

225
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:50,820
the match won't end

226
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,500
unless one of them falls.

227
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:55,580
Shayan!

228
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:03,180
Look at how worried your father is.

229
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,140
Just admit defeat.

230
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:07,300
This is my match.

231
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,220
I make the call here.

232
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,460
Shall we continue?

233
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:14,260
Bring it on.

234
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,900
(She's expanding her qi aura
to such a wide area.)

235

237
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,620
(within the radius.)

238
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:28,820
(If so, let me give this a try.)

239
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:31,140
(I'm coating)

240
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:34,340
(my flying knives with a special qi.)

241
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,620
(At this moment,)

242
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:39,980
(my Deity-Slaying Knives
have close to zero friction.)

243
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:43,460
My next technique

244
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:45,900
might not be suitable for sparring.

245
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:48,420
Cut the crap.

[Universe Enigma]

247
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,020

248
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:10,500
Kid! Listen to me!

249
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,740
Stop right now!

250
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:19,260
What happened

251
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,460
just now?

252
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:21,380
Shayan!

253
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,740
They...

254
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,660
They perished together.

Eight.

263
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,220
Nine.

264
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:11,340
You should've

265
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:13,460
listened to your mother

266
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:14,540
and gone home.

267
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:16,460
You didn't listen

268
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:17,900
to your father, either.

269
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,140
Say, who will win the match

270
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:23,020
if we keep this up?

271
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,740
Why are you doing this?

272
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:28,860
Even if you defeat me,

273
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:32,140
you're in no condition to fight in the next match.

274
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:36,740
Even so, I'm still the winner.

275
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,380
The winner is

276
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:40,620
Feng Shayan.

277
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,220
I see.

278
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:59,620
So that's the case.

279
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:03,740
I thought you dispersed your qi

280
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:06,500
in order to detect the trajectories of my knives.

281
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:09,220
So, I was wrong.

282
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:14,620
Actually, you can bridge space, am I right?

283
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,100
My flying knives were extremely fast in the end.

284
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,380
But you didn't dodge them.

285
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:22,020
Some of the knives

286
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:23,260
went through the space you bridged

287
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:24,820
and attacked me instead.

288
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:27,220
The space where your palm was touching

289
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,700
was the entrance of such space.

290
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:32,260
You can form a space at will

291
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:34,340
within the qi aura you dispersed.

292
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:37,380
After that, you appeared
together with the knives

293
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:38,380
and injured me.

294
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:40,180
Am I right?

295
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:45,620
Seems like you didn't get beaten up for nothing.

296
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:47,860
That's the power of my Universe Enigma.

297
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:52,820
However, I was just lucky.

298
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:55,900
Your flying knives were extremely fast.

299
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:00,860
I didn't expect you to go easy on me.

300
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:02,460
I don't understand at all.

00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:08,540
I just feel like

302
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:11,220
I can't bear to hurt you.

303
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:29,260
You want to hurt me

00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:10,580
But in reality,

379
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:11,460
I didn't collect

380
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:13,020
that many powerful qi spirits.

381
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:14,940
I have to return Mr. Liu's spirit

382
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:16,420
in a few days.

383
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:18,540
Chairman Feng,

384
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:19,740
are you sure this is okay?

385
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:21,500
The world is at peace now.

386
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,980
No one would attempt such lawless behaviors

387
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:24,380
besides the Sinister Pleasure.

388
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:26,620
I permitted Xingtong

389
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:27,780
to use Dispatch of Detained Spirits.

390
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:30,420
Mr. Lu used his Infinite Heavenly Talisman, too.

391
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:32,300
In this era,

392
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:34,460
there's no need to hide the Eight Supremes.

393
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:35,460
Anyway,

394
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,180
Xingtong, you did a great job today.

395
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:38,100
Thank you, Dad.

396
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:39,380
Chulan,

397
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:42,260
are you confident
that you can win tomorrow's match?

398
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,460
Wang Ye

399
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:46,140
defeated Zhuge Qing flawlessly.

400
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,020
Chairman Feng,

401
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:48,460
I suddenly remember
that I have something to attend to.

402
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:49,620
Let me make a phone call.

403
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:02,300
♪The Huangyang shoulder pole
is soft and flexible♪

404
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:06,260
♪Sisters and brothers, ya-ha-li-ye♪

405
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:10,540
♪Carrying the rice grains to Liuzhou♪

406
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:17,220
Ms. Bao,

407
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:18,620
how's your progress?

408
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:20,100
Are you done?

409
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,460
Look at the time.

410
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,260
Don't worry.

411
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:25,260
I promise that you won't see him tomorrow.

412
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:34,700
Did you dig that pit

413
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,620
for me?

414
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:40,500
You shouldn't bury people alive.

415
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,900
Let's talk this over, okay?

416
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:51,540
Why are you pouring water into the pit?

417
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,700
Once the ratio of water to mud
reaches a certain number,

418
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,740
the mud will stick to the body completely.

419
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:57,820
It'll be very comfortable.

420
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,060
Besides, watery mud like this

421
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:00,340
will produce a suction force

422
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:02,500
that can strip you of your weird power.

423
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,780
It's called Tai Chi, right?

424
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:06,020
Anyway, you won't be able to escape.

425
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:11,420
You're something else.

426
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:12,820
I'm not that amazing.

427
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:14,580
I'm just used to doing this.

428
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:18,820
I'll adjust the height

429
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:20,660
and make sure your head is visible.

430
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,260
What a drag.

431
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:24,580
(Seems like I need to escape by using my skill.)

432
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:25,980
(Gather my qi.)

433
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:26,500
(Chaos)

434
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:26,820
(Golden...)

435
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:32,820
Sorry about that.

436
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,740
I took too much radish.

437
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,020
(Chaos Golden Space Rip.)

438
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:46,500
What's going on?

439
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,140
It felt weird for a second.

440
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:55,340
♪Sisters♪

441
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:56,780
♪Heading to Liuzhou♪

442
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:57,740
Gen,

443
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:58,340
burrow like the earth dragon!

444
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:03,820
Oh no.

445
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:04,820
He ran away.

446
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:15,020
Boulder Toss!

447
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:21,460
Thanks, Miss.

448
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:24,500
I learned a lot from you.

449
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:29,500
18 Formidable Ways.

450
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:35,460
What kind of martial art is that?

451
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:36,860
(Chaos Golden Space Rip doesn't work on her.)

452
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,740
(Boulder Toss can't trap her, either.)

453
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:40,380
(Who exactly is this jinx?)

454
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:02,700
This girl is so hard to shake off!

455
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:03,540
Qian, diversion.

456
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:04,500
Dazzling Flowers!

457
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:30,300
That doesn't work, either?

458
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:32,060
I wouldn't have been in this situation

459
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:33,340
if I stayed in the mountains.

460
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:34,020
What a shame.

461
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:34,780
Martial Uncle only

462
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:35,540
gave me one of these!

463
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:45,540
Incense of Diversion!

464
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:56,100
(This would surely work, right?)

465
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:29,140
Chief Celestial Taoist is here
to spectate the match

466
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:29,940
because

467
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:31,580
Zhang Chulan is his grand-disciple.

468
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:33,540
Of all the matches to spectate,

469
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:34,700
you two

470
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:35,940
chose to spectate this one.

471
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,580
Is it because someone is jealous of

472
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:40,500
the Qimen Manipulation used by that young Taoist

473
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,220
from Mount Wudang?

474
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,780
This is nothing to be embarrassed about.

475
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:47,580
Forget about the people here.

476
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:49,620
Everyone who's here
at the Outsider Martial Arts Contest

477
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:52,540
is jealous of him.

478
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:53,540
If Zhang Chulan

479
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:56,260
did inherit his grandfather's Qi Apotheosis,

480
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:57,540
that means

481
00:22:57,540 --> 00:23:00,980
this match will be a match
between two of the Eight Supremes.

482
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,260
Wang Ye of Mount Wudang,

483
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:03,540
please enter the arena immediately.

484
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:04,820
Wang Ye,

485
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:06,540
enter the arena immediately if you hear this.

486
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:09,060
Qing,

487
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:11,060
that Taoist spent so much effort to defeat you.

488
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:13,340
But now, he's letting Zhang Chulan
win without putting up a fight.

489
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:15,020
He won because he was better than me.

490
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:16,540
Now, he has the freedom to decide

491
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:17,500
whether he wants to win or lose here.

492
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,300
Where's Baobao?

493
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:26,220
San,

494
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:27,540
you still don't understand?

495
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:29,460
Look at that shady look on Zhang Chulan's face.

496
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:31,340
I'm sure Ms. Bao is doing her work now.

497
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:34,300
Ms. Bao is amazing indeed.

498
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,820
Wang Ye is absent from the match.

499
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:37,740
The winner is...

500
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:51,940
Incense of Diversion,

501
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:52,380
dispel!

502
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:02,340
You're still doing it?

503
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:03,300
Ma'am!

504
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:03,980
Don't you have anything else on your mind

505
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:06,060
besides burying me alive?

506
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:07,500
Look at where you are.

507
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:10,300
The contestant is here.

508
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,380
Young girl,

509
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:13,580
please leave the arena.

510
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:17,460
Zhang Chulan, I messed it up.

511
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:19,380
Ms. Bao, that's fine.

512
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:20,980
Leave the rest to me.

513
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,020
At first, I thought

514
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:35,460
she was another one
of Zhuge Qing's fangirls.

515
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:37,620
But something felt off about her.

516
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,140
After that, I realized

517
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:41,380
that she was wearing

518
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:44,380
NDT's uniform, just like you.

519
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:47,780
So, she's your hired thug, huh?

520
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:50,300
Zhang Chulan, good for you.

521
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:51,900
Coward,

522
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:53,780
you're pretty good at this.

523
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:57,940
Wang Ye,

524
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:00,380
we can delay this match.

525
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:01,820
Just tell us

526
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:02,700
what you have encountered.

527
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:05,460
The Celestial Taoist Mansion
will uphold justice for you.

528
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:08,180
I'm fine.

529
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:09,980
Let's resume the match.

530
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:10,700
Alright.

531
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:11,900
Begin the match.

532
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:19,020
Get me some food.

533
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:22,860
I've been running the entire night. I'm starving.

534
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:24,700
It's been a few days since I had any mantous.

535
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:26,700
Did you lose your mind
from the beating you received?

536
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:27,740
Look at where you are.

537
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:29,740
You should continue with the match

538
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:30,900
if you don't wish to pursue the matter.

539
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:31,940
We can talk about it after the match.

540
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:33,300
We're competing.

541
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:34,580
No one said we have to compete

542
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:36,420
by fighting in the Outsider Martial Arts Contest.

543
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:37,860
We're Taoists,

544
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:39,340
not warriors.

545
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,180
Can't I just engage him

546
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:41,860
in an eating contest?

547
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:46,700
Fine, Chief Celestial Taoist.

548
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,660
I'll head back and tell Grandmaster

549
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:51,380
that the disciple of Mount Wudang
can't get any food in Mount Longhu.

550
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:52,140
Rongshan.

551
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:55,140
Stop arguing with that mushroom-head.

552
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:56,620
Do you have any mantous? Feed him to death.

553
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:57,980
Or he'd go back and complain to his grandmaster

554
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:58,980
about me.

555
00:25:58,980 --> 00:25:59,860
Yes, Chief Celestial Taoist.

556
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:00,260
Alright.

557
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:01,580
Sorry for the trouble.

558
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:02,620
Prepare the same

559
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:04,380
for Zhang Chulan as well.

560
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:24,300
Don't just stand there.

561
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:25,380
Eat.

562
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:27,260
If not, I'll kill you in one blow.

563
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:28,140
Alright.

564
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:38,780
Baobao, this is rare.

565
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:41,060
I never expected you to fail.

566
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:43,220
Even Baobao can't deal with him.

567
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:44,660
Zhang Chulan is in trouble this time.

568
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:49,460
Baobao,

569
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:50,900
what's on your mind?

570
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:53,300
I need to improve my workflow in the future.

571
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:54,620
I have to think of a way to prevent my victim

572
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:56,420
from utilizing their qi after knocking them out.

573
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:57,260
After that, I'll bury them.

574
00:26:58,660 --> 00:26:59,660
Enough.

575
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:01,020
Stop thinking about burying people.

576
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:02,140
Go and get changed.

577
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,380
Mr. Wang,

578
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:12,380
you haven't told me

579
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:14,540
why you came to Mount Longhu.

580
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:16,860
(Enhance Hearing.)

581
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:23,020
Good question.

582
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:25,260
As for the reason I came here,

583
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:27,380
I cannot explain it to you

584
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:28,900
in just a few sentences.

585
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:30,580
Zhang Chulan,

586
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:32,300
do you know what divination is?

587
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:33,780
I don't.

588
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:36,340
Let me tell you the basic concept for now.

589
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:38,380
The past cannot be changed.

590
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:39,980
However, the future can be changed.

591
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:41,940
In reality,

592
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,060
no matter how good you are at divination,

593
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:45,500
you cannot know about the past.

594
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:46,100
Even if they can predict the future,

595
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,860
they can only predict a few possibilities.

596
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:48,940
Even so,

597
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:50,260
it's intolerable by the course of nature.

598
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:51,020
So,

599
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:52,020
divination alone

600
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:53,620
is not beneficial to the sorcerers themselves.

601
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:55,420
As for the damage it will cause,

602
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:57,260
it depends on how much the world will be changed

603
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:58,100
by the info

604
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:00,100
you obtained through divination.

605
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:01,140
For example,

606
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:02,980
if I predict the number
of the next jackpot prize,

607
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:04,900
the damage will be minuscule.

608
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,660
It's because it only changes the candidate

609
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:08,300
of another potential upstart.

610
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,340
However, before this,

611
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:15,220
I made a divination

612
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:17,180
of this contest and you

613
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:18,260
when I was in Mount Wudang.

614
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:27,220
I almost died from trying to grasp

615
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:28,580
the blurry info I had about your future.

616
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,660
Actually, no matter what happens to you all,

617
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:40,260
it has nothing to do with me.

618
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,820
No matter how terrible the world ends up,

619
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,300
I can protect myself and my family.

620
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,820
I can keep us safe.

621
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:47,460
That's why I shouldn't be here.

622
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:49,780
But why did I come here?

623
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:51,500
There are two main reasons for it.

624
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:52,300
First,

625
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:53,900
if I don't come,

626
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:55,340
the reputation of Chief Celestial Taoist
and the Celestial Taoist Mansion

627
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:56,380
will be severely affected.

628
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:58,220
Chief Celestial Taoist is an elder I look up to.

629
00:28:58,220 --> 00:28:58,980
I don't want that to happen.

630
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:00,260
Second,

631
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,620
I came here

632
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:03,540
to provide you with an extra choice.

633
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:05,860
A choice for you to give up.

634
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:08,380
Give up?

635
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:10,620
Do you want me to give up on inheriting Tianshidu?

636
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:12,700
That's not it.

637
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:15,380
It doesn't matter

638
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:16,740
what happens in the contest.

639
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:18,940
The choice I'm providing you with

640
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:21,380
is the choice to give up on seeking the truth.

641
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:23,140
That way, you will get what you desire.

642
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,100
Mr. Wang, you should stop joking around.

643
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:26,460
What's so bad about seeking the truth?

644
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:28,180
That's exactly what I desire.

645
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:32,340
You do desire the truth.

646
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:34,780
But you also desire to have
a car, a house, and a wife.

647
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:37,020
It's justifiable that you desire all of these.

648
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:39,820
However, once you fulfill one of your desires,

649
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:41,780
you will proceed to pursue the next.

650
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:44,660
So, it's not a case
of one being unable to fulfill their desires.

651
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:47,380
It's a case of having too many desires to pursue.

652
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:48,660
That's the reason

653
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:50,340
why people forget about what they desire the most.

654
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:52,100
The thing I'm telling you right now

655
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,740
is something you desire but cannot achieve.

656
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:55,060
But once you achieve it,

657
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:58,780
you're willing to give up on everything else
for its sake.

658
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:00,060
That's the only thing

659
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:01,900
you desire the most.

660
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:04,740
You're just pretentious.

661
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:05,540
We don't really know each other.

662
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:06,340
I don't need you to tell me

663
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:08,100
what I desire the most.

664
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:13,540
Face it with genuineness,

665
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:17,660
and you shall obtain enlightenment.

666
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:21,180
Approach it with genuineness,

667
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:23,660
and inner peace shall be achieved.

668
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:40,940
Mr. Wang,

669
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:42,620
what were you chanting just now?

670
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:45,700
The Peace Mantra.

671
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:47,580
Inner peace shall be achieved?

672
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:49,420
That's great.

673
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:53,340
It sounds simple enough.

674
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:56,300
But it cannot be achieved that easily.

675
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:58,660
So, you have to give up on something else

676
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:00,420
in order to obtain it.

677
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:07,300
I think I get the gist of what you're saying.

678
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:10,380
You're saying

679
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:12,540
that if I continue my investigation,

680
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:13,420
the world might develop

681
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:15,340
in a bad direction.

682
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:16,980
Mr. Wang,

683
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:17,860
I'm sure I'm not the only one

684
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:19,860
who will be affected by the chaotic future, right?

685
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:21,460
We're not related by any means.

686
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,180
I'm sure you won't get yourself
involved in this mess

687
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:24,980
for my sake.

688
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:26,740
Wang Ye.

689
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:27,740
Do you know me?

690
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:33,140
This is related

691
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:34,420
to another concept.

692
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:35,700
I call it

693
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:37,060
the weight of fate.

694
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:39,580
This world is moving every second.

695
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:40,580
The sum of all individual changes

696
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:42,460
represents the change of the world.

697
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:45,540
A fossilized stone changed the world.

698
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:48,460
By consuming these preserved vegetables,

699
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:50,540
I'm also a part of the changes
that occur in the world.

700
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:51,900
However, individual changes

701
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:53,460
affect the change of the world

702
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:54,700
differently.

703
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:56,700
Some people racked their brains
their entire lives

704
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:58,100
but weren't able to achieve anything.

705
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,660
Some people flipped the world upside down

706
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:01,700
just because of that one difference in thought.

707
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:07,140
That's the ratio of the weight of fate.

708
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:09,060
And you, Zhang Chulan,

709
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:11,140
you hold a high ratio of that weight.

710
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:12,620
Your choice

711
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:15,100
will change the fates of many people.

712
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:19,060
Let's assume what you said was true.

713
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:21,420
Mr. Wang,

714
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:23,380
I have a question for you.

715
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:24,860
You could've stayed out of this entirely.

716
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:26,900
However, you chose to persuade me.

717
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:27,860
Does that mean you didn't choose

718
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:29,620
the fate that was best for you, either?

719
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:34,340
Don't touch it!

720
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:35,700
Stop the past me.

721
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:36,940
Don't let him know the truth.

722
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:39,860
That's right.

723
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:43,340
I don't need to do any divination to predict this.

724
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:45,020
I know that this isn't beneficial
to me in any way.

725
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:53,300
Wang Ye, beat him up!

726
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:54,820
We're not here to see you chat!

727
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:56,900
Beat him up!

728
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:59,820
They came all the way to the sparring ground
just to have a meal and chat?

729
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:01,620
Qing, I can't believe
that you actually lost to a freak like him.

730
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:03,340
It's more than just me.

731
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:05,660
What do you mean?

732
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:07,660
Wuhou Qimen has lost as well.

733
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:14,100
I'm full.

734
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:20,980
What do you think?

735
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:22,180
Zhang Chulan,

736
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:23,460
can you make your decision now?

737
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:35,540
Ms. Bao,

738
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:37,580
you were the one who provided me

739
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:39,340
with the warmth of a family,
which I haven't had in a long time.

740
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:55,740
Grandfather!

741
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:57,920
[Grandfather, Zhang Xilin]

742
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:02,820
Ms. Bao, it's fine.

743
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:04,300
You'll have what I have too.

744
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:09,500
Chulan,

745
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:12,620
by participating
in the Outsider Martial Arts Contest,

746
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:14,300
you can help Wu

747
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:16,060
to locate her past.

748
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:18,220
I will leave Wu

749
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:19,900
to you now.

750
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:29,300
You should stop eating

751
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,260
when you're full.

752
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:44,940
Why did you make the worst choice

753
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:46,900
out of all the possible choices?

754
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:49,700
This is the thing I wish to achieve.

755
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:51,700
No matter what happens,

756
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:53,220
I will bear the responsibility alone.

757
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:55,740
Do you know the kind of responsibility
we're talking about here?

758
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:57,940
Do you think you can bear it?

759
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:00,220
I'm not just doing this

760
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:03,460
for my own sake.

761
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:05,060
I'm sorry.

You're too courteous.

765
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:28,860
I'm here to provide you with a choice,

766
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,420
not to make the choice for you.
