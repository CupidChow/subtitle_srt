00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:32,940
You don't say.

192
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,340
Lyu Wen's baby

193
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:36,300
was born this morning.

194
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,180
I will be an aunt from now on.

195
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:39,740
It's the fifth generation now.

196
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:43,620
The fifth generation?

197
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:46,100
He should be coming today.

198
00:10:58,860 --> 00:10:59,420
Here.

199
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:05,980
Great-grandpa.

200
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:07,340
Whenever the Lyu family

201
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,780
has a newborn baby,

202
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:11,380
you will place them in the wine cellar.

203
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:13,300
Why do you do that?

204
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:18,780
Don't ask why.

205
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:20,340
Just wait here.

206
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:25,980
Great-grandpa.

207
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,420
Do you bathe the baby in some alcohol

208
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,500
so that they can

209
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,700
possess the Soul Whisperer?

210
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,180
Great-grandpa, did I get it right?

211
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:43,980
Lyu Gong.

212
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,740
Have you entered

213
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,420
the wine cellar before?

214
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:48,540
My guess was right?

215
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,260
Have you been down there before?

216
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,020
I haven't.

217
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:00,580
That was all just a guess.

218
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:14,060
Madam.

219
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:16,020
How are you related

220
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:17,980
to my great-grandpa?

221
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,860
Why did he keep you locked up in here?

222
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,620
Listen carefully.

223
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,780
I'm not some good old lady

224
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,180
or granny.

225
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:31,660
The Lyu family and I

226
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:35,180
are sworn enemies.

227
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,300
If you come here again...

228
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:50,060
I am going to kill you one day.

229
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,500
Quickly go and hide.

230
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:24,420
Take a look.

231
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:26,740
You didn't take

232
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:29,420
any of the tonic that I brought you.

233
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:31,580
You must get enough nutrients.

234
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:35,980
You are a woman,

235
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:37,420
but

236
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:39,820
you are so much tougher than Feng Tianyang.

237
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:41,420
Now that I think about it,

238
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:44,460
I have taken care of you for almost 60 years now.

239
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:47,060
You are 80 this year, aren't you?

240
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,420
I remember when you first
came into the Lyu family,

241
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,420
you refused to say a word

242
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:56,820
about Double Quan Palm.

243
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:57,860
If it were someone else,

244
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:00,500
I would have killed you long ago.

245
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,900
But I was soft-hearted.

246
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,020
I let you live.

247
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,700
I took care of you.

248
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,420
I couldn't bear letting you die.

249
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:18,860
Now it seems

250
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:20,980
that good people
will indeed be repaid with good things.

251
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:23,540
My efforts for you

252
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:25,380
were not in vain at last.

253
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:28,900
It has been so many years
since the Jiashen Calamity happened.

254
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:31,020
I finally figured it out.

255
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:32,900
The Double Quan Palm

256
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:34,860
isn't some secret manual.

257
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:36,940
When I forced you to write it down

258
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:38,140
for my family to practice it,

259
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:38,980
you

260
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,820
weren't able to write it.

261
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,060
That's because

262
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:44,180
it is something that's from the blood.

263
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:47,860
If descendants of the Lyu family

264
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,700
had your blood,

265
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:53,980
they would master the Double Quan Palm.

266
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:58,660
It's too late for me.

267
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:00,380
It's also too late

268
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:01,420
for my children.

269
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:04,620
Since the Lyu family's third generation,

270
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:06,820
I have been thinking.

271
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:09,020
How can I make them

272
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,140
have your blood?

273
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:27,380
I cannot let you die.

274
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:28,900
Because

275
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,260
descendants of the Lyu family

276
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:32,500
need to have your blood.

277
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,620
I kept experimenting

278
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:43,020
and trying.

279
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,980
When it comes to Lyu Gong's generation,

280
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,940
I have greatly succeeded.

281
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:50,140
Especially Lyu Liang.

282
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:53,380
He is able to erase memories.

283
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:58,300
But

284
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,340
I changed its name.

285
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:03,020
I named it Soul Whisperer.

286
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:56,340
This amount of blood would be enough

287
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:58,900
for a 3.7kg baby.

288
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,940
You must take care of yourself.

289
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:03,060
Once the baby is a month old,

290
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:05,260
I will need even more blood.

291
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:39,420
I said all that to you just now

292
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:41,260
because I was hoping you could tell me

293
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:45,100
about the whole of Double Quan Palm.

294
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,860
Since it can erase memories,

295
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:49,580
can it also alter memories?

296
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:50,940
And eventually,

297
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:53,260
can it create a completely new person?

298
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,780
Whether it can erase memories

299
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:59,660
or alter memories,

300
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:02,180
those aren't from the blood.

301
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:04,820
Those have to be learned.

302
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:07,020
Nonsense.

303
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:09,500
Then how come Lyu Liang knows it?

304
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,740
Go ask him.

305
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:15,220
I will never tell you.

306
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,060
Don't think I won't kill you

307
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:19,620
just because you are important.

308
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:20,820
Listen.

309
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,460
The Double Quan Palm has now been passed down

310
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,780
to the Lyu family's fifth generation.

311
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:25,260
The fifth one!

312
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,420
From now on, the Lyu family

313
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:29,220
can give blood to the next generation on our own.

314
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:31,740
I can kill you anytime.

315
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:52,060
But anyway,

316
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:55,260
I should thank you for living until 80.

317
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,540
You have provided
for five generations of the Lyu family.

318
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,740
Because of you,

319
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:03,740
every drop of blood of the Lyu family

320
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,540
has become very precious.

321
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:10,500
Very precious indeed.

322
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:32,580
Come out.

323
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:44,860
Madam.

324
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:48,420
Did I also get a blood transfusion back then?

325
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,900
Do I also have your blood in me?

326
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:56,980
I had never asked you

327
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:59,740
about your name.

328
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:01,100
Lyu Huan.

329
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,580
You can call me Huan.

330
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:04,780
Huan.

331
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:13,660
Come closer.

332
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,620
Let me take a look at you.

333
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,140
Earlier, you told me

334
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,500
about the Cola Sprite Theory.

335
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:27,980
My mind was a mess just now.

336
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:29,540
I didn't catch what you said.

337
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:34,180
Can you tell me about it again?

338
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:32,500
[Lyu Ancestral Hall]

339
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,700
Huan.

340
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:46,860
Where were you just now?

341
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,340
What is everyone waiting for?

342
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:53,060
For Great-grandpa to name the baby.

343
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:53,940
Every time,

344
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:55,620
we have to wait half an hour for that.

345
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:03,780
The baby is here.

346
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:04,340
There they are.

347
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:06,420
What is the name?

348
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:09,020
Ying.

349
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:11,260
The name of my child is Lyu Ying.

350
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:16,220
Please take your seats, everyone.

351
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:19,020
Huan!

352
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:20,100
The banquet is starting!

353
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,220
(I didn't pay much attention)

354
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:23,900
(to Huan's strange behavior that day.)

355
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:25,780
(But what happened next)

356
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:27,180
(changed everything for me.)

357
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,420
(That's what happened.)

358
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:41,540
What?

359
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:43,580
Huan was pushed off the cliff by Lyu Liang?

360
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:44,780
They can't even find her body?

361
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:47,420
Besides Huan,

362
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:48,780
the most gifted Soul Whisperer practitioner

363
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:49,900
in the Lyu family

364
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:50,980
is Lyu Liang.

365
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:53,140
That kid wouldn't have killed her

366
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:54,460
due to jealousy, would he?

367
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:57,980
Where is Lyu Liang right now?

368
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:00,620
Lyu Gong brought him back to the ancestral hall.

369
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:03,100
What should we do with him?

370
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:07,580
I will give the family an answer.

371
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:09,980
Seventh Aunt.

372
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:14,300
Ask Third Uncle to come to the ancestral hall.

373
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:28,060
How did it go?

374
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:29,620
I've asked him all night,

375
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:30,700
but he refused to say anything.

376
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,180
I even extracted his memory qi orb.

377
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:35,340
Look.

378
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:36,980
Just like last time.

379
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:38,460
It's empty

380
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:40,220
with no memories.

381
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:56,020
Lyu Liang.

382
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:57,540
Tell me the truth.

383
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:01,060
How did you push Huan off the cliff?

384
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:02,940
Great-grandpa.

385
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:04,460
I really don't remember.

386
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:06,340
Is Huan really dead?

387
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:06,940
She is!

388
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:09,180
You killed Huan!

389
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:12,580
Huan...

390
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:14,980
Huan...

391
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:16,580
Lyu Liang.

392
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:18,620
Look up.

393
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,820
Who taught you

394
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,180
how to erase memories?

395
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,060
What are you talking about?

396
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:32,020
Stop playing dumb.

397
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:34,260
You keep losing your memories.

398
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:36,340
Great-grandpa even blamed me
for messing it up last time.

399
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:37,660
Great-grandpa.

400
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:38,940
I really don't remember.

401
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:41,020
Huan and I are the closest.

402
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:42,700
I would never hurt her.

403
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:45,540
That's right.

404
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:46,420
Third Uncle, Seventh Aunt.

405
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:47,620
You two were there that day.

406
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:49,020
Explain to them

407
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:50,740
if I am being falsely accused.

408
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:00,940
Third Uncle, Seventh Aunt.

409
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:02,900
Please

410
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:04,700
show your qi orb.

411
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:07,980
Let him see the truth for himself.

412
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:17,500
We were harvesting in the mountains at the time.

413
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:18,860
(Lyu Liang!)

414
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:19,900
(Lyu Huan!)

415
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:21,900
(It's dangerous. Be careful.)

416
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:26,900
At first,

417
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,820
we didn't notice anything strange.

418
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:33,660
But Lyu Liang pushed Huan all of a sudden.

419
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:41,460
How can that be?

420
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:43,900
How could I possibly push Huan off the cliff?

421
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:44,820
Great-grandpa.

422
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:47,540
He should be punished

423
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:49,140
according to the family rules.

424
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:50,060
No.

425
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:53,460
He cannot die.

426
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:57,180
Every drop of blood of the Lyu family

427
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,700
is very precious.

428
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:00,300
Lock him up for now.

429
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:14,460
Huan...

430
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:17,300
Huan...

431
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:23,140
(Liang.)

432
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:25,140
(The memories in your head)

433
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:26,180
(have been)

434
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:27,580
erased by me.

435
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:28,500
How can that be?

436
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,820
The Lyu family's Soul Whisperer can't do this.

437
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:33,620
The Lyu family isn't the only one
who practices Soul Whisperer.

438
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:35,300
Who did you learn it from?

439
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:37,260
(An old lady.)

440
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:39,660
(I really lost that part of my memory.)

441
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:41,780
(But how could I possibly kill Huan?)

442
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:44,260
(At the time, everyone in the Lyu family)

443
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:45,020
(blamed me)

444
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,340
(for Huan's death.)

445
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:50,380
(They kept me locked up
in the cellar at the mansion.)

446
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:51,100
[Lyu Liang, 20 years old]

447
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,620
[Lyu Liang, 20 years old]
(They forced me to admit I killed her.)

448
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:55,670
[Lyu Liang, 20 years old]

449
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:01,020
(During those long and dreadful days,)

450
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:03,100
(I was waiting for an opportunity.)

451
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:05,140
(On the day of the family dinner,)

452
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:07,060
(Lyu Gong came to mock me.)

453
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:09,300
(Finally, the moment has come.)

454
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:27,700
Lyu Liang.

455
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:28,820
It's been years.

456
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:30,660
You still refused to admit it.

457
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:32,300
You would rather be locked up here

458
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:33,340
than say a word.

459
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:35,820
Why does the Lyu family have someone like you?

460
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:30,460
Lyu Liang.

461
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:32,100
It's okay.

462
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:34,460
If you refuse to admit it,

463
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:37,180
we'll keep you locked up in here until you do.

464
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:53,100
(From that moment on,)

465
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:55,060
(I was determined)

466
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:56,820
(to find Huan)

467
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:58,940
(and the truth behind what happened back then.)

468
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,060
(All of this is connected)

469
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:05,820
(to the old lady Huan mentioned.)

470
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:07,980
(Where did she and Huan go?)

471
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:09,660
(I was determined)

472
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:10,940
(to find the truth)

473
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:12,780
(behind that incident.)

474
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:18,820
(In order to find the truth,)

475
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:20,540
(I joined the Sinister Pleasure.)

476
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:23,540
Lyu Liang from the Lyu Village.

477
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:25,940
You killed your younger sister.

478
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:27,220
Thus becoming the Lyu family's

479
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:30,020
strongest Soul Whisperer practitioner.

480
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:32,420
You even ran away from home.

481
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:36,180
The whole of the Outsiders' world
is looking for you.

482
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:38,100
That's impressive, Lyu Liang.

483
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:40,620
You're crazier than the people
in the Sinister Pleasure.

484
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:46,180
I want to become a member.

485
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:51,500
Do you really want to join the Sinister Pleasure?

486
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,940
I think you just want
the Sinister Pleasure to protect you.

487
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:54,860
Can't I?

488
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:56,020
I'm sure

489
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:57,620
my Soul Whisperer will come in handy one day.

490
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:01,860
If you can't make the call,

491
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:03,220
get the Interim Leader.

492
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:06,740
There's no need for that.

493
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:08,580
You can join the Sinister Pleasure.

494
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:10,820
How do I do that?

495
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:14,340
As long as you declare yourself

496
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:16,140
a member of the Sinister Pleasure,

497
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:18,900
the Sinister Pleasure will accept you.

498
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:21,060
That simple?

499
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:23,620
That simple.

500
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:26,420
(I have always been aware)

501
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:28,100
(that it would be difficult to achieve)

502
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:30,500
(what I want to do on my own.)

503
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:32,620
(Joining the Sinister Pleasure)

504
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:33,860
(meets the most suitable requirements)

505
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:35,740
(to carry out all my plans so far.)

506
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:38,100
(That's why I hid in the organization.)

507
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:39,940
(Be it Interim Leader)

508
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:41,500
(or the plans of Sinister Pleasure.)

509
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:43,660
(It was all part of my plan.)

510
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:45,980
I did it.

511
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:47,060
(I basically confirmed)

512
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:48,820
(my speculations)

513
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:51,100
(through unlocking the memories
of Zhang Huaiyi and Tian Jinzhong.)

514
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:52,820
(The Lyu family's Soul Whisperer)

515
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:54,540
(is indeed closely related)

516
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:56,740
(to the Jiashen Calamity.)

517
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:59,060
(The Sinister Pleasure was gone.)

518
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:00,660
(All I could do was hide.)

519
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:02,980
(I no longer had the strength
to keep finding the truth.)

520
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:04,700
(This day still came eventually.)

521
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:06,460
(I had no choice but to return to that place.)

522
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:14,740
What?

523
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:15,820
It was

524
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:16,620
the Double Quan Palm.

525
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:21,060
Great-grandpa.

526
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:33,740
(Just when I thought)

527
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:35,580
(that all my plans)

528
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:38,740
(had to end here,)

529
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:43,060
(perhaps I received a blessing from God.)

530
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:45,540
(I was reborn)

531
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:50,820
(in darkness.)

532
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:01,340
(Even though you killed Huan,)

533
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:02,860
(I'm sure you didn't mean it.)

534
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:03,740
(I didn't do it!)

535
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:04,420
(I sincerely wished)

536
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:06,300
(that you weren't the killer.)

537
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:07,500
(You deserve to die for betraying)

538
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,220
(your clan.)

539
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:09,140
(What is)

540
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:10,060
(Double Quan Palm?)

541
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:12,340
(This is the Lyu family's biggest secret.)

542
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:13,900
(You must protect it.)

543
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:14,620
(He cannot die.)

544
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:16,340
(Every drop of blood of the Lyu family)

545
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:18,140
(is very precious.)

546
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:31,700
(The Double Quan Palm)

547
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:34,300
(is something that's from the blood.)

548
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,220
Lyu Gong.

549
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:15,820
Lyu Gong?

550
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:04,420
Lyu Liang.

551
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:07,260
No.

552
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:08,900
This is impossible.

553
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:10,580
You grew your limbs.

554
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:15,260
How did you grow your limbs?

555
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:18,380
You're not Lyu Liang.

556
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:20,340
You're not him!

557
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:30,860
You punk.

558
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:34,220
You think you're all that now?

559
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:42,300
How did a stupid and filthy old fool like you

560
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:44,180
become one of the Ten Elders?

561
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:51,420
Have you heard of this saying?

562
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:53,580
Living on to old age,

563
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:55,380
that is to be a pest.

564
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:57,500
