Gold Brilliance Spell is off-limits
to the public.

10
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:37,980
No matter who your grandfather is,

11
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:39,420
he's a traitor to Mount Longhu.

12
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:42,100
That explains

13
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:44,020
why you're such a twerp.

14
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:46,740
He must be one as well.

15
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:48,820
Vileness does run in your blood.

16
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:52,700
My grandfather isn't a traitor.

17
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:55,940
Take your nonsense elsewhere.

18
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:06,980
Martial Uncle.

19
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:08,340
That's too hard on him.

20
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,300
Grandmaster told us to...

21
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:23,100
(Chulan,)

22
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:23,940
(do not ever)

23
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:26,740
(show your powers in front of others)

24
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:27,900
(no matter when.)

25
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:28,860
(But, Grandpa,)

26
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:29,860
you have to tell me

27
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:31,940
when I can use martial arts
if you're imparting it to me.

28
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,780
I can't tell you

29
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:35,940
when you can use it.

30
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,860
However, you need to remember

31
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:40,780
when you can't use it.

32
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:42,900
Chulan,

33
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:45,380
do not ever

34
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:47,620
show your powers in front of others

35
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:48,980
no matter when.

36
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:56,020
But, Grandpa,

37
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:57,780
you force me to practice martial arts every day.

38
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,660
Now, you don't want me to use it
in front of others.

39
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,820
I don't feel like practicing martial arts now.

40
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:02,580
It's tiring,

41
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:03,740
and I can't use it anyway.

42
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:05,780
Chulan,

43
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:07,140
actually,

44
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,540
I know what you're thinking.

45
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:10,060
However,

46
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:12,140
this is a sin I've committed.

47
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:15,660
You have no choice but to learn this.

48
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,580
Grandpa,

49
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:18,460
what sin

50
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:19,260
have you committed?

51
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:20,420
Listen to me.

52
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:23,380
The Zhang family

53
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:25,420
is a family of martial artists.

54
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,060
The residents

55
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,820
of the martial arts world

56
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:31,260
fear nothing,

57
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,900
except for

58
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:36,020
people who are too different from them.

59
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:37,340
If you're too wicked,

60
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:38,820
they'll eradicate you.

61
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:39,940
If you're too timid,

62
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:41,700
they'll walk all over you.

63
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,660
If you're too kind or too strong,

64
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:44,980
they'll be wary of you.

65
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:47,660
They can only accept you

66
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:50,260
when you're almost at the same level as them.

67
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:56,420
Do you know why the martial arts techniques
of the Zhang family

68
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:58,540
cannot be imparted to outsiders?

69
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,660
It's because once we reveal them to other people,

70
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:05,140
people will treat you like an Outsider.

71
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:06,420
By then,

72
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:07,380
they will

73
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:09,460
hunt you down.

74
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,980
Outstanding individuals

75
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:16,820
are often targeted.

76
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,620
We have no choice.

77
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:26,460
Zhang Chulan,

78
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:27,620
don't get up.

79
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:38,780
(Grandpa.)

80
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:40,100
(Get up! You have to continue!)

81
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:41,580
Utilize the Gold Aura in you.

82
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:42,860
(Heaven and Earth.)

83
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:44,740
Heaven and Earth.

84
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:46,820
Qi as the primordial root.

85
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,020
Qi as the primordial root.

86
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,260
Through myriads of ordeals.

87
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:53,260
Through myriads of ordeals.

88
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,740
I shall prove my dominance!

89
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:01,060
Come on! Let's fight!

90
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:01,980
Cut the crap!

91
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,420
You wish to fight me?

92
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:04,300
Who do you think you are?

93
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,540
I'll wipe that smugness off your face!

94
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,140
Qi's Form.

95
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:24,870
[Qi's Form]

96
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,540
(No matter who your grandfather is,)

97
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,580
(he's a traitor to Mount Longhu.)

98
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:03,940
(The Outsider who killed
over ten members of Sinister Pleasure)

99
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:05,660
(was your grandfather,)

100
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:06,900
(Zhang Xilin.)

101
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,460
(To you,)

102
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:11,740
(he was a loving and caring grandfather.)

103
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:13,380
(But to the world of Outsiders,)

104
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:17,140
(he was a thug who had over ten deaths on him.)

105
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,300
This is all you're capable of

106
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,340
after giving it your all.

107
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:07,420
I don't know

108
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:09,340
how your grandfather managed to learn
the Gold Brilliance Spell in secret.

109
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:10,740
However, I will never allow

110
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,380
an unknown person

111
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:13,740
with no powers like you

112
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,460
to taint Celestial Taoist Mansion's name.

113
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,220
Let's go.

114
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:31,420
We'll return to Mount Longhu.

115
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:33,060
Martial Uncle,

116
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:34,900
didn't Grandmaster tell us
to invite Zhang Chulan back?

117
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:35,900
Forget about that.

118
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,100
I've already tested him.

119
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,780
Zhang Chulan doesn't deserve it.

120
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:40,180
Stop right there.

121
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:42,100
Who said you could go?

122
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:49,220
Zhang Chulan,

123
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:50,900
don't get up.

124
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:53,100
Martial Uncle won't engage you in another fight.

125
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:02,380
I'm done

126
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:05,020
with hiding.

127
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:12,380
All these years,

128
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:16,380
Grandpa told me to hide my powers

129
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:18,500
and keep a low profile.

130
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:22,540
It's because I'm a freak to normal people.

131
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:28,100
I've had a rough time hiding.

132
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:30,500
To be honest,

133
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:33,180
I was very happy when I heard about

134
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,980
the Outsiders.

135
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,140
I thought

136
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:40,740
I no longer need to

137
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:43,340
live in a dark corner all by myself.

138
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,220
I thought I found a world

139
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:48,060
where I could live freely.

140
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:51,100
I thought I could find other people like me.

141
00:07:58,420 --> 00:07:59,620
In the end,

142
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:03,580
even you Outsiders treat me

143
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:04,900
like a freak

144
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,300
because of that darned Qi Apotheosis.

145
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:09,340
I no longer

146
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:11,260
know what to do now.

147
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:18,500
Nothing good happened to me

148
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,700
ever since I met you guys.

149
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:23,300
Now, I just want to cause a huge mess!

150
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,420
Come on! Let's continue!

151
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:27,260
If we keep this up,

152
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:28,940
I might turn you into a cripple.

153
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:40,340
Try me then.

154
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,220
Fine.

155
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:42,980
I'll satisfy your request.

156
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,220
Zhang Chulan,

157
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,180
you don't need to fear him.

158
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:52,820
He's just a senior member
of Celestial Taoist Mansion.

159
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,220
You no longer need to hide or escape

160
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:57,020
once you become my slave.

161
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,100
If you don't want to live like a loser,

162
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,260
you should stand up.

163
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:03,820
From now on, live like a decent human being.

164
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,060
Crush all those

165
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:06,180
who trouble you.

166
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,580
Feng Baobao,

167
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,420
you're here too?

168
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,100
What did you call me?

169
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:25,460
Ms. Bao.

170
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:31,580
I'm sorry, Master.

171
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:32,620
I know my fault now.

172
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,300
You can pretend to be smug in front of them.

173
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,220
Do it in front of me,

174
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:37,020
and I'll kill you.

175
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:40,340
Go.

176
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:42,460
Show them what you got.

177
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:44,540
Yes,

178
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:45,580
Master.

179
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:57,300
[Patience]

180
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,620
Grandpa.

181
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:01,660
Look, I have

182
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:02,500
plenty of Gold Aura now.

183
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,020
You don't need to force me
to practice every day, right?

184
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:04,940
It's nothing worth showing off.

185
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:05,940
You still have a long way to go.

186
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:08,300
Why did you think I told you
to practice this spell?

187
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,380
It's just the basics.

188
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:11,460
You won't be able to learn the things

189
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:12,580
I will teach you

190
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:14,460
if your Gold Aura doesn't reach a certain level.

191
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:15,340
It's the real deal.

192
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:16,220
Got it?

193
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:25,660
What is that?

194
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:26,660
My Gold Aura

195
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,900
was ripped to shreds.

196
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:31,140
Can a human possess such power?

197
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:33,060
If you master this,

198
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:34,980
it'll become your strongest spell.

199
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:44,260
Next,

200
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:46,740
I'll show him

201
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,740
my strongest spell.

202
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:50,380
Yes.

203
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:51,900
This is the spell.

204
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,660
You used this against the thralls

205
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:55,100
in the cemetery.

206
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,900
A power that surpasses Gold Aura's.

207
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:00,140
This sensation,

208
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:01,140
could it be...

209
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:02,340
I understand now.

210
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:04,660
It's likely that Zhang Xilin

211
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,140
was a member of the Celestial Taoist Mansion.

212
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:07,820
But it's fake at the same time.

213
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:08,700
The Celestial Taoist Mansion

214
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:09,740
never had a member like him.

215
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:10,540
So, it's likely

216
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:11,740
that the Celestial Taoist Mansion

217
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:12,980
was hiding Zhang Xilin's identity on purpose.

218
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,500
He's someone they want to get rid of.

219

[Invitation]

220
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:18,620
[Outsider Martial Arts Contest of Mount Longhu]

221
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:20,500
The Celestial Taoist Mansion
is inviting Zhang Chulan

222
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,700
and elite members of all sects
to attend the Celestial Taoist Selection?

223
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,140
Is the current Chief Celestial Taoist
out of his mind?

224
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:26,140
If this is true,

225
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:26,980
not only will Zhang Chulan

226
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:28,060
and our company be affected,

227
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:30,220
but the entire Outsiders' world
will also undergo a huge change.

228
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,460
It's been so many years.

229
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:34,620
But this is my first time
using it against a human.

230
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:35,780
That's impossible.

231
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:39,420
Do you think your Gold Aura Armor is amazing?

232
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,100
Try this for size!

233
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,260
It's a Lighting Technique indeed.

234
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,220
I'm already shocked that Zhang Chulan
knows the Gold Brilliance Spell.

235
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:56,340
But he actually knows Lighting Techniques too?

236
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,540
However, his Lighting Technique
is different from Martial Uncle's.

237
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:00,660
It's white. It resembles
the Chief Celestial Taoist's technique.

238
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:02,140
That's impossible.

239
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:04,340
Martial Uncle is Chief Celestial Taoist's
last disciple.

240
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:05,860
Of course, he'll impart
the technique to Martial Uncle.

241
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,180
Besides, Lightning Techniques
cannot be learned in secret.

242
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:12,020
Martial Uncle, how do you feel?

243
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:14,260
I suppose your Gold Aura is fading.

244
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:15,380
Admit your defeat!

245
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:18,740
Among all the disciples, only a few

246
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:20,100
are known as senior members.

247
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,300
And among these senior members,

248
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,860
only a few of them
can learn Lightning Techniques.

249
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:25,460
And no matter how good they are at them,

250
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:27,260
they have no right to impart them to someone else.

251
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:28,420
In the past millennium,

252
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:29,820
the only person
who could impart Lightning Techniques

253
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,980
to other people was Chief Celestial Taoist.

254
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:33,740
Also, Lightning Techniques
will only be imparted

255
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:35,380
to the senior disciple who's most likely

256
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,660
to be the successor
of the Chief Celestial Taoist.

257
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:39,420
That doesn't make sense at all.

258
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:40,540
If his grandfather

259
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,020
was the senior disciple
who was most likely to be the successor

260
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:42,700
of Chief Celestial Taoist,

261
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:43,980
how could we have not heard of

262
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:45,460
the name Zhang Xilin?

263
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:48,100

00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:12,300
Next, I will crush

266
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,980
your Gold Aura entirely.

267
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:21,540
Martial Uncle,

268
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:23,340
you'll be utterly embarrassed.

269
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:26,860
Is that Lightning Palm?

270
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:35,940
He can use that too?

271
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:37,380
I never expected that brat

272
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:38,780
to be so adept with Lightning Techniques.

273
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,580
It's the same spell.

274
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,220
Wait.

00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,460
why is his lightning tainted?

278
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:19,500
Don't panic.

279
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,500

Hey, you.

You better watch out before you bully my lackey.

00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:11,060
Why do I need your recognition in the first place?

301
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:12,700
Aren't you curious

302
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,260
about why your grandfather

303
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:16,340
could utilize the techniques
of the Celestial Taoist Mansion?

[60 days until Outsider Martial Arts Contest]

305
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:35,500
You're still pretending?

306
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:40,700
Sorry about that.

307
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:41,860
It's been so many years.

308
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:43,300
I'm already used to pretending.

309
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,300
Ms. Bao,

310
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,780
since I already used my superpower,

311
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,420
does that make me an Outsider now?

312
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:50,180
If so, should I return to being
a normal person tomorrow?

313
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:51,740
Or should I act like an Outsider?

314
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:53,340
Of course you should act like an Outsider.

315
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:54,900
I don't think that's appropriate.

316
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,540
The Outsiders' world is a dangerous place.

317
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:58,860
I don't think I'm capable enough to survive there.

318
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:00,100
I was only able to act tough

319
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,620

Trust?

323
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:09,260
What is trust?

324
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:15,100
Trust?

325
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,260
I think this is what it means.

326
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,220
Trust is a term.

327
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:30,580
Its pinyin is "xinren".

328
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:31,660
One, it means believing in someone.

329
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:33,940
Two, it means entrusting
your heart to someone else.

330
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:35,060
Third, it means...

331
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:37,460
Actually, I think its meaning is not important.

332
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:38,660
To me, trust is

333
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:41,420
being your slave unconditionally.

334
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,500

are meek and weak?

375
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,100
I'll just use Gate of Gale.

376
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:50,980
How did you know?

377
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:52,780
I thought Gate of Gale

378
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:54,460
was one of Wudang Sect's techniques.

379
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,300
That's right.

380
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:57,660
However, do you know

381
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:00,020
how many people in the Outsiders' world
desire this technique?

382
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:01,180
In the Year of Jiashen,

383
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:02,700
Mount Wudang was attacked.

384
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:04,620
My brother,

385
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:05,340
Zhou Sheng,

386
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:06,980
Hong, Fang, and the rest

387
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:09,380
sacrificed themselves to protect this place.

388
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:10,540
After that,

389
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:13,300
everyone thought that the technique was lost.

390
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:15,980
If Gate of Gale appears again,

391
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:17,700
Wudang Sect will be annihilated.

392
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:19,980
Grandmaster,

393
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:22,140
stealing from other people
is no longer the norm now.

394
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:23,140
Humans

395
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:25,300
will never change.

396
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:26,660
You should go back.

397
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:32,060
(Mount Longhu is a renowned Taoist mountain.)

398
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:34,020
(It's one of the 72 Blessed Grounds.)

399
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:35,900
(It is known as the Taoist capital.)

400
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:38,900
(The Chief Celestial Taoist once concocted
the Nine Heaven Divine Pill on this mountain.)

401
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,820
(A dragon appeared when the pill was created.)

402
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:42,740
[Paradise on Earth, Mount Longhu]
(That's why it's known as Mount Longhu.)

403
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:44,500
No matter how many fancy adjectives they use,

404
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,060
in the end, it's just a mountain.

405
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:47,300
I don't want to be a Taoist.

406
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:48,780
Why should I go there?

407
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:51,140
What you saw just now
was meant for ordinary people.

408
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:52,140
There's a sparring contest

409
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:53,340
for Outsiders on Mount Longhu.

410
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:54,820
It's called Outsider Martial Arts Contest.

411
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:57,180
In the past, it was an internal sparring contest
between members of Mount Longhu.

412
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:58,780
This time, it's an open contest.

413
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:00,620
The winner can inherit
the title of Chief Celestial Taoist

414
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:02,140
and receive Tianshidu.

415
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:03,620
What's Tianshidu?

416
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:05,260
We'll arrive soon.

417
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:06,180
I'll tell you when we arrive.

418
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:08,100
Ms. Bao,

419
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,460
where are we going?

420
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:10,140
Many years ago,

421
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:12,580
our company spent a huge sum on a villa.

422
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:14,300
Mr. Xu lived there before.

423
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,500
I already submitted a request to the company.

424
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,900
We'll be living there for a few days.

425
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:19,060
A villa?

426
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,660
And Mr. Xu lived there before?

427
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:23,180
Ms. Bao, are we going on a vacation?

428
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:24,860
You could say so.

429
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:26,580
What are we waiting for then?

430
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:27,940
Ms. Bao, hurry up!

431
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:32,780
[48 days until Outsider Martial Arts Contest]

432
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:33,540
(Ms. Bao,)

433
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:35,220
how huge is the private cinema?

434
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:38,620
Is the pool right beside a lake?

435
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:39,980
It should at least

436
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:41,500
have a private gym, right?

437
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:45,980
We're here.

438
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:55,700
Ms. Bao,

439
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:56,700
you must be mistaken.

440
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:57,740
This is the place.

441
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:00,700
You still have a long way to go before you can win

442
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:01,860
the Outsider Martial Arts Contest.

443
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:04,180
This place is remote and quiet.

444
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:05,980
From today onward, we'll be living here.

445
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:07,220
I will train you.

446
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:08,260
Train me?

447
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,540
I thought we were on vacation.

448
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,140
Ms. Bao,

449
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:12,460
you must be kidding me.

450
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:13,220
Get off the vehicle.

451
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:17,020
[NDT Holiday Resort]

452
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:18,380
[NDT Derelict Site]

453
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:20,940
You might not understand what I've said just now.

454
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,220
You belong to me

455
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:22,940
until next month.

456
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:24,700
Ms. Bao,

457
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:27,540
it's not that I don't want to train.

458
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:28,740
But you saw it yourself.

459
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:30,660
No matter how strong that martial artist was,

460
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:31,380
we were well-matched

461
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:32,820
when I gave it my all.

462
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:34,220
It was a narrow defeat.

463
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,620
You think you're well-matched?

464
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,820
That Taoist only used 30% of his strength.

465
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:38,780
He was testing you.

466
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,220
Are you serious?

467
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:43,300
If so...

468
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:45,380
If so, there's no reason to train.

469
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:47,420
I can't defeat him
no matter how hard I train anyway.

470
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:49,060
Let's go.

471
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:50,300
Didn't you say you wish to know

472
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:52,060
the truth about your grandfather?

473
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:54,020
Even if you're uninterested
in the title of Chief Celestial Taoist,

474
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:56,260
you can use this opportunity
to rise through the ranks.

475
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:57,500
Only then will you have the chance

476
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,140
to be in contact with the person
who knows the truth,

477
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:01,180
Zhang Zhiwei, the 99th Chief Celestial Taoist.

478
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,060
Stop wasting time.

479
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:12,780
Here's your first training.

480
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:13,860
Clean this place up.

481
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,220
Although Zhang Chulan

482
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:20,820
knows the Gold Brilliance Spell
and Lightning Techniques,

483
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:21,820
he is

484
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:24,140
no match for Martial Uncle.

485
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:25,220
Lingyu,

486
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:27,540
how did you spar against Zhang Chulan?

487
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:32,820
(Descend the mountain tomorrow)

488
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:34,380
(and find someone for me.)

489
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:35,300
Test him

490
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:37,540
and see if he's good enough.

491
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:39,180
Good enough for what?

492
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:40,980
Good enough to inherit the Tianshidu.

493
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:44,420
You won against him.

494
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:46,060
Why are you pulling a long face?

495
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:02,420
Lingyu.

496
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:07,820
You've been back for a few days.

497
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,180
Why didn't you come and see me?

498
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:11,100
Master,

499
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:14,660
the Outsider Martial Arts Contest
will begin soon.

500
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:16,100
I have to train hard

501
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:17,620
so that I won't bring disgrace to Mount Longhu.

502
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:21,100
If so, I'll cut to the chase.

503
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:23,620
What do you think about Zhang Chulan?

504
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:25,860
His martial arts were nothing special.

505
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:27,180
However,

506
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:29,660
the Gold Brilliance Spell
and Lightning Techniques he used

507
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:31,700
did originate from Mount Longhu.

508
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,060
In that case,

509
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,900
what do you think about his character?

510
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:35,860
Well,

511
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:37,500
I'm not so sure about that.

512
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,580
However, I feel

513
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:39,820
that he's somewhat slick.

514
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:41,060
I don't like him.

515
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:45,260
Being likable might not be the only reason

516
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:47,100
we live in the world, you know?

517
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:54,020
It's the same for you.

518
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:10,460
Why did you hit me?

519
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:12,180
Accumulate air in your dantian.
Make sure the qi circulates upward.

520
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:13,020
You got it wrong.

521
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:13,780
Again.

522
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:19,980
I'll get angry if you keep hitting me!

523
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:21,260
Utilizing your qi is a basic skill.

524
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:22,100
You don't even know how to utilize your qi.

525
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,420
How can you compete with the other Outsiders?

526
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:24,260
Again.

527
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,500
You're hitting me even when I haven't started.

528
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:34,700
You were wrong before starting.

529
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,100
Your posture was wrong.

530
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:36,980
It's been a long time

531
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:38,500
since I saw a useless fool like you.

532
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:42,500
Ms. Bao.

533
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,060
Don't move.

534
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:56,500
Don't speak.

535
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:18,900
Feng Baobao, what did you do to me?

536
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:21,460
When you can't stand it,

537
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:22,260
(when you encounter difficulties,)

538
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:23,380
(you have to flick yourself.
You have to endure it.)

539
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:24,940
Flick yourself until you don't feel anything.

540
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:25,620
(You have to endure it.)

541
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:26,300
Just endure it.

542
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:27,620
You have to endure it.

543
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,660
(Chulan,)

544
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:36,300
(I'm old now.)

545
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:39,220
(I don't know for how many more years
I can keep you company.)

546
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:42,260
(In the future, you'll be all alone.)

547
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:49,020
Get up and train.

548
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:51,900
Feng Baobao,

549
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:52,900
are you even human?

550
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:53,900
I fainted, you know?

551
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,580
You still want me to train?

552
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:56,860
You didn't faint.

553
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:58,420
I imparted a technique to you.

554
00:26:58,420 --> 00:26:59,860
The formula is inside your brain now.

555
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:00,380
Next,

556
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:02,220
you just need to train according to the formula.

557
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:05,380
Yeah.

558
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:06,100
I suddenly feel like

559
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:08,220
I know different ways of utilizing qi now.

560
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,620
Although your Gold Brilliance Spell
and Lightning Techniques

561
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:13,220
are decent,

562
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:14,540
one month isn't enough

563
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:16,100
to improve your strength tremendously.

564
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:17,500
Try mine.

565
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,020
What do you call this technique?

566
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:20,620
I call it the Old Farmer Technique.

567
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:21,540
Old Farmer Technique?

568
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:23,140
What a strange name.

569
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:25,780
Feng Baobao, what are you doing?

570
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:26,500
What am I doing?

571
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:27,140
I'm going to take a bath.

572
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:28,060
I'm here, you know?

573
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:29,980
Do you know the meaning of being shy?

574
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:31,100
Shy?

575
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:32,940
Indeed.

576
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:34,060
I think other people said

577
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:35,220
the same thing as you before.

578
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,740
Compared to this, you should train now.

579
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:37,420
Hurry up.

580
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:49,580
♪Hearing the loud summer evening♪

581
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:51,580

♪The warmth that is neglected♪

586

Hurry and train.

What are you looking at?

593
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:38,780
Hurry and train.

594
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:44,820
Your qi is flowing in the wrong direction.

595
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:46,660
How did you know?

596
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:48,220
Why does your qi keep flowing
in the wrong direction?

597
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:49,740
You already did it several times.

598
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:51,780
It seems like it's flowing downward for no reason.

599
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:54,100
How can my qi flow in the right direction

600
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,060
when you're

601
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:55,500
wearing

602
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,260
that?

603
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:59,940
You have a point. I'll get changed then.

604
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:16,740
Ms. Bao,

605
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:17,740
you know how to feed pigs too?

606
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:18,580
Yeah.

607
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:19,380
Harvest potatoes,

608
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:20,420
split yellow peas,

609
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:21,260
remove moles,

610
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,660
I know how to do all of them.

611
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:24,220
Ms. Bao,

612
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,220
you're so capable.

613
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:27,060
What kind of childhood did you have?

614
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:28,340
Why don't you tell me about it?

615
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:31,300
I've never been through anything.

616
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,700
I forgot about my past completely.

617
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:35,380
Don't be so petty.

618
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:35,900
What about this?

619
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,100
I'll tell you

620
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:38,500
about my childhood.

621
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:41,220
Let me tell you a random story.

622
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:42,220
When I was young,

623
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:43,740
a boy who was a few years older than me

624
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,500
wanted to bully me.

625
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:47,380
Back then, I wasn't allowed to use my superpowers.

626
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:48,100
What did I do then?

627
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:49,140
I radiated a strong aura

628
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:50,900
and scared them so much
that they peed their pants.

629
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:52,940
And let me tell you this.

630
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:55,180
When I did so,

631
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:57,020
even the cicadas in the courtyard
stopped chirping.

632
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:58,140
I think they were stunned

633
00:29:58,140 --> 00:29:59,140
by my aura too.

634
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,140
Did anything else happen after that?

635
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:04,460
Of course.

636
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:06,660
After that,
something more interesting happened.

637
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:17,300
It's in the wrong direction.

638
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:18,300
It's still flowing in the wrong direction.

639
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:20,220
I'm already dressed decently.

640
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:22,020
Even so, you were affected.

641
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:23,540
Ms. Bao,

642
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:25,580
I just can't do this.

643
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:26,860
Your heart must be calm when you utilize your qi.

644
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:28,700
You have too many things on your mind.

645
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:30,180
You always got distracted

646
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:31,740
when you almost succeeded.

647
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:32,580
You couldn't complete

648
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,100
the final and the most vital step.

649
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:35,380
The seal existed

650
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:37,140
in order to help you retain your focus.

651
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:39,020
But now, it's becoming an obstacle for you.

652
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:41,140
Adolescent males are troublesome indeed.

653
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:42,940
I don't wish for this to happen either.

654
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:44,500
How is this my fault?

655
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:45,580
It's not your fault that you have a seal on you.

656
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:47,900
However, it's your fault that you're affected by it.

657
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:48,900
We have to resolve this issue.

658
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:51,820
Do you want to do it yourself?

659
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:52,660
Or do you want me to do it?

660
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:57,260
Ms. Bao!

661
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:59,700
I can do it! Please trust me one more time!

662
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:00,740
Wait here for me.

663
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:13,620
Ms. Bao,

664
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:14,580
what's going on?

665
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:15,580
Is today your birthday?

666
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:24,540
Hi, Bao.

667
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:25,660
Bao!

668
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:27,140
You're so pretty.

669
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:30,020
Hi, Bao.

670
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:38,260
Isn't he cute?

671
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:39,500
This is Meng,

672
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:40,340
Tian,

673
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:41,060
Jing,

674
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:41,700
Han,

675
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:42,460
and Lisa.

676
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:42,940
Hello.

677
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:44,580
They are all friends of Xu Si

678
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:46,500
and came especially to our party.

679
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:48,220
You guys get to know each other.

680
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:50,620
He's pretty handsome.

681
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:54,100
This is Zhang Chulan,
whom I've mentioned to you guys before.

682
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:57,340
His biggest weakness is

683
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:58,980
that he's been single ever since he was born.

684
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:00,180
He's an idiot when it comes to relationships.

685
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:02,140
You guys can be more proactive.

686
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:03,540
He's a loyal hunk you can't get elsewhere.

687
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:04,540
First come, first served!

688
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:07,580
Since this is a party,

689
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:08,780
I think I should stick with the usual.

690
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:10,300
Why don't I introduce myself first?

691
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:11,620
-My name is...
-That's unnecessary.

692
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:13,100
We know

693
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,260
everything about you.

694
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:18,060
Let's go.

695
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:19,900
Come on.

696
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:21,380
Sit.

697
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:24,260
I heard that you studied overseas.

698
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:26,340
Did you study in an elite school?

699
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:28,100
Elite school?

700
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:30,140
Drink up. He's so good at this.

701
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:31,540
I heard that you're good at golf.

702
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:32,420
Can you bring me

703
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:34,220
to your personal golf club?

704
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:36,220
Golf?

705
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:38,740
What have you told them?

706
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:39,820
You should cherish your chance.

707
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:41,100
This is all I can do for you.

708
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:42,260
Come on.

709
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:45,180
Bottoms up.

710
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:45,980
Come on.

711
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:48,460
He can hold his liquor well.

712
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:49,460
He's so cute.

713
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:53,100
Look at his pecs!

714
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:55,180
He has pecs!

715
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:06,700
He has pecs!

716
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:08,100
Enough.

717
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:11,740
Come on, I'll help you get undressed.

718
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:14,500
I'm not hot.

719
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:15,460
No!

720
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:16,140
I'll stop.

721
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:17,180
Don't be shy.

722
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:18,380
We'll help you get undressed later.

723
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:25,500
(Feng Baobao,)

724
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,220
(who do you take me for?)

725
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:30,260
(Are you an idiot?)

726
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:31,540
(Look at your own face.)

727
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:32,580
(How foolish you must be)

728
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:34,100
(to believe that girls)

729
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:36,020
(would throw themselves at a guy like you.)

730
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:38,300
(It's been so long)

731
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:39,940
(since I've seen a useless fool like you.)

732
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:42,820
Get out!

733
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:01,220
He has a terrible temper.

734
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:02,300
Who do you think you are?

735
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:03,140
Precisely.

736
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:04,100
We wouldn't even be here

737
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:05,420
if Bao didn't beg us to come.

738
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:06,140
Look at this decrepit house of yours.

739
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:07,700
Stop pretending to be a rich man's son.

740
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:10,540
-What's wrong with him?
-I know, right?

741
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:11,900
He was pretending to be a rich man's son.

742
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:12,580
Let's go.

743
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:16,940
A coward.

744
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:21,180
A useless fool.

745
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:25,140
I see,

746
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:26,700
that's how you guys see me.

747
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:37,700
You tried to use all those fancy words
to describe me.

748
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:44,700
But to you,

749
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:47,860
I'm still a useless fool that nobody loves,

750
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:49,260
right?

751
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:52,820
I thought you always wanted

752
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:54,740
to remove the seal?

753
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:06,140
Feng Baobao,

754
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:10,780
this master-servant game is over.

755
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:12,500
What did you say?

756
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:16,860
Before this, my grandfather told me
to keep a low profile

757
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:18,060
because he didn't want me

758
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:19,900
to join the Outsiders' circle.

759
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:22,020
That's why I listened to him

760
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:24,140
and kept a low profile for many years.

761
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:28,060
Now that my identity has been exposed,

762
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:29,220
there's no point

763
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:30,820
in hiding anymore.

764
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:34,500
And I realize

765
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:38,100
that the more I try to pretend to be a coward,

766
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:41,060
the more you guys take it for real.

767
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:44,660
Come back.

768
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:46,580
Do you know the consequences

769
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:48,140
of walking out of here?

770
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:50,380
I do.

771
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:52,820
Feng Baobao,

772
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:55,700
I can't defeat you.

773
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:58,700
And I know that I might die here

774
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:03,020
if I keep this up.

775
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:05,660
However, if I don't keep this up,

776
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:10,420
I'll lose all of my dignity here.

777
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:19,180
To me,

778
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:23,100
that's scarier than losing my life.

There's no need to avoid them.

They can't hurt you.

800

Who are those?

801
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:04,660
These are members of the Wudang Sect

802
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:07,380
and people who tried to steal the Gate of Gale.

803
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:10,300
What you're seeing now is a part
of the Jiashen Calamity.

804
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:12,540
It was a terrible mess.

805
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,500
Many people died or were seriously injured.

806
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:15,540
The person who survived it

807
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:17,260
became the sect leader instead.

808
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:19,020
Some went into hiding

809
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:19,980
as they were afraid.

810
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:22,140
However, some brought juniors like us with them

811
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:23,460
to fight them off.

812
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:25,940
We survived the Jiashen Calamity

813
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:28,820
and protected Wudang.

814
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:31,220
Wang Ye,

815
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:34,660
your phantasmagoria is extraordinary.

816
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:36,380
It contains a far greater meaning

817
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:38,140
than you can imagine.

818
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:41,060
You achieved something

819
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:42,420
in several months,

820
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:45,780
something we couldn't achieve
for several decades.

821
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:48,580
You're the chosen one.

822
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:51,500
You shouldn't be trapped by your phantasmagoria.

823
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:54,140
You need to learn how to control
your phantasmagoria.

824
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:56,100
This is your destiny

825
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:58,900
as well as your duty.

826
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:01,780
Big Ape is here as well.

827
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:04,780
Don't you wish to check out his abilities?

828
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:09,900
But I don't see it anywhere.

829
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:11,700
This is your phantasmagoria.

830
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:13,500
Don't look with your eyes.

831
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:15,380
Look with your heart.

832
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:31,860
It's been several decades.

833
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:34,540

[One of the creators of the Eight Supremes]
really know you.

836
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:43,020
Don't just look.

837
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:44,900
Learn with all your heart.

839
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:45,340
Gate of Gale?

840
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:47,500
Big Ape,

841
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:49,900
did you see that?

842
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:52,860
You have a successor now!

843
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:56,300
There's finally a successor

844
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:59,020
to the Gate of Gale!

845
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:12,940
Dry noodles, huh?

846
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:14,180
Master Hong.

847
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:16,340
It's been decades since I last had it.

848
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:18,860
It smells more delicious than meat

849
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:20,780
when you mix it.

850
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:24,420
Master Hong,

851
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:25,580
let me mix it for you.

852
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:31,780
I trapped myself in this cave

853
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:33,460
for several decades

854
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:37,260
just so I could preserve

855
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:40,780
a vain hope.

856
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:42,220
How pathetic.

857
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:44,460
What a pathetic story.

858
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:47,500
Back then,

859
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:50,100
Big Ape taught the three of us

860
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:52,260
Gate of Gale.

861
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:54,620
He did it out of good intentions.

862
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:56,740
However, he didn't know

863
00:41:57,540 --> 00:41:59,140
that the standards

864
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:01,340
that were natural to him

865
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:03,940
were impossible for us to achieve

866
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:05,900
even if we were to try our best.

867
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:09,620
I only figured out what it meant

868
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:11,180
when I saw you.

869
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:13,340
It's all because

870
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:15,420
our obsessions were too deep.

871
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:17,260
Wang Ye,

872
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:19,940
you aren't attached to gains and losses.

873
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:23,500
You could leave the phantasmagoria
anytime you like.

874
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:24,860
You'll definitely

875
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:27,300
put the Gate of Gale to good use.

876
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:30,780
I've been guarding this secret
on Big Ape's behalf for so many years.

877
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:33,580
I only understood what it meant

878
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:36,820
when I couldn't grab hold of anything.

879
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:39,260
Moving on from it

880
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:41,220
