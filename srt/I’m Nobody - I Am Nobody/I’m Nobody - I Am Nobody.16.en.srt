00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:49,660
(the technique used is called)

192
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:51,380
(the Five Elements Lightning Techniques.)

193
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,580
[Metal Lungs, Fire Heart]
(Virgins)

194
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:54,900
[Water Kidneys]
(are full of yang qi.)

195
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:55,260
[Metal Lungs, Fire Heart, Water Kidneys]

196
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,100
(That's why)

197
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,900
(they will have qi of the Metal Lungs
that is led by the Fire Heart.)

198
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,580
(So the first to develop)

199
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:02,940
(is the Five Elements Yang Lightning.)

200
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:03,700
[Metal Lungs, Fire Heart, Water Kidneys]

201
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,380
[Wood Liver]
(While those who are not virgins)

202
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:06,700
(have lost their primordial energy.)

203
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:07,180
[Wood Liver]

204
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:10,780
(Therefore, their qi of the Wood Liver
is led by the Water Kidneys.)

205
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:11,500
(That causes)

206
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,100
[Wood Liver]
(their yin qi to develop first.)

207
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,980
(And that is called
the Five Elements Yin Lightning.)

208
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:16,940
(Each five qi of yin-yang
has strengths and weaknesses.)

209
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:19,580
You must focus on one of them to cultivate.

210
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:23,020
Zhiwei.

211
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:25,820
Is Lingyu still hung up on
the Five Elements Yang Lightning?

212
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:26,780
Whenever this kid

213
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:28,180
uses Lighting Technique in public,

214
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:30,540
he only uses Lightning Palm.

215
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,740
He still can't overcome it.

216
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:34,340
Even when he's faced with a strong opponent,

217
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:36,380
he will still risk it
by defeating them with Lightning Palm.

218
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:37,420
Unfortunately,

219
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:39,820
Lightning Palm belongs to
the Five Elements Yang Lightning.

220
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:42,300
No matter how much he yearns for
the fairness and openness of yang,

221
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,660
yin is yin itself.

222
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,460
It is thick and filthy,

223
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:49,180
but also

224
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:50,220
peculiar and changeable.

225
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:51,980
When it takes effect,

226
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:53,660
it is like mercury that leaks from the ground

227
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:55,140
and fills every gap.

228
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:57,660
This is the true face
of the Five Elements Yin Lightning.

229
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:59,940
That is why Five Elements Yin Lightning
is also called

230
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:01,380
Impure Water Lightning.

231
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:05,500
[Impure Water Lightning]

232
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,420
Is that even lightning?

233
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:46,180
It is sticky and repressive.

234
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:47,380
It is clearly deadly,

235
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:49,340
but it also piques your curiosity.

236
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:54,100
(Lingyu.)

237
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:56,580
(You must be feeling terrible
using the Lighting Technique)

238
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:58,380
(in public.)

239
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:00,780
(Whatever the reason,)

240
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,580
(this is you now.)

241
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:03,940
(Accept it.)

242
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:06,300
(Accept who you are now.)

243
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,100
(Even if you turn into a pig,)

244
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,900
(you must also be calm and accept it.)

245
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:32,420
What is this?

246
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:38,740
No one can help him

247
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:39,860
at this point.

248
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,060
Zhang Chulan.

249
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:08,460
This is Impure Water Yin Lightning.

250
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:09,700
It crushes your bones

251
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:10,900
and burns your heart.

252
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:13,300
Only cultivation
much higher than mine can resist it.

253
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:14,620
Otherwise,

254
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:15,740
the only defense that can counter it

255
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:17,140
is your Yang Lightning.

256
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:18,060
The Heart Lighting.

257
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,380
I can only feel

258
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:24,420
how powerful you are when I've become stronger.

259
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:27,780
Frankly, before coming to Mount Longhu,

260
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:29,220
I never thought

261
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:30,740
I'd be able to enter the final round

262
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:31,740
and fight with you again.

263
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:35,660
You are powerful.

264
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:37,700
(Zhuge Qing is powerful.)

265
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:40,340
(Taoist Wang Ye is also powerful.)

266
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:41,620
Tai Chi Yang Palm.

267
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:43,220
(Everyone is doing their best)

268
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:44,300
(to surpass themselves.)

269
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,100
(I can't stop you all)

270
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,100
(from getting stronger.)

271
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:51,020
(But I will do everything I can
to get closer to that desire.)

272
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:54,180
Someone told me

273
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:55,820
that if I want to defeat you all,

274
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:57,420
I mustn't see you all as my opponent.

275
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,540
My opponent

276
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:05,460
is myself who has surpassed the limit.

277
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:20,900
Zhang Chulan.

278
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:22,780
You are very different today.

279
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:23,380
Good.

280
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,740
So you will only show your true colors

281
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:27,780
when you are cornered.

282
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:29,340
Spiritual Master Lingyu.

283
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:31,420
This attack that I will be using next

284
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:32,740
was newly invented by myself.

285
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:35,140
The effects are still not stable yet.

286
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:36,380
It only lasts for five minutes.

287
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:37,260
That would suffice.

288
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:40,260
I will take you out in five minutes.

289
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,500
If you please.

290
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:52,020
Injecting the Lightning Palm into yourself

291
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:53,180
to trigger your meridians.

292
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:55,460
Did you seriously think of that?

293
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:00,140
[Rapid Lightning]
Rapid Lightning.

294
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:00,600
[Rapid Lightning]

295
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,020
(Thick and moist.)

296
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:42,460
(Sticky.)

297
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:43,740
(As if it is dissolving)

298
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:45,500
(every inch of bone and muscle in me.)

299
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:47,740
(Five Elements Yin Lightning.)

300
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:48,700
(Impure Water.)

301
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:50,300
(I remember now.)

302
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:52,100
(Grandpa told me about the nature)

303
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,620
(of the Five Elements Yin Lightning.)

304
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,020
Chulan.

305
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:10,340
Do you still remember

306
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:12,460
what are the corresponding Stems-and-Branches

307
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:14,100
of the five organs that I told you?

308
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:16,900
I remember.

309
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,180
Then let me test you.

310
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:20,860
What is the corresponding earthly branch
of the heart and lungs?

311
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,220
Shen.

312
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:24,100
That's right. It is Shen.

313
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:25,300
Our ancestors compared

314
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,780
the yang of the heart and lungs

315
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:29,180
to a fiery monkey.

316
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:32,740
That's where the term "monkey mind" came from.

317
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:34,780
(There is another name for the monkey mind.)

318
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:36,260
(That is "practitioner".)

319
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:37,700
(Our ancestors believed)

320
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,420
that the more one experiences,

321
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:40,860
the stronger their heart becomes,

322
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,580
and the easier it is to train the monkey mind.

323
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:44,900
To achieve the perfect state,

324
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:47,180
one must understand the meaning of "emptiness".

325
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:49,380
(That is why)

326
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:50,940
(the goal of the monkey mind)

327
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:52,860
(is to understand emptiness.)

328
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,460
Little monkey,

329
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:59,020
you are still far from reaching

330
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,620
the state of understanding emptiness.

331
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:01,500
Besides that,

332
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:02,620
the yang of the heart

333
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,140
and lungs has another enemy.

334
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:05,820
It's called the yin of liver and kidneys.

335
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:07,620
The Five Elements match the Stems-and-Branches.

336
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,540
The liver and kidneys
correspond to the yin water.

337
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:11,940
The yin energy is just like

338
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,580
a pig that is soaked in water.

339
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,860
(But it controls our emotions and desires.)

340
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:17,940
(Such as)

341
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:19,420
(greed,)

342
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:20,580
(lust,)

343
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:21,340
(and so on.)

344
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:21,940
(Therefore,)

345
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:22,780
(if this pig)

346
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:24,060
(wants to cultivate,)

347
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:25,540
(it must keep the percepts,)

348
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:27,220
(which is the eight percepts.)

349
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:28,300
(But of course,)

350
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:29,900
not all desires

351
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,060
are useless.

352
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:32,580
Which means, it tells us

353
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:33,700
what you can do

354
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:35,500
and what you cannot.

355
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:36,900
Therefore,

356
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:37,940
the cultivation goal

357
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,780
of this pig

358
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:41,860
is to become aware.

359
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:44,140
So they are Sun Wukong and Zhu Bajie?

360
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,020
Grandpa.

361
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:46,700
Isn't this

362
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,300
the story of Journey to the West?

363
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,620
That's right.

364
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:52,060
Wukong and Bajie's yin and yang

365
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:53,180
don't match.

366
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:54,500
They oppose each other.

367
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,060
(However,)

368
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:56,900
(only one is destined to succeed.)

369
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:57,860
(That's why)

370
00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:00,100
(you mustn't disturb this pig.)

371
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,900
(Or else, when the Water Kidneys go haywire,)

372
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:03,700
everything you have trained

373
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:06,020
will go down the drain.

374
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,220
Grandpa.

375
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:08,940
If I tell them that this is what the story

376
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:09,780
of Journey to the West

377
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:10,660
is about,

378
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:11,580
do you think

379
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:12,860
my teachers and classmates

380
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,660
will think I am crazy?

381
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:17,700
They could.

382
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:21,540
Five Elements Yin Lightning.

383
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:23,300
Lightning of the Water Kidneys.

384
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:25,540
Grandpa.

385
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:27,260
I have come to understand it now.

386
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,860
(This fella has really become much stronger.)

387
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:57,820
What's so funny?

388
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:03,740
I have been lying to myself.

389
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:05,860
I have broken my primordial energy.

390
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:07,220
I can't practice the Yang Lightning.

391
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,820
But I refused to face it

392
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:09,780
and got angry at you.

393
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:13,980
I have hated you once.

394
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:17,060
I was also jealous of you.

395
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:21,780
Zhang Chulan.

396
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:25,820
I'm sorry.

397
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:29,540
All this time,

398
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:31,580
the person who is the worst

399
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:33,580
is me.

400
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:36,100
What?

401
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:38,980
I can't believe Taoist Zhang, who looks celibate,

402
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,700
once had a woman.

403
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:44,020
After this match,

404
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:46,780
I guess a lot of girls will be heartbroken.

405
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:53,380
I had no idea that's how you felt.

406
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:54,780
Enough with the fuss.

407
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,500
Escaping from your Yin Lightning

408
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,060
used up a lot of my energy.

409
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:00,060
The Rapid Lightning can't last for long either.

410
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:02,540
But I still want to say one last thing to you.

411
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:04,700
Stop being

412
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,100
so sharp-tongued.

413
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:11,860
I have to admit.

414
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,700
Life will be easier

415
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,340
if you are shameless sometimes.

416
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:17,300
But, Zhang Chulan,

417
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:19,220
I have a piece of advice for you too.

418
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:21,260
Be more upright.

419
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,420
This is the true face of Zhang Chulan.

420
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:43,380
This is that shameless fellow?

421
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:44,740
Dad.

422
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:46,380
When did you

423
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:47,500
discover his disguise?

424
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:49,740
The Zhang Chulan that you all perceive

425
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:51,020
is cowardly, despicable, and shameless.

426
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:52,780
That's what he wanted you all to see.

427
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:54,500
(Someone like that)

428
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,140
(won't make anyone feel threatened.)

429
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:59,340
(But look.)

430
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:00,420
(People have now forgotten)

431
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:02,060
(that he is the inheritor of the Qi Apotheosis.)

432
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:03,860
Zhang Chulan knows what he wants

433
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:05,100
and what he should give up.

434
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,380
(To do this,)

435
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:07,780
(you need certain qualities.)

436
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:09,460
(Forbearance, perseverance,)

437
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:10,700
(and even ruthlessness.)

438
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:12,300
You think you are all that?

439
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:15,780
Ruthless?

440
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:16,780
He doesn't fit

441
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:18,540
that description at all.

442
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:19,140
A few months ago,

443
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:21,300
Zhang Chulan suddenly
came into the Outsiders' World.

444
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,780
I looked into him.

445
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:23,620
NDT

446
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:24,780
noticed Zhang Chulan

447
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:26,020
when Zhang Xilin died.

448
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:28,140
The company deduced

449
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:29,420
that he wasn't an Outsider.

450
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:31,900
They thought he was just an ordinary kid.

451
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:32,980
Have you noticed

452
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:35,180
the scariest part in that?

453
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:36,180
Zhang Chulan gave up

454
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:37,740
the techniques his grandfather taught him.

455
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:38,580
He endured secretly

456
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:39,940
as an ordinary person for 12 years.

457
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:42,020
No matter how he was bullied or treated,

458
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:43,460
he never used his abilities.

459
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:46,020
He never exposed his true powers.

460
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,580
Over ten years of forbearance.

461
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:49,300
Even if he cultivated in secret,

462
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:51,820
you can imagine that he wasn't that efficient.

463
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:54,100
So do you get it now?

464
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:55,540
You peers

465
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:57,460
are facing an opponent

466
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:59,660
who has not cultivated for over ten years.

467
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:07,220
Impure Water.

468
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:08,140
Caecilian Lightning!

469
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:09,580
Little White Worm!

470
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:36,780
I see.

471
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:38,540
Is this the opposing power

472
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:40,540
that was hidden in my body?

473
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:45,300
Zhang Chulan.

474
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,020
Did you feel it?

475
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,940
Two forces resisting each other.

476
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:56,180
The one that can no longer resist first

477
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:57,820
will lose.

478
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:04,140
But I have reached my limit.

479
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:05,660
Martial Uncle.

480
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:08,500
Can I make a move first?

481
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:10,300
Sure.

482
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,420
Go ahead.

483
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:13,420
Alright.

484
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:15,020
That will be my last move.

485
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:17,940
Little White Long Worm!

486
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:19,070
[Little White Long Worm]

487
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:28,170
[Qi 77%-100%]

488
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:39,620
A Lightning Technique that can be controlled.

489
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:46,340
This final move is indeed tricky.

490
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:01,860
No matter how quickly you can react,

491
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:03,140
I doubt you can escape this time.

492
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,020
That's right.

493
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:13,460
My Little White Worm Lightning Series

494
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:15,500
can indeed be controlled.

495
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:16,340
But it is the slowest

496
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:17,940
while it's being controlled.

497
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:20,380
Its true nature

498
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:22,020
is a Tracking Lightning Technique

499
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,500
that can lock its target.

500
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:29,580
I want to turn over

501
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:31,500
the heavens!

502
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:33,100
The heavens!

503
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:08,620
Incredible.

504
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:10,540
Unpredictable.

505
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:12,340
You used the Yang Lightning

506
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:13,740
in the style of Yin Lightning.

507
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:26,420
You are far more talented than I am.

508
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:29,300
If you lose today,

509
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:31,420
it would only be due to

510
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:32,460
our difference in cultivation.

511
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:39,900
Zhang Chulan.

512
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:40,940
You are truly amazing.

513
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:42,540
You have forced me

514
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:44,900
to elevate the yin in my body to the maximum

515
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,380
and fully accept my Five Elements Yin Lightning.

516
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:50,300
That's a first for me.

517
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:02,580
(Zhang Chulan.)

518
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:04,620
(You have done a great job.)

519
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:05,780
(It was perfect.)

520
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:08,260
(But now,)

521
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,740
(I am going to defeat this perfect you.)

522
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:50,900
Is this the hard difference in strength?

523
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:55,340
Bao.

524
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:58,660
I'm sorry.

525
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:06,980
This is bad.

526
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:09,420
Zhang Chulan has lost.

527
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:12,660
I can't ask the old Taoist now.

528
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:53,500
What happened to you?

529
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:08,740
It's me.

530
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:10,740
It was my first time

531
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:13,380
mobilizing all the yin in my body.

532
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:18,540
How ironic.

533
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:21,180
I was never willing to accept the Yin Lightning.

534
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:23,580
Now that I have fully used the Yin Lightning,

535
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:25,980
I ended up suffering its attack instead.

536
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:30,460
Is this my punishment from God?

537
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:34,060
I...

538
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:39,620
Does this mean I have won?

539
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,220
Lingyu.

540
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:44,580
Are you

541
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:45,980
still able to continue?

542
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:47,420
I...

543
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:49,660
I...

544
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:09,260
I...

545
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:10,500
I admit defeat.

546
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:17,540
Master.

547
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:19,740
I am sorry.

548
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:22,860
I never thought I would lose

549
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:24,220
in such a ridiculous way.

550
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:30,100
Zhang Lingyu

551
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:31,740
versus Zhang Chulan.

552
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:34,300
The winner

553
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:37,300
is Zhang Chulan.

554
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:50,820
(Bao.)

555
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:52,140
I will win.

556
00:30:56,780 --> 00:31:11,380
Play-off!

557
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:13,140
Zhiwei.

558
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:15,460
What happened

559
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:16,980
to Lingyu?

560
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:18,380
Who knows?

561
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:21,620
Perhaps he ate something wrong for breakfast?

562
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,140
Zhiwei.

563
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:25,060
Just be honest with me.

564
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:29,060
This match between Chulan and Lingyu.

565
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:31,140
One is your favorite disciple.

566
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:33,060
Another is Huaiyi's grandson.

567
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:36,100
Who did you wish would win?

568
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:41,940
Chulan is the grandson of Huaiyi.

569
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:45,860
Huaiyi had a tough life.

570
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:47,460
If his grandson

571
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:48,220
could win

572
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:49,780
the Outsider Martial Arts Contest,

573
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:53,060
I would be pleased.

574
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:57,020
I get it now.

575
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:48,340
Master.

576
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:55,180
Lingyu.

577
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:57,820
Do you think that I was mean?

578
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:00,100
I have let you down.

579
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:02,340
I can't believe I lost so ridiculously.

580
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:03,820
I mobilized my qi wrong.

581
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:04,900
I am a disgrace to you.

582
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:06,100
I have wasted

583
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,340
your years of training me

584
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:08,660
and the help from other disciples.

585
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:09,620
Actually,

586
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:12,420
I drugged you this morning.

587
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:16,340
You are no longer upright.

588
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:18,180
You are now

589
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:19,820
simply straightforward.

590
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:21,060
Foolishly honest.

591
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:26,740
This is Waylay Powder,

592
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:28,620
also called the Immortal Pill.

593
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:30,980
Even immortals will be doomed once they take it.

594
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:33,020
Once it is taken,

595
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:35,620
it will block the flow of qi.

596
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:37,860
[Waylay Powder]
This was in your breakfast.

597
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:40,380
Dig in.

598
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:43,420
The dose I gave you

599
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:45,820
will only take effect

600
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:48,300
when you exert all your strength.

601
00:33:58,020 --> 00:33:59,340
I see.

602
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:02,060
What do you mean by "I see"?

603
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:03,340
Why did you sigh in relief?

604
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:05,580
You looked as if

605
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:07,380
you could finally be at ease now.

606
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:09,700
I thought

607
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:11,140
I made a low-level mistake

608
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:12,940
and let you down.

609
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:15,660
But it turns out I was set up by you.

610
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:16,580
Wrong reaction.

611
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:17,660
You should be acting like

612
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:19,900
you were betrayed.

613
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:22,500
You should be terrified.

614
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:23,300
Uneasy.

615
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:24,580
Confused.

616
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:25,580
In despair.

617
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:28,100
You should be yelling in agony,

618
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:30,700
"Why did you do that to me, Master?"

619
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:42,220
That should be your reaction.

620
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:44,620
But your reaction now

621
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:47,580
is very disappointing.

622
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:49,580
Master.

623
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:52,260
I actually want to ask why you did that.

624
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:55,340
You could have said so from the get-go

625
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:56,940
and told me to lose to Zhang Chulan.

626
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:59,780
Even if I wanted you to lose to him on purpose,

627
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:02,300
you would have agreed to it without hesitation.

628
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:07,660
That would be too much to ask of you.

629
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:10,820
That's why

630
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:12,580
I'm not eager

631
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:14,340
to know the reason.

632
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:16,620
Practitioners

633
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:18,380
have patience.

634
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:23,900
It would be too difficult

635
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:26,700
to use the Yin Lightning to perfection

636
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:29,260
with your character.

637
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:34,700
I

638
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:36,780
have an instruction for you now.

639
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:38,260
Tomorrow

640
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:40,420
is the last day
of the Outsider Martial Arts Contest.

641
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:42,300
If

642
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:43,900
you have to make a decision,

643
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:45,380
you must make

644
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:47,020
the opposite decision

645
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:48,940
of what you would normally decide.
