00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:36,490
Everyone is equal
when it comes to entrance tickets.

190
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:37,010
By the way,

191
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:39,060
don't go around by yourself
when we reach there later.

192
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:41,650
Is there a toilet nearby?

193
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:42,940
I think it's over there.

194
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:45,370
Wait, Baobao is missing.

195
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:47,300
She was still here just now.

196
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,300
Where's the toilet?

197
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:49,370
I think it's over there.

198
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:50,420
Thank you.

199
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:55,060
(I need to use the toilet.)

200
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:02,980
Ms. Bao, what are you doing?

201
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:04,730
This mister over here

202
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:05,420
is the 127th sect leader

203
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:06,610
of Beggars' Gang.

204
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:07,770
He said he wanted to read my palm

205
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:09,060
because of my unique constitution.

206
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:10,850
Beggars' Gang?

207
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:11,980
And he knows how to read palms?

208
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:12,490
Young lady,

209
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:14,250
judging from what I've seen,

210
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:15,700
you have an affinity with the Beggars' Gang.

211
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:16,940
Really?

212
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:18,100
You see,

213
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,340
fate has led us

214
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:20,100
to meet.

215
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:25,530
Today, I'll show you

216
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:26,770
the treasure of the sect.

217
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,180
This is the heavenly item

218
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:30,650
called the Spotted Red Glass Beads.

219
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,610
It's a treasure the ex-ex-sect leader

220
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:35,580
found here a few centuries ago.

221
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:36,650
When the sect leader

222
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:37,530
was training here,

223
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:39,010
he encountered

224
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:40,490
a ten-thousand-year-old fire dragon.

225
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:42,370
They fought for more than 80,000 rounds.

226
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:43,490
It was perilous

227
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:44,180
and intense!

228
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:44,820
Listen!

229
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:45,650
They were...

230
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:51,580
Young lady,

231
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:52,650
that's not the point.

232
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:53,610
The thing is,

233
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:54,490
our sect leader made this

234
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:55,340
using the core he extracted

235
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:55,850
from the dragon after killing it.

236
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:57,060
It's the Red Spotted Glass Beads!

237
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:58,250
I'm sure fate led us

238
00:09:58,250 --> 00:09:59,220
to each other today.

239
00:09:59,220 --> 00:09:59,730
Listen.

240
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:00,890
I'm not asking for 98,000 yuan

241
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:02,060
or 9,800 yuan.

242
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,010
I'm only asking for 998 yuan.

243
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:03,460
Don't you think

244
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:05,010
it's cheap?

245
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:08,340
It's so cheap.

246
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:09,340
I'll buy it!

247
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:11,300
Baobao,

248
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,530
he came all the way to a Taoist mountain
just so he could slay a dragon.

249
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:13,460
How could you believe that?

250
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:14,530
This was only made

251
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:15,460
after 80,000 rounds of intense fighting.

252
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:16,420
I want it!

253
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,580
She's paying 998 yuan for nothing.

254
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:20,940
How much higher

255
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:23,850
is her wage compared to mine?

256
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,300
You should go if you can't hold it in.

257
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:30,580
Don't break them.

258
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,150
[Washroom]

259
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:04,820
What's the matter?

260
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:06,250
It's nothing.

261
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:11,770
If so, why are you staring at me?

262
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,340
I was just looking around casually.

263
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,100
You call that casual?

264
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:26,490
I'll file a complaint

265
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:27,700
to your superior.

266
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:37,700
You must be Zhang Chulan.

267
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:40,220
Do you know me?

268
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:41,250
Are you an Outsider too?

269
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:44,130
Why are you attending

270
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:45,060
the contest?

271
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:47,610
If you're an Outsider,

272
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:49,530
you should know about my story.

273
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:51,740
I heard that you were affiliated

274
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,230
with Mount Longhu somehow.

275
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:54,700
All of my secrets

276
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,270
are related to Mount Longhu.

277
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:57,900
So, if I become the champion,

278
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:58,990
I can meet Chief Celestial Taoist

279
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:00,750
and ask him about my secrets.

280
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:04,820
So, you're attending it
to see Chief Celestial Taoist, huh?

281
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,030
But you're wrong about one thing.

282
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:08,660
What is it?

283
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:12,230
It isn't that difficult

284
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:14,110
to see the Chief Celestial Taoist.

285
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:19,940
What do you mean by that?

286
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,030
Follow me.

287
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:30,700
Chief Celestial Taoist, look here.

288
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:31,350
Look here!

289
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:32,700
Chief Celestial Taoist, take one step forward.

290
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:35,660
Chief Celestial Taoist, take one step forward.

291
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:37,180
Give me a cool pose.

292
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:49,390
Wait, he's Chief Celestial Taoist?

293
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:51,940
I told you already.

294
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,270
It isn't that difficult

295
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:54,780
to see Chief Celestial Taoist in person.

296
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,750
Is Zhang Lingyu attending the contest too?

297
00:12:58,750 --> 00:12:59,990
Of course.

298
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:01,580
He's Zhang Lingyu, you know?

299
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:02,700
Celestial Taoist,

300
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:03,940
can you answer a few more questions?

301
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:04,820
My master is tired.

302
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:05,900
If you guys have any questions,

303
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:07,270
you guys may ask me.

304
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:08,060
Chief Celestial Taoist?

305
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:11,580
I'm Wang Ye from Wudang Sect.

306
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:13,030
Greetings, Chief Celestial Taoist.

307
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,780
He's so thick-skinned.

308
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:17,180
He called himself the King of Wudang.
(*Wang Ye means "I am the king" in Old Chinese.)

309
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:18,350
Wang Ye?

310
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:20,990
How's your grandmaster doing?

311
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:22,150
So, his name is Wang Ye?

312
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:23,510
He's as energetic as ever.

313
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:24,470
Chief Celestial Taoist,

314
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:25,350
look.

315
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:27,060
Look who I've brought to you.

316
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:32,230
You must be Chulan, right?

317
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:40,060
Call me Grandmaster.

318
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:44,230
Your grandfather

319
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:46,470
imparted the Gold Brilliance Spell
and Lightning Techniques to you.

320
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:48,470
Although you aren't a disciple of Mount Longhu,

321
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:49,180
I'm

322
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:50,940
your grandfather's senior.

323
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:51,660
So,

324
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:54,270
you have to address me as Grandmaster.

325
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:55,990
Grandmaster.

326
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:01,230
Lingyu,

327
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,150
this is Zhang Chulan,

328
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:04,390
whom I asked you to invite.

329
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:05,580
You guys already met, right?

330
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:06,630
Yeah.

331
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:07,750
Zhang Lingyu,

332
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:08,870
I did some thinking.

333
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:10,110
When it comes to seniority,

334
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:12,150
I have to address you as Martial Uncle.

335
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:16,270
Lingyu,

336
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:17,990
you can entertain our guests.

337
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:19,300
I need to speak with Chulan.

338
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:21,390
Yes, Master.

339
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:24,110
Be careful.

340
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:24,940
Grandmaster.

341
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:32,870
Grandmaster,

342
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,580
has this place always

343
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:35,940
been like this?

344
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,300
Yes.

345
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:39,660
Look at this well.

346
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:40,940
The water is still clear and sweet

347
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:42,300
even after a millennium has passed.

348
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,990
Back then, my master produced elixirs

349
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:44,780
with this very water.

350
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:47,270
Your grandfather and I

351
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:49,230
had to come here and get water for him every day.

352
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:51,150
Back then...

353
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:54,510
Forget it.

354
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:55,870
Here.

355
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:57,660
Try it.

356
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:09,470
What's the matter?

357
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:13,150
Grandmaster, it's nothing.

358
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:15,580
I feel like you're just like my grandpa.

359
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:16,510
Both of you feel endearing to me.

360
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:19,630
We had the same master.

361
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:20,900
Of course we're similar.

362
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:21,660
Have a seat.

363
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:26,230
Speaking of which,

364
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:28,420
you don't resemble Huaiyi at all.

365
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:32,700
That dwarf.

366
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,700
Where did he get himself such a grandchild
who knows how to deal with people?

367
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:37,270
My goodness.

368
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:39,780
Actually, I always thought

369
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:41,350
that my grandfather's name was Zhang Xilin.

370
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:42,230
I only found out

371
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:43,750
that his name was Zhang Huaiyi recently.

372
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,300
That's a fake name he used to prevent any trouble.

373
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:48,420
You won't find anything with that name.

374
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:52,700
Grandmaster,

375
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,750
actually, I'm here

376
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,350
because I have something to ask you.

377
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:57,540
If you have any questions,

378
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:58,750
you can ask me after you become the champion.

379
00:15:58,750 --> 00:15:59,510
Grandmaster,

380
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:00,900
I don't like to fight.

381
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:02,230
I just want to know the truth.

382
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:04,300
But I don't have the answer you're looking for.

383
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:07,700
You have to win the contest.

384
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:08,630
Only then

385
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:10,150
can you inherit Tianshidu.

386
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:12,030
The truth you wish to know

387
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:13,510
is inside Tianshidu.

388
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:15,750
Everyone is talking about Tianshidu.

389
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,230
What exactly is Tianshidu?

390
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:19,270
You'll know once you become the champion.

391
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:20,470
Grandmaster,

392
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:22,780
there are all sorts of top-tier martial artists

393
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:24,470
joining this contest.

394
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:27,060
I'm not sure if I can win the contest.

395
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:29,630
Why don't you tell me something

396
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:31,750
on my grandfather's account?

397
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,060
You were daring enough to come here

398
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,110
and participate in

399
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:35,580
the Outsider Martial Arts Contest.

400
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:37,470
I'm sure you know

401
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:38,990
whether you can win the contest or not.

402
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:43,230
There are two parts to Mount Longhu.

403
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:44,060
All this while,

404
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:45,750
they're holding a Buddhist ritual
in front of the mountain.

405
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:47,150
Many tourists will be attending it.

406
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:48,990
And the Outsider Martial Arts Contest

407
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:50,700
is a sparring contest between Outsiders.

408
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:51,900
Ordinary people

409
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:53,270
won't be able to see them.

410
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:55,060
I'm sure you guys have noticed it

411
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:56,300
after coming from the front of the mountain.

412
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:58,150
There are tourists everywhere.

413
00:16:58,390 --> 00:16:59,780
We have no way

414
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,150
to erect a wall

415
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:02,540
to prevent them from watching.

416
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:04,380
However,

417
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:06,300
Mount Longhu has a natural advantage.

418
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,540
Tourists can never reach the place

419
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:09,710
the Outsiders can.

420
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:12,300
What kind of place is it?

421
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:44,670
The contest venue

422
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:46,190
is on the opposite mountain.

423
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:47,140
Guys,

424
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:47,580
please go ahead.

425
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:50,950
I think a place like this

426
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:52,620
usually has cable cars lying around.

427
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:54,950
All of you are talented youths

428
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:56,470
with extraordinary abilities.

429
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:58,060
The Outsider Martial Arts Contest

430
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:00,620
is an important stage for you guys
to exhibit your skills.

431
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:02,190
It's something extraordinary.

432
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:06,580
Therefore,

433
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:08,230
you have to use the main path

434
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:09,190
to get on the main road.

435
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:10,950
Main road?

436
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:12,670
Where exactly is the road?

437
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:31,990
Celestial Taoist Mansion

438
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:33,580
always does such useless stuff.

439
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:35,230
Slow down.

440
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:36,060
Don't choke.

441
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:37,510
I know.

442
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:38,750
Here, have some garlic.

443
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:39,990
Did you see that?

444
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:41,270
Have some water.

445
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:42,990
My younger sister is the best.

446
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:44,710
Do you know how many skewers
you've taken on our way here?

447
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:45,750
Are you that hungry?

448
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,710
Aren't you Deng Youfu and Deng Youcai?

449
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:49,190
Hold it right there!

450
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:50,380
What Deng Youfu?

451
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,340
Please address me as

452
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:53,990
Smith.

453
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:54,950
Cut it out.

454
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:56,710
What Smith?

455
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:58,140
How many years have you studied overseas?

456
00:18:59,190 --> 00:18:59,750
Do you know

457
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:00,750
where North even is?

458
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:01,910
No matter how you pretend,

459
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:03,300
you still grew up

460
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,060
eating the food

461
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:05,710
grown by our parents.

462
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:07,380
You cannot forget your roots.

463
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:09,270
Sister,

464
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:10,430
grab onto me.

465
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:11,340
All right.

466
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:12,140
Love you.

467
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:17,140
Father!

468
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:18,620
We have to hurry!

469
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:19,710
Sweetheart,

470
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:20,910
I'm going to let go now.

471
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:22,270
Okay!

472
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:22,950
Here you go!

473
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:38,270
Your father is pretty daring, huh?

474
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:39,470
Sweetheart!

475
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:40,990
I'm coming!

476
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:45,270
Dear, I know my fault now!

477
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:48,780
I'll skin you alive if you dare
to throw our daughter

478
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:49,750
like a chakram again!

479
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:55,620
Dear, I won't do it again!

480
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,990
I detect abnormal qi value inside this suitcase.

481
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,380
I think there's something hazardous inside.

482
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:02,620
Everyone, stand back!

483
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:05,670
Move aside.

484
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:06,030
Don't move.

485
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:07,340
Senior, what's wrong?

486
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:08,430
Let me do it.

487
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,190
What are you doing here?

488
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:25,860
What are you looking at?

489
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:31,670
I'm just checking their luggage

490
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:33,950
to see if they've brought any restricted goods.

491
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:36,190
Don't be afraid.

492
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:36,910
It'll be fine.

493
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,670
Just walk ahead bravely.

494
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:40,950
Our company

495
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:41,750
has the best doctor

496
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:42,470
in the Outsiders' world.

497
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:43,190
Even if you fall from here,

498
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:44,430
I'm sure they can save you.

499
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:45,190
Ms. Bao,

500
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:46,990
are you trying to console me here?

501
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,060
Ms. Bao,

502
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:13,030
why don't you go first?

503
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:14,750
You're making me nervous.

504
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,140
If I go first,

505
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:18,030
you'll definitely turn back.

506
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:19,820
Excuse me.

507
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,750
Please make way.

508
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:28,990
Ms. Bao, are you okay?

509
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:32,270
Sorry about that!

510
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:49,200
[Jia Zhengliang from the Jia family
of the Northwest]

511
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:50,670
I'm Jia Zhengliang.

512
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,510
I have a useless brother

513
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:53,380
called Jia Zhengyu.

514
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:55,060
I heard

515
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:56,470
that he was beaten up by a female employee of NDT

516
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:57,710
a few days ago.

517
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,580
I heard that she has long hair

518
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:00,670
and a messy look.

519
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,030
I think you're wearing

520
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:02,990
NDT's uniform.

521
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:11,470
What are you doing?

522
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:22,860
Feng Baobao,

523
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:25,470
no matter what kind of trash he is,

524
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:26,780
he's still my elder brother.

525
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:28,340
I'm looking forward

526
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:29,510
to our fight later.

527
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:32,620
By then, I will avenge that idiot

528
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:33,750
in front of everyone.

529
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:40,710
Chulan,

530
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:41,510
don't waste your energy.

531
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:42,990
Relax.

532
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:44,670
I'll transport you there with telekinesis.

533
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:45,950
No need for that!

534
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:48,030
It's not embarrassing for me
to climb there myself!

535
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:50,230
It's embarrassing when I need other people's help!

536
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:04,270
You guys are not waiting for me at all?

537
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:39,750
How is it?

538
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:40,620
Can you still stand?

539
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:47,060
I'm totally fine.

540
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,270
This is

541
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:49,230
a piece of cake for me.

542
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:57,430
Is this

543
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:59,380
the Outsiders' world?

544
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:00,780
I'll see if there's anything fun here.

545
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:29,860
Ms. Bao,

546
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:31,230
where are San and Si?

547
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:33,580
They went to check the stage.

548
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:34,580
Zhang Chulan?

549
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:36,950
Young Master Feng?

550
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:37,750
You're here too?

551
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:38,300
Yeah.

552
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,430
Are you here to join the contest?

553
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:40,470
My sister is here too.

554
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:41,580
Do you still remember her?

555
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,540
You two almost got married before this.

556
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:45,910
Miss Feng...

557
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:48,860
Hello, I guess.

558
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:51,540
Feng Baobao?

559
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:53,540
You recovered already?

560
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:54,710
Who are you?

561
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:57,060
I'm Feng Xingtong.

562
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:58,580
We met at The All-Encompassing Guild...

563
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,430
Forget it. It doesn't matter.

564
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:05,230

00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:48,740
I'm ashamed.

747
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:51,660
The monastic should let go
of all conflicts and desires.

748
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:53,140
However, I'm still looking forward

749
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:55,060
to your ultimate technique.

750
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:57,260
Why is Zhang Lingyu so popular?

751
00:31:58,860 --> 00:31:59,900
It's because

752
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:03,300
he's the perfect being,

753
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:04,620
Zhang Lingyu.

754
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:08,140
(Don't tell me he has the seal too?)

755
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:10,140
I'm looking forward to our match too.

756
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:21,020
The perfect being, huh?

757
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:25,100
Spiritual Master Lingyu.

758
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:26,420
Spiritual Master Lingyu.

759
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:27,500
Do you still remember me?

760
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,020
I had meals in your temple before.

761
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:31,100
As for him,

762
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:32,420
you should've seen him before.

763
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:34,540
I heard

764
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:35,620
that the match between you two ended as a draw.

765
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:36,540
Is that true?

766
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:43,780
You should speak up more
if you don't know what to say.

767
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:46,420
He hates me in the first place.

768
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:48,620
Don't say something like ending as a draw.

769
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:49,260
Zhuge,

770
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:49,900
Xingtong,

771
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:51,340
I shall take my leave.

772
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:51,940
We shall meet again next time.

773
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:55,260
I will take my leave too.

774
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:02,180
You were ignored.

775
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:07,660
So, you said

776
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:09,740
you knew everyone here?

777
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:11,420
Didn't I tell you before?

778
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:12,820
Well,

779
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:14,860
I may be mediocre when it comes to superpowers,

780
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:16,380
but I'm definitely great

781
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:17,780
at gathering intel.

782
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:19,380
Seriously?

783
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:21,420
Your intel is all trash.

784
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:22,660
Young Master.

785
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:23,900
You see...

786
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:25,540
The key to gathering intel

787
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:26,780
is deciding the main points.

788
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:27,820
[Zang Long, Superpower: Tough]
Understood?

789
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:29,420
Gathering intel from everywhere

790
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:30,940
without classifying them

791
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:31,700
is the act of an amateur.

792
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:33,980
Zang Long,

793
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:36,060
what are you doing here?

794
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:37,220
Why can't I be here?

795
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,100
You're so capable,

796
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:40,420
so you must

797
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:41,700
know him, right?

798
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:49,260
I already told you.

799
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:51,100
I only gather intel
related to important individuals.

800
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:52,180
I don't have time

801
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:53,380
to analyze a layman.

802
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:55,620
The Eight Supremes are here.

803
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:57,420
I'm sure everyone will give it their all.

804
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:58,540
Bai Shixue

805
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:00,460
held a prize quiz lately.

806
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:02,100
We can make a bet.

807
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:02,860
It's a bet

808
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:04,580
on who will win the contest.

809
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:05,780
Zhuge Qing is the second favorite contestant.

810
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:07,940
Zhang Lingyu is the most favorite contestant.

811
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:10,380
However,

812
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:12,300
there's one more person I'll recommend.

813
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:14,620
Although he's the third favorite contestant,

814
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:16,180
he gives out a solid performance.

815
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:17,780
Who is it?

816
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:19,940
Zhang

817
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:21,020
Chu...

818
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:21,860
lan.

819
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:25,420
The successor of Qi Apotheosis.

820
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:29,180
However,

821
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:30,340
I heard

822
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:32,300
that he doesn't know how to use Qi Apotheosis.

823
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:33,820
That's impossible.

824
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:35,300
He already used it twice before.

825
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:36,540
He used it on Zhang Lingyu

826
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:37,860
and Zhuge Qing.

827
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:38,780
Qi Apotheosis

828
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:39,900
is an extraordinary technique.

829
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:41,140
When he uses the technique,

830
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:42,380
the sky will change colors

831
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:43,740
and the world will be turned upside down.

832
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:45,740
The two fights

833
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:47,100
were intense

834
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,260
and exceptional.

835
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:50,060
They leave behind a trail of death
everywhere they go.

836
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:51,820
He gave

837
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:52,500
both Zhang Lingyu

838
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,780
and Zhuge Qing a sound beating.

839
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:58,900
He's amazing.

840
00:34:59,100 --> 00:34:59,740
Yeah.

841
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:00,820
I'm not lying.

842
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:01,860
Will you bet on him?

843
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:03,660
I'll bet 1,000 yuan

844
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:04,500
on Zhang Chulan.

845
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:05,700
Ms. Bao, have you lost your mind?

846
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:06,980
Hey, what are you doing?

847
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:07,780
Not only are you not supporting my business,

848
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:08,780
but you're also stopping her?

849
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:10,180
Here.

850
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:14,300
Got it.

851
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:15,940
Girl, what's your name?

852
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:17,740
I'm Feng Baobao.

853
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:19,820
Feng Baobao?

854
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:20,620
Girl,

855
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:21,700
are you here to be a Celestial Taoist too?

856
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:23,500
I'm not here to be a Celestial Taoist.

857
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:25,460
Zhang Chulan is here to be a Celestial Taoist.

858
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:26,460
My job is to get rid of

859
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:28,140
all the opponents that get in his way.

860
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:37,700
Now,

861
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:39,980
let's give a big hand

862
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:41,220
to

863
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:43,580
the main organizer

864
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:44,740
of the contest.

865
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:45,580
Coming from

866
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:47,500
Celestial Taoist Mansion of Mount Longhu,

867
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:50,020
the 99th Celestial Taoist,

868
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:51,020
Zhang

869
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:52,180
Zhi...

870
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:53,420
wei!

871
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:02,220
Everyone,

872
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:03,740
sorry for the long wait.

873
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:08,900
Besides being

874
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:11,620
an annual worship event,

875
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:12,300
the Outsider Martial Arts Contest

876
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:14,500
has always been a chance for qi practitioners
to interact with each other.

877
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:19,700
Since you guys are raring to go,

878
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:20,860
I won't take up your time.

879
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:21,780
This time,

880
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:23,900
there are 128 contestants in total

881
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:26,820
for the current Outsider Martial Arts Contest.

882
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:27,780
However, there will

883
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:29,500
only be one champion.

884
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:32,100

885
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,940
