jumping off a building

12
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:48,780
to avoid doing work.

If I were the Wudang Sect Leader,

14
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:51,660
I would fire you too.

15
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:52,580
Fine.

16
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:53,500
I'll get up there now.

17
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:54,220
Relax.

00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,340
Qing has left.

19
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:56,300
Alright, then.

20
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:02,780
Eleven of them.

21
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:04,300
Ms. Bao.

22
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:06,420
We can get credit for sending them

23
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:07,940
to the company, right?

24
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:08,580
Yes.

25
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:13,900
You're so snotty.

26
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,500
You must be the leader.

27
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:16,260
Here's what.

28
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,500
Tell me who sent you here

29
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:19,820
and I'll let you guys go.

30
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:21,220
Hey, brat.

31
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:23,340
Save it.

00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:26,820
work based on trust.

34
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,260
If I tell you,

35
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:30,220
I'll run out of business.

36
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:31,660
If I don't tell you,

37
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:33,540
there's nothing you can do.

38
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,220
There's nothing I can do?

39
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:39,820
Ms. Bao.

40
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,620
Tell him what I can do to him.

41
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:43,500
Sure.

42
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:02,380
Nice one.

43
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:09,580
See?

44
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,140
This is a work injury.

45
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:13,020
I've reported it to the company.

46
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:15,580
Our company is united.

47
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:17,940
A collective with love.

48
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,020
From today on,

49
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:20,340
your name

50
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,340
has been put on the list in the company.

51
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:25,580
You beat me up so badly.

52
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:27,500
From now on,

53
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:30,380
you will be the main concern of our company.

54
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:32,100
You can kiss goodbye to your business.

55
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,100
You're framing me!

56
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:35,700
Am I?

57
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:37,940
You knew from the get-go

58
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:39,380
that he was this despicable.

59
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:40,660
So you asked me to find him, right?

60
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,100
How would I have known?

61
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:44,180
I guess

62
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:46,580
that's a serendipitous bonus.

63
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:48,980
I will never tell you.

64
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:53,220
Just come at me.

65
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:54,660
Why did you approach my family?

66
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:55,540
Taoist Wang.

67
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:58,100
We haven't done anything to your family yet.

68
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,300
Relax.

69
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,620
Don't you dare do anything!

70
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:02,460
Tell me.

71
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:03,780
Who sent you?

72
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,700
How many more of you are out there?

73
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:07,900
Are you telling me or not?

74
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:09,220
You...

75
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:10,460
Wang.

76
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:11,980
Don't do it.

77
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,180
That's right, Wang.

78
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,660
I've beaten myself up so badly,

79
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:16,260
yet he refuses to speak.

80
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:17,860
Let's go and talk.

81
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:27,300
If we want to find who's behind it now,

82
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,300
don't you think it's time

83
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:30,420
you two use your phantasmagoria?

84
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,620
What's with that look?

85
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:36,900
Did I say something wrong?

86
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,220
You are right.

87
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:39,500
This is my business.

88
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,460
I should bear it alone.

89
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:44,020
Don't.

90
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:45,620
If it were this easy to bear,

91
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,140
you could have done so in the first place.

92
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:48,580
Let's do it together.

93
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:49,500
Count Lian in.

94
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:50,820
All three of us.

95
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:52,580
Together?

96
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:53,900
Is this a joke?

97
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:56,060
Wait a minute.

98
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,220
Can you two calculate

99
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:58,340
and give me a definite answer?

100
00:03:58,820 --> 00:03:59,860
Wang.

101
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:00,860
Can you set the Four Pillars?

102
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:01,700
I can.

103
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,540
What did you mean by the three of us together?

104
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:06,580
How can three people do divination together?

105
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:08,420
So there's something you can't do.

106
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:10,340
This

107
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:12,100
is a unique skill of the Wuhou family.

108
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,740
We discovered long ago

109
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:15,780
that the phantasmagoria
wasn't unique to all sorcerers.

110
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,220
Once you have entered,

111
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:18,220
it is all the same.

112
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,300
Ms. Bao.

113
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,140
You must stand watch for us later.

114
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:21,740
One more thing.

115
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,340
Don't let those guys get away.

116
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:24,420
Piece of cake.

117
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:36,940
Handled it.

118
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:37,820
They can't move now.

119
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,020
I love Ms. Bao's style.

120
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:49,940
Come on.

121
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:50,860
Let's find an empty space.

122
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:54,060
Zhang Chulan.

123
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,180
Is your eye okay?

124
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:56,340
I'll rub it back to normal.

125
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:56,980
Wang.

126
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:58,380
I think this space looks good.

127
00:04:58,380 --> 00:04:59,300
Let's do it here.

128
00:04:59,300 --> 00:04:59,940
First off,

129
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,260
Wang has to be the one

130
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:02,580
laying out the array.

131
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:04,300
Qimen's Four Pillars

132
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,500
will move every two hours.

133
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:06,620
This array can only be used

134
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08,300
when the Four Pillars

135
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:08,860
are in the right spots.

136
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:10,740
(That means the Three Wonders)

137
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:11,500
(and Six Flags,)

138
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:12,580
(Eight Doors,)

139
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:13,860
(Nine Stars,)

140
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:15,060
(and Eight Gods)

141
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:16,740
(must all fall in their respective houses.)

142
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:19,060
A timing like this can only be desired.

143
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:20,940
That's why this array is extremely impractical

144
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:22,020
to the Zhuge family.

145
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:23,740
But we have Wang.

146
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,140
So this exacting demand

147
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,300
won't be a problem.

148
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,300
The second step.

149
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,260
Someone who can mobilize qi
needs to land on the house

150
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:30,260
to be a sacrificial offering.

151
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:31,260
According to old folks,

152
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:32,140
the ancestor, Kongming,

153
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:33,060
once planned to gather

154
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,820
the 15 offerings
of the Three Wonders and Six Flags

155
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:36,060
to gain exceptional powers

156
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,580
through this array.

157
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:38,420
Sadly,

158
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:39,580
he did not succeed in the end.

159
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:40,620
But of course.

160
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:42,260
There are only three of us.

161
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:43,260
We aren't incarnations,

162
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,620
nor are we asking for powers.

163
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:45,700
It's just an inquiry.

164
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:46,500
It should be alright.

165
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:47,180
Later,

166
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,500
I will stand on Bing Fire.

167
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,180
Wang,

168
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:50,620
you stand on Ding Fire.

169
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:51,940
Zhang clashes with Yi Wood.

170
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,300
Use the Gold Brilliance Spell.

171
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:55,740
Ms. Bao.

172
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:57,260
Guard the three of us.

173
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:59,140
We each take a spot of the Three Wonders.

174
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:00,500
I will take us

175
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,180
into the phantasmagoria through this array.

176
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:03,260
Let's begin, Wang.

177
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,020
Okay.

178
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:07,940
(Qimen's Immaculate Scrutiny.)

179
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:18,740
(Zhuge Qing.)

180
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:20,180
(This must be the real reason)

181
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,300
(you came looking for me.)

182
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,140
(You want to see the Gate of Gale again)

183
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:25,460
(using whatever excuse.)

184
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:30,620
Everything is still the same.

185
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:31,540
It is changing.

186
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:34,780
Alright.

187
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:41,020
Well,

188
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:43,260
where do I go?

189
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:45,060
Stand there.

190
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:52,420
Let's begin.

191
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:54,140
Li,

192
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:56,100
Bursting Flame.

193
00:06:58,820 --> 00:06:59,820
Gold Brilliance Spell.

194
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:02,860
Li,

195
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:04,140
Firefly Flowing Light.

196
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,660
Qimen First Array.

197
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:07,700
Revert Array.

198
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:55,380
What is this place?

199
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:11,900
Zhang Chulan.

200
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,420
You and Wang

201
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:14,980
are now both in my phantasmagoria.

202
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:17,500
In your language,

203
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:20,100
that means you are in the world of my mind,

204
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:21,660
(while your bodies)

205
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:22,940
(are being guarded)

206
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:24,060
(by Ms. Bao outside.)

207
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,020
That's awesome.

208
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,060
Zhang.

209
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:29,500
Didn't you mention the Double Color Ball?

210
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:34,580
Try asking for the numbers

211
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,100
of the next Double Color Balls in your head.

212
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:36,940
Ask?

213
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:37,620
How?

214
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,060
Do I just think about it?

215
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:44,380
This is the answer.

216
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:45,540
If you break it,

217
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:46,820
you will obtain the answer.

218
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:54,740
I can't open it.

219
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:57,980
Will it be easier

220
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:59,180
for you two to open it?

221
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:00,860
Smart.

222
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:02,060
These numbers

223
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:03,300
mean nothing to the two of us.

224
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,580
That's why we can easily obtain them.

225
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:07,860
Since you two

226
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,300
are inside my phantasmagoria,

227
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:10,900
these information

228
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:11,700
can be shared.

229
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:27,380
What happens if we tell someone else the numbers

230
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:28,420
of the Double Color Balls?

231
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:29,620
That would be deceiving God.

232
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,020
Your fortune

233
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:31,700
would be reduced.

234
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:33,020
In a minor case,

235
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:34,180
you'll face various misfortunes.

236
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:35,020
In a severe case,

237
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:36,660
you'll face a brutal death.

238
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:38,220
The punishment's severity

239
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,540
depends on

240
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:40,980
the impact of the disclosed information
on the world.

241
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:43,300
But if you relay the information

242
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,220
in vague words,

243
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:45,860
perhaps

244
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:47,460
it could lessen the effect of the punishment.

245
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:50,140
This is why we sorcerers

246
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:51,820
tend to beat around the bush.

247
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:53,380
Alright, Zhang.

248
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:54,900
You have got the basic idea.

249
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:07,500
Let's begin.

250
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,140
This is what we came in to ask.

251
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:11,020
The identity of the person behind this incident.

252
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,260
That's huge!

253
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:13,860
This looks way bigger than the ball

254
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,460
in the Double Color Ball lottery.

255
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:16,220
Indeed.

256
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:17,860
Otherwise, all three of us wouldn't be in here.

257
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,620
On top of that, your vitality will be consumed

258
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:21,540
and damaged in here.

259
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:24,140
It's not too late to back out.

260
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:25,380
I have known this.

261
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:26,740
No need to worry.

262
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:27,740
Wang.

263
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,340
You need to pay me more

264
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:31,500
for my reduced lifespan.

265
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:37,260
Let's get to it.

266
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:38,620
Zhang.

267
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:39,500
Attack this glowing ball at full force

268
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,500
with Lightning Technique.

269
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,100
Why is my Lightning Technique like this?

270
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,340
In this Distribution,

271
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:51,260
you entered the phantasmagoria
through the Yi Wonder.

272
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:52,620
So you're now in the form of Yi Wood.

273
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:53,980
And I

274
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,260
am Bing Fire.

275
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:01,860
I am Ding Fire.

276
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:10,500
The glowing ball is growing bigger.

277
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,620
We can't break it!

278
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:13,860
It's resisting!

279
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,780
Did you think such important information

280
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:17,140
could be easily obtained?

281
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:19,020
Prepare to put your lives on the line!

282
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:27,140
Zhang Chulan.

283
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,660
Hang in there!

284
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:13,420
We did it.

285
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:19,540
If I did it alone,

286
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:21,820
I'd probably need to sacrifice half my life.

287
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,180
What do you think, Wang?

288
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:24,300
Now you've seen it.

289
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:26,300
The beauty of Wuhou Qimen.

290
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:28,100
Wang.

291
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:30,020
Don't forget the add-on fee.

292
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:32,460
Now we know it.

293
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,100
The person behind it

294
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:36,340
is the number one in the Shu Sect.

295
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:37,660
One of the Ten Elders,

296
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,220
Chen Jinkui.

297
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:41,700
Life is easy for you sorcerers.

298
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:42,980
You can easily get the answers

299
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:43,700
you want.

300
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,820
If you two hadn't brought me here,

301
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:46,660
I would never

302
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:48,180
get to experience something like this.

303
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:49,700
Why don't we ask

304
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:50,900
a few more questions

305
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:51,820
before the array ends?

306
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,020
Don't even think about it!

307
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:02,740
Zhang Chulan.

308
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:04,180
What did you ask?

309
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:20,220
Is this the truth behind the Jiashen Calamity?

310
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:29,860
Zhang Chulan!

311
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:44,140
Zhang Chulan!

312
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:45,180
Stop!

313
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:53,660
Give up.

314
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:54,780
Even ten or a hundred of us

315
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:55,580
can't break it,

316
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:57,060
let alone the three of us.

317
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:58,860
Zhang Chulan!

318
00:13:58,860 --> 00:13:59,580
Wake up!

319
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:07,340
What on earth did he ask?

320
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:18,020
Wake up now!

321
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:26,260
It's gone wild.

322
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:27,980
They have all gone wild.

323
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:29,700
I need to set their qi right.

324
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:30,500
Well,

325
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,340
I guess this will do.

326
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:48,100
Zhang Chulan!

327
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:57,100
Duck!

328
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:34,940
Ms. Bao?

329
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:45,500
What's going on?

330
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,060
You're awake.

331
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:47,580
We need to go now.

332
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:49,300
Undo!

333
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:52,500
What just happened?

334
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,980
It hurts!

335
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:56,500
Feng Baobao.

336
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,260
It's going to break!

337
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:00,700
Are you awake?

338
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,140
I noticed that your qi

339
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:03,140
had all gone haywire.

340
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:04,420
So I unblocked your pulses.

341
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:08,620
Zhang Chulan.

342
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,180
What on earth did you ask?

343
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:11,260
You nearly got us both killed.

344
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:11,900
You know that?

345
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:17,020
Answer me.

346
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:19,540
Forget it, Qing.

347
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:20,540
It was our fault too

348
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:21,940
for bringing a non-practitioner.

349
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,380
I'm sorry.

350
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:24,940
You got hurt because of me.

351
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:27,260
You never received training
for Qimen's Scrutiny.

352
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,060
Being bewitched is unavoidable.

353
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:31,300
If I failed to wake up in the phantasmagoria,

354
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:32,820
what would have happened?

355
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:35,940
If you had failed to wake up,

356
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,980
our identity as the Three Wonders
wouldn't hold anymore.

357
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:40,340
I wouldn't be able to undo the array.

358
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:41,660
And you.

359
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:44,140
If you insisted on attacking the answer,

360
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:45,820
you would be crushed for sure.

361
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:46,660
The two of us

362
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:48,420
would eventually be swallowed by the answer.

363
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:49,700
We'd sink within the phantasmagoria

364
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,660
and become walking corpses.

365
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:56,460
Ms. Bao.

366
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:57,700
We're lucky you helped us in time.

367
00:16:58,180 --> 00:16:59,100
I can't thank you enough.

368
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:00,220
Don't mention it.

369
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:01,980
Alright.

370
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:03,580
Regardless,

371
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:04,900
it was worth taking this risk.

372
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:07,020
At least we now know

373
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:08,140
the enemy we are facing.

374
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:09,860
Leave the next step to me.

375
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:12,540
I got paid, so I need to do my job.

376
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:14,420
My job isn't done yet.

377
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:35,420
So you are Zhang Chulan,

378
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:37,380
the champion
of the Outsider Martial Arts Contest?

379
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:39,540
Master Chen.

380
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:41,740
Those were just some petty tricks.

381
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:43,660
I certainly can't be compared to you.

382
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:45,980
Tell me.

383
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:47,500
Why are you suddenly here

384
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,260
to see me?

385
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:50,620
Here's the thing, Master Chen.

386
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,460
You know Wang Ye, right?

387
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:54,660
I don't.

388
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:55,980
I have never met him before.

389
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:57,940
You don't know him?

390
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:58,820
You have never met him before?

391
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,140
That's weird.

392
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:02,500
I heard from others

393
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:03,620
that you planted many people

394
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:05,220
around his family.

395
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:09,980
Master Chen.

396
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:11,780
Don't get mad.

397
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:13,460
I was only asked to come

398
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:14,820
and talk to you.

399
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:16,940
Wang Ye thinks so.

400
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:19,060
Just go at him.

401
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:20,780
Don't get families involved.

402
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,260
If both parties are like this,

403
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:24,700
isn't it tricky to handle?

404
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:44,780
Master Chen.

405
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:46,300
I have another suggestion for you.

406
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:48,300
If you really want to go to war with Wang Ye,

407
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:49,860
fight him one-on-one.

408
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:51,860
Or gather 50 people

409
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:52,940
to beat him up.

410
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:54,620
Just don't involve his family.

411
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:55,500
By the way,

412
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,540
I heard that those friends of yours
were quite pricey.

413
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:58,980
How about telling them to leave?

414
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,900
What methods did you use?

415
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:03,580
Not only did you find out who hired us,

416
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:05,020
you even got them to cancel the order.

417
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:06,820
Luck.

418
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,420
It was all luck.

419
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,100
Sorry about the past few days.

420
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:15,540
Everyone gets a share.

421
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:17,060
Please don't refuse it.

422
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:18,620
Regardless of how you were treated,

423
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:20,700
that was the doing
of that NDT employee, Zhang Chulan.

424
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,100
Now, things are over.

425
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,780
Though we aren't friends,

426
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:25,220
we certainly aren't enemies.

427
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:27,140
We might even need your help in the future.

428
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:28,140
This money

429
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:29,180
is just a small kind gesture

430
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:30,460
from Mr. Wang.

431
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,900
We hope all of you have a good time here.

432
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:36,620
Wang Ye.

433
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:38,460
I won't apologize to you.

434
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:39,620
We were just getting paid

435
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:40,380
to do things.

436
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,140
It's nothing personal.

437
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,380
If you need help in the future,

438
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:44,100
contact us.

439
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:45,580
You can consider it done.

440
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:46,900
Everyone,

441
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:47,740
goodbye.

442
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:52,940
Take care.

443
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:57,940
Thanks,

444
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:58,460
Zhang.

445
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,980
The money was supposed to be yours,

446
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:02,620
but you gave them the favor.

447
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:04,540
To be honest,

448
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:05,900
I learned something from you.

449
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,980
No big deal.

450
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:10,340
Where should we eat later, Ms. Bao?

451
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:11,660
Roast duck.

452
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:45,300
Let me do it.

453
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:12,620
It's finally over.

454
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:13,300
I haven't had

455
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,500
a proper meal in days.

456
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:16,820
Over?

457
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,100
It's over?

458
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:19,980
Basically, yes.

459
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,060
We just haven't wrapped it up.

460
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:23,540
That simple?

461
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:27,020
What else do you expect?

462
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:28,460
Barge into Chen Jinkui's house

463
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:29,460
and wipe out his family?

464
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:31,100
I'm telling you.

465
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,060
Neither of you have reached

466
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:33,300
the point of showing your hands.

467
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:34,940
It's the perfect time for both to step back.

468
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,700
Why did he withdraw his order?

469
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:38,700
That shows he has concerns.

470
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,420
That's easy to settle if that's the case.

471
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:41,460
You are stronger

472
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:42,340
than him.

473
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:43,420
But have you wondered

474
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:45,260
why dealing with this was such a headache for you?

475
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,580
It's because you were against a guy with no shame.

476
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:49,820
A guy with no shame

477
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:51,780
would do anything to achieve his goal.

478
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:53,580
That's why he could play with people like you

479
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:55,260
as he pleased.

480
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:57,060
But what if a shameless guy meets a shameless guy?

481
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:00,420
Before completely falling out with each other,

482
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:01,820
everyone will act with caution.

483
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,140
Because once they fall out,

484
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:03,980
it will be a battle

485
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:05,820
of who can go lower.

486
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:07,100
So,

487
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,220
in order to protect your family,

488
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:09,700
you must tell them

489
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:10,940
that you have no shame either.

490
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,420
Once this is over,

491
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:16,540
leave your home and go anywhere.

492
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:17,620
You can't protect your whole family

493
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:18,700
on your own.

494
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:20,460
Instead, you will be exposing your weakness.

495
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:21,340
That's why you must leave

496
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,660
and let someone else protect them.

497
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:26,180
I've ever thought about that.

498
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:28,300
But

499
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:30,660
who can I entrust my family with?

500
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:35,460
What?

501
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:36,620
Qing.

502
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:38,540
You seem to have a lot of free time.

503
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:40,060
How about

504
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:41,540
a part-time job at my place?

505
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:42,580
No.

506
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:44,580
How about this?

507
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:45,860
I'll recommend three people to you.

508
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:04,980
My friends

509
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:06,740
are better than your bodyguards, right?

510
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:09,980
Each of them is really skilled.

511
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:11,860
If so, consider

512
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:12,700
hiring them.

513
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:15,180
The tall one.

514
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:16,780
He can be your personal male bodyguard.

515
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:17,620
The girl

516
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:19,020
can be Mom's personal female bodyguard.

517
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:19,780
The short one

518
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:20,940
can protect Yi's whole family.

519
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:24,020
You have everything planned.

520
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:26,180
Are you planning to leave again?

521
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:29,220
A few years ago

522
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:31,700
when you graduated from university,

523
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:33,060
you wanted to become a novice.

524
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:35,900
I got so angry that I slapped you.

525
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:37,420
I've waited so long.

526
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:40,180
You finally came back from Wudang.

527
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:42,460
But in the end,

528
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:45,060
you still have to leave.

529
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:46,220
Dad.

530
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:48,540
If you are still angry,

531
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:49,540
you can give me another slap.

532
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:57,060
My son.

533
00:23:58,900 --> 00:23:59,780
You're a grownup now.

534
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:01,780
You have to walk

535
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:03,100
your own path.

536
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:06,460
I only

537
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:07,860
have one thing to ask of you.

538
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:10,260
When you're out there,

539
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:11,700
no matter what danger

540
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:12,940
or trouble you face,

541
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:14,860
don't shoulder everything alone.

542
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:16,940
Come home.

543
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:19,540
You have me.

544
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:24,340
I will.

545
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:26,380
Dad.

546
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:29,260
I know you are rich and capable.

547
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:32,020
But I really don't need

548
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:33,060
luxury cars and mansions.

549
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:35,340
Let my two big brothers have those things.

550
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:37,820
You're right.

551
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:40,580
That's why

552
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:42,260
there is nothing I can do about you.

553
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:44,420
Come on, Dad.

554
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:45,940
Don't say that.

555
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:48,380
Actually...

556
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,020
I rely on you more than them.

557
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:55,060
Because I have you here,

558
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:58,260
I get to have more freedom to choose

559
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:00,900
and become myself.

560
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:03,820
Dad.

561
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:06,220
Thank you.

562
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:12,740
I will hire

563
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:14,780
your friends.

564
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:17,540
Tomorrow,

565
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:19,580
enjoy a meal with your mother.

566
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:20,380
Don't bring this up.

567
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:22,260
I

568
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:24,660
will soothe her later.

569
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:33,380
My son.

570
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:35,300
Just

571
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:37,700
leave quietly.

572
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:01,780
Ms. Bao.

573
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,580
Was there cucumber in the hotel's breakfast?

574
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:05,060
From the kitchen.

575
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:07,780
You entered their kitchen?

576
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:09,100
They were pretty nice.

577
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:10,260
You took it in front of them?

578
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:11,620
Mr. Zhang.

579
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:13,420
We have brought your car to the entrance.

580
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:14,780
This is your car key.

581
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:32,420
Thank you.

582
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:35,180
You made so much money.

583
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:36,340
Why are you still so stingy?

584
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:37,700
Wang.

585
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:39,140
I should thank you.

586
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:41,460
If I didn't have to get back to work,

587
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:43,500
I really wish to stay at your hotel
for a few more days.

588
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:44,700
Don't mention it.

589
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:45,660
I

590
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:47,260
should be thanking you instead

591
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:47,780
for getting my family

592
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:49,460
out of the Jiashen Calamity.

593
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:51,260
I will handle the rest on my own.

594
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:52,660
I'll be off, then.

595
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:00,900
Zhang Chulan.

596
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:02,180
Feng Baobao.

597
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:03,980
Till we meet again.

598
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:05,580
By the way,

599
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:08,180
I've transferred the extra money
back to your account.

600
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:10,020
You don't want the money?

601
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:12,780
You've brought me into the phantasmagoria.

602
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:14,460
I was too weak to get my answer.

603
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:15,500
You don't owe me anything.

604
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:18,460
Who knows when we'll meet each other again?

605
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:22,700
I haven't

606
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:24,260
seen anyone roll down a window in years.

607
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:27,940
I'll roll it for you once more.

608
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:28,420
It's enough.

609
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:29,700
You should get going.

610
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:35,580
(Wang Ye.)

611
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:36,620
(Thank you.)

612
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:40,260
(Though I only got a vague glimpse of the truth,)

613
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:42,300
(I must find Lyu Liang next.)

614
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:44,820
(I hope you will also find your own path.)

615
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:50,860
You've sent off those two weirdos?

616
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:55,940
It's suddenly so quiet.

617
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:57,260
I'm not used to it.

618
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:00,340
What about you?

619
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,420
Are you planning to go back?

620
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:05,620
I'm not going back.

621
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:06,820
I must wander and look around.

622
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:09,940
If it hadn't been for you,

623
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:12,220
I wouldn't have met so many interesting people

624
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:13,060
and things.

625
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:15,980
I've gotten a little addicted.

626
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:17,100
You?

627
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:21,220
I don't know.

628
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:26,300
I've been trying to figure it out these few days.

629
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:29,020
Why does Zhang Chulan do things

630
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:30,580
with such ease?

631
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:35,740
Well,

632
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:37,260
I'm not trying to brag.

633
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:40,100
But I'm considered smart.

634
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,900
Since I was a child,

635
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,460
I could handle everyone around me.

636
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:46,860
My parents.

637
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:48,580
My teachers.

638
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:49,940
My classmates.

639
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:52,580
Even my two elder brothers.

640
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:54,980
I could make all of them happy.

641
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:59,700
(But whether it was relationship or achievement,)

642
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:02,980
(to me, I just did it to make them happy.)

643
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:06,980
(I found those things to be such a bother.)

644
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:09,780
That's why

645
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:11,900
after graduating from university,

646
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:14,060
I went to Wudang to cultivate my mind.

647
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:17,540
You know what?

648
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:20,140
Whenever I faced

649
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:23,380
those around me after that,

650
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:25,980
I had this inexplicable sense of superiority.

651
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:30,020
(I looked at you foolish people)

652
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:33,260
(wearing yourselves out)

653
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:33,940
(over those little desires.)

654
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:35,620
(But look at me.)

655
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,220
(So unfettered)

656
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:38,260
(and free.)

657
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:40,660
(While all of you are still working hard in life,)

658
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:42,980
(I have gone beyond secularity.)

659
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:46,060
(But)

660
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:49,060
this sense of superiority
had disappeared these few days.

661
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:52,860
It turns out there were things I couldn't handle.

662
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:58,980
Someone free of all vulgarity like me

663
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:01,340
had no choice but to turn to

664
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:03,580
the most unbearably vulgar fellow.

665
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:08,940
Out of all the choices,

666
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:11,580
why did you choose the worst one?

667
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:13,700
It is what I want to do.

668
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:15,780
Whatever the outcome is,

669
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:16,780
I will bear the consequences.

670
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:17,980
(I don't know)

671
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:19,860
(what Zhang Chulan asked in the phantasmagoria.)

672
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:22,060
(But the truth he has to face)

673
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:23,500
(is a disaster.)

674
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:25,580
(Now, I believe)

675
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:27,300
(that even if)

676
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:28,660
(he gets on that train one day)

677
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:30,380
(and finds the truth,)

678
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:32,100
(he was probably already able)

679
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,700
(to face any challenges with a calm heart.)

680
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:37,020
(Looking at those two,)

681
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:39,580
(I realized how foolish I was.)

682
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:44,420
What they have now

683
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:46,740
and what I don't

684
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:50,100
is a secular past.

685
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,780
The result after being carved and polished.

686
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:55,340
Compared to them,

687
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:58,980
my only advantage

688
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:02,020
was being born into a better life.

689
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:04,540
I have been avoiding society.

690
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:07,900
Who am I to talk about going beyond secularity?

691
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:12,860
Wang.

692
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:14,700
Whatever it is.

693
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:16,780
You gained something

694
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:18,220
from this.

695
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:19,220
That's a good thing.

696
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:21,180
But please don't be like Lian.

697
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:22,980
He has absolutely no shame.

698
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:25,940
That's not what I meant.

699
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:32,740
Actually, I've been thinking about this.

700
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:35,580
Grandmaster told me to leave Wudang.

701
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:38,500
Perhaps there was a deeper meaning to it.

702
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:43,140
I should come out

703
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:45,300
to become a practitioner

704
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:48,500
and find out what I'm capable of.

705
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:50,980
My departure

706
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:52,780
can also let my family return to

707
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:53,820
their peaceful lives.

708
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:55,940
I'm off.

709
00:31:58,180 --> 00:31:59,780
Just like that?

710
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:19,580
Ms. Bao.

711
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:21,140
Do you still have cucumbers? I want one.

712
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:36,870
[Lyu Liang]

713
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:50,340
It's me.

714
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:57,460
You really dared show up.

715
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:58,540
Aren't you afraid I'd kill you?

716
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:02,220
What's so funny?

717
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:04,940
If you want to kill me,

718
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:06,300
do it now.

719
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:08,380
Tons of people want me dead.

720
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:09,820
Dying in your hands

721
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:11,020
is my best option.

722
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:13,140
Why?

723
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:14,460
You can't do it?

724
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:15,700
It's because we're the same kind.

725
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:16,620
Am I right?

726
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:18,860
Who says we're the same kind?

727
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:25,660
You tricked me.

728
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:27,500
I know the secret of the Eight Supremes.

729
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,260
Zhang Chulan.

730
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:29,460
This is my only way...

731
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:37,500
What are you staring at?
I'm not that shameless, okay?

732
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:39,020
I sneaked out to meet a scum like you.

733
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:40,540
I obviously had to come prepared.

734
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:41,820
You haven't changed.

735
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:45,740
This is my and your grandpa's crucial memory.

736
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:47,780
It holds the truth behind the Jiashen Calamity.

737
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:49,300
But only I can open it.

738
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:50,220
I'm giving it to you.

739
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:51,460
Not because I trust you,

740
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:52,700
but because you'll come and find me.

741
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:01,420
What just happened?

742
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:02,220
No time to explain.

743
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:02,980
Go! Now!

744
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:11,780
Split up.

745
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:12,940
Alright.

746
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:16,100
(Sinister Pleasure is gone.)

747
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:18,180
(All I can do is hide.)

748
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:20,740
(I don't have the power
to carry on finding the truth.)

749
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:21,940
(This day still came eventually.)

750
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:24,180
(I have no choice but to return to that place.)

751
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:25,220
(Zhang Chulan.)

752
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:26,780
(I have marked all the memories)

753
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:28,220
(that are related to you.)

754
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:30,340
(I hope we can meet again.)

755
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:32,220
(You are probably the only one who can help me.)

756
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:49,140
What's the matter?

757
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:51,220
You still want to run?

758
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:53,620
Long time no see,

759
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:54,500
Gong.

760
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:56,620
If you missed me,

761
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:57,940
you could just call me.

762
00:35:58,780 --> 00:35:59,780
I've missed you too.

763
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:01,820
It's been years since I've gone back.

764
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:03,980
If so, come with me to meet Grandpa tonight.

765
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:07,220
Sure.

766
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:08,780
It's been years.

767
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,780
I hope he is still in good health.

768
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:13,540
What did you do?

769
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:21,820
Enough.

770
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:23,620
Old Master wants him alive.

771
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:33,500
Did you think

772
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:35,380
that you could escape?

773
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:36,580
In your dreams.

774
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:41,900
Take him.

00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:49,500
(tried hard to protect the secret.)

777
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,860
(But he still failed in the end.)
