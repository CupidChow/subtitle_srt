00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:31,340
I bought you so many things.

390
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:33,260
Shouldn't you do something in return?

391
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:34,860
My grandpa's body is gone.

392
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,260
We need to find it. No?

393
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:37,340
I'm not your sister.

394
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:40,460
No way.

395
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:42,420
You are my sister.

396
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:43,660
When I first saw you,

397
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,660
I was surprised by how similar we look.

398
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,260
We're like two peas

399
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,420
in a pod.

400
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:51,340
I'm not your sister.

401
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:53,260
But you said it yesterday.

402
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:54,220
Yesterday is yesterday.

403
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,060
Today is today.

404
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:57,860
So today, you are...

405
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:05,020
Xu Baobao,

406
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:07,660
an exchange student from Taiwan, China.

407
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:10,900
My dad just started his business
in the Chinese Mainland

408
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:13,060
that offers premium resin-related products.

409
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,020
My hometown

410
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:16,900
is Zhangtai City, Huyan Province.

411
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:20,740
Not sure about my mom.

412
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:24,540
Taiwan, China?

413
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:27,540
Yet, you're rocking a Sanchuan dialect.

414
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:29,780
Is this how you lie nowadays?

415
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:30,380
Listen now.

416
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:31,060
I don't care

417
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:32,060
who you are and why you're here.

418
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:33,340
Leave me alone now

419
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:34,900
because I will bite.

420
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:37,980
Sorry, can't do that.

421
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:38,500
But wait,

422
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,900
I'll call to confirm it first.

423
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,020
Hi.

424
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:45,780
Is this Xu San?

425
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:48,220
Do I get to do whatever I want

426
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:49,860
with my possession?

427
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:53,340
(I'm a human, not a possession.)

428
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:56,860
I got the answer now, Zhang Chulan.

429
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:58,020
From now on,

430
00:21:58,660 --> 00:21:59,900
you're my slave.

431
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:01,580
Slave?

432
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:02,700
Slave, my foot.

433
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,660
Mind your manner.

434
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:13,660
Let's speak outside.

435
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:12,180
Help!

436
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:13,820
What's the matter?

437
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:14,900
Help...

438
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:15,940
Help me!

439
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:17,540
What's the emergency?

440
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:19,140
A woman

441
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:20,220
is chasing me

442
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:21,100
with a knife.

443
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:22,660
No way.

444
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:23,740
In broad daylight?

445
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:24,860
In a peaceful campus?

446
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:25,980
Don't lie.

447
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:27,180
I'm serious, sir.

448
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:28,780
Call the police.

449
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:30,020
She has a knife.

450
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:30,900
What police?

451
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,100
I am the security guard.

452
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:35,700
She's here.

453
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:36,820
Stop shouting!

454
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:38,060
You're freaking me out.

455
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:40,500
Who's there?

456
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:52,300
Come in.

457
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:05,620
Hi.

458
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:07,260
Is Zhang Chulan here?

459
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:07,780
There she is.

460
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:08,700
Stop shouting!

461
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:09,700
You're making me jump.

462
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:11,940
It's just a girl.

463
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,060
She has a weapon.

464
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:17,620
Listen, young girl.

465
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:19,100
Listen to me.

466
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:20,540
Give me the knife.

467
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:21,580
All right?

468
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:29,420
Is this a knife?

469
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:32,780
Is this a knife?

470
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:36,780
How can this be?

471
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:43,980
Trust me, mister.

472
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:44,900
I saw it with my own eyes

473
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:45,820
and she slashed

474
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:47,500
the door in half with a knife.

475
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:48,820
She carries a knife with her.

476
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:51,260
Get up!

477
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:53,380
Be a man.

478
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:54,540
Look at you.

479
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:55,420
Stand straight.

480
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:56,220
Lift your chest.

481
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:57,180
Lift your chin.

482
00:24:58,020 --> 00:24:59,180
Miss.

483
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:01,140
What's the matter between you two?

484
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:02,060
I am his...

485
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:03,020
She wants me to be her slave.

486
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:04,340
Shut up.

487
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:06,460
Speak.

488
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:08,980
He is my slave.

489
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:11,100
I see.

490
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,220
Now, your turn.

491
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,740
You heard it, didn't you?

492
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:17,180
She wants me to be her slave.

493
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:19,180
How lucky!

494
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:21,100
Isn't that great?

495
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,940
Young people nowadays

496
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:25,860
are so open-minded.

497
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:29,860
Clean this mess up.

498
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:30,060
It's so messy.

499
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:31,060
Let me do it.

500
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:35,740
See?

501
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:37,020
She is

502
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:38,500
sensible.

503
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:48,140
Wait. Of all people, you're into him?

504
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,260
It's fine.

505
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,380
I can train him.

506
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:51,620
You have to.

507
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:52,380
Take him back

508
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,700
and train him well.

509
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:56,780
Do you still want to run?

510
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:58,100
Are you running?

511
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,340
He will stop.

512
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:04,260
Do you want to talk?

513
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:05,700
Do you want to talk?

514
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:10,420
He said yes.

515
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:11,580
Let's go.

516
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:13,140
Go.

517
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:16,580
Go!

518
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:20,460
Come on.

519
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:21,540
Don't be shy.

520
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:23,060
Go now.

521
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:24,220
Take your toy with you.

522
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:25,860
Go now.

523
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:26,740
Hurry.

524
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:27,700
Have fun, okay?

525
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:28,900
You two

526
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:30,060
are lovely.

527
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:32,140
Find a beautiful place

528
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:33,580
and talk things out.

529
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:34,980
What a harmonious campus.

530
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:36,060
Look.

531
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:37,180
All right.

532
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:37,940
Go.

533
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,260
Go.

534
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:01,940
Speak.

535
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:03,060
What do you want from me?

536
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:04,980
Show me how you escaped

537
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:06,980
from those thralls.

538
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:07,700
Now.

539
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:08,900
Stop playing dumb.

540
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:09,860
You're hiding something.

541
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:11,540
I noticed it yesterday.

542
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:19,860
I abandoned you there

543
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:22,020
to see when you'll show your true colors.

544
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:23,740
Who exactly are you?

545
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:28,980
Hurry.

546
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,100
Show your power.

547
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,060
You're my slave now.

548
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:33,460
I don't want to use violence.

549
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:35,980
I swore

550
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:37,580
not to use my power

551
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:39,180
before anyone.

552
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:45,860
[Patience]
You forced me to do this.

553
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:03,780
Forgive me, Ms. Bao!

554
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:05,740
I don't know anything!

555
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:19,780
Why are you crying?

556
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:21,660
Is this shirt very expensive?

557
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:31,100
Look.

558
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,260
I'm merciful enough.

559
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,700
I cut your clothes.

560
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:34,900
But not your body.

561
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:40,740
Say cheese.

562
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:42,620
What are you doing?

563
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:44,860
I'm sending it to the Village Director.

564
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,620
What for?

565
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:51,700
A seal.

566
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:53,140
(She can see it?)

567
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:00,420
Isn't that

568
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:01,540
restricting?

569
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:04,980
Pervert!

570
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:06,940
You ripped my clothes off.

571
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:08,820
Then, you became concerned about me.

572
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:13,740
You know what?

573
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:16,020
Be my slave.

574
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:16,860
Or

575
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:18,140
I'll upload your photo

576
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:20,100
to the uni's forum.

577
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:21,780
Yes, Ms. Bao.

578
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:22,980
I

579
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:24,620
am now your slave.

580
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:25,900
Feel free to use me.

581
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:29,380
Boss me around.

582
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:32,180
Don't call me Ms. Bao.
