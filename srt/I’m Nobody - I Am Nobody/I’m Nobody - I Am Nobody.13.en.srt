As I said, it won't be that easy.

Every ability and technique

201
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:42,420
has to be adapted

202
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:44,900
to how your qi works.

203
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,300
It's like programming.

204
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,060
Qi is the source code.

205
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,700
If you don't know how to use it,

00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:50,820

I can find you a more suitable tutor.

No need.

211
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:01,100
I get it now.

212
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:02,460
I didn't summon

213
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,500
enough qi.

I didn't feel anything.

218
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,820
It's only strong enough to topple aluminum cans.

Aluminum cans?

220
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:43,420
Chief Celestial Taoist,

221
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:44,620
explain this.

222
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:45,820
Think of qi

223
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:46,860
as the gold reserve of a nation.

224
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,220
When it goes to war,

225
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:48,940
it should use

226
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:49,900
its gold efficiently.

227
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:50,540
But this woman here

228
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,300
just threw gold ingots at her enemy.

229
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:53,900
Anyone else

230
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,700
would have fainted from overexertion.

231
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,460
Eat this, then.

232
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:26,100
How can this be?

233
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,860
Has she found out the weakness of my Sniff attack?

234
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,780
The closer she is to me, the stronger the attack,

235
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:31,100
but the smaller the range.

236
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,460
So it's easy to dodge.

237
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:33,500
How does Feng Baobao

238
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,620
predict Xiao Xiao's movements?

239
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:37,220
She didn't predict.

240
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,500
She knows how Xiao Xiao breathes.

241
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,140
So Xiao Xiao cannot fool her

242
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:43,380
by feigning a breath.

243
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,340
To unleash his Sniff attack,

244
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:45,660
he has to use his dantian.

effortlessly, right?

252
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,740
Defeating him with spells isn't that difficult.

00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,700
is the order of arcanum.

389
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,580
It's the hidden law of the universe

390
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:24,660
that ordinary people do not understand.

391
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:26,740
In the right position,

392
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:27,940
at the right time,

393
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:29,060
with the right force,

394
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:31,500
you can pursue the good and avoid the danger.

395
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:35,700
Taoist Wang,

396
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:37,140
I observed

397
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,180
from your previous matches

398
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:40,380
that all your steps

399
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:41,540
were precisely where they should be.

400
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:42,740
You positioned yourself

401
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:44,700
in the most auspicious spot.

402
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:46,380
That's why

403
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:47,900
you could dodge

404
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,740
all the attacks they hurled at you.

405
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:50,780
Because you manipulated luck

406
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:52,340
to be on your side.

407
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,380
Did I get it right,

408
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:55,620
Taoist Wang?

409
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:58,780
What a nuisance.

410
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:02,340
It's hard to befriend someone like you

411
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,220
because I can't have secrets at all.

412
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:08,780
I was just trying my luck.

413
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:10,020
I wanted to defeat you

414
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:11,220
before you use your Qimen skills.

415
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,620
I guess I made a mistake,

416
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:16,060
Zhuge Qing.

417
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:21,220
Have you suffered a loss before?

418
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:24,980
Outside of my training with my elders,

419
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:26,220
no.

420
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:29,380
Do you think you can accept a defeat then?

421
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:31,300
That kind of defeat

422
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,780
that invalidates all your achievements before.

423
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:36,140
Since we're both sorcerers,

424
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:37,340
no need to get physical

425
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:39,020
like the others.

426
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:40,700
I'll give you time.

427
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:43,100
Go ahead and find

428
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:44,540
the right spot.

429
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:54,340
Why are they just standing there?

430
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,980
What a twist.

431
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,860
A sorcerer goes with the flow.

432
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,100
Zhuge Qing.

433
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,780
I do not want to humiliate you，

434
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:06,020
and I only say this once.

435
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:08,620
Go back, Zhuge Qing.

436
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:10,700
That is the right option for you.

437
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:21,500
Have you found your sweet spot?

438
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:22,980
Taoist Wang.

439
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:26,300
I performed a divination for myself.

440
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:29,540
And I was given three words.

441
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:32,300
A meaningless struggle.

442
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:33,980
Kun,

443
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:34,540
Boulder Toss.

444
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:39,860
Kun,

445
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:41,540
Boulder Toss.

446
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:05,260
(He stood in the spot of Xun,)

447
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:06,740
(yet he exerted the spell of Kun.)

448
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:08,260
(And he overpowered me with that?)

449
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:10,220
(I can't find any opening.)

450
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:18,780
Li,

451
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:19,620
Fireball!

452
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,060
Xun,

453
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:24,540
Sandalwood Succor.

454
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:34,100
Did you see that?

455
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:36,220
He attacked a tree with a fireball.

456
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:36,780
No, you're wrong.

457
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:38,300
The tree is growing thicker.

458
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:39,060
No,

459
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:41,220
he used the tree to defend against the fireball.

460
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:42,940
How can this be?

461
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:44,060
Impossible.

462
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:45,060
This is not Qimen Skills at all.

463
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:26,940
It cannot be.

464
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:28,820
No sorcerer can defy

465
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,580
the law of elements.

466
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:37,380
Zhuge Qing.

467
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:38,860
What do we do now?

468
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:41,100
Should we stop here?

469
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,980
You divined for yourself already.

470
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:46,140
Taoist Wang.

471
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:49,020
Maybe I am destined to be defeated.

472
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:50,700
Maybe this defeat

473
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,780
will bruise my ego.

474
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:55,220
But for a sorcerer,

475
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:56,100
one thing

476
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,620
is more important than ego.

477
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:01,260
It's the truth.

478
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:09,380
If I'm defeated here,

479
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,100
I need to know

480
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,540
what kind of power I lose to.

481
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:24,580
[Qimen's Immaculate Scrutiny]

482
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:26,300
[Qimen's Immaculate Scrutiny]
It's Qimen's Immaculate Scrutiny!

483
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,860
The user's perception

484
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:29,860
will be greatly enhanced,

485
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:30,460
and he can see

486
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:32,060
all that is not visible,

487
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:33,220
including the nature of a matter.

488
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,780
This spell-slinging match

489
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:37,300
is such a nail-biter.

490
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:38,780
A nail-biter?

491
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,820
Isn't the match lopsided enough?

492
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:43,700
Qing was in the spot of Kun,

493
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:46,060
but his boulder toss was outmatched.

494
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:48,100
He was in the spot of Li and threw a fireball,

495
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:51,140
but it was countered
by a wood-based spell of all things!

496
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,320
(Qimen's Immaculate Scrutiny!)

497
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:55,740
Qing.

498
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:57,140
I'm begging you.

499
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:58,580
Stop it.

500
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:00,100
He

501
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,980
is way beyond your league.

502
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:06,660
I don't want to see you defeated.

503
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:08,580
Come, Taoist Wang.

504
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:10,300
Show me what you have got.

505
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,020
Dui,

506
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:11,700
Black Mamba.

507
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:24,820
What have you done?

508
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:27,220
Teleportation?

509
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:29,620
That's my sister's technique.

510
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,460
Zhuge Qing can teleport too?

511
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:33,420
No, Taoist Wang teleported Zhuge Qing.

512
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:34,820
He is now restrained by Taoist Wang.

513
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:54,020
I paralyzed your Danzhong pressure point.

514
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:55,700
It's over.

515
00:25:58,780 --> 00:25:59,780
I

516
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:01,540
lost.

517
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:08,180
But I saw nothing.

518
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:09,260
He gave up just like that?

519
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:12,900
Wang Ye managed

520
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:15,220
to outclass Zhuge Qing.

521
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:16,620
But in terms of sorcery,

522
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:18,860
none should be able

523
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:20,580
to surpass the Zhuge family.

524
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:22,340
The divine dragon
bestowed upon us the divine chart.

525
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:24,340
From rulers to rulers, it was passed down.

526
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:26,300
The astrologian, Fenghou,
deciphered it with his words.

527
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:28,140
Thus born the arts of Qimen.

528
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:28,740
Lu,

529
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:30,460
although no one has seen it before,

530
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:32,820
one of the Eight Supremes

531
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:34,340
is Qimen Manipulation.

532
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:35,180
Thank goodness

533
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,140
we stayed.

534
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:40,540
While Qi Apotheosis remains elusive,

535
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:42,780
Qimen Manipulation makes an appearance.

536
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,660
See?

537
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:56,420
Zhuge Qing!

538
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:57,620
Stop now!

539
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:58,740
Stop!

540
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:02,260
I said, stop!

541
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:12,460
Qing!

542
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,260
I told you to stop!

543
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:24,980
Do you hear me?

544
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:28,260
I wanted to perform another divination for myself.

545
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:30,740
I didn't know it would turn out like this.

546
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:37,740
I can accept defeat.

547
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:40,940
But I cannot accept

548
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:41,620
a defeat

549
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:43,420
without knowing how I was defeated!

550
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:51,340
Forgive me.

551
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:52,500
Oh, masters and my grandmasters,

552
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:53,820
forgive my insolence.

553
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:54,940
Forgive me.

554
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:57,380
You forced me to say those vile things!

555
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:58,820
You...

556
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:03,540
Whatever.

557
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:05,900
I shouldn't have come here.

558
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:10,740
Guess this is the end of my peaceful days.

559
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:12,820
Zhuge Qing.

560
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:14,660
Look carefully now.

561
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:31,740
I knew it.

562
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:34,780
You're a sorcerer, too.

563
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:36,340
Zhuge Qing.

564
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:38,860
You lost your composure.

565
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:40,740
You know I am a sorcerer.

566
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:41,500
So why

567
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:43,460
did you tunnel-vision on me?

568
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:44,860
Look at the chart.

569
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:47,220
What's wrong with the chart?

570
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:48,300
Isn't it a normal

571
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:50,220
chart...

572
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,020
Can you see it now?

573
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:58,900
Unlike sorcerers

574
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:01,180
who seek to find the most advantageous spot,

575
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:02,940
in this chart,

576
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:05,100
I embody all positions.

577
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,540
I am both fortune and misfortune.

578
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:07,740
Time,

579
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:08,980
space,

580
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:10,540
the law of elements,

581
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,100
I decide them all.

582
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,980
(During our match,)

583
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:16,580
(I didn't touch you at all.)

584
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:18,860
(But since this space is under my command,)

585
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:21,180
(so is your position.)

586
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:23,820
(I can attack you from anywhere)

587
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:26,020
(and strike your weak spot.)

588
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:32,860
You manipulate the chart with your will.

589
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:34,220
But the chart

590
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:35,780
is dictated by time.

591
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:38,060
You can't possibly manipulate time.

592
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:39,260
Why not?

593
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:42,260
Time is but a measurement

594
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:43,700
of evolution.

595
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:46,700
For someone who remains eternal,

596
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,420
time becomes meaningless.

597
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:50,740
If you can manipulate
the evolution of all matters,

598
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:52,900
you can manipulate time.

599
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:55,020
I can manipulate anything

600
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:57,900
in this Qimen chart.

601
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:03,380
From now on,

602
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:04,140
the gravity of this space

603
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:05,700
will be different from the outside world.

604
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:08,260
It will take this pebble a minute

605
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:09,780
to fall to the ground.

606
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:12,700
Is it warm now?

607
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:14,980
Is the wind blowing another way?

608
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:17,980
It's almost spring now,

609
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:20,300
but I can change the temperature and humidity
of this place

610
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:22,020
to resemble summer's.

611
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:24,420
You say a sorcerer places himself
at the most auspicious spot.

612
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:26,020
And that he is bound by the law of the universe.

613
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:27,100
I agree.

614
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:28,460
But it's not entirely true.

615
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:30,700
Why is your ancestor, Zhuge Liang,

616
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:32,860
considered the greatest Outsider
to have ever existed?

617
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:36,580
As a sorcerer of immense power,

618
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:39,220
did he not foresee
that the imperial family would wane?

619
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:40,100
Did he not know

620
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:41,180
that division brings unity

621
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:42,660
and unity brings division?

622
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:44,340
If he wanted to stay at the most auspicious spot,

623
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:46,140
he should have stayed in his hometown.

624
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:47,700
With that kind of power,

625
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,180
he could have easily

626
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,700
achieved greater heights.

627
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:52,020
But he gave

628
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:52,980
his enlightenment

629
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:54,380
up.

630
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:56,380
Despite the ominous tidings,

631
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:58,740
he threw himself into mortal affairs

632
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:00,300
because he wanted

633
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:02,580
to save the world that was beyond redemption.

634
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:04,020
He fought the universe

635
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:05,500
and the destiny

636
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,180
for the world he believed in.

637
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:09,420
To attempt the unimaginable,

638
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:09,900
that's

639
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:12,500
what a sorcerer of his caliber did.

640
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,580
If staying at the most auspicious spot

641
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:15,980
and following the law of the universe to a tee

642
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:17,660
are what a sorcerer should do,

643
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:19,260
why should we seek the truth?

644
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:22,820
Regardless of whether we follow the order or not,

645
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:24,540
regardless of whether
we are Outsiders or ordinary people,

646
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:25,780
we are all bound by something,

647
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:27,340
are we not?

648
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:38,580
Most Outsiders

649
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:39,740
hit a wall

650
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:40,940
because of their inner demons.

651
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:42,780
Your ancestor, Zhuge Liang,

652
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:44,380
turned away from enlightenment

653
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:46,340
for the people he cared about.

654
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:48,780
That is what makes him great.

655
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:50,340
In my eyes,

656
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:51,540
Zhuge Liang, Lyu Dongbin,

657
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:52,660
and Zhang Sanfeng,

658
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:53,420
these

659
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:55,700
past legendary figures,

660
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:57,820
I revere them the most.

661
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:09,740
I lost.

662
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:11,500
I lost completely.

663
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:13,540
Taoist Wang.

664
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,180
I surrender.

665
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:17,940
Wang Ye

666
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:19,420
versus Zhuge Qing.

667
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:20,500
The winner is

668
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,700
Wang Ye.

669
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:26,700
Congratulations.

670
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:35,500
It's okay, Qing.

671
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:36,940
Don't worry, Qing.

672
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:39,300
We will always support you!

673
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:41,700
Taoist Wang.

674
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:44,300
If I may ask one last question,

675
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:45,620
what is the name

676
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:47,300
of your technique?

677
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:50,220
I have told you enough things.

678
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:51,420
Don't be greedy now.

679
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:54,260
You can divine the answer yourself.

680
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:57,820
But I'm not stopping you
if you are courting death again.

681
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:04,620
I didn't expect to see someone like him
from Mount Wudang.

682
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:06,780
How did he escape my notice?

683
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:08,260
Can I trust you

684
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:09,460
to recruit Wang Ye

685
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:10,780
to our guild?

686
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:11,620
Chulan.

687
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:13,500
Your next opponent

688
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:14,580
will be Wang Ye.

689
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:16,020
Goodness me!

690
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:18,180
There's no way I can defeat him.

691
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:19,540
Dad.

692
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:20,620
He's so strong.

693
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:22,100
I can't defeat him.

694
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:23,540
We can't kidnap him, can we?

695
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:26,740
Did I teach you nothing at all?

696
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:28,540
Everyone covets something.

697
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:30,140
You just need to identify what he is after.

698
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:31,660
But...

699
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:34,380
But I don't know him that well.

700
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:36,660
Use your brain.

701
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:37,940
What does a Taoist need?

702
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:39,220
Money, of course.

703
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:40,580
Only poor people turn to religion.

704
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:47,060
