Yes.

3
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:23,220
Careful.

4
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:25,420
Chief Celestial Taoist.

5
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:27,700
These are the damages
done by the Sinister Pleasure.

00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:29,220

Okay.

Zhang Chulan.

10
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:40,580
What secret lies in Tianshidu?

11
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:41,940
Is there something about my past?

12
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:44,860
Tianshidu...

13
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:46,260
Chulan.

14
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:47,220
Come.

15
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:49,620
Ms. Bao.

16
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,220

I'm Kun from the Sinister Pleasure.

28
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:40,140
Greetings, sir.

29
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:45,780
Good.

30
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,140
Can we go now?

31
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:50,180
Rest well.

32
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:53,140
Yes, we can leave now.

33
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:54,620
You did such a great job.

34
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:56,140
Why don't you stay here

35
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:57,420
and take care of me?

36
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:03,660
Why not express your gratitude
to Chief Celestial Taoist right away?

37
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:04,860
It's such

38
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,860
an honorable position.

39
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,740
I'd die to stay here too.

40
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:09,860
I'm so jealous of you.

41
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:15,340
We shall pack our things.

42
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:18,580
Stop shoving. You should get your braces changed.

43
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,060
Congratulations, Grandmaster.

44
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:21,740
You have two more assistants now.

45
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,980
You said you were jealous of them.

46
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,900
Why don't you stay here then?

47
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:32,540
Grandmaster.

48
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:33,300
Well.

49
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,620
The presence of Sinister Pleasure here
has been eradicated.

50
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:36,340
San

51
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:38,420
lamented the lack of foresight

52
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:40,620
and promised that this would not happen again.

53
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:42,380
Don't change the topic.

54
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:44,740
I'll ask you again.

55
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:47,060
Will you accept Tianshidu or not?

56
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:50,140
Grandmaster,

57
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:53,780
you haven't answered

58
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,380
my question from back then.

59
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:02,700
If you give me Tianshidu,

60
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:04,620
what will happen to you?

61
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:07,380
You

62
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:10,260
must have guessed the answer already.

63
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:14,820
Grandmaster,

64
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:18,940
will I see you again?

65
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:24,380
It's like talking to a wall.

66
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,020
As long as you do not stray from your path,

67
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:31,780
I will always

68
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:32,660
be your

69
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:33,780
grandmaster.

70
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,860
Mount Longhu will always be your home.

71
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:42,460
Sorry, Grandmaster.

72
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,620
Forget it.

73
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:47,340
You know my answer.

74
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:49,660
You should know why I did all that.

75
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:50,740
(You will leave tomorrow)

76
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:52,060
and find someone for me.

77
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:54,900
(I want you to test him)

78
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,780
(and see if he has what it takes
to inherit Tianshidu.)

79
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:58,700
You have to win.

80
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,420
You'll know once you're the champion.

81
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,220
Most importantly,

82
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,540
once you take over my mantel,

83
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:06,260
no one in the Sinister Pleasure
dares to mess with you.

84
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:07,980
Grandmaster,

85
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,180
I don't want

86
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:11,900
Tianshidu.

87
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,620
Can't you tell

88
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:14,620
I organized

89
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,500
the martial arts contest for you?

90
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,980
Take good care of yourself.

91
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,500
You,

92
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:25,980
(Lingyu,)

93
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:28,820
(and that Wang Ye,)

94
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,140
(the world)

95
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:34,980
(will be yours in the future.)

96
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,620
(The burden)

97
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:37,740
(will be a heavy one.)

98
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:43,580
But you're here, Grandmaster.

99
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:44,620
No harm will come to me, right?

100
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:46,860
Cheeky rascal.

101
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:49,340
I bet that lady is waiting for you out there.

102
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,820
Go back now.

103
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:00,500
Ms. Bao?

104
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,300
You hold her dearly, don't you?

105
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:17,820
-Help! Somebody!
-Don't run!

106
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:18,300
Sir.

107
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,580
You lied to me.

108
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:20,940
Save us.

109
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:21,620
Who did this?

110
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:22,460
He did.

111
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:23,580
Master,

112
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:24,580
are you all right?

113
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:28,420
Why are you here?

114
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,860
Aren't you supposed to protect Tian?

115
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:31,380
It's very quiet over there.

116
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:32,460
There was no invader whatsoever.

117
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:33,420
On my way here,

118
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:34,460
I ran into these two scoundrels.

119
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:35,740
Why are you here? Answer me!

120
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:38,900
Where is Tian?

121
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,700
He's in his room.

122
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:48,420
Master?

123
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,620
Martial Uncle.

124
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:58,860
Master is here.

125
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:02,580
Master.

126
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:04,300
Martial Uncle?

127
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:09,700
Martial Uncle?

128
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,900
Martial Uncle!

129
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:10,460
Chulan,

130
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:11,660
who did this?

131
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,540
Anything about him has been wiped clean.

132
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:23,740
Lyu Liang...

133
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,660
Check if there are other clues.

134
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:30,220
Chief Celestial Taoist.

135
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,420
Please stand aside.

136
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:34,220
This is a specialist from my company.

137
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,260
He can reenact past scenes

138
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:36,820
from the ambient qi.

139
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:37,380
But of course,

140
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:38,820
if the incident took place a long time ago,

141
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,180
the amount of ambient qi will be too faint

142
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:41,580
for a proper restoration.

143
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,140
Is it plausible?

144
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:47,580
It took place less than 40 minutes ago.

145
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:49,180
I can do it.

146
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:06,420
I was there.

147
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:09,700
Second Grandmaster.

148
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:12,260
Grandmaster Rong Shan.

149
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:13,860
What's the matter, Qing?

150
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,500
You're shaking.

151
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:17,100
The Celestial Taoist Mansion...

152
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:21,460
The Sinister Pleasure attacked
the Celestial Taoist Mansion.

153
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:25,700
Those scum!

154
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,540
Chief Celestial Taoist is fighting too, I heard.

155
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,020
The Sinister Pleasure is numerous.

156
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,780
Chief Celestial Taoist is old too.

157
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:31,900
I fear that he might

158
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,060
be outnumbered.

159
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:35,540
Rong Shan.

160
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:36,140
Go now.

161
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:38,700
Help your master.

162
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:39,940
No, Martial Uncle.

163
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:42,140
Master told me to protect you.

164
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:44,540
This place is far from the battlefield.
No one will come here.

165
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:45,380
Go.

166
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:46,780
This is an order.

167
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,300
Yu, Qing.

168
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,780
Protect Second Grandmaster.

169
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:55,100
Yes.

170
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,740
Worry not, Grandmaster Rong Shan.

171
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:00,460
You fool.

172
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,980
See how easy they lured you away?

173
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,700
What do we do?

174
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:06,780
Is the Sinister Pleasure

175
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,740
going to destroy the Celestial Taoist Mansion?

176
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:09,980
Don't worry.

177
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,780
They are not strong enough.

178
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:14,540
And they don't want to destroy
the Celestial Taoist Mansion anyway.

179
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:15,820
Qing.

180
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:18,220
You haven't met the Sinister Pleasure.

181
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,740
They will use every means

182
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,220
to advance their goal.

183
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:27,380
Qing.

184
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:28,620
What are you doing?

185
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:31,180
You say the Sinister Pleasure uses every means
to advance their goal.

186
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:32,780
I am aware of that.

187
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,260
Because I told them

188
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:35,180
to destroy

189
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:37,700
the unimportant parts
of the Celestial Taoist Mansion.

190
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,860
You see, I've been here for three years now.

191
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,100
This place has sentimental value to me.

192
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:52,540
I am the Interim Leader
of the Sinister Pleasure, Gong Qing.

193
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:58,380
Pleased to make your acquaintance.

194
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:03,200
[Interim Master of the Sinister Pleasure,
Gong Qing]

195
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:15,820
[Thirty minutes after the assassination
of Tian Jinzhong]

196
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:20,340
He's here.

197
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,740
Finally, you show up.

198
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,740
Interim Leader Gong.

199
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,780
They are on high alert now.

200
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:50,100
Tianqian has been sealed by NDT.

201
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:52,460
This warehouse looks abandoned.

202
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:53,860
I don't think they will come here.

203
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:56,260
Let's spend a night here for now.

204
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:58,100
We can merge with the crowd and leave this place

205
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,500
during the funeral tomorrow.

206
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,860
Funeral?

207
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:03,860
Whose funeral?

208
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,100
Mr. Yuan.

209
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,660
How's everything on your side?

210
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:08,900
You see,

211
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:10,100
I

212
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,140
managed to keep
Chief Celestial Taoist occupied.

213
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:15,140
But so many people died

214
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:17,020
for you.

215
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:19,620
Even though they were just fodders,

216
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,540
they still made up the Sinister Pleasure.

217
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,980
Do you know what awaits you

218
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:27,340
if you return empty-handed?

219
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:46,740
Stop squeezing it.

220
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:52,220
Enough!

221
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:09,900
Mr. Yuan.

222
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:12,860
You asked me whose funeral it'd be.

223
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:14,780
It'd be Tian Jinzhong,

224
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:15,740
Mr. Tian's funeral.

225
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:21,020
Tian Jinzhong is dead?

226
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:23,620
I killed him.

227
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:34,380
Don't you pride yourself as someone
who knows the Sinister Pleasure the best?

228
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:36,700
So why does my double identity,

229
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,780
being your disciple and the interim leader
of the Sinister Pleasure,

230
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:40,300
surprise you so?

231
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:42,540
I'll be frank with you.

232
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:45,860
I am interested in Jiashen Calamity.

233
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:47,620
Especially Zhang Huaiyi.

234
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:50,020
I found out that he stayed in Mount Longhu

235
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,660
so I infiltrated this place.

236
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:52,540
However,

237
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:55,260
your security is airtight.

238
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:57,100
During my sojourn here,

239
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,380
I found nothing.

240
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,100
But I got lucky.

241
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,540
When I was about to give up,

242
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:04,540
I stumbled upon a lead.

243
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:09,060
And so I was waiting for an opportunity.

244
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:11,020
An opportunity like today.

245
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:14,220
To ask you the question.

246
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:17,420
What question?

247
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,660
You once left Mount Longhu with Zhang Zhiwei

248
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:22,820
and went your separate ways.

249
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:24,940
No one knows why.

250
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:26,500
But I do.

251
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,580
You two were looking

252
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:30,140
for the traitor of Mount Longhu,

253
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,180
Zhang Huaiyi.

254
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:35,700
What I want to know is...

255
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:36,980
Was your search

256
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:39,420
a fruitful one?

257
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,340
How did you obtain that information?

258
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,380
That incident

259
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:45,500
was only privy to my master, Zhiwei,

260
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,820
and me.

261
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:49,180
You are right.

262
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:51,100
The secret is only privy to three of you.

263
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,220
But it isn't too hard to deduct it.

264
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:55,740
I have seen your scars.

265
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:58,700
(They were inflicted by torture.)

266
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:01,420
(Why were you)

267
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:03,020
interrogated?

268
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:04,460
Because someone wanted to know

269
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:06,060
why you made the trip.

270
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:07,740
It was for Zhang Huaiyi.

271
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:09,780
Is my theory

272
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:10,860
sound and logical?

273
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:15,060
You theorized all that?

274
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,100
I did.

275
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,180
At this point,

276
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:21,180
I don't mind telling you
that I launched this invasion

277
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:23,620
to test my theory.

278
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:24,980
If my hypothesis is wrong,

279
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:28,020
my peers will kill me.

280
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:30,060
What a shame.

281
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:32,900
Because you're right.

282
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:35,220
We did leave Mount Longhu

283
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:38,620
to look for Huaiyi.

284
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,380
My kidnapper

285
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,660
wanted to get

286
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:43,780
Huaiyi's whereabouts from me too.

287
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:45,780
Failing to find Huaiyi

288
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:47,900
is my deepest regret.

289
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:50,780
If Huaiyi were with me,

290
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:52,740
they wouldn't be able to lay their hands on me!

291
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:55,780
So they got nothing

292
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:57,300
from you?

293
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:00,620
You see.

294
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:04,900
They reduced me to a cripple
but I still refused to give in.

295
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,500
What makes you,

296
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,860
Gong Qing,

297
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:09,940
think you can fish information

298
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,300
out of me?

299
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,820
Second Grandmaster,

300
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:16,340
you are as stubborn as a mule.

301
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:18,220
Indeed, I can't

302
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:19,580
extract information from you.

303
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:21,860
Come in.

304
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:30,980
Will you remain stubborn

305
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:33,340
or should I continue guessing?

306
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:37,180
After all,

307
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:39,340
I have been taking care of you

308
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,100
for the past few years.

309
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:45,420
And during these few years,

310
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:47,580
I found out many times,

311
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,940
that you, who claimed that you needed no sleep,

312
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:53,140
almost dozed off.

313
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:17,580
Grandmaster.

314
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:18,900
Is Second Grandmaster that powerful?

315
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,300
He needs no sleep at all?

316
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:23,780
Yes.

317
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:25,340
It's called mindfulness.

318
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:28,660
That's incredible.

319
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,140
Since when?

320
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:31,500
A long time ago.

321
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:33,900
After he was injured,

322
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:37,140
his body was too weak

323
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:39,740
to practice anything

324
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,340
other than static qigong.

325
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:50,620
(You have no idea)

326
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:52,180
(how excited I was at this discovery.)

327
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:54,100
Because it gave me

328
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,900
another explanation.

329
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,580
You are not unwilling to sleep,

330
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:01,020
but unable to do so.

331
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,620
Or perhaps, you don't dare to.

332
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:05,260
I theorized

333
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:06,340
that your kidnappers

334
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:08,820
couldn't get anything out of you.

335
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:10,300
And you never mentioned it

336
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,500
to anyone in Mount Longhu.

337
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,420
It was around that time

338
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:16,660
that you began to be afraid of sleeping.

339
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,740
Why?

340
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:21,420
Because when we're asleep,

341
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:23,380
our inhibition is lowered.

342
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:25,900
You are afraid of sleep-talking.

343
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,580
After your rescue,

344
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:29,540
there is a secret

345
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:31,980
inside you.

346
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,340
And that secret is

347
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:35,300
you

348
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,700
met Zhang Huaiyi.

349
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:39,700
(Not only that,)

350
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:43,100
you talked to Zhang Huaiyi

351
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:45,740
and obtained information

352
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:48,460
that cannot be revealed to your master.

353
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:50,300
You would bring it to your grave.

354
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:57,300
Young lad.

355
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:59,500
You're so creative.

356
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:02,380
But you got it wrong

357
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:05,660
this time.

358
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:07,700
I did not find Huaiyi.

359
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:10,820
Even if my limbs were chopped off,

360
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:12,780
and my meridian system was destroyed.

361
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:16,220
A fact is a fact.

362
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,380
Whatever situation I'm in,
whoever asks me that question,

363
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:20,660
my answer will not change.

364
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:22,220
Second Grandmaster,

365
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:25,100
I know how stubborn you can be.

366
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:26,900
I wasn't planning to make you confess anyway.

367
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,020
Lyu Liang.

368
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:33,620
Stay back,

369
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:35,140
foul beasts!

370
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,180
Hurry.

371
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:48,140
Extract his memory from back then.

372
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:49,340
Then delete all memories from that incident

373
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:50,860
as well as memories containing you and me.

374
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,580
He had held onto them for far too long.

375
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:54,940
Let's release him from his agony.

376
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:56,380
I can't.

377
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:58,340
He has the most resilient

378
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:00,900
primordial spirit I have ever seen.

379
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:03,660
Count yourself lucky

380
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:04,980
that I can check his memory.

381
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,380
To extract specific memories,

382
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,060
it'll take months.

383
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:10,900
We won't be able to get anything

384
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:12,340
from him now.

385
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:13,740
Go.

386
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:15,380
Guard the door.

387
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:18,420
I will do my best

388
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:20,340
to make a copy of all his memory.

389
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,020
I'm done.

390
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:43,180
Let's go.

391
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:44,980
It's dangerous to stay here.

392
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:46,940
Qing.

393
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:48,580
I need you.

394
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:52,020
Come. We're done here.

395
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:52,900
What are you waiting for?

396
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:58,660
What are you doing?

397
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,020
Are you crazy?

398
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:01,300
I'm leaving you.

399
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:32,420
Qing.

400
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:34,900
Not bad.

401
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,980
You weaved your intricate plan
patiently for three years

402
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:40,660
and it paid off.

403
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,860
I won't be able to convince you to give up,

404
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:45,940
will I?

405
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:50,060
Are you going to leave now?

406
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:51,460
Yes.

407
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:02,180
To think that Sinister Pleasure
was once a virtuous organization...

408
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:05,780
Look how far you have fallen.

409
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,220
You're but a motley band

410
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:09,580
of criminals,

411
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:11,580
scumbags!

412
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:13,900
You think the world is your oyster

413
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,660
but you're destroying it.

414
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:18,020
Irresponsible morons!

415
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:19,540
Second Grandmaster, this is unbecoming

416
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:21,060
of you.

417
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:22,220
Don't call me that!

418
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:26,260
You're dirtying my name.

419
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:30,980
You're the ringleader.

420
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:33,220
Minister in Black?

421
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:35,260
Wu Gensheng?

422
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:37,300
All of you are the same.

423
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:39,380
Cowards who turn away
from their responsibilities!

424
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:52,780
I see.

425
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,260
You're so right.

426
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,900
[Nefarious Needle]

427
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:04,980
Let me take charge

428
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:06,940
of your life.

429
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:16,260
You finally grew a pair.

430
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:18,780
You want to kill me?

431
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:20,900
I might be a cripple

432
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:23,100
but here in the Celestial Taoist Mansion,

433
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:25,820
my power is merely below Zhiwei's.

434
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:28,260
Quit threatening me.

435
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:31,220
What if I chicken out?

436
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,260
Are you sure about it?

437
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:12,660
[Year of Jiashen]

438
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:14,260
[Year of Jiashen]
Are you sure about it?

439
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,820
[Zhang Huaiyi, 35 years old]
Even so,

440
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:17,180
[Zhang Huaiyi, 35 years old]
are you still trying to force me to say it?

441
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:17,500
[Zhang Huaiyi, 35 years old]

442
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,460
[Zhang Huaiyi, 35 years old]
Is that right, Jinzhong?

443
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:20,140
Yes, unless you explain why,

444
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:21,500
or I won't stop pestering you.

445
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:32,220
And that is our duty.

446
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:34,140
What epiphany did you receive?

447
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:35,500
The finality of all things

448
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,740
is Qi Apotheosis.

449
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:37,780
Dummy.

450
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:38,300
Let's go.

451
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,300
We're running out of time.

452
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:46,340
Jinzhong.

453
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:48,020
Don't return.

454
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:49,700
Come with me.

455
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:50,540
I can't.

456
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:52,140
Master is waiting for me.

457
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,420
I have to go back to him.

458
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:55,780
Fine.

459
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:58,100
I know you far too well.

460
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:59,980
Be proud of yourself now

461
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,180
because you're the sole keeper

462
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:02,860
of this secret.

463
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:05,460
Jinzhong.

464
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:06,980
Take care.

465
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:09,220
All the best.

466
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:11,380
May we never meet again.

467
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:13,700
May we never meet again.

468
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:26,220
You're awake.

469
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:27,340
Master.

470
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:28,940
Zhiwei.

471
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:31,820
I did not find Huaiyi.

472
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:32,820
But they wouldn't believe me.

473
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:35,140
They wouldn't.

474
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:36,740
Jinzhong.

475
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:40,180
I will track your kidnappers down

476
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:41,300
and avenge you.

477
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:50,940
Jinzhong.

478
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:56,220
What are you doing?

479
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:58,140
Master.

480
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:00,020
Just let me die.

481
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:01,740
Please,

482
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:03,580
Master!

483
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:05,300
You fool!

484
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:06,260
Have you learned nothing

485
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:07,380
from years

486
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,180
of cultivation?

487
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:10,860
Remember.

488
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:12,500
You are no ordinary man.

489
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:15,460
Like me, we seek enlightenment.

490
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:17,340
We celebrate life.

491
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:18,940
No cultivators

492
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:20,420
kill themselves

493
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:22,140
upon encountering a setback.

494
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,300
The path is arduous

495
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:26,140
but you will endure it.

496
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:28,020
Remember this.

497
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:29,380
Hardship

498
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,240
means you're making progress.

499
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:34,940
Master...

500
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:37,500
Sorry, Master.

501
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,200
Come.

502
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:46,860
Do you like it?

503
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:47,580
You made it?

504
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:49,700
Did I improve?

505
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:51,220
Not bad.

506
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:52,740
Zhiwei.

507
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:54,820
I don't care what assignment Master gives you.

508
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:56,180
Even when you become a Celestial Taoist,

509
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:57,700
you have to cook for me.

510
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:02,260
I had a deal with Huaiyi.

511
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,180
He'd travel for a year.

512
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:04,540
Then it'd be my turn.

513
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:06,140
In the end, he never came back.

514
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:07,500
Here.

515
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:09,620
Take another bite.

516
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:14,180
Zhiwei.

517
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:17,540
Thank you so much.

518
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:18,740
Jinzhong.

519
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:21,820
Don't feel bad at all.

520
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:23,900
You got injured on a mission.

521
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:25,820
You did not fail our sect

522
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:26,580
nor did you fail

523
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:28,140
your peers.

524
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:30,140
And to be honest,

525
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:31,580
when everyone takes turns

526
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:33,020
to take care of you,

527
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:34,300
we actually get to skip

528
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:35,660
some of our training.

529
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:39,540
I don't feel that guilty, you know?

530
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:40,580
Maybe I do when others are here.

531
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:41,580
But you?

532
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:43,100
You ought to take care of me.

533
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,420
Anyway, you were talking in your sleep last night.

534
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:47,260
"Sorry, Master."

535
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:48,540
"Sorry, Zhiwei."

536
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:50,740
What else did I say?

537
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:54,540
You also said,

538
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:56,780
finality,

539
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:57,660
and,

540
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:58,660
qi.

541
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:12,580
Hardship means I'm making process.

542
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:15,940
Hardship means I'm making process.

543
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:17,940
Huaiyi.

544
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:20,060
I regret it so much.

545
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,060
I shouldn't have asked you to explain.

546
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:26,540
And now, I have to carry

547
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,940
this burden.

548
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:34,900
When you told me what you were doing,

549
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:38,620
I should have done it.

550
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:42,980
Even though I'll betray my doctrine

551
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:45,580
in the process,

552
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:49,700
I should have died a long time ago.

553
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:57,380
Sorry.

554
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:02,020
I should have died a long time ago.

555
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:14,660
Second Grandmaster.

556
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,060
Goodnight.

557
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:33,780
Lyu Liang did his best

558
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:35,780
and extracted Mr. Tian's memory.

559
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:37,300
Brilliant!

560
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:39,500
So your theory

561
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,460
is right.

562
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:42,780
Three years ago,

563
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:44,220
you wagered your life

564
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:46,540
to convince us.

565
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:50,460
You said you'd find the whereabouts
of our ex-leader, Wu Gensheng.

566
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:52,300
Your wager paid off handsomely.

567
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,020
Don't tell anyone the fact

568
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:00,020
that we have Mr. Tian's memory now.

569
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:02,260
I trust you to circulate

570
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:05,100
what I'm about to say to everyone.

571
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,740
Another operation right after

572
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:08,660
we invaded the Celestial Taoist Mansion?

573
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:09,940
Do you know

574
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:11,100
how heavy the casualties are?

575
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:13,420
Tell all our members

576
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:14,820
to be in mourning for seven days.

577
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:16,460
We will all mourn for Mr. Tian.

578
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:17,500
Those who refuse to comply

579
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:20,620
will be killed.

580
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:45,060
I did everything I could to reenact the past.

581
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:46,540
But Mr. Tian's memory

582
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:48,060
is in Lyu Liang's possession.

583
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:49,820
I have no way to retrieve his memory either.

584
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:51,300
Thank you.

585
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:54,860
You did a good job already.

586
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:55,940
Thank you so much.

587
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:58,180
Chief Celestial Taoist,

588
00:29:58,180 --> 00:29:58,940
my condolences.

589
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:21,820
Rong Shan.

590
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:25,820
Death is inevitable.

591
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:26,980
Accept it.

592
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:32,100
Rong Shan.

593
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:34,020
Rong Shan?

594
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:38,540
Rong Shan.

595
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:40,060
Rong Shan.

596
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:41,420
Rong Shan!

597
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:05,700
Martial Uncle...

598
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:44,220
[Long Live Taoism]

599
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:02,580
Zhang...

600
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:03,500
Baobao.

601
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:06,340
Don't say anything now.

602
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:38,220
Ms. Bao.

603
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:44,620
Ms. Bao.

604
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:50,260
Xu San said your mood hasn't been good lately

605
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:52,140
and asked me not to ask you anything for now.

606
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:54,860
Is it because you are sad?

607
00:32:58,740 --> 00:32:59,780
I think I can understand

608
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:01,420
what sadness is now.

609
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:03,100
When a long-time friend dies,

610
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:04,580
you feel sad.

611
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:07,380
When a family member dies,

612
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:08,860
you feel sad.

613
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:11,180
When your loved one dies,

614
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:12,540
you feel sad too.

615
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:19,140
You have only met Mr. Tian a few times.

616
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:21,780
He isn't your family.

617
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:23,860
Do you love him?

618
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:25,860
Why are you in love

619
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:27,980
with someone you barely met?

620
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:35,820
Ms. Bao.

621
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:38,940
I refused to inherit Tianshidu.

622
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:40,500
So I cannot

623
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,900
get the answer you want
from Chief Celestial Taoist.

624
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:45,140
I'm sorry.

625
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:56,660
Ms. Bao.

626
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:58,540
I think

627
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:00,060
you should give up on the past.

628
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:01,340
It's been so many years, after all.

629
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:02,500
Maybe they already...

630
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:15,140
Ms. Bao.

631
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:16,740
You're not alone.

632
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:18,740
I also no longer have a home.

633
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:25,300
But I can promise you

634
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:27,300
that I will stay by your side

635
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:29,980
like Mr. Xu or Xiang did.

636
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:34,140
You can boss me around.

637
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:35,060
You're lying.

638
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:38,860
You have a home.

639
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:39,820
You do.

640
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:41,740
All of you do.

641
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:43,580
It's in here.

642
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:02,340
Ms. Bao.

643
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:05,420
You will find what we have.

644
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:08,060
I will help you find the truth.

645
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:10,740
I will find your home.

646
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:41,580
Grandmaster Tian.

647
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:43,540
Thank you for keeping

648
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:45,540
my grandpa's secret for years.

649
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:02,420
Jinzhong.

650
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:05,100
You must be tired

651
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:06,740
from all these years.

652
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:08,900
Sleep well now.

653
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:31,980
Master.

654
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:33,220
Don't dwell in grief.

655
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:34,580
Your health is important.

656
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:36,540
Jinzhong.

657
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:38,780
You will not die in vain.
