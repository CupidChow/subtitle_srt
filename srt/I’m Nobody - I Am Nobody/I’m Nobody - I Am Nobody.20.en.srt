the Chief Celestial Taoist kill them?

00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,500
When that day comes,

189
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,020
don't think the Lyu family

190

378
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:15,100
is my family.

379
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,460
Huanjin,

380
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:23,660
I only asked you to leave the mountain
with me this time.

381
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:25,500
What do you think?

382
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:27,980
I will do

383
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:28,980
whatever you tell me to do, Master.

384
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:29,820
If you don't say it,

385
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:31,020
I won't harbor wild thoughts.

386
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:31,940
Then let me ask you.

387
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:36,340
If something goes wrong with me

388
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,260
this time

389
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:44,460
and I tell you to run away,

390
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:47,500
what will you do?

391
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:48,940
Then I'll run away at once.

392
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:57,060
Your pork is here.

393
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:57,780
Enjoy your meal.

394
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:01,940
Great.

395
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:03,900
Then I want you to eat the meat now.

396
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:04,900
Then I will eat the meat.

397
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:34,460
He has informed Chief Celestial Taoist

398
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:35,740
as per your request.

399
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:41,100
Liu,

400
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,020
you'd better shape up.

401
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:55,380
Has everything been arranged?

402
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,420
The Sinister Pleasure's masters

403
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:58,340
who can come are all ready.

404
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:00,220
Chief Celestial Taoist is too strong.

405
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:01,460
Our only chance of winning

406
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:02,660
is to make good use of our men

407
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:03,540
and take them by surprise.

408
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:10,060
Extend my greetings to Chief Celestial Taoist.

409
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:17,700
Master,

410
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:18,620
here it is.

411
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:23,060
Master,

412
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:24,300
you are an old man.

413
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,220
What are you doing here?

414
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,060
I will do

415
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,300
whatever they do.

416
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:31,100
Can your heart bear it

417
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,340
at this age?

418
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:34,580
I'm over 18.

419
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:35,700
[No entry for those under 18]

420
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:36,660
Taoist,

421
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:37,900
I didn't mean to disrespect you.

422
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:38,860
We open a store

423
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:40,140
to do business.

424
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,180
It's more lively

425
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:43,060
next door.

426
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:44,740
Why don't you go and check it out?

427
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,660
I'm old.

428
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:49,900
I can't dance anymore.

429
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:25,660
Sirs,

430

what would you like to drink?

431
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:28,820
We are waiting for someone.

432
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:29,620
I'm sorry,

433
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:30,740
but there's a minimum spend.

434
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:31,780
If so, I'd like a lemonade

435
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:32,660
with more ice.

436
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:34,100
Okay.

437
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:56,500
Where is Gong Qing?

438
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:00,260
You may ask him.

439
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:33,660
Your lemonade is here.

440
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,020
Chief Celestial Taoist.

441
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:43,780
The Interim Leader
of the Sinister Pleasure, Gong Qing,

442
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:46,100
asked me to send you

443
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:48,220
his regards.

444
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:23,140
Gong Qing is not here, right?

445
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:25,500
We can fight against you

without the Leader himself.

447
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:30,140

to have gathered so many people.

I'm a good-for-nothing.

535
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:19,260
I violated your teachings

00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:22,260
for a woman from the Sinister Pleasure.

537
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:25,780
I disgraced you.

538
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:30,020
This woman has a name.

539
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:31,580
Her name is Xia He.

540
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:34,580
Lingyu,

541
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:36,140
isn't it human nature

542
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:38,620
to be anxious about the one you love?

543
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:45,220
You have been pursuing perfection

544
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:46,660
and avoiding mistakes

545
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:48,100
since you were a child.

546
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,820
But there is no real perfect being

547
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:52,260
in the world.

548
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:54,860
I have been hoping

549
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:56,020
for you to make a mistake

550
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:57,580
for so many years.

551
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,140
Because

552
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:01,340
it takes more courage

553
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:03,740
to admit that you are not perfect.

554
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:11,100
On the last day of the Martial Arts Contest,

555
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:13,300
I asked you to make the opposite choice.

556
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:15,620
Do you know why?

557
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:20,060
Because you care about other people's opinions

558
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:22,900
and never make your own choices.

559
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:26,420
But if a person wants to grow,

560
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:27,900
he must be brave enough

561
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,660
to be honest with himself

562
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:31,340
and be himself.

563
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:37,380
As for me,

564
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:38,620
I am just a passer-by

565
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:40,740
in your life.

566
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:43,100
Lingyu,

567
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:45,620
you finally made a choice.

568
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:47,140
From now on,

569
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:50,540
you are no longer a Mount Longhu disciple,

570
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:52,940
and I am no longer your master.

571
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:08,380
Go ahead and cry.

572
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:11,300
You will feel better after this.

573
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:20,540
As I get older, I talk more.

574
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:21,540

579
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:39,220
are the necessary paths of life.

580
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:46,260

581
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:50,820

the biggest secret in the Outsiders' world.

651
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:16,540
These secrets are extraordinary enough

652
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:18,780
to cause complete chaos

653
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:21,620

00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:25,860
