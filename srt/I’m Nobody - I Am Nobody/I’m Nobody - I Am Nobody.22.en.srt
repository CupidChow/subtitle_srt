Stop following me.

500m east,

and 1km north.

After the bridge and market,

you'll see a park. Let's meet there.

It's not that easy to get rid of us.

Are you going to run again?

33
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:42,860
No.

34
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:44,460
I can't run anymore.

You're so rampant.

I don't mind.

would be a sorcerer.

the elders of my clan

didn't blame me for losing to you.

from when you were on the mountain.

174
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:10,580
You appear rather tense.

When you were at Mount Longhu,

176
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,900

It shows that you're in deep trouble.

186
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,580
I shall give you some advice.

187
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:54,420

188
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:57,340
Aren't you observing my palm?

189
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:05,460
Actually,

190
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,940
after I lost to you at Mount Longhu,

191
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:09,380
I was completely wrong-footed.

00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:10,980
It wasn't until I left the mountain

193
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,500
and heard the rumors that I knew

194
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:15,100
the skill you used was one of the Eight Supremes,

195
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:17,020
Qimen Manipulation.

196
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,220
And I know

197
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:20,420
that to obtain the Eight Supremes,

198
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:23,260
those people could do anything
without thinking of the consequences.

199
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:25,460
I supposed when the Eight Supremes were introduced

200
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:26,940
back in the Year of Jiashen,

201
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:28,060
it was as chaotic.

202
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,180
How about you?

203
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:35,180
Me?

204
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:40,300
I want to get it, too.

205
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:44,060
Although I acquired Wuhou Qimen,

206
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:45,860
I want more.

207
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:50,820
Whenever I have this thought,

208
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,700
I find myself shameless.

209
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,980
Even though I truly want it,

210
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,140
I won't do so.

211
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:58,940
Even if you give it to me, I won't accept it.

212
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:00,300
Because

213
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:02,100
I'm the kind of person

214
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:03,180
who is

215
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:04,620
noble and righteous.

216
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:07,660
I don't think so.

217
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:11,900
Most importantly,

218
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:13,140
I don't want to end up

219
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:14,380
like you and Zhang Chulan.

220
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:15,940
Both of you are everyone's targets.

221
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:18,780
I heard that Sinister Pleasure
had caught him a few times.

222
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:21,500
That's right.

223
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:25,060
I'm indeed bothered.

224
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:28,740
The current situation...

225
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:30,700
How should I put it?

226
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:33,380
I think

227
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:34,900
I overestimated myself then.

228
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:38,620
Recently, I've been followed.

229
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,380
My family is being targeted, too.

230
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,020
However, my family knows nothing.

231
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,460
Well,

232
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,060
if you had given in

233
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:50,260
and let me hit you with Tai Chi,

234
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:51,260
all this wouldn't have happened.

235
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:53,420
Are you blaming me now?

236
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:54,300
I won't take the blame.

237
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:00,540
That's right.

238
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:01,820
I did promise

239
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,700
that I'll help you when you're in trouble.

240
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:05,020
But this time,

241
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:06,740
it's beyond my capability.

242
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,340
I know someone who can help you.

243
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,260
I got it.

244
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,260
This is your dad's friend.

245
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:14,220
This is your mom's friend.

246
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,060
They're all Outsiders.

247
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,100
There might be some Outsiders

248
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,100
who are targeting your brother and his family.

249
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,340
So, you asked me over

250
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:18,740
to investigate

251
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:19,940
the mastermind behind it.

252
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:20,340
Am I right?

253
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:22,860
Well,

254
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:24,140
this is no easy feat.

255
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:25,060
You're so foolish.

256
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:25,740
It's just a simple case.

257
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,180
Even I know what to do.

258
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:29,620
Ms. Bao.

259
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:30,700
Are you experiencing

260
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:31,420
intermittent quick-witted disorder?

261
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,860
I couldn't think of any solutions
even after thinking for a few nights.

262
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:34,980
Can you think of a solution?

263
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,140
Don't say

264
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:37,820
that I should bury all of them.

265
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:39,420
Are you silly?

266
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:40,580
Whatever they want,

267
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:41,620
just give it to them.

268
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:47,060
You're right, Ms. Bao.

269
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:47,940
Taoist.

270
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:48,940
To monks like you,

271
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:49,460
aside from your own life,

272
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:51,020
nothing else matters, right?

273
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:51,820
If they want something from you,

274
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,220
just give it to them.

275
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:54,500
How about this?

276
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,380
You can give your Qimen Manipulation

277
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:56,340
to me.

278
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:57,540
After all, they're trying to get

279
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:58,140
my Qi Apotheosis.

280
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:58,860
Having one more Qimen Manipulation

281
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:00,060
won't do any harm.

282
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:01,100
Zhang Chulan.

283
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:03,780
Why don't you give your Qi Apotheosis

284
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:04,740
to those who want it?

285
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:06,260
I wish I could do so.

286
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:07,700
But I don't know how to do it.

287
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,660
Otherwise, I would have given it to them by now.

288
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,180
The more people master the skill, the safer I am.

289
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:14,380
I can't hand the skill over to them yet.

290
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,380
If I do, the tragedy of the Jiashen Calamity
will repeat itself.

291
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:17,980
The world will be in much more chaos.

292
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:18,980
I have to carry this burden

293
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:19,900
on my own.

294
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:21,580
Besides,

295
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:22,660
I've made a promise to Master Hong.

296
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:23,740
Who is Master Hong?

297
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:24,700
Is he the one who taught you
the Qimen Manipulation?

298
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:25,420
Where is he now?

299
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,780
Instead of putting it that way,

300
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,740
I would say that he inspired me.

301
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:31,980
Master Hong is no longer around.

302
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:35,740
That's complicated then.

303
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,660
If so, we can only sit this out.

304
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:38,780
As you said,

305
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:40,100
you can protect yourself.

306
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,780
You can hire
some Outsiders to protect your family.

307
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:42,220
Well,

308
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:43,180
I'll source Outsiders for you.

309
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:44,500
I'll source some from the company.

310
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:45,580
It's cheap and affordable.

311
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:46,580
Our service is good too.

312
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:48,340
I don't trust others.

313
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:49,300
Besides...

314
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:54,300
I have a suitable candidate.

315
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,780
Is it me?

316
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:03,980
Why are you looking at me?

317
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:06,020
I have other tasks.

318
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:07,140
Tasks?

319
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,060
To keep an eye on me?

320
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:14,340
Actually,

321
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:14,860
you're

322
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:16,020
the most suitable one to do this.

323
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:17,660
Zhang Chulan.

324
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:19,140
You're from the company.

325
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:20,140
You were kidnapped, too.

326
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:21,460
You handled stalkers like them

327
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:22,220
previously.

328
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:22,980
Moreover,

329
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,060
you're right here.

330
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:25,700
What are the odds?

331
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:27,260
Zhang Chulan.

332
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:30,540
Don't you want to know

333
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:31,700
the one that's targeting Wang Ye

334
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,740
and coveting the Qimen Manipulation?

335
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:38,100
If I'm not wrong,

336
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:38,740
you're here

337
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:40,140
because of Qimen Manipulation, aren't you?

338
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:44,500
Just see it as doing a friend a favor.

339
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,940
We won't let you do this for free,

340
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:46,940
right?

341
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,020
Of course.

342
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:49,820
Name your price.

343
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,740
My rates are expensive.

344
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:53,820
No worries.

345
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:55,020
I'm loaded.

346
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,140
One billion.

347
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:02,060
It's a deal.

348
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:05,020
We're friends, so let's make things clear.

349
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:06,700
I'll send the contract to you by tonight

350
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,140
and wire you the deposit tomorrow.

351
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:09,100
Is that fine?

352
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:12,860
Sure.

353
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:14,460
I'll make the preparations.

354
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:22,740
[90 hours until the mastermind is found]

355
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:25,300
Ms. Bao.

356
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,340
How bold of you.

357
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:27,740
How could you just name a price like that?

358
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:29,940
Did I ask for too little money?

359
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,260
Little?

360
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:33,620
I stuck my finger out,

361
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:34,780
and I meant ten thousand.

362
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:36,700
Yet you asked for one billion without thinking.

363
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:37,860
I'll explain to him then.

364
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:41,340
We must be honest.

365
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:42,860
We should keep our word.

366
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:43,420
Well,

367
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:45,220
one billion it is.

368
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:46,340
We'll slightly be at a loss.

369
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:49,100
Wang sure knows something
about the Jiashen Calamity.

370
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,060
We get to test him out.

371
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:02,580
- I have a big watermelon.
- I have a big watermelon.

372
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:04,940
- It's so round.
- It's so round.

373
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:07,900
- I cut it once.
- I cut it once.

374
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:10,860
- And I cut it again.
- And I cut it again.

375
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:14,060
- Half for you.
- Half for you.

376
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:17,580
- Half for me.
- Half for me.

377
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:21,100
Serve it on the table.

378
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,940
Serve it

379
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:24,060
on the table.

380
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:26,940
Ye.

381
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:28,940
Is this the authentic Tai Chi

382
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:31,140
that you learned in the mountain?

383
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:32,220
Yes.

384
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:34,860
I find it rather unreliable.

385
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:35,660
I won't do it.

386
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:36,580
I'm not doing this.

387
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:38,220
Dad.

388
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,500
You just need to cut the watermelon every day.

389
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,740
It's more effective

390
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:42,500
than you taking kangaroo essence

391
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,740
or tiger bone wine.

392
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:45,460
Ye.

393
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:47,980
You've been quite obedient since your return.

394
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:48,860
Tell me.

395
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:50,060
What do you want?

396
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:51,500
Dad.

397
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,980
I have an emergency,

398
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:54,420
and I need some money.

399
00:18:58,700 --> 00:18:59,540
How much do you need?

400
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,260
One billion...

401
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,620
Oh, boy.

402
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:11,740
You scared me.

403
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:15,220
Wait, Dad.

404
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,460
It has been years.

405
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:20,220
It's my first asking for money from you.

406
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:22,220
Just join the company, then.

407
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,620
All of the company assets will be yours.

408
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:26,300
You can have some pocket money,

409
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,500
but I won't give you

410
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,460
this money.

411
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:31,900
Never mind.

412
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:32,980
I'm just saying.

413
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:34,620
By the way, Dad,

414
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,060
I'll go out later.

415
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:37,660
I won't come back tonight.

416
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,180
Where are you going again?

417
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:44,700
I'll go

418
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,020
to Baiyun Temple.

419
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:47,340
Just now,

420
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:48,140
I suddenly recalled

421
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:49,500
that I haven't seen my seniors there

422
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,580
for a long time.

423
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:54,060
I miss them so much.

424
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:57,220
I'd like to visit some of the elders there too.

425
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:59,420
When I was in Wudang,

426
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:03,220
they encouraged me.

427
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:04,460
I need to pay them a visit

428
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:06,700
and chat with them.

429
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:07,180
Seniors.

430
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:08,140
Stop!

431
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,660
Just one billion.

432
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:18,220
Dad.

433
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:21,500
You may give me more.

434
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:23,540
All these years on the mountain,

435
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:26,020
I have had a poor and simple life.

436
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:28,380
Fine...

437
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:28,980
I'll

438
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,580
wire a few million to you first.

439
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:32,700
I'll wire the rest of the amount to you later.

440
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:35,860
I won't ask what you're going to do

441
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:36,660
with the money.

442
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:39,300
Even if you use it for clubs

443
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,500
and pubs,

444
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,420
or even

445
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:42,700
waste all of it.

446
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:46,460
But you must promise me one thing.

447
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:48,620
Please go on.

448
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:50,420
You mustn't go to the temple anymore!

449
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:07,140
How much is this?

450
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,340
Five yuan.

451
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:13,140
(You received a two-million payment)

452
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:15,700
(on Alipay.)

453
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,460
Do you get to earn so much money

454
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:18,900
by selling sweet potatoes these days?

455
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:20,620
It's my ringtone.

456
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:28,740
Wang, the money...

457
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:33,020
Mr. Wang, we received the payment.

458
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:34,820
Don't worry. We've started to work.

459
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:45,060
Ms. Bao.

460
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:48,460
Doesn't the company have portable equipment?

461
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:49,580
It has been taken.

462
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:51,100
You need to pay.

463
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:53,340
A sweet potato is only worth a few yuan.

464
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,940
We now have two million.

465
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:58,340
We need to investigate something for Mr. Wang.

466
00:21:58,340 --> 00:21:58,900
Yeah.

467
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:16,460
Is there any progress?

468
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:19,940
Have a look.

469
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,660
The person on Madam Wang's left is an Outsider.

470
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:24,740
The person on the second last row

471
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:25,780
is also an Outsider.

472
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:28,140
The one leading the dance

473
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:29,420
is also an Outsider.

474
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:33,740
[72 hours until the mastermind is found]

475
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:58,380
(Wang Ye is troublesome enough.)

476
00:22:58,380 --> 00:22:59,820
(Now, there's Zhuge Qing.)

477
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:01,380
(We're doomed.)

478
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:04,300
It's actually simple.

479
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,380
You can look for Zhuge Qing.

480
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:06,620
He knows Enhance Hearing.

481
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,980
How much do we need to divide with him then?

482
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:12,460
After this job,

483
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:13,660
I need to buy something

484
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:14,780
from the leader of Beggars' Gang.

485
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:23,100
What are you waiting for?

486
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,060
Give chase!

487
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:32,700
By the way, it has been three days.

488
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,380
Hasn't Zhang Chulan contacted you?

489
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:38,420
No.

490
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:43,420
By the way,

491
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:44,900
your job is done here, right?

492
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:46,460
Why are you not leaving yet?

493
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:49,660
We are friends, aren't we?

494
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:50,540
At times like this,

495
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:52,700
the more help you get, the better.

496
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:00,900
Or do you think

497
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,740
that I'm not skillful enough

498
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:03,900
and will hold you back?

499
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:06,980
You just find this enjoyable

500
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:08,220
because it happens once in a blue moon.

501
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:09,380
So, you're here

502
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:10,620
to join the fun.

503
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:13,020
I'm not that horrible.

504
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:19,260
Actually,

505
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:20,460
I've been thinking.

506
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:21,540
Did Zhang Chulan

507
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:23,700
run away with the money?

508
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:26,820
I think you should call him.

509
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,420
Perhaps

510
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:30,060
he's already in another city now.

511
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:31,420
I don't think he's such a person.

512
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:33,060
[Lian]

513
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:42,220
Who says that I'm not in the capital?

514
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:46,860
How is it?

515
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:50,220
I'll do my job if I get paid.

516
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,780
How's your progress?

517
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:55,620
Everything is going smoothly.

518
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:57,500
We identified 11 individuals.

519
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,060
Also,

520
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:00,420
please part ways

521
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:01,780
and walk around the area.

522
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,340
I'll have a look.

523
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:16,540
He's so fair.

524
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:42,180
How is it?

525
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:43,860
The view is great, isn't it?

526
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:45,660
It's clear.

527
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:46,420
Here's the invoice.

528
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:51,540
Didn't I give you the deposit?

529
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,980
That is called labor fee.

530
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:57,140
This is for additional charges.

531
00:25:58,500 --> 00:25:59,380
No, it's not right.

532
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:01,460
20 jin of sweet potatoes for 120 yuan.

533
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:02,460
What is this?

534
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:03,580
We have leftovers.

535
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:04,540
Do you want some sweet potatoes?

536
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:07,860
Listen.

537
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:09,820
There are 11 Outsiders in total.

538
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:10,940
With different roles,

539
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:11,940
they get to know your parents

540
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:13,020
and your brother as well as his family.

541
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:14,380
But actually, they are all from the same gang.

542
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,580
There are three people in that building.

543
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:18,620
Two men and one woman.

544
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:19,860
However, their eating preferences don't align.

545
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:21,460
They need to order eight rounds of food delivery.

546
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:23,180
Two people sleep in the room, while
the other one sleeps in the living room.

547
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:24,260
The lady baths at 8 AM in the morning,

548
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:25,260
while the men bath at 10 PM at night.

549
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:26,860
The man who has the living room is the worst.

550
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:28,900
He hasn't bathed at all.

551
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:29,940
And he goes to sleep late,

552
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:31,420
which is 3 AM.

553
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:32,420
However, the lady

554
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:33,860
wakes up at 6:30 AM.

555
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:34,820
Hence, our operation time

556
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:36,380
is from 3 AM to 6 AM.

557
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:42,940
You do make a point.

558
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:44,860
So, what should we do now?

559
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:45,420
Well,

560
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,300
our team

561
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:48,940
is to be led by Ms. Bao.

562
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:50,580
We must listen to her orders

563
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:52,180
like slaves.

564
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:58,460
It's still early.

565
00:26:58,460 --> 00:26:59,940
Let's play eight rounds of mahjong.

566
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:01,140
We'll start the operation at 3:30 AM.

567
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:03,860
I agree.

568
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:04,620
Come on.

569
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:14,380
[8 hours until the mastermind is found]

570
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:23,260
Two Bamboo sets.

571
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:23,780
Two Dots.

572
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:24,500
One Dot.

573
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:31,060
Five Dots.

574
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:35,020
Wang Ye.

575
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:35,660
Draw your tiles.

576
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:41,900
Winning by my own draw.

577
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:46,220
Pure suit hand with four sets.

578
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:46,820
Gang!

579
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:47,660
All kongs.

580
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:50,380
I don't need you to claim my receipts now.

581
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:55,260
[Action]

582
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:55,820
[Action]
Let's get to work.

583
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:56,660
[Action]

584
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:10,700
The three of you.

585
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:13,220
From now on, you have to keep quiet.

586
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:15,500
Take the mask off.

587
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:31,500
I'll do it.

588
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:02,060
It's not locked.

589
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:11,100
(He's)

590
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:11,820
(asleep.)

591
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:16,060
(You,)

592
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:16,420
(you)

593
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:16,860
(and you,)

594
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:17,540
(handle him.)

595
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:18,740
(Got it.)

596
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:19,740
(I'll)

597
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:20,260
(enter the room)

598
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:20,860
(and handle the other one.)

599
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:21,780
(All right.)

600
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:17,140
To make someone unconscious,

601
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:19,020
you just need to find the right spot and force.

602
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:20,140
I'm not asking you to dismantle the house.

603
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:32,180
You better not try to run away.

604
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:38,020
Don't just tape their mouths.

605
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:40,780
You need to make sure
that it's stuffed into their mouths

606
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:43,540
to restrain their tongue movement.

607
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:45,740
If you just tape their mouths,
they can still speak.

608
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:49,620
NDT Express

609
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:51,140
is a legitimate company.

610
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:51,980
Am I right?

611
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:54,340
Don't mind the details.

612
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:57,380
I've been expecting to do this.

613
00:30:58,060 --> 00:30:59,260
Make sure it's stuffed inside
before you tape the mouth.

614
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:03,860
Ensure that the fillings

615
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:05,260
will not be pushed out by the tongue.

616
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:10,300
What is this for?

617
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:16,580
[Wang Weiguo]

618
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:19,060
[Liu Chunhua]

619
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,060
Answer me.

620
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:24,260
Why are my parents' photos up there?

621
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:26,260
I had to figure out your mom's interests

622
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:27,620
in order to befriend her.

623
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:32,740
Zhang Chulan.

624
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:35,180
Please.

625
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:37,180
I'll pay you any amount.

626
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:39,100
Please handle these people for me.

627
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:43,580
I can do anything as long as I get paid.

628
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:46,620
However,

629
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:48,460
there's a tiny problem here.

630
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:49,740
How could we

631
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:50,620
move these people outside?

632
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:55,300
We can't be

633
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:57,020
guarding them till the morning, right?

634
00:31:58,180 --> 00:31:59,260
Even if we transfer

635
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:00,740
each of them into a sack,

636
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:01,580
we'll be exposed

637
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:02,860
if they move.

638
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:05,620
Fool.

639
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:06,540
Stop moving.

640
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:08,860
You're no better than him.

641
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:10,740
Three of you.

642
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:11,700
Get out of here now.

643
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:12,860
Wait for me in the car.

644
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:31,700
Don't worry.

645
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,260
I've sent their phone numbers

646
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:33,900
and personal details

647
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:35,460
to the company.

648
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:36,300
The company

649
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:37,860
will check their recent financial status

650
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:38,820
and call history soon.

651
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,260
Wang.

652
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:42,780
We'll surely find something.

653
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:44,660
Here she comes.

654
00:32:59,020 --> 00:32:59,420
Ma'am.

655
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:00,660
Two sets of Tianjin-style jianbing.

656
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:21,300
What is inside the box?

657
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:23,060
Goods.

658
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:28,180
Please add more.

659
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:30,860
Sir.

660
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:32,420
This is for you.

661
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:37,540
She's

662
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:40,020
fearless, isn't she?

663
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:41,980
She must be a habitual offender.

664
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:49,460
Okay.

665
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:50,820
Their superpowers are sealed.

666
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:52,820
Wang.

667
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:54,460
There are 11 of them.

668
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:55,980
You need to hire a cleaner.

669
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:58,860
You said there are 11 of them.

670
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:00,140
Where are the remaining eight?

671
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:05,540
(The three stalkers are here.)

672
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:06,020
(Ms. Bao.)

673
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:06,980
(Please keep watch here.)

674
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:08,300
(The three of us will climb up there.)

675
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:15,460
Don't be afraid.

676
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:16,220
Leave it to me.

677
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:20,780
Wang.

678
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:22,700
There's no need

679
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:24,380
to do this.

680
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:29,340
Why didn't you guys tell me sooner?

681
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:50,660
Wang.

682
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:52,180
I can't do this anymore.

683
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:53,420
I'm a bit dizzy while climbing staircases.

684
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:54,540
Don't you have a fire-based superpower?

685
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:56,380
Just start a fire and force them to come down.

686
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:58,260
That won't do.

687
00:34:58,500 --> 00:34:59,540
I think it's doable.

688
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:00,420
I'll do it.

689
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:01,260
Li.

690
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:02,580
People will easily notice if we make big noises.

691
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:03,700
Fireball!

692
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:16,020
Qing.

693
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:18,180
Your little fire snake

694
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:19,020
is quite fast.

695
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:21,020
Who are you calling little?

696
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:32,620
It's just a short distance,

697
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:33,980
yet your body couldn't even handle it.

698
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:48,860
What could it be?

699
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:49,820
You're making a big fuss out of it.

700
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:51,220
Watch...

701
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:58,820
It's indeed a problem.

702
00:35:58,900 --> 00:35:59,860
Someone

703
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:01,100
exhausted the oxygen here with the superpower.

704
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:03,780
What should we do then?

705
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:04,860
We've only walked a few levels.

706
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:06,380
How many levels are left?

707
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:07,660
Ten.

708
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:09,180
We still have seven levels to go.

709
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:12,020
What should we do?

710
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:14,220
Well, what else?

711
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:15,180
Do this in one breath.

712
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:30,500
We lost them.

713
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:32,540
We haven't seen Wang Ye for days.

714
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:34,580
Do you think he's escaped the capital?

715
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:45,500
You managed to pass

716
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:46,980
through the anaerobic zone that I created.

717
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:48,980
Xun,

718
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:50,900
Wind Reflection!

719
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:09,940
Wang.

720
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:10,780
Don't mind us.

721
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:11,860
We can handle this.

722
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:12,940
Don't let that person run away.

723
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:14,100
It's okay.

724
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:15,140
It's one-on-one.

725
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:15,660
If I can't win, I'll run away.

726
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:17,660
Ms. Bao will settle them for us.

727
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:18,860
All right.

728
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:27,860
Boulder Toss!

729
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:31,820
Xun,

730
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:32,700
Wind Rope!

731
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:26,220
Aren't you here

732
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:26,980
to capture me?

733
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:28,620
If you stay so far away from me,

734
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:30,380
you won't be able to get me.

735
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:45,020
Speak.

736
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:46,380
Who send you here?

737
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:49,700
