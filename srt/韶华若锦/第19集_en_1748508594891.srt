1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,680
I am Quiz Geceyci Erten.

2
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:49,860
I am the local

3
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:55,820
hot pop singer who is votes for...

4
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:58,820
I don't need to delay the trip because of this.

5
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:08,820
Princess, you should put on your luggage.

6
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:12,820
Yunyi, I have something to tell you.

7
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:22,820
Uncle Fu, I have something to ask you.

8
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:25,820
I have something to ask you.

9
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:28,820
Okay, I will tell you.

10
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:35,820
Princess, are you sure you want to leave some horse carriage?

11
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:39,820
It will be too late if you leave the capital and think about the heaven.

12
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:44,820
I can't stand your kindness.

13
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:48,820
Let me carry this bag, I want to give some to others.

14
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,820
Thank you.

15
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,820
n

16
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:56,300
Now I see everything in you.

17
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:59,260
It is all good, I like it.

18
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:02,120
You can go now.

19
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,240
Okay.

20
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,300
Cai Kun.

21
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:14,300
When you finish up the top part of your oyu s piece,

22
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,300
I'll be waiting for your letter every day.

23
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,300
Don't break your promise.

24
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,300
And Tan.

25
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,300
If there's any news about Zhang Huayu,

26
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:23,300
you must tell me.

27
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,300
Madam Yun.

28
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:29,300
You're the only one on the way.

29
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,300
You must take care of her.

30
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,300
Miss Yun.

31
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,300
Is she really Qizhi's aunt?

32
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,300
Don't worry.

33
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,300
I'm here.

34
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,300
Are you happy?

35
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,300
No.

36
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,300
I just never heard you mention me.

37
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,300
I think

38
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:50,300
you have a good relationship with her.

39
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:53,300
You don't mind.

40
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,300
I don't mind.

41
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,300
But I think you're a bit too much.

42
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,300
I...

43
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,300
Okay, go back.

44
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,300
I'll be back as soon as possible.

45
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,300
Let's go.

46
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,300
Let's go.

47
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,300
Let's go.

48
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,300
After Ming Tingyuan's death,

49
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,300
the Haiyoumen has been watching the Prince of Dingbei's mansion.

50
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:18,300
But they haven't found anything suspicious.

51
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,300
I'm worried about Ming Tingyuan's death.

52
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,300
But Prince of Dingbei will definitely

53
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,300
return to the capital this time.

54
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,300
I'm sure.

55
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,300
I'm sure.

56
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,300
I'm sure.

57
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,300
I'm sure.

58
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,300
I'm sure.

59
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,300
I'm sure.

60
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,300
I'm sure.

61
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,300
I'm sure.

62
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,300
I'm sure.

63
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:38,300
I'm sure.

64
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,300
I'm sure.

65
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,300
I'm sure.

66
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,300
I'm sure.

67
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,300
You're leaving this country too.

68
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,300
You're leaving this country too.

69
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,300
Take the Emperor's life!

70
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,300
I don't want take your life!

71
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,300
Your Majesty!

72
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:51,300
It's all because of you.

73
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:54,300
That place is said to be the capital of Dom85.

74
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,300
Yes.

75
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,300
If the truth comes out,

76
00:05:56,300 --> 00:06:00,300
you go to the capital and check whether theMYのは

77
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:07,300
the police is still at press conference.

78
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,300
You just arrived in the capital.

79
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,120
We can't cut the crack

80
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,180
certainly we can.

81
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:13,900
You should have the order

82
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,060
to wait for our master's order.

83
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,960
Mev radioactive

84
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,300
When did you come to my mansion?

85
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,300
Two months ago.

86
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:50,300
Then what did you do in the mansion?

87
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,300
Protecting the princess.

88
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:58,300
At this time, you are so busy.

89
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:04,300
Then, you don't need to take care of the prince?

90
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,300
The prince has his own shadow.

91
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,300
The prince has his own shadow.

92
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:13,300
So, Yun is like a shadow in the mansion.

93
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,300
She only needs to protect the princess.

94
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,300
Yun is from the Imperial Guards.

95
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:28,300
But she is the best in the Imperial Guards.

96
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:32,300
Of course, she is good at it.

97
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,300
I admire her.

98
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:38,300
The princess said that the prince is the best man in Shangjing.

99
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:41,300
But she didn't say that your problem is also the best in Shangjing.

100
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,300
This is the best.

101
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,300
The plum soup can be removed from the heat.

102
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,300
It's so cool.

103
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,300
It's so hot.

104
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,300
The plum soup and cakes in Changping Square.

105
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,300
The national cuisine in Sanliu Jiulu.

106
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,300
The princess loves them all.

107
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:33,300
Princess.

108
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:38,300
Do you blame me because of the moon trap case?

109
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,300
Do you really want to know?

110
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:58,300
It's not you who framed Ming family and framed father.

111
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,300
Why should I blame you?

112
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,300
I don't know.

113
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,300
But I am a little confused.

114
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:06,300
I can't solve it.

115
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:10,300
I didn't get your explanation for a while.

116
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:16,300
Since you said that, I will say it directly.

117
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:21,300
Father's news about the disaster is in the capital.

118
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:24,300
Why did you bring the name of the imperial guards?

119
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:28,300
I was just ordered to do it.

120
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:33,300
So you are following the order of the emperor or the king?

121
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,300
Cousin Shen took father back to the capital.

122
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:52,300
Why did you let the soldiers of the Northern and Northern armies release father?

123
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:56,300
If you did, you would have been able to prove father's innocence.

124
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,300
You would have believed him.

125
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:01,300
Father's return to the capital was the initiative of the Northern and Northern kings.

126
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:07,300
Do you know that the one who really wanted to harm your father was your husband, the Northern and Northern kings?

127
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,300
Why don't you say anything?

128
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:27,300
You can't say it or you don't want to say it or you don't dare to say it?

129
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:32,300
I don't want to say it or you don't dare to say it.

130
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,300
Lu Ting is my own person.

131
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:46,300
When the imperial guards found out that I didn't want the scoundrel Chengxur to do the disaster again,

132
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:51,300
I didn't expect that they had planted the stolen goods in the Ming family's home.

133
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,300
The soldiers who bought the goods were bought by someone.

134
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,300
I knew that the enemy would make some action on the way.

135
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,300
So I asked Shen Yu to prevent the disaster in advance.

136
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:02,300
But the last person who caught the goods was one of our soldiers.

137
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,300
I have another question.

138
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,300
That day in the prison,

139
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:15,300
why did His Highness stop me from seeing father for the last time?

140
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,300
Father!

141
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:21,300
I know that the case has no turning back.

142
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:25,300
I only want to see father for the last time.

143
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,300
Open your eyes and look at me.

144
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,300
Father!

145
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,300
I'm late.

146
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,300
I can understand that His Highness didn't make any arrangements.

147
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,300
But I was clearly in prison that day.

148
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,300
If His Highness hadn't stopped me,

149
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,300
I would have seen father for the last time.

150
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,300
After you left the capital,

151
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,300
is there anyone else?

152
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,300
There are three people.

153
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,300
Don't worry.

154
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,300
There is the guards.

155
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,300
They didn't disturb us.

156
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,300
Stop the car.

157
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,300
Get off the horse.

158
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,300
Jiang Zizhi,

159
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,300
you told me to stop you.

160
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,300
You said that you would escape from the city.

161
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,300
Do you want to make up with me?

162
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:22,300
I just left the capital.

163
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,300
I didn't want to see father again.

164
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,300
I didn't want to see father again.

165
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:26,300
You just left the capital.

166
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,300
You treated me like this.

167
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,300
How can I be a prisoner in the future?

168
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,300
Get off.

169
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,300
Where are you going?

170
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,300
I'm going to find the medicine that can cure the princess.

171
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:36,300
I'm not going.

172
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,300
I can't let you go today.

173
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,300
Jiang Zizhi, let me go.

174
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,300
You go first.

175
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,300
You go with the water and the shrimp.

176
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,300
Go.

177
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,300
Get off the horse.

178
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,300
Someone is following us.

179
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,300
Go.

180
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,300
Someone is really here.

181
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,300
Go.

182
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,300
Where are you taking me?

183
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,300
Go.

184
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,300
Go.

185
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,300
Where is this?

186
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,300
Why did you take me here?

187
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,300
I'm sorry.

188
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,300
It hurts.

189
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,300
It hurts.

190
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:29,300
Your hand is in your hand.

191
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:33,300
Destiny has been broken.

192
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:36,300
Holding me, I'm willing to give up.

193
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,300
To the director,

194
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,300
it's indeed a long road.

195
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,300
Yes.

196
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,300
It's not a dead end.

197
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:48,300
The battle of Baishui has been set.

198
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,300
The director is still alive.

199
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,300
But

200
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:53,300
he needs to take a break.

201
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:55,300
Let's go.

202
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,300
Before the ceremony,

203
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,300
Ayu's team must leave the capital.

204
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,300
Let's go.

205
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:15,300
Let's go.

206
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,300
I want to go back quickly.

207
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:25,300
Let's go.

208
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,300
So, the incident that happened in the prison

209
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,300
was designed by His Highness?

210
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,300
Yes.

211
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,300
Then why didn't he tell me?

212
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:42,300
Even after the incident, he didn't mention it?

213
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,300
Tan Er.

214
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,300
This is a crime of abandoning the king.

215
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,300
If you make any mistake,

216
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:53,300
all those who know about it will be punished with death.

217
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:58,300
His Highness did this for you.

218
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,300
Su Xiang is suspicious.

219
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:08,300
Even if I die in front of her,

220
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:13,300
she will send someone to keep an eye on the palace.

221
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,300
The matter is not over yet.

222
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:19,300
I will try my best to punish her.

223
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,300
Your Highness, don't worry.

224
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,300
I'm here.

225
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:27,300
I misunderstood you.

226
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,300
If you don't bring her to see the father-in-law,

227
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:35,300
I'm afraid she will be in a mess.

228
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,300
What's more,

229
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:39,300
she may hate me forever.

230
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,300
My husband.

231
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,300
Okay, okay.

232
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,300
You guys sit down.

233
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,300
It will be done soon.

234
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:59,300
Tan knows that you did this for my own good.

235
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:02,300
But you and I are husband and wife.

236
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:05,300
You can do this for the family.

237
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:07,300
Then why can't you and Tan

238
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:11,300
share the same pain and death with me?

239
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:15,300
I promised to protect you forever.

240
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:20,300
If you tell me about this in advance,

241
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,300
you will be in danger.

242
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:26,300
Tan is very sad.

243
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:30,300
I didn't realize your pain.

244
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:32,300
I misunderstood you.

245
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:35,300
I will accept whatever you ask.

246
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:41,300
I will ask you to eat well.

247
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:43,300
Don't eat too much.

248
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,300
My husband.

249
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,300
I haven't eaten well for a long time.

250
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:52,300
I'm not well.

251
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:57,300
I will ask you to eat well.

252
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,300
If you have any problem,

253
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:05,300
I will ask you to eat more every day.

254
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:14,300
Okay, the soup is here.

255
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,300
Come on.

256
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:17,300
Father.

257
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,300
Taste my cooking.

258
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,300
It must be delicious.

259
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,300
I will taste it.

260
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:23,300
Okay.

261
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,300
Come on.

262
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:33,300
Be careful.

263
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:56,300
Brother Zhunfeng, did you see Miss Yun?

264
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,300
Where?

265
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,300
Where?

266
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,300
Miss Yun.

267
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,300
What are you doing?

268
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,300
I'm making a contract.

269
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:13,300
There are dry food and pastries on the carriage.

270
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:14,300
You don't have to do this.

271
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:16,300
I'm going to buy some pastries.

272
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,300
I'm going to buy some pastries.

273
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,300
I'm going to buy some pastries.

274
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:21,300
I'm going to buy some pastries.

275
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:23,300
I'm going to buy some pastries.

276
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,300
You don't have to be so hasty.

277
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:54,300
Sit down.

278
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,300
Thank you, Miss Yun.

279
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:12,300
Miss Yun.

280
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:14,300
I'm sorry.

281
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:16,300
I'm sorry.

282
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:18,300
I'm sorry.

283
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,300
I'm sorry.

284
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,300
I'm sorry.

285
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:24,300
See you later.

286
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:32,300
Me nice to meet you, Miss Yun.

287
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:34,300
Your celebrate is awesome.

288
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:38,300
I'm good to see you Legal.

289
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,300
And you are good at your work.

290
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:47,100
I

291
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:51,100
Blessed

292
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,340
Building

293
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:55,760
And hopefully, you'll enjoy yourself.

294
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:03,960
Pull yourself together, okay?

295
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,760
What if the brand is under public straight chains?

296
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,840
Which one would you choose?

297
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:18,880
Well…

298
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,100
Nejir Manas.

299
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:21,700
Alright.

300
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:24,560
He's the Crown Prince of Xia regretted his last life.

301
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:26,000
He must be happy.

302
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,840
You should respect him as a prince soon.

303
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,400
Why are you asking about my wife?

304
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:35,580
I...

305
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,180
Prince Yins is his best friend.

306
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:45,180
He also studied

307
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:46,060
and said

308
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:48,660
only excepted battles happening in the sword higher.

309
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,880
You don't deserve to eat fish.

310
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:50,880
You don't deserve to eat fish.

311
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:52,880
Miss Yun, you really misunderstood.

312
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,880
I definitely didn't mean to do that.

313
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:55,880
You really misunderstood.

314
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,880
That's the fish that Miss Yun grilled for me.

315
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,880
Why?

316
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:20,880
Can't you sleep?

317
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:22,880
This bed is too hard.

318
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,880
It hurts my bones.

319
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:26,880
I can't sleep.

320
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:28,880
You can't sleep?

321
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:30,880
You can't sleep?

322
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:32,880
I can't sleep.

323
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:33,880
What's wrong with you?

324
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,880
I can't sleep.

325
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:37,880
I can't sleep.

326
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:40,880
I can't sleep.

327
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:42,880
I can't sleep.

328
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:44,880
I can't sleep.

329
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:46,880
I can't sleep.

330
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:47,880
My bones hurt.

331
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:49,880
I didn't take a bath before I went to bed.

332
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:50,880
My hair is also bleeding.

333
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:52,880
I feel uncomfortable all over.

334
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:57,880
Tan's bed is a strange place without a regular bed.

335
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,880
There are no familiar objects.

336
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:02,880
It's hard to sleep.

337
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,880
Who said that the princess didn't take a bath?

338
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,880
There are no familiar objects around her.

339
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,880
You can just take me as a soft cushion in the house.

340
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:30,880
The pillow on the bed can fall asleep automatically.

341
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,880
Do you have any misunderstanding about yourself?

342
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,880
You are so fat.

343
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,880
You are not much better than her.

344
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,880
At least it's a familiar object.

345
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,880
The princess is determined to use it.

346
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,880
After all, this is the only way.

347
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,880
I didn't expect that the king of Dingbei who is in charge of the city

348
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:22,880
is so good at serving people.

349
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:26,880
When the king is in battle,

350
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:30,880
he can't take a bath for months.

351
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,880
It's a common thing.

352
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:35,880
Sometimes when the water is full,

353
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,880
a few people take it.

354
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:38,880
No matter how bad the environment is,

355
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:40,880
it's much more difficult than that.

356
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,880
In the future,

357
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,880
you can't sleep with Tan.

358
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:57,880
Tan can sleep without a familiar object.

359
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,880
I'm afraid that before she comes back,

360
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,880
she can't leave me.

361
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,880
Why didn't I notice that

362
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,880
you were so good at it?

363
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:10,880
I didn't notice that either.

364
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,880
Maybe Tan and I have been together for a long time.

365
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:14,880
We have improved a lot.

366
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,880
I remember the things in my hand.

367
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:22,880
I listened to your gentle heart.

368
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,880
I will never lose you

369
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:29,880
as long as I am with you.

370
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:33,880
Even if I have never expected it,

371
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:37,880
I don't know when I will see you.

372
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:40,880
The flowers are only for you and me.

373
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:46,880
The flowers are only for you and me.

374
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,880
When the flowers bloom,

375
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:56,880
you and me will be together.

376
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,880
It's really good.

377
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,880
But there is no news from here.

378
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,880
We don't know where he is.

379
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,880
We can't contact the security guards.

380
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,880
This place belongs to Hezhou.

381
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,880
Didn't Ayu disappear in Lingzhou?

382
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:34,880
We will never miss the news from the prison guards.

383
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:38,880
The Su family must have framed Ayu.

384
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,880
But they killed her in secret.

385
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,880
They said that Ayu disappeared in Lingzhou.

386
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:44,880
It's just a lie.

387
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,880
If they did it outside Lingzhou,

388
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,880
the Su family could be exposed.

389
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,880
So, Ayu must have found something.

390
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,880
Since we are away from Lingzhou,

391
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,880
we must have gone to Shangjing.

392
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,880
We just have to search along the way.

393
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,880
The security guards will definitely leave clues.

394
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,880
No, Ayu will not be here.

395
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,880
If I were Ayu,

396
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,880
I would die in Lingzhou.

397
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,880
The Su family will be in danger.

398
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,880
If the Su family catches her,

399
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,880
they will be dead.

400
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,880
Now they can't find Ayu.

401
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:22,880
It can only mean that Ayu is not here.

402
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,880
The Su family will never think that

403
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,880
Ayu will go back to Lingzhou.

404
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:28,880
Lingzhou?

405
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,880
The lights of the sword are dark.

406
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,880
Now for Ayu,

407
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:36,880
Lingzhou is the safest place.

408
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,880
You are right.

409
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,880
The best thing to do is to fool around.

410
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,880
If we are sure that Zhang Shizi is still in Lingzhou,

411
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,880
we will meet with Zhun Yin first.

412
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,880
He will find out about Lingzhou.

413
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:57,880
Let's go.

414
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,880
Stop!

415
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,880
Stop!

416
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:06,880
Miss Yun!

417
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:07,880
Miss Yun!

418
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:08,880
Miss Yun!

419
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:10,880
Miss Yun!

420
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,880
I am used to being alone.

421
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,880
I forgot that I have Mr. Shu.

422
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:27,880
Get on the horse.

423
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:28,880
No, no.

424
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:32,880
You...

425
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,880
Miss Yun, I...

426
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,880
I am sorry.

427
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,880
It's a remote place.

428
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,880
Why is there a carriage?

429
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,880
I am afraid that you will get tired.

430
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,880
So I came here in a hurry.

431
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,880
Teng, go ahead.

432
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:10,880
Father!

433
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,880
My husband and I will ride the horse to the market.

434
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:14,880
We can just get a carriage.

435
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,880
Why do you have to go on a trip?

436
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,880
It takes a long time to get there.

437
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,880
We can get used to it with a carriage.

438
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,880
In the past,

439
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:28,880
I didn't understand your hard work.

440
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,880
It's all my fault.

441
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,880
I was too ignorant.

442
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:34,880
But don't worry, father.

443
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,880
I will investigate the whole thing in Lingzhou.

444
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,880
I will make it clear to father.

445
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,880
I will make it clear to the Ming family.

446
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,880
Tan Er.

447
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:52,880
The biggest pride of my life

448
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:55,880
is to have a good daughter like you.

449
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,880
I am alone.

450
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:02,880
Be careful.

451
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,880
Don't reveal your identity.

452
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:06,880
Don't worry.

453
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,880
I hope you can stay here for a day.

454
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,880
Now, Mr. Zhang is in danger.

455
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:19,880
We have to get to Lingzhou as soon as possible.

456
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,880
But don't worry, father.

457
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,880
We will be back soon.

458
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:25,880
Yes.

459
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:26,880
I will.

460
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:29,880
I will.

461
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:32,880
Xianxu.

462
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,880
Tan Er has been raised up.

463
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,880
She hasn't been away for a long time.

464
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:41,880
If she makes any mistakes in the future,

465
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,880
don't worry.

466
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:46,880
Don't worry, father.

467
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,880
I won't make any mistakes.

468
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:52,880
If I make any mistakes, it's also someone else's fault.

469
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:53,880
Yes.

470
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:54,880
Father.

471
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,880
You are so wise.

472
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:00,880
Okay.

473
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:01,880
Okay.

474
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:03,880
Father.

475
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,880
Take care.

476
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:12,880
Take care.

477
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,880
The scenery here is different from Shangjing.

478
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,880
The mountains are always in a state of panic.

479
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,880
The scenery is beautiful.

480
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,880
Tan is in a good mood.

481
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:28,880
If I knew it,

482
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,880
I wouldn't have brought my husband's carriage.

483
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,880
And I would have prepared some food and drinks.

484
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,880
And I would have taken a rest.

485
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:36,880
We will have a rest in the river.

486
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:37,880
If it's convenient,

487
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,880
we should buy some necessary things.

488
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:40,880
No matter how hard the journey is,

489
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,880
Tan and my husband can't suffer.

490
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,880
Why don't you talk?

491
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:49,880
What are you thinking about?

492
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,880
I've been thinking about it.

493
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:52,880
When we arrive in Chu,

494
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:56,880
the first thing we should do is to ask Tan to re-sign a contract.

495
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,880
I have a request too.

496
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,880
I want to sign the contract one by one.

497
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:04,880
What is your request?

498
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,880
First, no matter what happens in the future,

499
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:10,880
we should be honest with each other.

500
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,880
There shouldn't be any secrets.

501
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,880
Second, no matter how much you are angry,

502
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,880
you can't ignore me.

503
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,880
You can't ignore me.

504
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:20,880
Third,

505
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:23,880
there is no contract like this.

506
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,880
Tan knows he is wrong.

507
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:29,880
Please forgive me this time.

508
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:33,880
Besides,

509
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,880
the one who doesn't know is innocent.

510
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,880
If you didn't hide anything from Tan,

511
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,880
Tan wouldn't have misunderstood you.

512
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:42,880
It's your fault to follow the rules.

513
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:47,880
Besides, the contract is already torn.

514
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,880
Can't you and Tan

515
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,880
sign a contract forever?

516
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,880
You are interested in Tan.

517
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:56,880
Tan is interested in you.

518
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,880
Why do you still sign a contract?

519
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,880
Tan is right.

520
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:09,880
Eat more.

521
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:10,880
You will gain weight.

522
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:12,880
You will gain weight.

523
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:13,880
Eat more.

524
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:14,880
You will gain weight.

525
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:16,880
You will gain weight.

526
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:18,880
Eat more.

527
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,880
Eat more.

528
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:21,880
Eat more.

529
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:31,880
Miss Yun,

530
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:33,880
it's been two days.

531
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,880
Can we find the place where we can find the brothers?

532
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:39,880
You doubt the king or the master.

533
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:40,880
Don't you believe the king?

534
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:46,880
Miss Yun, I don't mean that.

535
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:48,880
I'm just worried.

536
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:49,880
I can't help asking.

537
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,880
What's the point of worrying?

538
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,880
Can you come back early if you are worried?

539
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:55,880
Well...

540
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:59,880
Miss, I have already fed you.

541
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:00,880
It's not enough.

542
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:01,880
Feed me more.

543
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:03,880
Okay.

544
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,880
Can I buy you a chicken?

545
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:09,880
Sure.

546
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:12,880
Chicken is for money.

547
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,880
But you have to do it yourself.

548
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:16,880
I...

549
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:18,880
I can do it myself.

550
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:23,880
Miss Yun, Miss Yun.

551
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:24,880
It's okay.

552
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:25,880
Let me do it.

553
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:28,880
Here.

554
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,880
Here.

555
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,880
Here.

556
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:49,880
Here.

557
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,880
What's the point of asking for a car?

558
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,880
I can't fight a chicken.

559
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,880
That's what you always say.

560
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,880
You can't fight a chicken.

561
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:14,880
Miss Yun, you are so kind.

562
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,880
It seems that the chicken is used to

563
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:17,880
fight against the enemy.

564
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:18,880
It's just a human.

565
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,880
It's not human.

566
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,880
It's just a human.

567
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,880
The power is important.

568
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,880
If you lose the power in front of the enemy,

569
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,880
you will lose the chicken.

570
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,880
Losing the power is not the same as losing the chicken.

571
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,880
Miss Yun, you are right.

572
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,880
Miss Yun, you mean

573
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,880
I'm not as powerful as the chicken?

574
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:39,880
Yes.

575
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,880
It smells good.

576
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,880
You can't even catch a chicken.

577
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,880
How can you be so good at grilling chicken?

578
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,880
I always see you eating roasted chicken.

579
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:56,880
It's so delicious.

580
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:57,880
It makes me happy.

581
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,880
I learned it from the chef in the family.

582
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,880
But I don't know how it tastes.

583
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,880
I hope it can suit your taste.

584
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:05,880
Yes.

585
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:07,880
It smells good.

586
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:12,880
It's delicious.

587
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:13,880
It's delicious.

588
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:14,880
It's delicious.

589
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:15,880
It's delicious.

590
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:17,880
You can eat now.

591
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:32,880
Here.

592
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:46,880
Here.

593
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:49,880
Here.

594
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:50,880
One more.

595
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,880
You bought this chicken and you cooked it.

596
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:54,880
You can eat it.

597
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,880
You don't have to give me all the good ones.

598
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:00,880
Miss Yun,

599
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,880
I cooked this roasted chicken for you.

600
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:13,880
I mean,

601
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:16,880
it's rare for someone to eat something so delicious.

602
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:20,880
It's like the food in the world is not as good as the roasted chicken you have.

603
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,880
It's really not as good as the roasted chicken you have.

604
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:33,880
It can be said that the roasted chicken you cooked

605
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,880
is the second best in the world.

606
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:40,880
Miss Yun,

607
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:43,880
is the best roasted chicken in your heart

608
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,880
cooked by the prince?

609
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,880
I didn't have anything to eat when I was a kid.

610
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:48,880
I was hungry for days.

611
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,880
But the roasted chicken cooked by the prince saved me.

612
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:01,880
By the way,

613
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:03,880
why are we here?

614
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:07,880
Is the secret recipe of the chef in your mansion

615
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,880
particular about the location?

616
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:14,880
Come with me.

617
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:38,880
Come on.

618
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:08,880
Come on.

619
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:38,880
Come on.

620
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:08,880
Where are we going?

621
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,880
Hurry up, hurry up.

622
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:11,880
It's too late.

623
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,880
No, I can't run anymore.

624
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:16,880
Hurry up, it's really too late.

625
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,880
What are we going to do?

626
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:33,880
Hurry up, hurry up.

627
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:34,880
It's too late.

628
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,880
No, I can't run anymore.

629
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:38,880
You said,

630
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,880
there is no surprise for me

631
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:43,880
that mom and dad are having an affair.

632
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:44,880
I didn't hear.

633
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:46,880
Could it be that the princess has a lot of money

634
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,880
and set it up for you?

635
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:51,880
No, I can't.

636
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:53,880
Kid,

637
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:55,880
if you don't say that you are going,

638
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:56,880
I'm not going.

639
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:59,880
The man said you are not going.

640
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:01,880
He said he would help you regret it for life.

641
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:03,880
I don't even know who that man is.

642
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:04,880
If I meet a man,

643
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,880
I really want to regret it for life.

644
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:10,880
What do you have to be worried about?

645
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:15,880
Let's go.

646
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:16,880
Don't go, you are so old.

647
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,880
Why are you still angry like a child?

648
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:21,880
I am like a child,

649
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:22,880
then what are you like?

650
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:23,880
Old grandpa.

651
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:25,880
Let's go, we'll be there soon.

652
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:30,880
We are here.

653
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:32,880
Where is the man you said?

654
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:46,880
Little girl,

655
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,880
you are so special.

656
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,880
