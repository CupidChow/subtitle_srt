1
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I don't know.

2
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Your niece has been living in this house for a long time.

3
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
She has not only had a son but also a child.

4
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Right?

5
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
What are you saying?

6
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
There are many rumors in the whole of Shangjing.

7
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
How can you believe it?

8
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
My niece used to live in this house.

9
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
But she never had a place to live.

10
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
She has no relatives.

11
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
She has no relatives.

12
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
It's not like she has relatives.

13
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
She has another family.

14
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
She has a child.

15
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
It's all rumors.

16
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Is it a rumor?

17
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Rumors.

18
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Say it again. Is it a rumor?

19
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Yes.

20
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
A few days ago, I found a good wife for my niece.

21
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
She has gone back happily.

22
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
She said she would never come to Shangjing again.

23
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
My Lord, she is the wife of the prime minister.

24
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
How can she be wrong?

25
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
If you are not at ease, I promise you.

26
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I will never accept any concubines.

27
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I have a wife for me.

28
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
My Lord.

29
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
My Lord.

30
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
My Lord.

31
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Aunt.

32
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Aunt.

33
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
My Lord.

34
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
What did I do wrong?

35
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Why did you treat me like this?

36
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
It was not a good idea.

37
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
If the daughter of the Ming family comes in,

38
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
my uncle will take me as his wife.

39
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
He will make me a daughter of the family.

40
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I am a woman of the family.

41
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Why did you marry me to Zhuang Teng?

42
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
You are so cruel.

43
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
My Lord.

44
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
As you ordered, Zhu'er has made a scene outside the palace.

45
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
You have a backer.

46
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
You are a backer.

47
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I can't leave them alone if they want to marry me.

48
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
How should we settle Zhu'er and her son?

49
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Please tell me.

50
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
We can't afford to lose them.

51
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
We need to find someone to send them away.

52
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Listen.

53
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
What else do you want to say?

54
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Speak.

55
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
My Lord.

56
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
My Lord.

57
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Get out.

58
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
My Lord.

59
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
You are so rude.

60
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
My Lord.

61
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
How dare you think of my daughter?

62
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Dream on.

63
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
You have to leave this marriage.

64
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
You have to leave this marriage.

65
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
My Lord.

66
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
My Lord.

67
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
My Lord.

68
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Oh no.

69
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
It's over.

70
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
My Lord.

71
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
You want to talk to me?

72
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
My Lord.

73
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Yihua.

74
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
It's been years.

75
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Tan'er has been out of the prison.

76
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Madam.

77
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
You are blessed.

78
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I am very happy.

79
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I am far away from the border.

80
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I am in the state of Zhao.

81
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I almost lost Tan'er's life.

82
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I am so ashamed.

83
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I can't even ask for forgiveness.

84
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Madam.

85
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Don't worry.

86
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Now that I am back in Shangjing.

87
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I will do everything for Tan'er's marriage.

88
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I will choose a good husband for her.

89
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I will choose a good husband for her.

90
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
The marriage between the two families is not yet over.

91
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
The Marquis of Jing'an is in charge of the army.

92
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
The marriage will be over.

93
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Someone will be in trouble.

94
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
You can't even make a decision after destroying one marriage.

95
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Or you have arranged a better marriage for Miss Ming?

96
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Jiang Qizhi.

97
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
What do you mean?

98
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
The Empress has arranged for Ayu's marriage.

99
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
It's hard for us to know.

100
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Lu Ting is too affectionate.

101
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Am I the unlucky one?

102
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
You can't marry me.

103
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Why can't you?

104
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Zhu'er is so naughty today.

105
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,000
What else can I do in Shangjing?

106
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
No, no.

107
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Tan'er, fame is just a thing.

108
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
You can't think of anything else.

109
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Mingming.

110
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
In this big Shangjing.

111
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Who else can marry me?

112
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
This is the son of the Empress.

113
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
It was originally for the Princess to choose her husband.

114
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
This time I must be in front of the Empress Dowager.

115
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
To give the marriage to the Ming family.

116
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
The marriage of the Ming family is not easy.

117
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
The Su family is in a difficult situation.

118
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
You can't just get married for the Ming family.

119
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
The son of the An family's heir, Wen Hao.

120
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
How is it?

121
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Not good.

122
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Cuiwei.

123
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Not good.

124
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
The Censor of the Court.

125
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
The Censor of the Court.

126
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
The Censor of the Court.

127
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Your Majesty.

128
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I will be honest.

129
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
The daughter of the Ming family is very smart.

130
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
She is very skilled.

131
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
She is very good at acting.

132
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
After these officials.

133
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
She can't be controlled.

134
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
After the general?

135
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
What else can I do?

136
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
This is the daughter of the Empress.

137
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
The one who chose you as the Princess.

138
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
The marriage of the Ming family is not easy.

139
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
What's wrong with your marriage?

140
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I don't mean to force you to get married.

141
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
But if you don't choose her.

142
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
The Empress Dowager will give you and Fengzhao the marriage.

143
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
The Su family can't be my master.

144
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
You and the Marquis Jing An are all important soldiers.

145
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
The Su family can't be spared.

146
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I will marry the daughter of the Ming family.

147
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
What?

148
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I will marry her.

149
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
It is indeed a good plan.

150
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
It is indeed a good plan.

151
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Ah Xu.

152
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
You like her.

153
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Don't you?

154
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Ah Xu.

155
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
You like the daughter of the Ming family.

156
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
It is not a big deal.

157
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Then you are...

158
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I will not be able to bear it.

159
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I will not be able to bear it.

160
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Let us go.

161
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,500
Lady produced by the Ming family.

162
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,280
I go.

163
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:17,720
Prime Minister.

164
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,360
The investigation of the other country's palace has been completed.

165
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,960
I have replaced all the people involved in the investigation

166
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,560
in the accounts of the other states.

167
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,440
I am sure that it will not involve anyone else.

168
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,960
Liang Qiwei's family is 3000 miles away.

169
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,720
Please spare his life.

170
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,880
He is a kind man.

171
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,520
The military supply has been cut off.

172
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,120
But Prince Dingbei has promised to find the person who kidnapped him.

173
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:53,200
He has been investigating the corruption of the military.

174
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,640
Prince Dingbei will not be able to do anything.

175
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,680
He will not give up.

176
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,840
The one who kidnapped him is Gu Jinzhong.

177
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,240
He will be suspected of breaking out of the palace.

178
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,480
You should warn him.

179
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,720
Liang Qiwei is the one who is the scapegoat.

180
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,440
You should warn him.

181
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,680
He must be cleared of all the corruption.

182
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,640
Don't let anyone catch him.

183
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,040
Yes.

184
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,440
Gu Jinzhong has been involved in corruption.

185
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,240
I have already made a clear statement.

186
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,480
Prince Dingbei will not be able to find out anything.

187
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,240
As I expected,

188
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,520
the people involved in the investigation

189
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,400
are looking for a way to get their own house.

190
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,480
The Empress Dowager has also called Prime Minister to the palace

191
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,520
to discuss the matter.

192
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,960
What is the way of those families?

193
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,160
Keep an eye on them.

194
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,400
Yes.

195
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,200
Is there anything wrong with the House of Duke of Jing'an?

196
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,880
Everything is fine.

197
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,480
Today, many invitations have been sent to the House of Duke.

198
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:53,400
But Duke of Jing'an doesn't seem to like this.

199
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:54,880
I haven't seen any of them.

200
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,040
But today,

201
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,920
Prime Minister and his wife have come to the palace to meet their daughter.

202
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,720
They are having a good time.

203
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:13,840
I will not let go of Duke of Jing'an.

204
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:17,760
He came to the palace to get married.

205
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,000
It was really unexpected.

206
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,040
We got married in time.

207
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,080
We didn't have to face any trouble.

208
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:34,000
Tan'er is a good girl.

209
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,440
You will find a good husband in the future.

210
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:42,400
You said it in the letter.

211
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:45,640
The Liang family has been a noble family for generations.

212
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:49,000
How did Liang Zixuan become a famous and successful man?

213
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,200
But in the end, he was just pretending.

214
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:54,920
You are really bad at acting.

215
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:55,440
I...

216
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,800
Do you know that Yuan Ye...

217
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,600
Father, Tan'er is fine now.

218
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,280
Let bygones be bygones.

219
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,480
Besides,

220
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,000
he has been away from Shangjing for so many years.

221
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,960
But thanks to his aunt's care for Tan'er.

222
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:12,920
Father has been deceived by the Liang family.

223
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:13,680
He?

224
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:15,840
Father, don't blame me.

225
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,520
Father is just a little bit careless.

226
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:21,400
I don't know about his temper.

227
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,240
I can understand him.

228
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,920
You are too sensible.

229
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,840
If you tell me about the water fall,

230
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,560
I will kill Liang Zixuan.

231
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,240
You are so sweet.

232
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,800
What did you do with the money?

233
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,360
You are so stingy.

234
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,400
Father.

235
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,220
acaksın

236
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:11,400
The winner of the Chinese LaFang Championship is...

237
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,400
I'll finish first.

238
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,400
I'll hold the game first.

239
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,920
I'll hold the game first.

240
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:20,920
Why are you...

241
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,400
She's my daughter.

242
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,400
Tan'er is also my daughter.

243
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,400
Why don't you say something?

244
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,400
When did you say something?

245
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,400
Get out and practice.

246
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,800
I'm sure he can do it.

247
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,600
You're a martial artist and I'm a civil servant.

248
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,600
I won't fall for your trick.

249
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,800
You dare not.

250
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,800
Tan'er is thoughtful.

251
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,800
I'm worried about him.

252
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,800
It's good to have some pigeon soup.

253
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,800
Be careful.

254
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,800
Be good.

255
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,800
Tan'er,

256
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,800
I'll let you and your father enter the palace.

257
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,800
Please take care of the family in the family.

258
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,800
I'll think about it with you.

259
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,800
Thank you for your concern.

260
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I'm worried about Tan'er.

261
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
But Tan'er has decided to go to the temple.

262
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
He can pray for 49 days.

263
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
He can also rest in peace.

264
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
That's good.

265
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
You say.

266
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Tan'er,

267
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
although you're married,

268
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
you'll be discussed in Shangjing.

269
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Go out and have a good time.

270
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
The Marquis's mansion has prepared five carts.

271
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
They're going to send Miss Ming to pray in Hanyan Temple.

272
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Five carts?

273
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I've checked.

274
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
They're all of Miss Ming's clothes, shoes,

275
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
jewelry,

276
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
sandals, incense, stove and other things.

277
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
He's planning to live in Hanyan Temple.

278
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
He's going to live in Hanyan Temple.

279
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Miss,

280
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,200
the Marquis said he'll send you tomorrow morning.

281
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,200
Why are you leaving tonight?

282
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,200
If I leave tomorrow morning,

283
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,200
the one in the silver house will take advantage of it.

284
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,200
Instead of being humiliated,

285
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,200
I'll leave first.

286
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,200
It's reasonable.

287
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,200
Greetings, Master.

288
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,200
You're in the temple for a rest.

289
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,200
You just need to bring some things with you.

290
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,200
These are my things.

291
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,200
During the rest,

292
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,200
you can come to me for anything.

293
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,200
I'll be waiting for you.

294
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,200
This is...

295
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,200
The people in the temple are all wearing this.

296
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,200
You don't need to worry.

297
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,200
The clothes are all clean.

298
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,200
You can take a rest after you get out of the temple.

299
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,200
I won't disturb you.

300
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:27,200
How can this be clean?

301
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,200
Look.

302
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,400
The clothes are wide and long.

303
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,400
There's no waist.

304
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,400
The color and material are also...

305
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,400
The third class maids in our house

306
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,400
are wearing more clothes than this.

307
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,400
How can you get up from this?

308
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,400
If it wasn't for the beads,

309
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,400
you wouldn't have to suffer.

310
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,400
Forget it.

311
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,400
The Buddha's teachings are simple and simple.

312
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,400
All the people know it.

313
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,400
Moreover, Qingxiu is a sacred place.

314
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,400
It's a sacred place.

315
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,400
It's a sacred place.

316
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,600
Qingxiu is my place.

317
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,600
I can't blame anyone else.

318
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:07,600
I can only blame myself for being unlucky.

319
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,600
I'm always the one who's unlucky.

320
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,600
Speaking of which,

321
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,600
every time you're not happy,

322
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,600
it's all because of her.

323
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,600
Last time, when the temple was in danger,

324
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,600
she...

325
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,600
She was also the one who was

326
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,600
confused with the evidence.

327
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,600
My Lady!

328
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,600
Did you do something to me?

329
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,600
You're right.

330
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,600
Let's stay here for a while.

331
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,600
I'll wait outside.

332
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,600
I'll come back after you're done.

333
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,600
The hall is always the same.

334
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,600
The servants are all the same.

335
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,600
The rules are the same.

336
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,800
I'm not hungry yet.

337
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,800
Sit down.

338
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,800
I have it.

339
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,800
It's said that the rice from the temple

340
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,800
is very delicious.

341
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,800
That's why I chose Qingxiu.

342
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,800
Taste it.

343
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
How is it?

344
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
My Lady,

345
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
is there a misunderstanding?

346
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
The relationship between

347
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
the rice and the deliciousness

348
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
is not that great.

349
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
My Lady,

350
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
the farming nearby is not lacking in vegetables.

351
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Why don't I prepare another meal for you?

352
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
No!

353
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
If you're only a servant,

354
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
how can you be considered as Qingxiu?

355
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Although this is a very simple task,

356
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I'm sure you can do it.

357
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I'm not considered as Qingxiu.

358
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Although the rice is not as good as the cooking,

359
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
the taste is not bad.

360
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
The rice is also very delicious.

361
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
The Buddha's heart is very kind.

362
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
It's very meaningful.

363
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
The rice is very thick.

364
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
It's a reminder to us.

365
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Since we've already prepared the meal,

366
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
let's take it as a reminder to us.

367
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
If you can't eat it,

368
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
you can also not force yourself.

369
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Amitabha!

370
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
My Lady,

371
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I can't eat the rice.

372
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
My Lady, she...

373
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
The two masters are talking non-stop.

374
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
They are disturbing the peace.

375
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I'm sorry for the inconvenience.

376
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Please stay and clean the hall.

377
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Little Master,

378
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I have a small appetite.

379
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I'll just prepare the food.

380
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
If so,

381
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
you can go to the small hall and wake up.

382
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I have to kneel down to eat the food.

383
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Where am I?

384
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
So many Buddha's halls.

385
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Where exactly is the small hall?

386
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
It's in the heart of the city.

387
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
It should be in every place.

388
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I didn't expect you to remember this place.

389
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
This is where Your Majesty and I used to sneak out.

390
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I won't forget it.

391
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
You came to the military camp.

392
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
You should have at least pretended to be a soldier.

393
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Why did you do this?

394
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I'm not good at acting.

395
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
The military camp is just the beginning.

396
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
With your help,

397
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
I can defeat the evil and clear the court.

398
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I came back to the capital to get back the military funds.

399
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I have to pay you back

400
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
for the military funds.

401
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I'm sorry.

402
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
I'm sorry.

403
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
I didn't know you were a soldier.

404
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
You should be thankful.

405
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
You've entered the army,

406
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
and you have to accompany me until the end.

407
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
You shouldn't just leave the army.

408
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I've been in the army for ten years.

409
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
The army of the Su family

410
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
is still as strong as the previous officers.

411
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
They are very ambitious.

412
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
They are very hard to defeat.

413
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
However,

414
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
they have a lot of power.

415
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Only the Prime Minister

416
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
can kill Your Majesty.

417
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:46,000
You wanted to Schwar Madam 말씀 about your memang in the room before I arrived

418
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,280
When at last, the dispute on是of any 120 days

419
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,240
That date.

420
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:52,080
Won't leave either brother-in-law no

421
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,680
All the soldiers, gather in waiting

422
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,380
I👽

423
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:58,100
That day.

424
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,580
Tell that to brother-in-law

425
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:02,120
before coming

426
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,540
Xiao

427
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:05,500
oh

428
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:07,040
That day impact

429
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:09,040
I'm afraid that you can't keep up with the new order.

430
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:12,040
I'll allow you to execute the order today.

431
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:15,040
In the future, if you make any trouble,

432
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:17,040
I'll help you.

433
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:25,040
I think this is a wrong move.

434
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:29,040
The army's duty is to be followed.

435
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:32,040
The subject's duty is to be followed.

436
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:35,040
The one who knows me is also Ah Xu.

437
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:45,040
Buddha, I'm Ataan from the Ming family.

438
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:49,040
I'm a delicate and delicate person.

439
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:54,040
I'm not used to eating in public.

440
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:57,040
I regret eating in public.

441
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:00,040
Please forgive me.

442
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:05,040
I'm sorry.

443
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:11,040
Buddha, I'm Ataan from the Ming family.

444
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:14,040
I'm a delicate and delicate person.

445
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:17,040
I'm not used to eating in public.

446
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:20,040
I'm not used to eating in public.

447
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:23,040
I'm a delicate and delicate person.

448
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:26,040
I'm not used to eating in public.

449
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:29,040
I'm a delicate and delicate person.

450
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:32,040
I'm a delicate and delicate person.

451
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:35,040
Take a look at the fruits..

452
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:37,040
They're fresh books.

453
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,360
They've grown well.

454
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:40,960
If the birds sing those glories,

455
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,040
it will be a blessing.

456
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:47,040
When the day falls into the garden's пробicals,

457
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:49,980
insects and lived things should blossom,

458
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:52,040
a message from the writer.

459
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:54,040
End of the story.

460
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,040
In that case...

461
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:57,040
Oh, my wasps...

462
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,040
Of course!

463
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,040
Isn't it?

464
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,600
Do you develop things?

465
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,240
My sound...

466
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:15,600
count, too, if it's born on the spot.

467
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:19,120
You MP3 player of this year?

468
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,680
Who's she?

469
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,320
Am I in good hands?

470
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,360
Are you serious?

471
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:47,860
The

472
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:59,160
I will burn the ashes on the paper.

473
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:02,160
If I can find such a good husband,

474
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:06,160
I will pray for Buddha and live in heaven.

475
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:11,160
This woman is really unquestionable.

476
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:16,160
Her standards are too high.

477
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:20,160
There is no perfect husband in the world.

478
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:23,160
You are right about her.

479
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:26,960
Those people can't control her.

480
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,960
Fortunately, you have taken her away.

481
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,960
I didn't mean that.

482
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,960
I just...

483
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,960
I just...

484
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,960
I will ask for your permission another day.

485
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,960
Why don't you get down?

486
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,960
You haven't decided the winner or loser.

487
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,960
Before the death of Wu Xianwei,

488
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,960
he was not admitted to the court.

489
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,960
But he was used by Marquis Chengen.

490
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,960
It's useless.

491
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,960
I told my men to keep an eye on him.

492
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,960
But they didn't.

493
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,960
Gu Wenyan is the son of Gu Jinzhong.

494
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,960
There is a big problem.

495
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,960
Gu Jinzhong has only one son.

496
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,960
Yes.

497
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,960
He is poor and poor.

498
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,960
He is in danger.

499
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,960
He is not a good son.

500
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,760
He is the fourth son.

501
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,760
He is popular.

502
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,760
Many students are jealous.

503
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,760
Let Shen Yu meet him.

504
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:39,760
General Shen sent Zhu'er and her son to Yuanji.

505
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,760
They will return to the city at night.

506
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,760
Zhu'er and Yuanji are not far from here.

507
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,760
He will be back in two days.

508
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,760
Why did he come back so late?

509
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:52,560
I don't know.

510
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,560
Tan.

511
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,560
Shen Yu?

512
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,560
Why are you here?

513
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,560
I went to the tea house today.

514
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:02,560
I heard that you have been married off.

515
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,560
And you came to Hanyan Temple.

516
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,560
So I came here.

517
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:09,560
Why did you come here?

518
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,560
I came to tell you.

519
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:16,560
I have been a fan of you.

520
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:19,560
But you were engaged to Liang family.

521
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:22,360
We are strangers.

522
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,360
Now you are married off.

523
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,360
Why don't you marry me?

524
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:30,360
After the war, you are the fourth general.

525
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,360
Although you are still a daughter of the Marquis.

526
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:36,360
I will make more contributions to you.

527
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,360
You are a brave general.

528
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,360
You are a good man.

529
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:46,360
You are...

530
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,360
Do you know what you are saying?

531
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,360
What are you doing?

532
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,360
I...

533
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,360
I am proposing to you.

534
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,360
You are not here to propose.

535
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,360
You are here to make me a father.

536
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:06,360
You should know the rules of marriage.

537
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,360
If I agree to your proposal,

538
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:10,360
you will be happy.

539
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:12,360
You will be happy.

540
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,360
You will be happy.

541
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:16,360
You will be happy.

542
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:18,360
You will be happy.

543
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,160
I...

544
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,160
You know I came here to avoid the storm.

545
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:26,160
You should know that I am very strict.

546
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,160
If you are not careful,

547
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,160
you will not come here.

548
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,160
You will be dead.

549
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:34,160
You...

550
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:36,160
I am rude.

551
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,160
But I...

552
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,160
You are rude.

553
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,160
Please leave.

554
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,160
We never met.

555
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:45,160
We never proposed.

556
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,960
I am not interested in you.

557
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,960
I will never marry you.

558
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:52,960
Please forget about it.

559
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:55,960
Miss.

560
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:56,960
Miss.

561
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,960
Why are you here?

562
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,960
We went to the temple and didn't see you.

563
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,960
You scared us.

564
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,960
Young master.

565
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,960
Go back to the room.

566
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,760
Okay.

567
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,760
Let her go back to the room.

568
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:16,760
See you soon.

569
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,760
Yes.

570
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:31,760
Chu Chu.

571
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,760
Where are you going?

572
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,760
I am going to practice.

573
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,760
I am going to play with father.

574
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,560
You are not a daughter.

575
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,560
How can you play with father?

576
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:44,560
You are not as beautiful as the other girls.

577
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:48,560
But my daughter is beautiful and cheerful.

578
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,560
She is the only one in the capital.

579
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:55,560
I told your father to teach you to be a good daughter.

580
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,560
You should learn the rules.

581
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,560
You should be a daughter.

582
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:02,560
The marriage is going to be a big problem.

583
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,560
Who dares to play with our family?

584
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,560
You...

585
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,360
Miss.

586
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,360
Really?

587
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,360
Where are you going?

588
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:18,360
I am not finished.

589
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,360
Cousin.

590
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,360
You are like my cousin.

591
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,360
Have you forgotten?

592
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,360
You are my cousin.

593
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:38,160
Why are you still here?

594
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,160
Why are you so quiet?

595
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,160
I am not a ghost.

596
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,160
Why are you hiding?

597
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,160
You are here to see sister, right?

598
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:48,160
She just got married.

599
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:50,160
She is going to the temple.

600
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,160
I am here to see you.

601
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:54,160
You accepted me.

602
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:56,160
You recommended me to the army.

603
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:58,160
Now you are back.

604
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,160
I should come to visit you.

605
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,160
Why are you so stubborn?

606
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:04,160
We are playing together.

607
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,960
I like you.

608
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,960
Now you are back.

609
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,960
It's a good time for you to meet your uncle.

610
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,960
You are so kind.

611
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,960
It's not a bad thing.

612
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:20,960
You are young and you are a good girl.

613
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,960
You are a good match for me.

614
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,960
You and I are not in love.

615
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:38,960
A woman wants to open up to you.

616
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,960
This is because she isistic.

617
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:50,960
Love is not about the respect.

618
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,960
If you want to marry her,

619
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,960
you can ask Prince.

620
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,960
Prince will get you married.

621
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:00,960
Don't think too much.

622
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,960
I am a princess.

623
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:06,340
Can we see him clearly?

624
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:23,200
Your Highness!

625
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:27,300
Your Highness, I've Maya and Naliches

626
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:29,720
How can I help help you?

627
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:32,720
0

628
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:35,720
0

629
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:40,720
0

630
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:43,720
0

631
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:46,720
0

632
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:49,720
0

633
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:52,720
0

634
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:55,720
0

635
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:58,720
0

636
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:05,720
Go clean up the salt factory and clear the horse dung in the stable.

637
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:06,720
Yes, sir.

638
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:09,720
Come back.

639
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,720
There is a son named Gu Wenyan in Chengen.

640
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,720
Send someone to keep an eye on him.

641
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:16,720
Yes, sir.

642
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:19,720
Then...

643
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:21,720
Horse dung...

644
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:22,720
Go after clearing it.

645
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,720
Yes, sir.

646
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:29,720
Horse dung...

647
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:38,720
Sir, if I have a new lover one day,

648
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:41,720
can you grant me a marriage?

649
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,720
As long as it's not Miss Ming,

650
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:49,720
I can do anything for you.

651
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:53,720
Why?

652
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:57,720
I don't need a subordinate who is always with his children.

653
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:58,720
I don't want to.

654
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:02,720
You lied to me because you wanted to see him.

655
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:07,720
How could I know you wouldn't be like him?

656
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:08,720
I...

657
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,720
Go and clean up the stable.

658
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:11,720
Go clean up the stable.

659
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:12,720
Yes, sir.

660
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,720
Greetings, Your Highness.

661
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:33,720
You entered the palace early in the morning.

662
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:36,720
Is it for the marriage of Miss Ming?

663
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:37,720
Yes.

664
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:38,720
In recent years,

665
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:43,720
the Su family's business and connections have been replaced by many.

666
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:45,720
There is no one to rely on in the army.

667
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,720
As usual,

668
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:50,720
the Su family is always in power.

669
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:51,720
Yes, sir.

670
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,720
I am the only one who can rely on.

671
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:54,720
As usual,

672
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:58,720
the Su family is always in power.

673
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,720
I was the only daughter of Mingtan.

674
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:03,720
I did it for today.

675
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:05,720
After my brother came,

676
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:08,720
I was always paying attention to the selection.

677
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,720
As long as you agree,

678
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:13,720
I will grant you the marriage.

679
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:15,720
As for Prince Dingbei,

680
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,720
before he went to the north,

681
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:21,720
he was unwilling to grant her the marriage.

682
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,720
Now,

683
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,720
it is time.

684
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:29,720
It is good if you can marry him.

685
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,720
But your temperament...

686
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:33,720
The big picture is important.

687
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,720
I can't let him do it.

688
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:36,720
Yes.

689
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,720
With the Empress Dowager's marriage,

690
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:41,720
Prince Dingbei would not have refused.

691
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:43,720
But the marriage is in short supply.

692
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,720
It should be done before His Majesty.

693
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:46,720
I am sure.

694
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,720
Especially the marriage of the Ming family.

695
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,720
All the members of the Liang family

696
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:55,720
have been in the same boat.

697
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:58,720
We have been in a bad situation.

698
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,720
I heard that Prince Dingbei

699
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,720
checked the money himself.

700
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,720
That's why the Liang family is in trouble.

701
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:05,720
I think

702
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,720
he is not as useless as you said.

703
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,720
At least he is brave.

704
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:14,720
Tan,

705
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,720
I have been eating this cake for days.

706
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:17,720
Why don't you eat?

707
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,720
I think you are right.

708
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,720
Father and Father

709
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,720
will be with me.

710
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,720
After I leave,

711
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,720
I will have someone else.

712
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,720
You have to choose one.

713
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:34,720
Unless I can get married before the second father.

714
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:38,720
Which son do you want to marry?

715
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,720
We are in the daughter's family.

716
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,720
If we don't get permission from our parents,

717
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,720
we will have to meet each other.

718
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,720
We don't have to consider the details.

719
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,720
If we don't get the chance,

720
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,720
we will go to the second son's house.

721
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,720
We will go to the second son's house.

722
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,720
I have chosen the place.

723
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:57,720
The best place is the Wen Tao Pavilion.

724
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:59,720
But we have to go to the first son's house.

725
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:00,720
Tan,

726
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,720
will you be interested in

727
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,720
going to the second son's house tomorrow?

728
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,720
The second son?

729
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,720
You are interested in him too?

730
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,720
Don't interrupt.

731
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,720
I only admire the second son.

732
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,720
I am interested in you.

733
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:18,720
You will be the leader and the leader of the family.

734
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:21,720
Maybe the second son will marry you.

735
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,720
I won't go.

736
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,720
You won't go?

737
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:29,720
You will be embarrassed.

738
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,720
You will lose your identity.

739
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:35,720
Tu Jia?

740
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,720
You...

741
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,720
You can't be afraid of Tan.

742
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:41,720
Brother-in-law,

743
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,720
I was just guessing.

744
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,720
Why are you so angry?

745
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:46,720
Think about it.

746
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,720
The marriage is not going well.

747
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:49,720
Tan has been married for a few days.

748
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,720
Aren't you afraid that he will be upset?

749
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:53,720
That's not a good thing.

750
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:55,720
There are so many good sons in Shangjing.

751
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:57,720
We can find another one.

752
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:59,720
Tan is so talented.

753
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:01,720
He can't marry you.

754
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,720
Wait.

755
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:07,720
I will go.

756
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:15,720
Tan,

757
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,720
you are not going to the temple?

758
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:19,720
Where is Tan?

759
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:20,720
My lord,

760
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,720
Miss Xiaoxiao and Miss Mi Mi...

761
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,720
Miss Xiaoxiao and Miss Mi Mi have not seen each other for a long time.

762
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,720
They are meeting in Wen Tao Pavilion to talk.

763
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,720
Talk?

764
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,720
You are late.

765
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,720
There is only this place left.

766
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,720
It's okay.

767
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,720
This is the right place.

768
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:39,720
Tan, let's go.

769
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,720
I told you.

770
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:49,720
Tan can't marry you because of such a small matter.

771
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:51,720
Brother-in-law, come here.

772
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:52,720
What's wrong?

773
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,720
I want to ask you.

774
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:57,720
Can you manage Tan's marriage alone?

775
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:01,720
I know your worries.

776
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:05,720
Do you know that the Empress Dowager and His Majesty have been calling me to the palace?

777
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:07,720
It seems to be a good thing.

778
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:10,720
But in reality, they are going to marry.

779
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:15,720
The Empress Dowager has given up the title of Princess Consort and Prince Consort.

780
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:17,720
She wants me to choose.

781
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:21,720
But these two people,

782
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:24,720
they are not as talented as Liang Zixuan.

783
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,720
Not to mention Tan,

784
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,720
I can't even look at them.

785
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:32,720
The Empress Dowager means the Prime Minister.

786
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:37,720
The Empress Dowager's marriage is just to get you married to the Prime Minister.

787
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:41,720
After the Liang family, they have their own people to choose from.

788
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:43,720
After all, they are not real women.

789
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:46,720
If they think for Tan, they will be in danger.

790
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,720
I am the one who is in danger.

791
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,720
The Emperor is the one who is in danger.

792
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,720
If Tan marries,

793
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:55,720
I will be the one who will be filial to him.

794
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:57,720
Brother-in-law, you are too simple.

795
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:59,720
You think so, but others may not.

796
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:02,720
The Emperor may not.

797
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,720
I don't care what others think.

798
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:07,720
I am a man of integrity and I have no qualms.

799
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:11,720
Although it is just to get married,

800
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:13,720
if Tan marries,

801
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:15,720
I will not agree to it,

802
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:18,720
whether it is the Empress Dowager or the Emperor.

803
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:19,720
Yes.

804
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:23,720
My Lord, someone has sent a message.

805
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:25,720
They said that His Majesty is calling you.

806
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:28,720
Please.

807
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:31,720
Please enjoy.

808
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:33,720
Thank you.

809
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:37,720
Tan.

810
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,720
How do I look today?

811
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:45,720
You look beautiful.

812
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:47,720
I am glad.

813
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:49,720
I am glad too.

814
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:56,720
Come.

815
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:58,720
Come.

816
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:09,720
Tan.

817
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:10,720
What is it?

818
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:12,720
That is Mr. Shua.

819
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,720
Mr. Shua.

820
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,720
Mr. Shua.

821
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:18,720
Look at his appearance.

822
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,720
His temperament.

823
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:23,720
A man is like a man.

824
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:25,720
He is as rough as a stone.

825
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:26,720
He is as strong as a devil.

826
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:28,720
That is it.

827
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:31,720
Mr. Shua is handsome and handsome.

828
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:33,720
He deserves it.

829
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:35,720
Mr. Shua.

830
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:40,720
Only a man like Mr. Shua can be in the eyes of the Princess.

831
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:44,720
Mr. Shua was looking at me.

832
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:45,720
He smiled.

833
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:47,720
I think he saw the Princess.

834
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:51,720
Mr. Shua is handsome and handsome.

835
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:53,720
The Emperor is a man of integrity.

836
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:54,720
He is a man of integrity.

837
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:57,720
The Princess and he are friends.

838
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:00,720
Why don't you ask the Empress Dowager to grant you a marriage?

839
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:05,720
You don't have the right to talk about my marriage.

840
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:08,720
Don't say that.

841
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:13,720
I don't know why the Empress Dowager wants to grant you and Prince of Dingbei a marriage.

842
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:15,720
Prince of Dingbei?

843
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:18,720
They say that the Princess and Prince of Dingbei are always self-righteous.

844
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:22,720
But when they meet Mr. Shua, they don't know what they are.

845
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:25,720
You always say that I am not decent.

846
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:27,720
I think I am much better than them.

847
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:32,720
I wonder what kind of wife he will marry in the future.

848
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:37,720
Our Shua will definitely be picky about the family's appearance.

849
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:40,720
Especially, she needs to know the book and the etiquette.

850
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,720
She needs to know the book and the etiquette.

851
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:45,720
Especially, she needs to know the book and the etiquette.

852
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:48,720
She needs to know the book and the etiquette.

853
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:03,720
It's you again!

854
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:14,720
It's you again!

855
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:44,720
It's you again!

856
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:14,720
It's you again!

857
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:16,720
It's you again!

858
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:18,720
It's you again!

859
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:20,720
It's you again!

860
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:22,720
It's you again!

861
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:24,720
It's you again!

862
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:26,720
It's you again!

863
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:28,720
It's you again!

864
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:30,720
It's you again!

865
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:32,720
It's you again!

866
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:34,720
It's you again!

867
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:36,720
It's you again!

868
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:38,720
It's you again!

869
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:40,720
It's you again!

870
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:42,720
It's you again!

871
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:44,720
It's you again!

872
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:46,720
It's you again!

873
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:48,720
It's you again!

874
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:50,720
It's you again!

875
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:52,720
It's you again!

876
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:54,720
It's you again!

877
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:56,720
It's you again!

878
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:58,720
It's you again!

879
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:00,720
It's you again!

880
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:02,720
It's you again!

881
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:04,720
It's you again!

882
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:06,720
It's you again!

883
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:08,720
It's you again!

884
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:10,720
It's you again!

885
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:12,720
It's you again!

886
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:14,720
It's you again!

887
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:16,720
It's you again!

888
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:18,720
It's you again!

889
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:20,720
It's you again!

890
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:22,720
It's you again!

891
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:24,720
It's you again!

892
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:26,720
It's you again!

893
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:28,720
It's you again!

894
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,720
It's you again!

895
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:32,720
It's you again!

896
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:34,720
It's you again!

897
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:36,720
It's you again!

898
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:38,720
It's you again!

899
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:40,720
It's you again!

900
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:42,720
It's you again!

901
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:44,720
It's you again!

902
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:46,720
It's you again!

903
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:48,720
It's you again!
