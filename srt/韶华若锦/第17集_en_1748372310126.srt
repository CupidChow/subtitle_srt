1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,600
God Da Tang, come quickly!

2
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,800
Why aren't you bringing it?

3
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,760
Tomorrow, you couldn't find it.

4
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,640
Who are you to help us?

5
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,320
Even if you didn't find it,

6
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,880
what's the point of fighting again?

7
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:55,320
Swearing isn't noticed until it gets to the open-ended.

8
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,960
It only changes after the battle,

9
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,960
I've been saving it for 20 years.

10
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,080
On the night of Tan'er's wedding,

11
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,080
we had a good time together.

12
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,840
I didn't want to see you again.

13
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,920
But I've already had a chance to see you.

14
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,960
What are you looking at?

15
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,680
Isn't this the result you wanted?

16
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,560
You're wrong.

17
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,760
I didn't want this result.

18
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,840
But the Su family wanted it.

19
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,560
For the past 20 years,

20
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,560
I've been the only one

21
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,080
who has been taking care of the Su family.

22
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,160
I can't just watch it die.

23
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,520
I can only do my best to solve it

24
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,360
and make a plan for it.

25
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,160
Wait.

26
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,880
You and the Su family?

27
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,360
What's the difference?

28
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,160
All these years,

29
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:11,680
even though you never helped me in the court,

30
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,160
I've always treated you like my own son.

31
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,240
I've always treated you as my daughter.

32
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,240
If I had to choose,

33
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:25,320
I wouldn't want to go this far.

34
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,960
You...

35
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,280
So what?

36
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,680
You're the daughter of the Su family.

37
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,760
You can't compete with the Su family.

38
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,480
You can't.

39
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,160
I'm not going to be a court official tomorrow.

40
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,440
I'm just a man of my word.

41
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,880
Even if I end up like this,

42
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,160
I'm still determined

43
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:58,360
whether it's worth a hurt or not.

44
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:04,560
Another excuse to go is to be a단cap salesman.

45
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,040
Sían is stronger than you can get.

46
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,700
and some of our pineapples to sling them directly.

47
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,960
Should be enough.

48
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,360
Sir,

49
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,680
shall we go now,

50
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:23,640
or go right now?

51
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,340
Sir.

52
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,780
Surf!

53
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,240
Dive.

54
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,280
Go ahead, Marshal.

55
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,040
I have arranged everything.

56
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,040
But...

57
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,040
Wait, wait, wait.

58
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,040
In a while, someone will come to take us from this door.

59
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,040
Remember, you only have one chance.

60
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,040
Prince?

61
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,040
Prince...

62
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:40,040
Today, I must see my father for the last time.

63
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:43,040
If you insist on stopping me, I will kill you.

64
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,040
Tan!

65
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:59,040
When a man is about to die,

66
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:03,040
his words are good.

67
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:06,040
If you listen to me,

68
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:10,040
let go of your obsession,

69
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:13,040
let go of those things that are outside your body.

70
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,040
Maybe the Su family

71
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:20,040
will go further.

72
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:30,040
Do you still have any wishes?

73
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:35,040
I am a man of my word.

74
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:38,040
I will protect the country and the people

75
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:41,040
for the rest of my life.

76
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,040
Now,

77
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:48,040
in this world,

78
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:51,040
I can't let go of anyone.

79
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:55,040
Tan'er has Prince Dingbei to protect him.

80
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:58,040
He will be fine.

81
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:01,040
You said you wanted to marry him.

82
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:04,040
Isn't that what you thought?

83
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,040
Yes.

84
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,040
With Prince,

85
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:11,040
what can't I let go of Tan'er?

86
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:20,040
What I can't let go of until I die

87
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,040
is to protect the country

88
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:25,040
and the people.

89
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,040
My last wish

90
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:31,040
is to marry the people

91
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:34,040
and to kill the evils.

92
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:05,040
Oh, my God!

93
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:34,040
Oh, my God!

94
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:37,040
Oh, my God!

95
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,040
Go and report to the head.

96
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,040
Yes.

97
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,040
Yes.

98
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,040
What happened?

99
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:13,040
My Queen, please go back.

100
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:21,040
Before the moon, Prime Minister Su came alone.

101
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,040
He said he would send the Marquis Jing'an away.

102
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,040
I checked the box and let him in.

103
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,040
I heard the sound and rushed over.

104
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,040
I saw Marquis Jing'an on the ground.

105
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,040
There was still wine on the table.

106
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,040
I think it was a trick to drink.

107
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,040
He suddenly vomited blood.

108
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,040
He had a fever and a fever.

109
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,040
He has a blood clot.

110
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,040
He was poisoned.

111
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,040
Poisoned?

112
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:41,460
Brother-in-law?

113
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:42,460
Tan.

114
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:45,460
Brother-in-law, brother-in-law.

115
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:47,460
Go back first.

116
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:49,460
Tan.

117
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:05,460
Tan.

118
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:07,460
Where is Tan?

119
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:09,460
Tan.

120
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:10,860
Sister- in- law!

121
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:32,020
Ha Dan!

122
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:35,940
Kay!

123
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:36,940
Aye.

124
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:42,780
Aye.

125
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:54,060
Aye.

126
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:56,740
Aye.

127
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,860
I'm so sorry.

128
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:01,860
Ate.

129
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:06,620
Ate.

130
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:10,260
What happened?

131
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:12,860
What happened?

132
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,900
Isn't Qianqian okay?

133
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:24,180
Ate.

134
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:31,860
Ate.

135
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,900
Aye, why are you so cruel?

136
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:59,660
Why are you so cruel?

137
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:01,860
Ate.

138
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:07,300
Why didn't you kill him?

139
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,100
Ate.

140
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:13,260
Ate.

141
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:15,900
Mr. Zhang, the Empress of Jing'an was murdered.

142
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:17,260
We need to check it immediately.

143
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,500
Eunuch Chang, send the Princess back to her mansion.

144
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:21,860
Go.

145
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,300
Ate.

146
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,220
Hurry.

147
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:30,740
Ate.

148
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,100
Take the body to the court.

149
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:48,700
We need to check it immediately.

150
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,060
Yes.

151
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:52,700
There are only Yue Zheng and Xiang Yan in the prison.

152
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,100
Xiang Yan is not related to it.

153
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:56,780
Guards.

154
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,300
Take Su Xiang away.

155
00:12:58,700 --> 00:12:59,700
Keep an eye on her.

156
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:00,780
Yes.

157
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,300
Who dares to touch Bai Xiang?

158
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:09,180
Without any evidence,

159
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:11,980
we can only arrest the Prime Minister of the Tang Dynasty.

160
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:14,540
I'm sorry.

161
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:15,620
I'm sorry.

162
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:16,700
I'm sorry.

163
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:17,780
I'm sorry.

164
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:18,860
I'm sorry.

165
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:23,540
Everyone is tired of living.

166
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,420
Please calm down, Prime Minister.

167
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:31,860
His Highness didn't say you were the murderer.

168
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:34,060
But we haven't found out the truth yet.

169
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:36,060
And you are involved in it.

170
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:38,060
You can't leave without a reason.

171
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:40,540
You need to stay and ask for help.

172
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,220
Please forgive me.

173
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,100
Guards.

174
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:46,060
Go to the court and check the clean room.

175
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:48,060
Please go and take a break.

176
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,420
Yes.

177
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:20,500
The King of the Water Tribe, Bai Suishan,

178
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:22,740
invites you to continue watching.

179
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:29,060
Your Highness.

180
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:30,140
Lord Zhang.

181
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:32,740
The deceased was killed by the fire.

182
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,420
Fill the fire list as soon as possible.

183
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,820
Leave it to the Ministry of Justice.

184
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:36,900
Yes.

185
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:47,180
Lord Zhang.

186
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,700
Although Lord Jing'an is guilty,

187
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,900
he is still my father-in-law.

188
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,860
Even if he can't be buried,

189
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:57,540
I and my wife should do our best

190
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,380
to send him off.

191
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:03,260
Your Highness.

192
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:05,780
Lord Jing'an is guilty.

193
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:07,060
You know that.

194
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,580
According to the law,

195
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:11,140
he is not allowed to return the body to his family.

196
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:14,100
I can't make the decision.

197
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:16,260
I know Lord Zhang is fair.

198
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:17,980
I don't want to make it difficult for you.

199
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:20,580
I've already sent someone to report to His Majesty.

200
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,580
Lord Jing'an

201
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:29,100
has done a great service to the society.

202
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:32,260
He shouldn't have ended up like this.

203
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,900
He should have stayed in this cold place.

204
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:36,980
Your Highness is filial.

205
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:38,420
I'm sorry.

206
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:40,060
It's just...

207
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:41,780
I'll stay here

208
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:43,260
and tell His Majesty

209
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:45,500
what you're worried about.

210
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:50,700
Since you're here,

211
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:52,260
I hope that

212
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:54,620
Lord Jing'an can be buried soon.

213
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,500
Guards.

214
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:57,860
Put Lord Jing'an's body

215
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:59,460
on the carriage outside.

216
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:01,020
Be careful.

217
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,420
Don't touch anything.

218
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,500
Yes.

219
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:16,380
Although the father-in-law is dead,

220
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:18,380
I can't just let him die.

221
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:20,380
I can't just let him die.

222
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:23,540
I hope that the Court of Judicial Review

223
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:25,500
can investigate this case

224
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:27,300
and give Lord Jing'an justice.

225
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:30,780
Don't worry, Your Highness.

226
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:34,300
I will investigate this case thoroughly.

227
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:35,780
But if you're a suspect,

228
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:38,140
you can't be the one to blame.

229
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:40,420
I'm afraid that this case has limited clues

230
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,820
and is hard to prove.

231
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:45,940
So you don't have to worry too much about this case.

232
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,860
As long as it's true,

233
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:51,660
I don't mind waiting for more time.

234
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:55,260
Don't worry, Your Highness.

235
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:58,780
I will investigate this case

236
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:00,220
and even question it.

237
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,900
Here's the imperial edict.

238
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:08,380
I hope that Ming Tingyuan's body will be returned to his family

239
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,100
and be buried with Lord Dingbei.

240
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:12,780
The Court of Judicial Review will investigate the case of Ming Tingyuan.

241
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:14,780
I will not forget it and punish him severely.

242
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:16,740
Yes, Your Highness.

243
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:30,820
My Lady.

244
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:35,460
Please go inside and rest.

245
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:40,060
No need. Tan is still unconscious.

246
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:42,540
He will rest well these days.

247
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:44,100
Besides, he's too sad.

248
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:45,460
He can't stand it.

249
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:46,780
Let him sleep for a while.

250
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:47,860
Don't go inside.

251
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,300
This is for you, My Lady.

252
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:54,620
You've been working hard for the Princess Consort these days.

253
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,220
You haven't had a good rest.

254
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:58,220
I made soup for you.

255
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:59,820
Please have some.

256
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,620
My Lady, don't be too sad.

257
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,980
When the Princess Consort sees you like this,

258
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:05,660
she will be even more sad.

259
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,660
Tan has been waiting for so long

260
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:11,500
that he finally brought his uncle back.

261
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:14,860
But who knew that his father and daughter had just reunited

262
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:17,260
and they would have to face the farewell again?

263
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:18,780
Tan,

264
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:19,980
I'm sorry.

265
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:21,100
I'm sorry.

266
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:22,260
I'm sorry.

267
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:23,340
I'm sorry.

268
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:24,620
I'm sorry.

269
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:25,820
I'm sorry.

270
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:26,900
I'm sorry.

271
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:27,980
I'm sorry.

272
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:29,060
I'm sorry.

273
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:32,580
It's a cooling breeze as powerful as a

274
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,540
emerald haze of love.

275
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:36,580
I feel like I'm gonna cry.

276
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:37,940
What are you doing?

277
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:39,900
You're...

278
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:41,900
For so long.

279
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:46,980
Lately, I've fallen in love with Tan and

280
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,300
One thousand years have passed.

281
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:52,460
But I keep coming to �こと san harus' historian,...

282
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,380
andLeave the situation with only next to her one day.

283
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:57,780
She has fallen in love with me and

284
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:58,980
with my uncle.

285
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:00,340
I'm going to Lingzhou.

286
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:01,860
I'll leave tomorrow.

287
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:05,660
Miss Bai, will you come to see me off tomorrow?

288
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:10,380
Yunyi.

289
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:13,460
Yunyi.

290
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:16,460
Miss, Yunyi doesn't sleep on the roof at night.

291
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:20,860
What's the matter with you calling her Yunyi?

292
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:25,980
What's the matter with you calling her Yunyi?

293
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,980
What's the matter with you calling her Yunyi?

294
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,980
May I ask why you're here?

295
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:42,540
Although we're investigating the details of the Su family's tax evasion,

296
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:44,180
you must be very experienced.

297
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:48,300
You can't investigate like the previous officials.

298
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:51,940
You must find another way to deal with the Su family.

299
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:54,860
They think you're a man of

300
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,620
unrighteousness and can pull the trigger.

301
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:58,500
When they're in their room,

302
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,900
it's your chance to show your true colors.

303
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:12,180
Ayu, Ayu.

304
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:14,460
Are you listening to me?

305
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:16,580
No.

306
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:18,580
Okay, okay, okay. I know, I know.

307
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:20,140
Why are you more cowardly than me?

308
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:22,100
I'm not a man of good manners.

309
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,380
Why are you so rude?

310
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:28,300
Mr. Zhang, if we don't go now, we won't be able to catch the train.

311
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:29,780
Let's go.

312
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:33,700
Let's go.

313
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:51,420
Greetings, Mr. Zhang.

314
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:54,540
Miss Mimi is in the palace with the princess.

315
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:57,020
She asked me to come and see you off.

316
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:00,780
Is there anything she wants to say to me?

317
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:04,500
Zhang Huayu, come back earlier.

318
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,900
I don't want to be involved with your stupid affairs.

319
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:09,660
Is there anything else?

320
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:11,980
There's one more thing.

321
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:14,420
But Miss Mimi's expression is weird.

322
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:16,420
Yunyi really can't learn it.

323
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:18,020
She said...

324
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:19,860
She said...

325
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:24,460
You must come back alive.

326
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:32,620
Thank you, Miss Yun.

327
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:34,580
I have something to say to you.

328
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:36,260
Please tell her on behalf of me.

329
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:43,940
Mimi, wait for me in Shangjing.

330
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:45,980
I will come back safely.

331
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:48,500
I have something important to tell you.

332
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:57,060
Tell her on behalf of me when I come back.

333
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:57,780
Anything else?

334
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:59,780
Please take care of yourself.

335
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:07,380
Take care of yourself.

336
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:10,580
Miss Yun.

337
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:11,580
Miss Yun.

338
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:13,140
Yun...

339
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:14,140
Yun...

340
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:17,340
Mr. Zhang, can you leave?

341
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:18,340
Leave?

342
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:19,940
Leave now.

343
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:22,540
I want to go back quickly.

344
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:45,140
I want to go back quickly.

345
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:16,140
I want to go back quickly.

346
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:18,140
I want to go back quickly.

347
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:49,140
The one who is guilty must not be punished.

348
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:55,140
I have asked someone to go to Hanyan Temple

349
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:57,140
and light the lantern for the moon.

350
00:23:57,140 --> 00:24:00,140
And send the super-poison to the capital.

351
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:03,140
If you want to go to Hanyan Temple to pay respect,

352
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:07,140
I can accompany you to go.

353
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:11,140
No need.

354
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:17,140
The wind blows cold and cold.

355
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:22,140
No need to look back at the past.

356
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:26,140
The tears of the eyes and the wounds of the heart.

357
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:35,140
Looking back, the road is endless.

358
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:38,140
Father is no longer alive.

359
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:42,140
Shangjing is not in the mansion of Duke Jing'an.

360
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:47,140
How many times is it too cold?

361
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:49,140
No matter how many promises are made,

362
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:52,140
Looking back, the road is endless.

363
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:57,140
The night is endless.

364
00:24:57,140 --> 00:25:01,140
How many times is the world of souls?

365
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:05,140
You and I are searching for the truth.

366
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:07,140
I once lost my heart.

367
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:11,140
After the wedding, we need to keep the name of the couple.

368
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:14,140
So I wrote three chapters.

369
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:44,140
This contract is no longer valid.

370
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:47,140
You don't have to write the contract again.

371
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:50,140
You can write it when you have to.

372
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:55,140
I have no choice.

373
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:07,140
Tan.

374
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:12,140
Tan.

375

I'm sorry.

468
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:41,140
Su Nian, Li Ito!

469
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:45,140
Did Atan go back?

470
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:48,140
PosthumSur came to Calab theo from the Tang dynasty.

471
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:49,140
and looked around and picked it up.

472
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:51,140
He said he is going to pray.

473
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:52,140
He won't allow us to come with him.

474
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:54,140
He's given an order to pick him up.

475
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:56,140
However We were too late when we arrived at Calab theo.

476
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:57,140
He left early in the morning.

477
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:01,140
Where canshe go if he's like that?

478
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:05,140
Wait,

479
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:07,140
Would she have to go,

480
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:08,140
impossible

481
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:09,140
I don't know what to do.

482
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:10,140
I can't be with him.

483
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:11,140
I can't.

484
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:12,140
I'm sorry.

485
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:15,140
I know that Tan can't stand it alone.

486
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:17,140
I shouldn't leave.

487
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:20,140
If I stay with him, he won't disappear.

488
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:22,140
It's all my fault.

489
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:24,140
The priority is to find the Princess.

490
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:25,140
We should split up.

491
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:27,140
We should find all the Princesses.

492
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:29,140
Also, go to the capital and inform His Highness.

493
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:30,140
I'll contact the imperial guards.

494
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:32,140
They'll find the Princess.

495
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,140
Don't worry.

496
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:35,140
There's a rain of wind and rain.

497
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:37,140
If anything happens, we'll be sure to find her.

498
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:38,140
I'll contact them.

499
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:40,140
I have news.

500
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:41,140
Come now.

501
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:42,140
Yes.

502
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:47,140
Move!

503
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:03,140
Tan.

504
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:09,140
Tan.

505
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:10,140
Tan.

506
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:12,140
Who are you?

507
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:17,140
Ba Juan.

508
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:19,140
Tan.

509
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:21,140
You must be safe.

510
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,140
Mother.

511
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:25,140
Father is going home today.

512
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:28,140
I want to see him soon.

513
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:30,140
Can we walk faster?

514
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:31,140
Let's see the umbrella.

515
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:32,140
Okay.

516
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:36,140
Father is not here.

517
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:41,140
There's no peace in the capital.

518
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:46,140
No matter how many promises I make,

519
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:52,140
they're useless.

520
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:08,140
Father.

521
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,140
Father.

522
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:08,140
Tan.

523
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:29,140
Tan.

524
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:38,140
Tan.

525
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:43,140
Okay.

526
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:45,140
Still the same.

527
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:46,140
What?

528
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:48,140
They're confident on their release.

529
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:51,140
They passed the tests deliberately.

530
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:53,140
What are they doing now?

531
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:55,140
They said the order is outlaw.

532
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:57,140
What did they do this that day?

533
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:02,140
I'm not going to rest until I find Tan Ye Oguza in Shanghai.

534
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:04,140
I'll be whatever he needs.

535
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:06,140
Okay, wait for my order.

536
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:10,580
I'm relieved that you're going to the Prince of Dingbei's Mansion.

537
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:15,980
Father.

538
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:20,660
I'm not going anywhere tonight.

539
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:24,340
I'm just waiting for you to come home.

540
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:29,100
If you're here,

541
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:33,780
can I draw a picture of you?

542
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:38,220
In this way,

543
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:44,580
I can draw a picture of you.

544
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:07,340
Sir.

545
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:17,260
You do know a reconcile.

546
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:20,460
Sure.

547
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:23,040
Who on earth wouldn't know?

548
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:27,500
Who's innocent?

549
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:29,980
Let's leave now.

550
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:30,340
Okay.

551
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:31,460
Sir,

552
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:33,500
we didn't do anything tragic.

553
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:37,500
I heard that the deceased is very worried.

554
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:42,500
He will come back home and see me the third day after his death.

555
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:46,500
He is the only one who can help me.

556
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:51,500
I am afraid that when he comes back home,

557
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:55,500
he will be alone and can't find me.

558
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:00,500
I am worried about him.

559
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:08,500
I will accompany him to the last stop.

560
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:12,500
I will send him off.

561
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:16,500
If he comes back,

562
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:20,500
I will leave with peace of mind.

563
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:36,500
I am sorry.

564
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:54,500
I am sorry.

565
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:06,500
Actually, I have been wanting to ask you.

566
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:10,500
When we were in love,

567
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:15,500
why did you only take me and Ming Chu?

568
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:19,500
You left me alone,

569
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:22,500
and kept the mansion.

570
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:25,500
All these years,

571
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:28,500
I have been working hard to manage the mansion.

572
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:32,500
I have been working hard to make the mansion the best.

573
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:36,500
I didn't care about anything else.

574
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:40,500
I just wanted to be with my father.

575
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:45,500
I wanted to be with him.

576
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:51,500
I have been waiting for him for all these five years.

577
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:56,500
But when I really see him,

578
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:00,500
I feel so sorry.

579
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:04,500
I don't know where to start.

580
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:09,500
I thought that the days were still long.

581
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:15,500
I still have a lot of time to spend with my father.

582
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:19,500
I want to make up for all the life and regret

583
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:23,500
that we have been through.

584
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:28,500
But how could I imagine

585
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,500
that we would be together

586
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:34,500
before dawn?

587
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:00,500
Your Highness,

588
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:04,500
although I have never seen you,

589
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:08,500
I think you were not in Pianan

590
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:11,500
when you went abroad with your sister.

591
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:15,500
Yunyi,

592
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:18,500
how did you know about this?

593
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,500
His Highness and I have said this before.

594
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:33,500
His Highness has met Prince before he left.

595
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:36,500
He does not want to see his wife

596
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:38,500
because he is afraid that he would be sadder

597
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:40,500
after seeing you.

598
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:42,500
His Highness said that

599
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:45,500
it's better to be apart from one another than to be separated.

600
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,500
His Highness did not want to see his wife

601
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:51,500
because he was afraid that he would be sadder

602
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:54,500
after meeting her.

603
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:56,500
I'm not going to leave you.

604
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:58,500
I'm going to die.

605
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:00,500
My lord, you are the king of all kings.

606
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:02,500
I will protect you.

607
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:04,500
I will make sure you are safe.

608
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:06,500
I will do it as soon as possible.

609
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,500
What else did father say?

610
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,500
My lord, what else did he say?

611
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:14,500
I was a man of the West.

612
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:16,500
I was worried about my son.

613
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:18,500
I was worried about my son.

614
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:20,500
I was worried that I would be a burden to him.

615
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:22,500
My son

616
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:24,500
has been in the South.

617
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:26,500
He has been in the South.

618
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:28,500
If he goes,

619
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:30,500
he will suffer.

620
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:34,500
I thought about it again

621
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:38,500
and decided to

622
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:40,500
take my daughter to the West.

623
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,500
Her son lost his mother.

624
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:48,500
I owe him a lot.

625
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:50,500
I don't know

626
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:52,500
how I can take her to the border

627
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:54,500
to suffer.

628
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:56,500
But since then,

629
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:58,500
I have been away from home.

630
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:02,500
Tan'er is not willing to see me off.

631
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:08,500
I can see that

632
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:12,500
she was disappointed.

633
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:14,500
I am sorry.

634
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:18,500
I am sorry.

635
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:44,500
I am sorry.

636
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:14,500
Prophet

637
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:18,500
Hanzo

638
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:24,500
Prophet

639
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:28,500
A'c安全

640
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:36,500
plötzlich

641
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:38,500
la pas

642
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:40,740
vede

643
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:42,740
And the desserts that you like to eat.

644
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:45,740
When you want to eat them,

645
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:47,740
you can send them to me anytime.

646
00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:48,740
Yes.

647
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:48,740
I put the weight of my weight in your hands.

648
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:52,740
I cut the fate into two parts.

649
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:56,740
Don't worry about my wishes.

650
00:45:56,740 --> 00:46:03,740
I have a long way to go.

651
00:46:11,740 --> 00:46:18,740
I will leave behind the face that will shine in the end.

652
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:27,740
The desire in my hands is in your hands.

653
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:31,740
Fill up my life.

654
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:35,740
Let your voice guide me.

655
00:46:35,740 --> 00:46:42,740
Who is by my side after a long night?

656
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:49,740
Is it too much of a dream or are you afraid?

657
00:46:51,740 --> 00:47:02,740
Don't be afraid, I will go with you.
