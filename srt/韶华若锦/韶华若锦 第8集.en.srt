4
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,880
If I knew it was so dangerous to marry you,

5
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,570
I might as well become a nun.

6
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:45,530
If you are really as wise and mighty

7
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:46,780

just show up.

9
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,860
I don't want to

10

die young.

11
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:12,310
His Majesty granted the marriage.

12
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:13,880
This is the highest honor and favor.

13
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,840
Marquis of Jing'an's Mansion
and Prince of Dingbei's Mansion

Today is the wedding.

00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:23,740
It's full of joy.

18
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:24,850
Anyone who congratulates

19
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:26,190
will be rewarded with money...

20
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:28,190
-Congratulations.
-For good luck.

Is there any news

24
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,370
from His Highness?

25
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,450
Madam of Auspicious Fortune
has been waiting in the backyard

26
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:39,240
for quite some time.

27
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,450
If this continues,

28
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,930
I'm afraid we won't
be able to keep it a secret.

29

Even if we can't, we must.

Today's wedding must
proceed without any mishap.

31
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:50,920
His Majesty personally
bestowed this marriage.

32
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:51,850
What kind of girl

33
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:53,329
could be so fortunate?

34
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:54,200
Indeed.

35
00:02:54,329 --> 00:02:55,520
I heard that on the day of the betrothal,

36
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,630
the Prince of Dingbei made a special effort

37
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:57,680
to add many more gifts.

38
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,960
You should have seen

39
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:00,830
the betrothal gifts.

40
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,890
The Prince of Dingbei's Mansion
is truly exceptional.

41
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:04,360
It's different from

42
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:04,960
ordinary noble families.

43
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,760
Isn't it?

Here's the situation.

00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:10,240
Tan caught a chill

48
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,700
before bed last night.

49
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:12,920
She's not feeling well.

50
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:13,820
Early this morning,

51
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,130
she complained of a severe headache

52
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:16,590
and can't stand any noise.

53
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:17,770
By the way,

54
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:19,520
the ladies are all in the backyard.

55
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,520
Perhaps you could go there first

56
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,890
to have some tea and catch up.

57
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:22,760
-That sounds good.
-Okay.

58

Quickly,

Well,

as Tan's godparents,

72
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,780
you haven't been attentive enough.

73
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:55,520
You've come quite late.

74
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:57,780
When we arrive

75
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,500
isn't important.

Even the best godparents

are still guests.

78

No, no, no.

79
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:04,410
If you say that,

80

I won't be happy.

81

You took care of Tan.

Though I often bicker with you,

00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:15,900
I remember your kindness

If you stopped bickering with me,

88
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:24,210
that would truly be unsettling.

I was turned away.

102

Perhaps we should wait a bit.

you're still a man.

Tan naturally wouldn't want to see you now.

I've been like a mother to Tan for years.

Tan is ill?

What happened to your voice?

Is it a severe cough?

00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:10,110
Fourth Miss,

176
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:12,910
the medicine is ready.

177
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:15,480
You should drink it while it's hot.

178
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,340
It'll help cure the cough faster.

179
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:22,300
Greetings, Your Grace.

180
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:25,770
Fourth Miss, be careful

181
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:27,630
not to pull off the veil.

182
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,320
Earlier, during the face-painting,

183
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,480
Madam of Auspicious Fortune
repeatedly reminded us

184
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,610
that the veil

185
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:34,409
must be removed by you

186
00:07:34,409 --> 00:07:35,970
after bidding farewell to your parents.

187
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:38,700
Otherwise, it's considered
very inauspicious.

188
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:40,290
Your Grace,

189
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:41,680
wouldn't you agree?

190
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,120
Naturally.

191
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:46,710
The custom of veiling the face

192
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:48,580
is meant to bring good luck.

193
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:53,530
Tan,

194
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,210
this is a small token from me.

195
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:58,360
Come,

196
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,880
let me put it on for you.

197
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,480
The auspicious time is near.

198
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,950
You should prepare to depart.

199
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:23,530
I'll go wait in the front hall.

200
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,410
Tan.

201
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:00,490
Didn't we agree

202
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:01,960
I'd see your makeup first?

203
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:02,560
Why did you already

204
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,490
cover your face with the bridal veil?

205
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:04,360
Miss Minmin.

206
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:05,750
This...

207
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,420
Lyu'e?

208
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:10,740
Miss...

209
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:12,490
Miss Minmin.

210
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:12,990
What...

211
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,680
What's going on?

212
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,560
Where is Tan?

213
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,200
Thankfully, Madam of Auspicious Fortune
from the palace

214
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,920
has never seen Fourth Miss before,

215
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,580
Otherwise, this wouldn't
have held up till now.

216
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:26,530
What exactly happened?

217
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:27,460
Where did Tan go?

218
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,010
We don't know.

219
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:36,780
We can only keep it secret
for as long as we can.

220
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,600
What time is it?

221
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,410
My Lord.

222
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:03,070
It's now the auspicious hour.

223
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,720
Wasn't it said that Prince of Rui

224
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,800
would come to escort the bride?

225
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,000
Why isn't he here yet?

226
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:11,050
Yeah.

227
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:13,230
Could something have gone wrong?

228
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:22,410
The auspicious hour has arrived.

229
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:23,960
Why hasn't Tan come out yet

230
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,690
to bid farewell to her parents?

231
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,650
It's...

232
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:28,720
Could it be that you're reluctant
to part with your daughter

233
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,250
and decided to hide her?

234
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,050
How could that be?

235
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:32,960
Hard to say.

236
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,250
The auspicious hour is here.
Begin the bride's ritual.

237
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:47,410
Great!

238
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,370
Chancellor Su, please.

239
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:54,650
Alright.

240
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,440
Spring is the first of seasons,

241
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,440
and filial piety is the foremost of virtues.

242
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:10,600
The precious daughter marries today,

243
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:14,600
bidding farewell with tears to her parents.

244
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:34,890
Tan.

245
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:38,220
Today you are getting married,

246
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:40,620
As your father, my heart is full of comfort.

247
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:42,800
In the days ahead, with the prince,

248
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,920
you must treat each other with respect,

249
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,650
support one another to old age,

250
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:48,200
work as one in both

251
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,490
joy and hardship.

252
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:57,070
That's enough,

253
00:11:58,010 --> 00:12:00,320
Don't delay the auspicious departure time.

254
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,370
Go quickly now.

255
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,490
Tan.

256
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:09,560
Tan.

257
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:13,490
I find it hard to part with you.

258
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,370
After you enter
the Prince of Dingbei's Mansion,

259
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:17,570
do come back to visit our mansion often,

260
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,150
and spend time with me and your godfather.

261
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:21,320
Hurry and go,

262
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,250
the auspicious time is almost over.

263
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:24,050
Tan,

264
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,680
we didn't even get to meet earlier

265
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,130
at Zhaoshui House.

266
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:29,190
Now at your wedding farewell,

267
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,630
surely I

268
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:32,700
should at least have a proper look at you?

269
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,610
One glance, and I'll be at ease.

270
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:37,940
No.

271
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:39,080
How dare you!

272
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,720
Such behavior

273
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,070
shows no respect to your elders.

274
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:47,700
Minmin, don't be rude.

275
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:50,990
Old man, you don't understand.

276
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:52,770
If the bridal veil of a new bride

277
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:54,350
is lifted by someone else,

278
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,120
it's considered unlucky for her marriage.

279
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,530
Isn't that right,
Madam of Auspicious Fortune?

280
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:00,890
It is indeed.

281
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,410
Your Grace's action is rather improper.

282
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,720
My wife and I

283
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,410
have treated Tan as our own.

284
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,080
To take one last look as we send her off,

285
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,320
what's wrong with that?

286
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,170
If there really is any bad luck,

287
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,770
let it all come to me instead.

288
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,600
Go on, then.

289
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,400
Who dares to lift the bridal veil

290
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,370
and ruin my wedding's blessing?

291
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,200
The Prince of Dingbei
has personally come to escort the bride,

292
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,190
as a sign of his deep regard

293
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:33,200
and wish for good fortune.

294
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:50,580
Your Highness, why did you come in person?

295
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:52,010
My humble self and daughter

296
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:53,810
are truly honored beyond words.

297
00:13:57,090 --> 00:13:59,440
Lady Su is my daughter's godmother.

298
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,960
Her reluctance to part is only natural.

299
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:04,100
She may have acted a bit out of line,

300
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,390
I hope Your Highness

301
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:09,270
will not take offense.

302
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:14,150
Since father-in-law has spoken,

303
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,250
I shall obey.

304
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:18,330
Thank you, Your Highness.

305
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:23,740
Princess consort, please lift your veil,

306
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:26,140
shield your face with the wedding fan,

307
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:28,610
and follow me to the carriage.

308
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:23,130
Princess consort, are you alright?

309
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:40,050
Your Highness...

310
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:40,960
Jiang Xu!

311
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:10,670
Help!

312
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:12,730
Help!

313
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:51,790
Since Lady Su

314
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:53,580
is so full of motherly love,

315
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,800
Let the princess consort
say goodbye to her in person.

316
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,640
So she won't

317
00:16:57,890 --> 00:16:59,050
lose sleep

318
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:01,150
and skip meals from sorrow later.

319
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,010
Godparents, I have been cared for

320
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:16,210
by you for many years.

321
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:19,210
Such affection,

322
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:22,290
I will remember always.

323
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:26,160
Today, I must also bid farewell to you

324
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,170
and thank you for your love.

325
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:33,220
What godmother gave today,

326
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,680
I will

327
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:36,730
treasure dearly,

328
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:39,290
and regard it as a precious gift.

329
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:44,320
The bride is leaving home!

330
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:49,400
Father,

331
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:51,530
I bid farewell to you.

332
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:52,320
Okay.

333
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,250

00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,730
Princess consort, isn't your neck tired?

526
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,780
Thank you, Your Highness, for your concern.

527
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:17,270
Come in.

528
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:24,400
Greetings, Your Highness.

529
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:26,840
Your Grace.

530
00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:30,330
If you have any injuries,

531
00:30:30,530 --> 00:30:32,460
be sure to apply medicine promptly.

532
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:33,870
Please rest well.

533
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:37,130
If you're hungry, just inform the kitchen.

534
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,880
The phoenix crown is too heavy.

535
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:52,880
Why not remove it?

536
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:04,360
My Lady, are you hurt?

537
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:05,440
Do you feel unwell?

538
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:06,420
I'm fine.

539
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:08,450
That's good to hear.

540
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:09,850
You truly frightened us.

541
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:12,600
Thank heavens

542
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:14,430
the wedding is finally over.

543
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:15,260
My Lady,

544
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,300
you don't even know

545
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:17,360
how dangerous this morning was.

546
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,250
We almost got caught...

547
00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:20,630
Several times.

548
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:25,090
My Lady.

549
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:27,080
Please take off the phoenix crown.

550
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:31,000
It's really heavy.

551
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:33,960
Come, please.

552
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:34,870
Your Highness.

553
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:36,400
Your Highness.

554
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,050
I offer my congratulations, Your Highness,

555
00:31:38,050 --> 00:31:39,330
Wishing you

556
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,760
many sons and daughters.

557
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:42,340
Thank you, everyone.

558
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,260
Your Highness,

559
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:45,040
you know I'm not good with words,

560
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,550
and I don't have much learning.

561
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:47,910
Later I'll drink a few

562
00:31:47,930 --> 00:31:49,000
more cups with you

563
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:50,960
to express everything I can't say.

564
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,240
Back in the army,

565
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:54,740
Your Highness never touched
a drop at victory banquets.

566
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:55,930
But today is your wedding,

567
00:31:55,930 --> 00:31:57,310
so you can't turn us down again!

568
00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:58,030
Exactly!

569
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:58,930
Come on, Your Highness!

570
00:31:58,930 --> 00:31:59,250
Here, Your Highness!

571
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:00,730
Alright, alright, alright.

572
00:32:00,730 --> 00:32:01,050
Come.

573
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:02,050
I know Xu

574
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:03,890
is strict in the army and cold by nature.

575
00:32:03,890 --> 00:32:04,690
Normally,

576
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:06,180
you wouldn't dare overstep.

577
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:07,910
But today, you've seized
the chance to have fun,

578
00:32:07,910 --> 00:32:09,240
hoping to get him drunk.

579
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:11,450
In that case, while Xu

580
00:32:11,450 --> 00:32:12,720
is still sober,

581
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:14,660
I'd better give him
a few proper words of advice.

582
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:15,320
Fine.

583
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,160
Can't deny it.

584
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:30,280
His Highness is quite thoughtful.

585
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,700
Of course a husband

586
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,330
should be considerate
and attentive to his wife.

587
00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:35,500
Naturally.

588
00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:36,550
Otherwise, how could His Highness

589
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:39,280
have gone personally
to the mansion to fetch you?

590
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:41,430
He didn't

591
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,330
even tell me beforehand.

592
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:44,690
His Highness must have worried
you'd overexert yourself,

593
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:45,820
so he came on his own.

594
00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:48,370
With him here,
who would dare make trouble?

595
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,490
For His Highness to act this way...

596
00:32:56,050 --> 00:32:57,750
He must truly care about me.

597
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:00,340
So attentive and considerate,

598
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,860
always paying attention.

599
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,930
If this isn't affection,

600
00:33:03,930 --> 00:33:05,130
what else could it be?

601
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,360
Yu.

602
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:11,400
Are you really up to something,

603
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,590
or just being mysterious again?

604
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:14,190
You'll find out soon enough.

605
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,140
Lord Liu,

606
00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:24,490
without you these past few years,
the Ministry of Revenue

607
00:33:24,490 --> 00:33:25,980
wouldn't have made it.

608
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,290
You know it's true.

609
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:27,840
You go ahead first.

610
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:28,600
Thanks to you.

611
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,800
I'll be right behind.

612
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:33,430
Since Lord Liu took office,

613
00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:35,930
the messy accounts
that had piled up for years

614
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:37,700
have mostly been cleared.

615
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,770
Lord Liu is truly experienced.

616
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,320
Just a few days ago,

617
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:43,980
His Majesty personally
praised him by name.

618
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:47,400
Lord Liu has always been diligent,

619
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,580
conscientious and meticulous.

620
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:51,360
He hasn't missed
a single roll call all year.

621
00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:52,400
With him around,

622
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:53,560
the Ministry of Revenue

623
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:55,310
has had no issues for years.

624
00:33:55,690 --> 00:33:56,530
Indeed.

625
00:33:56,690 --> 00:33:57,490
But,

626
00:33:57,810 --> 00:33:59,080
Lord Liu, why weren't you

627
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,740
seen on night duty yesterday?

628
00:34:00,770 --> 00:34:03,370
Were you perhaps meeting with

629
00:34:03,370 --> 00:34:05,530
some young lady after sunset?

630
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:09,370
Congratulations, Your Highness.

631
00:34:09,370 --> 00:34:10,969
Best wishes on your wedding.

632
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:28,130
Congratulations, Your Highness.

633
00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:36,489
Your Highness, please.

634
00:34:36,489 --> 00:34:38,690
I hope the hospitality wasn't lacking.

635
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,600
I shall toast you all with tea

636
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:41,530
in place of wine.

637
00:34:42,489 --> 00:34:43,929
Your Highness honors us.

638
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:46,280
Lord Liu.

639
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,239
Please.

640
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:10,840
Thank you, Your Highness.

641
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:23,800
Please enjoy yourselves.

642
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,580
Thank you, Your Highness.

643
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:30,730
Thank you, Your Highness.

644
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:43,450
Since when do you have dealings

645
00:35:43,450 --> 00:35:45,110
with the Ministry of Revenue?

646
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:48,010
It's a wedding day.
Let's not talk about anything else.

647
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:49,540
Drinking is the main event.

648
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,050
I've searched high and low

649
00:35:54,050 --> 00:35:55,200
to get this fine bottle.

650
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,050
I've been saving it for today,

651
00:35:56,050 --> 00:35:57,560
to drink heartily with all of you.

652
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:59,240
The banquet starts at 8:30 p.m.

653
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,010
Lu, are you so eager for wine?

654
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,490
You can't wait?

655
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:04,810
If you want to drink, do it yourself.

656
00:36:04,810 --> 00:36:06,120
Xu stayed up all night

657
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,120
to save the princess consort.

658
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,270
He hasn't slept a wink.

659
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:09,160
If he starts drinking now,

660
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,720
how will he perform...

661
00:36:11,810 --> 00:36:14,210
When he enters the bridal chamber tonight?

662
00:36:14,330 --> 00:36:15,310
I invited him here

663
00:36:15,310 --> 00:36:16,790
not just for drinks.

664
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:19,280
I really have something important to say.

665
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:19,880
Xu,

666
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,050
I know

667
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:23,370
you've fought valiantly
on the northern frontier,

668
00:36:23,370 --> 00:36:23,970
but when it comes to

669
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:25,640
the ways of husband and wife,

670
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:29,120
you might still be a novice.

671
00:36:29,930 --> 00:36:31,330
Yu is right.

672
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:34,290
In this area, you really
ought to listen to us...

673
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:35,880
To them.

674
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:37,120
To him.

675
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:41,970
Right.

676
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,280
Xu.

677
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:44,810
Now that you're married,

678
00:36:44,810 --> 00:36:45,970
on your wedding night,

679
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:46,930
you mustn't be too distant

680
00:36:46,930 --> 00:36:47,850
with your wife.

681
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,100
Think about it.

682
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,680
You'll be sharing a bed now.

683
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,560
She's shy.

684
00:36:53,930 --> 00:36:55,200
You can't treat her
like you do everyone else,

685
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,240
so silent and withdrawn.

686
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:56,630
That...

687
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:57,320
Exactly!

688
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,820
Saying a few more words

689
00:36:58,850 --> 00:36:59,930
won't kill you.

690
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:01,540
Bad luck.

691
00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:03,200
What an unlucky word

692
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,890
to say on a wedding day!

693
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:05,560
In short,

694
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:06,890
just follow my advice.

695
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,330
Talk about things

696
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,720
she likes.

697
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,270
And absolutely
don't mention war or military matters.

698
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:13,710
You can speak to her about

699
00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:15,180
poetry, music, art, and literature.

700
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:16,160
You're not clueless.

701
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,290
Exactly. You've got to say something.

702
00:37:18,410 --> 00:37:19,810
You can't just

703
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,740
get straight to the point.

704
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:25,760
Listening to you two,

705
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,420
you sound like seasoned pros.

706
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:29,520
How many wives

707
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,720
and concubines have you had?

708
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:34,430
We haven't married,

709
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:35,570
but in this area,

710
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,700
we still understand more than you do.

711
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:49,010
The phoenix and the dragon,
with modest wine,

712
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:51,050
await your honorable presence.

713
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:55,760
Esteemed guests,
please proceed to the banquet hall.

714
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:20,570
My Lady.

715
00:38:21,970 --> 00:38:24,320
My Lady.

716
00:38:25,610 --> 00:38:27,070
His Highness is on his way.

717
00:38:28,370 --> 00:38:30,320
His Highness is almost here.

718
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:37,290
Here.

719
00:39:16,890 --> 00:39:18,950
-Your Highness.
-Princess Consort.

720
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:27,650
Please speak, Your Highness.

721
00:39:30,490 --> 00:39:31,950
Your abduction last night

722
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:33,500
was due to my failure.

723
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:36,530
Thankfully, you were clever,

724
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:37,880
and left clues

725
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,160
along the way

726
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:40,750
that led me to you.

727
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:43,380
Otherwise, today's wedding

728
00:39:43,490 --> 00:39:44,890
would not have happened.

729
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,820
Your Highness overstates it.

730
00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:49,600
If not for your timely arrival,

731
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,000
how could I have escaped?

732
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,200
You've saved me time and again,

733
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:54,310
and I have no way to repay you,

734
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:55,570
except with myself...

735
00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:06,580
You haven't slept all night

736
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,290
and was frightened.

737
00:40:10,370 --> 00:40:11,630
You must be exhausted.

738
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:13,660
It's getting late.

739
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,010
You should rest.

740
00:40:20,830 --> 00:40:21,870
Sleep now?

741
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,010
You won't?

742
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,010
You still have something to do?

743
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:35,720
I...

744
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:37,670
I...

745
00:40:39,450 --> 00:40:41,330
I can have something to do.

746
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:42,340
But...

747
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:46,110
But I haven't thought it through.

748
00:41:10,810 --> 00:41:11,670
Your Highness.

749
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:25,850
This...

750
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:27,850
This isn't mine!

751
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:40,310
I swear it's not mine.

752
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:44,070
Your Highness,
I really didn't put that there!

753
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:44,680
This...

754
00:41:44,910 --> 00:41:46,500
There's no need to explain.

755
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:47,890
I understand.

756
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:50,170
What do you understand?

757
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:51,700
This booklet has nothing to do with me.

758
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:53,670
I have to make that clear.

759
00:41:53,730 --> 00:41:55,390
Even if it was prepared by you,

760
00:41:55,970 --> 00:41:57,030
it doesn't matter.

761
00:42:01,710 --> 00:42:03,760
Why did I sign the contract?

762
00:42:04,170 --> 00:42:05,710
Now look what's happened.

763
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:07,640
Not only did it push him away,

764
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:09,120
it made him think

765
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,330
I'm being two-faced,

766
00:42:10,770 --> 00:42:12,360
saying no but meaning yes.

767
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:18,980
Come, come, come!

768
00:42:19,050 --> 00:42:20,200
On such a joyful day,

769
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:21,940
let's toast!

770
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:35,940
The last time we drank this freely

771
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:38,090
was years ago.

772
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:41,100
I still remember when we first

773
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:42,930
entered court service;

774
00:42:43,270 --> 00:42:45,230
how full of spirit we were.

775
00:42:47,330 --> 00:42:48,330
In a blink,

776
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:50,560
decades

777
00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:53,130
have passed.

778
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:58,970
Why are you

779
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:01,690
so quiet today?

780
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:03,080
Could it be

781
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:05,490
that you still can't bear to part with Tan?

782
00:43:05,490 --> 00:43:06,370
Come, come.

783
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:09,160
Have a drink to ease your sorrow.

784
00:43:10,010 --> 00:43:11,270
Let's drink together.

785
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:13,080
Here.

786
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:21,960
Pour the wine.

787
00:43:24,510 --> 00:43:25,000
Okay.

788
00:43:25,530 --> 00:43:26,330
Please.

789
00:43:31,410 --> 00:43:32,490
Last night,

790
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:35,410
Tan was

791
00:43:35,410 --> 00:43:37,080
taken by members of the Haiyou Sect...
