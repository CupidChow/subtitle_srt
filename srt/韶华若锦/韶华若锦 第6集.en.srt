[Episode 6]

3
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:38,780
It's just a royal marriage.

4
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:40,420
I understand if those outside the mansion
want to flatter her.

5
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:41,880
But now even a maid from her courtyard

6
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,210
dares to talk back to me!

7
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,120
Everyone in the mansion now

8
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,120
is focusing on the Zhaoshui House.

9
00:01:47,539 --> 00:01:49,120
They're not worried about too much work.

10
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,340
They're only worried they can't do things

11
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,270
well enough to show their loyalty.

12
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,440
What's so great about it?

13
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,100
I think Prince of Dingbei is as blinded

14
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,860
as any ordinary man.

15
00:01:57,890 --> 00:01:58,830
He's been bewitched by that vixen,

16
00:01:58,830 --> 00:01:59,940
and he hasn't even realized it.

17
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:01,550
Chu, you mustn't let

18
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:03,240
your father hear such words.

19
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,380
He's spent so much effort these days

20
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:07,080
trying to find you a good match.

21
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,120
Don't anger him

22
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,199
at a time like this.

23
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:10,870
No matter how much effort he puts in,

24
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:14,330
it can't compare to the glory
of being the Princess of Dingbei.

25
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:17,550
Of course you are no match

26
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,320
for Ming Tan.

27
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:24,150
Her marriage was bestowed by His Majesty,

28
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,060
and her future husband
is the Prince of Dingbei.

29
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,200
He's not someone an ordinary girl

30
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,460
can marry.

31
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,890
I know.

32
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:34,980
But how am I worse than her?

33
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,200
You're certainly not worse than her.

34
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:42,170
It's all my fault.

35
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,290
If your birth mother were Her Grace,

36
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:48,360
it would be you who'll marry

37
00:02:48,579 --> 00:02:49,840
the Prince of Dingbei.

38
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:53,730
Mother.

39
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:01,800
You can call me Mother

40
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,700
in private,

41
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,480
but you can't do that in public.

42
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,760
Otherwise,

43
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,000
if Ming Tan hears it,

44
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,020
she'll cause trouble for you again.

45
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:13,880
But honestly,

46
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,500
if you could really become the princess,

47
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,780
everyone who sees you

48
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:19,240
would have to respect

49
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,240
and obey you.

50
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:22,630
Even Ming Tan

51
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:24,900
would have to bow and greet you.

52
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,480
Alright, let's not talk about this.

53
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:31,200
Let's go. Don't be late
for the blind date.

54
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,150
I'm not going!

55
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:33,790
Just because I'm her elder sister,

56
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:34,880
I have to rush into marriage

57
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,700
before her.

58
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,880
How is that fair?

59
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:39,260
The blind date
was arranged by your father.

60
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,540
How can you disobey?

61
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:43,170
I can go to the blind date,

62
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,780
but why does Ming Tan have to go with me?

63
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:45,480
Clearly she's just going

64
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,560
to laugh at me.

65
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,200
It was my idea.

66
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:51,410
Ming Tan is
the future Princess of Dingbei.

67
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:52,730
If she goes with you,

68
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,190
it will bring you honor.

69

And the family you're meeting

won't dare to look down on you.

71
00:03:58,780 --> 00:03:59,780
Listen to me.

72
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,700
Just go out as usual.

73
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:07,850
Be careful on the way.

74

No matter what happens,

75
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,960
just protect yourself.

It's improper for you
to board the carriage first.

Where's Minmin?

107
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:08,530
She said

108
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,660
everything's been going poorly,

109
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:10,930
and she's been targeted everywhere.

110
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:12,120
She thinks she must have offended someone.

111
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,060
So she went to the hall to draw
a divination lot to ask about her fortune.

112
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,290
She said once she's done,

113

she'll go to you in the back mountain.

go in with me?

118
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,060
It's not proper to have someone

Go alone.

and scare her.

123

It won't be that bad.

Don't worry too much.

Just handle it with a calm heart.

I...

129
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:57,430
You just need to remember

130
00:06:57,690 --> 00:06:59,210
the purpose of a blind date

131
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:00,580
is to find someone you like

132
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:01,820
and get married.

133
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:04,150
So what's the most important?

134
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:05,130
What?

135
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,070
Your feelings for her.

136
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,470
Whether you like her or not,

137
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:11,820
you'll know at a glance.

138
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:12,990
If you like her,

139
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:14,830
you'll naturally ask questions

140
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:16,230
to get to know her better.

141
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:17,830
But if you don't like her,

142
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:20,150
you'll want to leave.

143
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:20,890
Then

144
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,540
just make an excuse to leave.

145
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:28,390
This is an important life event.

146
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:30,340
It's normal even if
you don't like each other.

147
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:32,470
You'll get used to it after a few times.

148
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,530
No need to be nervous.

00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,610
You're favored by His Majesty,

175
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:03,540
but at most,

176
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,470
you'll only be promoted to the Commander.

177
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:07,050
The Lu family has no noble lineage

178
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:08,120
or hereditary titles.

179
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,180
Your career prospects seem limited.

180
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,490
Compared to other young masters
from noble families,

181
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:14,300
Young Master Lu, your background

182
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,820
is indeed not good enough.

183
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:19,550
I wonder how large your mansion is

184
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:21,310
and how many servants you have.

185
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,610
I haven't bought a mansion,

186
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:26,290
and I don't have any servants.

187
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:27,250
Most of the time,

188
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:28,730
I'm on duty in the palace.

189
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:30,940
I'm used to simple meals

190
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,280
and frugal living.

191
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:35,350
Of course the Ming family is much better.

192
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,720
Commander Lu,

193
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:38,350
you have a bad reputation

194
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:40,400
for stopping kids from crying at night.

195
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,970
Everyone in the capital

196
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:43,230
would avoid you.

197
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,500
With such a bad reputation, no mansion,

198
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:48,140
and no career prospects,

199
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:51,230
what gives you the confidence
to come to the blind date?

200
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:55,840
Not having a mansion

201
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:57,340
doesn't mean I can't afford it.

202
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:57,980
I just want

203
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:00,240
to let my future wife decide everything.

204
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,480
Moreover,

205
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,990
His Majesty once granted me
a three-courtyard mansion.

206
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:04,950
But I suppose,

207
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:06,200
in Third Miss Ming's eyes,

208
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,130
it's surely not worth mentioning.

209
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:13,460
[Salvation with Compassion]

210
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:17,840
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

211
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,410
It's just a blind date.

212
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:21,830
Material things are not worth mentioning.

213
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:22,900
Since it's a blind date,

214
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,140
we should get to know each other

215
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:25,450
and know each other's background.

216
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:26,190
Why can't we mention

217
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:27,350
material things?

218
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:31,030
You have a point.

219
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:31,980
Commander Lu...

220
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:32,700
But...

221
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,900
it's understandable that you have

222
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:35,970
your own considerations.

223
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:37,980
I also have my own considerations.

224
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:40,370
Perhaps you and I don't see eye to eye,

225
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,930
and we are not like-minded.

226
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,100
I prefer frugal living.

227
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:45,350
I don't like mansions.

228
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:47,280
And I don't want anyone to serve me.

229
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:53,500
I'm leaving.

230

Young Master Lu.

232
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:01,140
You're leaving?

233
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:03,140
Third Miss.

[Salvation with Compassion]

235
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:04,940
My younger sister will marry into

the Prince of Dingbei's Mansion
as the princess!

237
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,580
How could such an ill-mannered person

238
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:09,620
from a humble background

239
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:10,820
be a good match for me?

240
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:11,980
You claim to be

241
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:13,340
the capital's top matchmaker!

242
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,300
What kind of person did you find?

243
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:14,940
I...

244
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:19,060
Fourth Miss is virtuous and accomplished.

245
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:21,340
She's the best
among the capital's noble ladies.

246
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:22,980
She deserves to be the princess.

00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:19,700
What are your names?

274
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,900
Why were you surrounding Second Young Master Shu?

275

When it comes to authority
and commanding presence,

it's got to be you, Lu.

Luckily, you're here.

282
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:46,530
Otherwise, today,

283
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,880
I wouldn't have been able to move an inch.

Giving gifts?

287
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:00,790
Why did it look like
they were fighting over someone?

288
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:02,250
With so many accessories,

289
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:03,940
you could set up a stall on the street

290

tomorrow.

291
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:05,890

to set up a stall.

297
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:15,620
It'll be your side business

outside your official duties.

When we were making wishes earlier,

the candle flame on the altar
flickered twice.

303
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,900
That means our business

304
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,460
will surely flourish.

305
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:44,300

come to offer incense often,

you may encounter petty troublemakers.

320

You may be easily agitated,

My Lady,

your zither skills have greatly improved.

332
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,900
But I feel in the final part,

333
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,630
if a few notes were changed,

334
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:56,700
the mood would align
more closely with the moment.

335

Listen.

336
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:13,560
The melody flows smoothly,
graceful and full of emotion.

how could she make a mistake

344
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:38,580
in the final part?

345
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:42,670
I get it, Xu.

346
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:45,030
Fourth Miss Ming did it intentionally.

347
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:46,820
Why?

348
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:49,010
A flawed tune draws Zhou Yu's gaze.

349
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:50,190
Go, Zhou Yu.

350
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:51,880
Go meet your future princess.

351
00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:57,490
Troublemaker Zhang?

352
00:16:57,770 --> 00:16:58,970
Why is he here?

353
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:00,660
How...

354
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:02,980
You really can't talk about people
behind their backs.

355
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,099
Speak of the devil.

356
00:17:04,099 --> 00:17:05,220
But this talisman

357
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:07,099
must be given no matter what.

358
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:12,819
Young Lord Zhang.

359
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,780
You're also here with your friend

360
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:19,040
to pray for blessings?

361
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:22,430
What's wrong with her?

362
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:24,579
Yes.

363
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:26,900
Miss Bai, you too?

364
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:28,150
Yes.

365
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:32,780
Minmin.

366
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:33,860
Tan.

367
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,670
Greetings, Prince of Dingbei.

368
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:54,950
He... He...

369
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:56,910
He is the Prince of Dingbei?

370
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:03,780
Greetings, Prince of Dingbei.

371
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:07,070
No need for such formalities.

372
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:08,830
We'll be family soon.

373
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:11,120
So there's no need for such formalities.

374
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:20,500
I was wondering who

375
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,120
was playing the zither here.

376
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:23,610
It turns out it was you, Tan.

377
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:25,470
Tan, you were in quite a good mood.

378
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:31,730
I guess you and I are destined to meet.

379
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,140
After meeting once before,

380
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:34,440
we meet again here.

381
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:39,380
Who are you?

382
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:41,380
You don't remember me?

383
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:42,660
We met at an inn

384
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:44,350
on the outskirts of the city.

385
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:45,780
I don't remember.

386
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:51,620
Chu, I thought you were

387
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:53,260
on a blind date at the Huiji Hall.

388
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:54,540
It ended so quickly?

389
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:57,260
Though he came from a good family,

390
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:58,820
with a promising career and decent looks,

391
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:00,490
after talking with him for a while,

392
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:01,780
I felt we didn't see eye to eye.

393
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:03,300
It's hard to have mutual understanding.

394
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,360
So I had to decline.

395
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:09,580
Actually, a blind date
is all about the first impression.

396
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:11,100
Family background and career prospects

397
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,630
are not the most important.

398
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,300
Xu.

399
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:27,300
Third Miss Ming, we meet again.

400
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:28,920
I'd rather we hadn't.

401
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:30,800
Don't tell me

402
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:32,750
today's blind date was for you two.

403
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:33,900
So?

404
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,830
Commander Lu, are you interested?

405
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:38,390
I'm afraid it's impossible

406
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:39,630
between Third Miss Ming and me.

407
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:41,410
Third Miss Ming thinks I look ordinary

408
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:43,810
and come from a humble background.

409
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:45,140
And I have a bad reputation.

410
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:45,660
I...

411
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:47,100
Also, my career is not promising,

412
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,830
and I don't have my own mansion.

413
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:51,070
It's understandable.

414
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:53,190
I hope Third Miss Ming

415
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,580
can find someone she likes

416
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:55,500
soon.

417
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,620
What do you mean?

418
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:59,940
I... mean nothing.

419
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:05,350
Did I say anything wrong?

420
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:08,420
Commander Lu,

421
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:10,980
you really are straightforward.

422
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:15,650
Alright, alright.

423
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:16,900
Fate has brought us together.

424
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:17,780
Since we've all met here,

425
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:19,140
why don't you join us

426
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:20,580
for tea and music?

427
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:22,970
Fourth Miss Ming.

428
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:25,420
Please.

429
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:30,220
Tan, you've always cared
about your reputation.

430
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:31,340
You fell into the Xian River that day,

431
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:32,950
and it has been kept a secret.

432
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,620
Now you're engaged,

433
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:36,300
but you're out here flaunting yourself.

434
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:37,420
If word gets out,

435
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:39,220
aren't you worried
the Prince of Dingbei would blame you?

436
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:40,500
What nonsense are you talking about?

437
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,220
You weren't even in the capital
on the night of the Lantern Festival.

438
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:42,900
Which eye of yours

439
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,100
saw Tan fall into the river?

440
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,540
I think you're just slandering Tan because

441
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:47,140
your blind date didn't go well.

442
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:48,380
I'm slandering her?

443
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,960
Don't think I don't know

444
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:51,020
that day, the two of you

445
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:52,580
specially disguised yourselves

446
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:53,980
just to sneak into the Capital Garrison

447
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:56,240
to see what Prince of Dingbei looks like.

448
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:01,770
What?

449
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,900
Tan, you're the one who always cares

450
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,340
so much about reputation.

451
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:06,100
Shut up!

452
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:06,660
I think you're deliberately

453
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:07,580
trying to ruin Tan's reputation!

454
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:09,500
-Stop! Stop!
-Stop talking nonsense!

455
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,660
We're all on the same side.

456
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:12,480
Don't ruin the harmony.

457
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:15,450
Go away!

458
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:17,940
Everything I said is true.

459
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:18,820
What?

460
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,180
You could sneak
into the Capital Garrison for a peek,

461
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:21,580
but I can't talk about it?

462
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,360
I'm not wrongly accusing you.

463
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:25,660
My gentle elegance

464
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:27,010
and grace

465
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:29,060
have been totally ruined today.

466
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,660
And it was right in front of him.

467
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:33,500
Ming Tan, you tell them yourself.

468
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,850
Is everything I said...

469
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:36,220
My Lady!

470
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:37,500
My Lady! What's wrong?

471
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,500
-My Lady!
-Tan!

472
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:40,500
Pretending to faint again.

473
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,180
You've used this trick since childhood.

474
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:43,620
Can you come up with something new?

475
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:45,390
Listen, Tan...

476
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,260
Finally, the one being treated this way

477
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,700
is not me.

478
00:21:58,420 --> 00:21:59,860
Looks like your future husband

479
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,360
did something to Ming Chu.

480
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,830
He struck her acupoint?

481
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,550
Tan, what's wrong?

482
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:31,420
Leave me alone.

483
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:34,220
Then just calm down.

484
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,900
But how can I calm down?

485
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:39,980
My embarrassing moments
were exposed in front of everyone.

486
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:41,220
After they go back,

487
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:42,580
who knows

488
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:43,890
how they will mock me?

489
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,380
I think you're overthinking it.

490
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:47,020
I believe those people

491
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:48,780
are friends of the Prince of Dingbei's.

492
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:50,900
They surely won't gossip behind his back.

493
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,520
Even if they won't gossip,

494
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:53,660
the image I spent so many years

495
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:54,700
building

496
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:55,980
has been ruined.

497
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:58,980
And it happened
right in front of the Prince of Dingbei.

498
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:01,180
It was truly embarrassing.

499
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:03,540
I wonder

500
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:05,100
what he will think of me.

501
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:07,550
It sounds like

502
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:08,900
you want to marry him?

503
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,020
I also think

504
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:12,950
your future husband is quite good.

505
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:15,660
What's good about him?

506
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:16,880
Earlier, I already thought

507
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,300
the Prince of Dingbei is a good match

508
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,710
in every aspect given his good background.

509
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:20,860
But you refused him due to

510
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:21,980
his rumored appearance.

511
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:23,340
But after seeing him today,

512
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:25,220
I think he is tall and imposing,

513
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:26,260
with extraordinary demeanor.

514
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:29,220
He completely meets
your criteria for your future husband.

515
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:30,630
In my opinion,

516
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:31,860
the Prince of Dingbei

517
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:34,130
doesn't seem as cold as they say.

518
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,000
Just now, when you pretended to faint,

519
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,780
he didn't expose you in front of everyone,

520
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:39,630
and he protected your dignity.

521
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:41,820
My Lady, you often talked about

522
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:44,250
how your future husband should be.

523
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,530
After seeing him,

524
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:47,980
I think the Prince of Dingbei is exactly

525
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,350
what you described.

526
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:56,000
Do you really think

527
00:23:56,910 --> 00:23:58,970
the Prince of Dingbei is a good match?

528
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:06,840
How embarrassing!

529
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:14,850
This is strange. Where's the talisman?

530
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:20,810
Miss Bai.

531
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:22,870
Young Lord Zhang.

532
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:28,160
Miss Bai, when you were fighting earlier,

533
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:30,080
you dropped something.

534
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,020
Shut up!

535
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:32,820
-Stop! Stop!
-You're trying to ruin Tan's reputation!

536
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:34,400
Stop talking nonsense!

537
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:38,210
Young Lord Zhang, I specially asked

538
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:39,920
for this amulet for you.

539
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,300
It must be fate

540
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:43,750
that you found it.

541
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:46,730
You mean

542
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:48,180
this amulet was

543
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:49,840
specially asked for me?

544
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:52,260
Specially.

545
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:54,880
Specially?

546
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:04,180
Miss Bai.

547
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:06,140
I truly appreciate

548
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:07,820
your kindness.

549
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:08,820
But now,

550
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:09,500
I don't have anything good

551
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,340
to give you

552
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:11,220
in return.

553
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:12,180
I will

554
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:14,850
carefully select a gift

555
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:17,730
to thank you some other day.

556
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:18,710
No need for that.

557
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:20,470
I should.

558
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:26,460
The master at the temple said

559
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:27,620
the amulet

560
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:28,980
must be carried every day.

561
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:30,260
And it's best to place it

562
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:31,620
under your pillow at night.

563
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:32,760
Only then will it

564
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:34,380
give you the strongest protection.

565
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:36,140
Okay. I'll keep that in mind.

566
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:37,760
I'll carry it every day.

567
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:39,200
If there's nothing else,

568
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,260
I'll take my leave.

569
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:12,260
My Lady, you're still

570
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:14,260
upset about what happened earlier?

571
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:20,070
I wonder what the Prince of Dingbei

572
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:22,070
truly thinks.

573
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:23,680
In my opinion,

574
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:25,570
you're overthinking it.

575
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:27,650
He is your future husband.

576
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:28,980
In his heart,

577
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:30,580
he naturally sides with you.

578
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:32,820
Otherwise, when he saw you
pretend to faint,

579
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:34,020
he wouldn't have struck

580
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:35,700
Third Miss's mute acupoint.

581
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:37,810
He looks cold,

582
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,150
but he's thoughtful.

583
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,540
With such a

584
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:42,090
considerate husband,

585
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:43,180
My Lady, you'll surely live comfortably

586
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:44,510
after getting married.

587
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:50,870
What husband?

588
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,460
If others hear this,

589
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:54,070
they'd think I'm desperate to marry him.

590
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,990
So what if others hear it?

591
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:57,580
The marriage has been decreed.

592
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:58,380
The Prince of Dingbei

593
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:00,440
will be your husband sooner or later.

594
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:02,550
Surround them!

595
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:12,050
What's going on?

596
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:15,400
I... I think they're bandits.

597
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:16,980
Bandits?

598
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:18,110
How dare you!

599
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:19,820
Do you know whose convoy this is?

600
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:21,220
You're utterly lawless!

601
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:24,590
We only want your valuables,
not your lives!

602
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:26,820
If you're smart, give us

603
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,240
all your gold and silver!

604
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:42,660
If the bandits only want valuables,

605
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:44,820
why are they targeting
an official's carriages?

606
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:45,860
They ambushed us here.

607
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:47,520
Clearly, they came prepared!

608
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:52,120
Be careful on the way.

609
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:53,700
No matter what happens,

610
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:56,010
just protect yourself.

611
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:04,100
You've got the wrong person.

612
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:04,620
The person you want

613
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:05,340
is in the carriage ahead.

614
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:06,120
Go now!

615
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:11,740
These two maids are good too!

616
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:12,380
Take them too!

617
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:13,210
Come out!

618
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:14,140
Let go!

619
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:15,760
-My Lady!
-My Lady!

620
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:16,900
Suxin!

621
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:17,760
Move!

622
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:22,420
Let go! Let go!

623
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,180
Move!

624
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:24,990
Let me go!

625
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:26,620
Release me!

626
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:27,740
Help!

627
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:54,220
Put me down!

628
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,640
Let go of me!

629
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:59,040
Let go!

630
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:00,500
Let go!

631
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:29,940
H-Honey?

632
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:33,790
That's... That's not what I mean.

633
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:05,280
Fourth Miss!

634
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,540
Fourth Miss, this...

635
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:08,780
This...

636
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:10,720
-My Lady.
-My Lady.

637
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:17,060
Th-Thank you for saving us.

638
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:21,420
I told you Xu

639
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:23,620
and Fourth Miss Ming were fated to meet.

640
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:24,860
After coming to Hanyan Temple,

641
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:26,390
they already met twice.

642
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:28,420
This is fate.

643
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:33,180
Take them away. Keep them alive.

644
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:33,780
Yes.

645
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:35,760
Take them away!

646
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:37,200
Take them away!

647
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:47,630
Since we met each other,

648
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:50,180
he has saved me many times.

649
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:52,820
Even though we are engaged,

650
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:55,140
he has never sought credit

651
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:56,790
or overstepped the bounds.

652
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:59,180
It seems Father was right.

653
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:00,460
He is indeed

654
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,800
a trustworthy person.

655
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:03,900
-Miss Ming.
-Miss Ming.

656
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:10,860
Thank you for saving my life.

657
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,580
About the bandits incident today,

658
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:21,020
young masters, please don't tell anyone

659
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,080
for the sake of

660
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,280
the reputation of the two young ladies.

661
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:28,580
The authorities won't know about this.

662
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:38,740
Hurry. Let's go back.

663
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:39,400
Yes.

664
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,000
Sir, save your wife's life.

665
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:58,070
Pay for the ginseng now, please.

666
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:19,700
Not bad.

667
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:23,900
Come here.

668
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:26,580
Look.

669
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,780
Master.

670
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,180
Be careful.

671
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:33,620
Look. And here.

672
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:34,610
Okay.

673
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:42,630
Master, you feel hot?

674
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:46,250
That is not the point.

675
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:04,180
Master, please don't stand in the way.

676
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:08,140
Haven't you noticed

677
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:10,740
anything different about my fan today?

678
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:14,140
What's different about it?

679
00:33:14,170 --> 00:33:15,620
You're so unobservant.

680
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:18,060
Haven't you noticed

681
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:19,870
there's a talisman on the fan?

682
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:22,940
It's just a talisman.

683
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:24,440
Who hasn't asked for a few?

684
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:27,580
The talisman is not the point either.

685
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:30,240
Then what is the point?

686
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:33,740
In old times, a beauty twirled her ring,

687
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:36,140
remembering her love when seeing the ring.

688
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:38,540
Now, a beauty gave me an amulet as a gift

689
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:41,140
to express her affection silently.

690
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:44,900
What does that mean?

691
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:47,650
It means a beauty likes Master.

692
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:50,980
She gave him the talisman
to express her feelings.

693
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:52,840
Shuiying, you're so perceptive.

694
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:55,790
Young Lord, you're handsome.

695
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:58,120
It's natural that a beauty likes you.

696
00:33:58,460 --> 00:33:59,800
What's important is

697
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:02,140
Young Lord, you also have

698
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:04,140
feelings for the beauty.

699
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:05,750
Keep it low-key.

700
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:08,460
Things like this should stay hidden,

701
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:10,000
not spoken loud.

702
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:17,840
Peach blossom talismans from Hanyan Temple

703
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,139
are the most effective.

704
00:34:19,139 --> 00:34:20,230
Looks like the beauty

705
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:22,460
has liked you for a long time.

706
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:27,280
Peach blossom talismans?

707
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:29,340
This is a peach blossom talisman?

708
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:30,199
Peach blossom.

709
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:34,560
The girls here often ask for this talisman

710
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:37,460
to give to the ones they like.

711
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,139
But she told me

712
00:34:39,139 --> 00:34:40,239
this was an amulet.

713
00:34:41,659 --> 00:34:44,139
She was just shy to tell you directly.

714
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,780
Young Lord, you just said it shouldn't

715
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:47,350
be spoken loud, right?

716
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:27,900
From now on, this altar

717
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:30,110
needs to be cleaned every day.

718
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:31,940
Change the fresh flowers every three days.

719
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:33,780
The incense must never go out.

720
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:35,660
Yes.

721
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:36,500
Also,

722
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:38,500
never touch this talisman,

723
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:41,380
so that it won't
be contaminated by worldliness.

724
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:43,500
I'll tell them right away.

725
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:44,580
You handle this personally.

726
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:45,980
I don't trust anyone else.

727
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:46,780
Master,

728
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:48,750
I'm working two jobs,

729
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:49,900
Wentao Pavilion by day

730
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:50,940
and Bieyu House by night.

731
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,900
I'm really very busy.

732
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:54,430
I don't have time

733
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:56,430
to take care of this little talisman.

734
00:35:56,430 --> 00:35:57,520
Little talisman?

735
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:59,020
Do you know how important

736
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:00,470
this talisman is?

737
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:02,180
Why didn't you complain about being tired

738
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:04,180
when you received double salaries?

739
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:05,380
Master,

740
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:07,220
since you value it so much,

741
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:10,150
you should clean it yourself
to show your sincerity.

742
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:12,870
How could you ask someone else to do it?

743
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:16,660
You have a point.

744
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:17,820
Go tell them now.

745
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:18,990
From now on, no one

746
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:20,860
is allowed to touch anything here.

747
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:21,610
Okay.

748
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:22,980
No.

749
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:24,140
No one is allowed
to enter this room from now on.

750
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,540
Leave. Hurry.

751
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,350
[Spring Blossoms, Autumn Fruits]

752
00:36:46,310 --> 00:36:47,300
Chu,

753
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:49,120
your martial skills are good.

754
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:50,340
Dealing with a few bandits

755
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:51,620
should be easy for you.

756
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:53,220
In such danger today,

757
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:55,510
why didn't you protect your sister?

758
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:57,100
I didn't protect her?

759
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:58,740
Those bandits weren't pushovers.

760
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:00,300
What could I do if I couldn't beat them?

761
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:01,100
Besides,

762
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:02,660
Tan had guards with her.

763
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:05,110
I had no obligation to protect her.

764
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:06,820
I failed

765
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:08,420
to discipline Chu properly.

766
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:09,780
But, My lord,

767
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:12,110
although Chu knows some martial skills,

768
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:13,530
she is a girl after all.

769
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:15,640
How could she stand against bandits?

770
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:18,180
Fortunately, Fourth Miss is unharmed.

771
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:19,940
Otherwise, I wouldn't be able

772
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:21,620
to make up for it even if I die.

773
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:23,320
Enough.

774
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:26,380
Luckily, you're all safe.

775
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:29,280
This was, after all, an act of banditry.

776
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:31,380
But Chu failed to protect her sister.

777
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:32,660
She should be punished.

778
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:34,860
Go kneel in the ancestral hall for one day.

779
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:36,900
Liu failed to teach her daughter well.

780
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:39,340
She'll be confined
to Yiyun House for three days.

781
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:40,180
That's all.

782
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:42,620
Father, you're so biased!

783
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:43,760
Why should I be punished

784
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,700
for not protecting her?

785
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:45,740
She's a daughter of the Ming family.

786
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:47,500
Am I not a daughter of the Ming family?

787
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:48,340
Father, to you

788
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,560
and Tan,

789
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:50,580
am I just a guard

790
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:51,640
of the Ming family?

791
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:53,380
Chu.

792
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,700
Don't be disrespectful to your father.

793
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:59,200
Today, there's something

794
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:01,580
I don't understand.

795
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:09,580
Chu, I wanted to ask you privately,

796
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:11,180
but I guess

797
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:12,330
I have to ask you now.

798
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,520
Today, when the bandits took me,

799
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:17,700
Chu, why did you

800
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,530
deliberately stop the guards,

801
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:24,210
wink at the bandits,

802
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:29,460
and let them go?

803
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:34,540
What exactly did you want to do?

804
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:39,400
Chu.

805
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:42,130
Is what Tan said true?

806
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:46,180
That's right.

807
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:47,180
I asked the bandits

808
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:47,980
to kidnap her!

809
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:48,820
Then she won't be an eyesore!

810
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:49,440
You...

811
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:57,860
I can't believe I have raised

812
00:38:57,860 --> 00:38:59,100
a daughter like you!

813
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:03,070
I've tolerated your arrogance

814
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:04,480
and willfulness all this time.

815
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,100
But how could you

816
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:06,660
be so cruel to your own sister?

817
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:07,820
No, no, My lord.

818
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:08,860
She... She just didn't think straight

819
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:09,580
and said it out of anger.

820
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:10,340
Shut up!

821
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,980
Just because of your excessive indulgence,

822
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:15,500
she has become

823
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:17,160
so arrogant and domineering.

824
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:20,660
Guards!

825
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:23,540
Take them to the ancestral hall!

826
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:24,680
Let go of me!

827
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:25,980
Father, you want to punish me.

828
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:27,380
I dare not defy you.

829
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,260
But Ming Tan disregarded her reputation

830
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:30,660
and secretly met with a man.

831
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:32,000
How will you punish her?

832
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:33,850
Secretly meeting with a man?

833
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:35,700
When my mother and I
were on our way back to the capital,

834
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:37,300
we took a break at Yinma Town.

835
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,620
We caught her meeting secretly with a man.

836
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:40,940
They acted intimately!

837
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:42,820
Sir, your wife left

838
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:44,300
out of anger when she discovered

839
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:45,500
your mistress.

840
00:39:45,530 --> 00:39:47,970
How are you going to explain to your father

841
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:50,230
if his grandchild dies?

842
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:54,660
I did hear Chu mention this.

843
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:56,980
That man is already married.

844
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:58,540
And his wife is pregnant.

845
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:01,470
Could it be that Fourth Miss

846
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:02,740
is really involved

847
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:03,780
with that married man?

848
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:05,180
Madam Liu, mind your words!

849
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:06,180
Without evidence,

850
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:07,180
how could you and Third Miss

851
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:08,820
slander Fourth Miss like this?

852
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:10,820
Father, I swear to God

853
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:12,220
that every word I said is true.

854
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:13,180
The person who rescued her

855
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:13,980
from the bandits today

856
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:14,740
is the same man

857
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:16,380
she met secretly at Yinma Town.

858
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:17,860
Actually, today at Hanyan Temple,

859
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:18,500
I caught them

860
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:19,650
meeting secretly.

861
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:21,120
To protect her, that man

862
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:23,040
even struck my mute acupoint!

863
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:25,420
Can you guys

864
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:27,580
spare me a moment's peace?

865
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:31,420
Father.

866
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:34,100
Ming Tan met with a man in secret.

867
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:35,100
Even after being granted a royal marriage,

868
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:36,220
she's still involved

869
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:37,450
with him.

870
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:38,980
If His Majesty knows this,

871
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:40,900
it would be a serious crime
of deceiving the emperor!

872
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:41,660
By that time,

873
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:43,180
it'd ruin the Ming family's reputation,

874
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:44,240
and even your official career

875
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,300
would be affected.

876
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:51,140
Tan, is that true?

877
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:53,510
Um...

878
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:57,210
Who is that man?

879
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:00,260
Tell me!

880
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:02,420
Father, I...

881
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:04,280
Tell me!

882
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:05,900
Who is that man exactly?

883
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:07,340
I...

884
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:11,140
Tell me!

885
00:41:11,170 --> 00:41:13,380
The man who met with Miss Ming in secret

886
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:17,360
was me.

887
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:25,480
Your Highness?

888
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:29,660
No need for formalities.

889
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:30,940
If I hadn't come,

890
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:33,420
my future princess
would have been wrongly accused,

891
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:35,080
with no way to defend herself.

892
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:37,270
You... You are the Prince of Dingbei?

893
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:39,420
I've thoroughly interrogated the bandits.

894
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:41,340
That was not an accident.

895
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:43,780
Someone bribed the bandits

896
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:45,720
to do it deliberately.

897
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:51,700
What?

898
00:41:58,340 --> 00:42:00,580
But why would Liu do that?

899
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:01,890
If Tan lost her virginity,

900
00:42:01,890 --> 00:42:03,120
it would benefit neither Chu

901
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:05,280
nor the Ming family!

902
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:08,020
The imperial decree of marriage
has been issued.

903
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:10,680
A union between our two families
is inevitable.

904
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:13,470
If Fourth Miss lost her virginity,

905
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:14,910
do you think there's

906
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:17,300
anyone more suitable than Third Miss

907
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:18,960
to take her place as the bride?

908
00:42:21,690 --> 00:42:24,290
She... She is so foolish!

909
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:28,100
I came here in the middle of the night

910
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:29,500
because I didn't want you

911
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:30,500
to be deceived.

912
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:33,180
If you keep such vile people around,

913
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:36,400
I'm afraid your family
will face endless problems.

914
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:43,710
Ming Chu is not kind.

915
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:45,980
She has caused trouble repeatedly.

916
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:47,130
You need to come up with

917
00:42:47,130 --> 00:42:49,260
a proper solution as soon as possible.

918
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:53,620
Your Highness, you're straightforward.

919
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:55,480
I won't beat around the bush then.

920
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:58,180
Ming Chu indeed made

921
00:42:58,180 --> 00:42:59,700
an unforgivable mistake.

922
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:02,140
The match I originally arranged for her

923
00:43:02,140 --> 00:43:03,740
is no longer suitable.

924
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:08,220
Her future husband's family

925
00:43:08,470 --> 00:43:10,430
will have to be of lower status.

926
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:13,230
Preferably not in the capital.

927
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:14,420
So she won't

928
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:16,320
cause more trouble in the future.

929
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:19,800
Do you have anyone in mind?

930
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:20,980
Well...

931
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:22,760
I...

932
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:26,630
haven't had the chance to look for one.

933
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:31,380
How about the third son

934
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:34,340
of General Xuanwei from Lingzhou?

935
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:37,760
General Xuanwei?

936
00:43:38,770 --> 00:43:40,030
I remember now.

937
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:41,660
General Xuanwei

938
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:43,260
is a fifth-rank military official.

939
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:44,260
His rank is not high,

940
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:46,340
and Lingzhou
is far enough from the capital.

941
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:48,150
Good, that's perfect!

942
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:50,380
Back then, I

943
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:52,080
had dealings with General Feng.

944
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:53,810
I have a good impression of him.

945
00:43:53,980 --> 00:43:54,980
His third son

946
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:57,720
has much of his father's demeanor.

947
00:43:58,100 --> 00:43:59,420
Since you're satisfied,

948
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:01,330
it's settled.

949
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:02,500
It's settled.

950
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:05,280
And Liu...
