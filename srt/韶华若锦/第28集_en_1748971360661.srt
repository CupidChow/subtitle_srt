1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

17
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
You and I are the same.

18
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
We have no secrets.

19
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
We don't have people.

20
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I'm not the same as you.

21
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I came here to tell you the truth.

22
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
It's because of the Western talents.

23
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
You're a good person.

24
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I don't want to see you being fooled and used by others.

25
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
And you want to make Kang Kai die.

26
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I'll give you two days.

27
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
If you change your mind,

28
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
everything may be returned to you.

29
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Your Majesty.

30
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
This is the letter that Su Wenchun gave me.

31
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Please take it to the tomb.

32
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I'll keep it.

33
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I'll ask the palace servants to take it.

34
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
It's my duty.

35
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I'm the master behind this.

36
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I'm the mastermind behind this case.

37
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'm innocent.

38
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I know I'm innocent.

39
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I'm not guilty.

40
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I'm not guilty.

41
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I'm begging you.

42
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
You can investigate the case.

43
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I'll pay back my father's innocence.

44
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Su Wenchun is guilty.

45
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
He's innocent.

46
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
He's got a soul under his hands.

47
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
He's got a soul under his hands.

48
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I'll make a living for all the people in Han Yuan.

49
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I'll make a living for all the people in Han Yuan.

50
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Yes.

51
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
You betrayed him.

52
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
If I had killed him,

53
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I would have been willing to die.

54
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
You asked me why you disappeared.

55
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
You were so stubborn.

56
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
You were so loyal to me.

57
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
You were so loyal to me.

58
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
You were so loyal to me.

59
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
You were so loyal to me.

60
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
You were so loyal to me.

61
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
And your betrayal

62
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
proved that you're right.

63
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
No.

64
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
No.

65
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Please report.

66
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Why did he leave?

67
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
You're under arrest.

68
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
You're under arrest.

69
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
You're under arrest.

70
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
The police.

71
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Su Wenchun.

72
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
The party is dead.

73
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
The Su family is in the hands of the leader.

74
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
We're ordered to investigate the case.

75
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Su Wenchun, the criminal,

76
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
will be executed right away.

77
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
We'll find out the truth.

78
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Take him down.

79
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Yes.

80
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I'll go myself.

81
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
This cup is for the Ming family.

82
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I'm sorry to have caused you any trouble.

83
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I'm sorry.

84
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I'm sorry.

85
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I'm sorry.

86
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I'm sorry.

87
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I'm sorry.

88
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I was afraid

89
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
that you'd save my life.

90
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I'm afraid

91
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I won't have the chance to wait for the Ming family to get their blood.

92
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Yuanzhang is a loyal country.

93
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
But he's a cruel man.

94
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I'll do my best to protect Yuanzhang.

95
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Yuanzhang is a common man.

96
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
You can't be silent.

97
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
He's a leader of the Ming family because of his evidence.

98
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I'll do my best.

99
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
This is the first time

100
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
the imperial court has made this decision.

101
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
It's a great honor.

102
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
General Feng, you're too much.

103
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
My father is a soldier.

104
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
He won't do anything to make the country famous.

105
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
How can I be so serious

106
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
to see my father being so innocent?

107
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I've always been a father to protect my daughter.

108
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Now I can share my father and Ming family with him.

109
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I'm very happy.

110
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
The prince is a good man.

111
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
The princess is brave and brave.

112
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I admire her.

113
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I'll make the country famous.

114
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
But I'm sorry, Qing.

115
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I can't make the promise I made

116
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
to take care of Ming Chu.

117
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Qing is really selfless.

118
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I can't help her.

119
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
She's not only a great emperor,

120
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
but also a great leader.

121
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
It's a big mistake

122
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
to make a mistake.

123
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I need to reflect on it.

124
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I can't help her.

125
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I'm sorry.

126
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Sister San is Ming's daughter.

127
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
If she can make a mistake

128
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
through this,

129
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Ming family will be her shield forever.

130
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
You're right.

131
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
As long as Ming Chu can be happy,

132
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Feng family will be open to her.

133
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I'm sorry.

134
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Master.

135
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I'm Li Zhong.

136
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I'm a soldier of two Western Army.

137
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I'm here to report.

138
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
What happened?

139
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Guo Bingmao's army is out of the city.

140
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
He's taken the army to north.

141
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
He's not a general.

142
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
How dare he?

143
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
He's not a general.

144
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
He's not willing to take the lead.

145
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
The back of the army

146
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
must be Song.

147
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I'm afraid

148
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
he'll be killed.

149
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I'm afraid he'll be killed.

150
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I'm afraid he'll be killed.

151
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I'm afraid he'll be killed.

152
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
The back

153
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
must be Song.

154
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Please come in, schemer.

155
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I need to take a uncleal step.

156
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I'm afraid he'll be returned.

157
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
You can leave them with me.

158
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
To prepare the grandêter.

159
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
We're finding no time.

160
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I will go back to the capital.

161
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I will have to take care of the moon and protect it.

162
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Don't worry.

163
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Tan'er has my care.

164
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
You have to be more careful.

165
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Be careful.

166
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Tan'er,

167
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
we will meet at home.

168
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
My husband.

169
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Tan'er will stay at home.

170
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Waiting for your safety.

171
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Don't worry.

172
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Xu,

173
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Guo Bingmao is so annoying.

174
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
You should be aware.

175
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
The Ming family has a conspiracy.

176
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Guo Bingmao and Su Wenchun are in charge of the conspiracy.

177
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Su Wenchun was in the rain.

178
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Guo Bingmao took the troops.

179
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Yang Xilu is the one who saved the country.

180
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
But even if he saved the Prime Minister,

181
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
the troops won't be able to fight back.

182
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Unless...

183
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Unless he is killed by the police,

184
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
and the Prime Minister is in the same boat with him.

185
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
He will be in danger.

186
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I will go with Zhenyin.

187
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
The rest of the guards will escort you back to the capital.

188
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
When the time comes,

189
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
try to wake up.

190
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I will inform you at any time.

191
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
If the capital is really in danger,

192
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
let Yuezhang send the princess to the war.

193
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Okay.

194
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Be careful.

195
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Take care.

196
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
The war is coming!

197
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
The fire is coming!

198
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
The fire is coming!

199
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
The fire is coming!

200
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Aunt,

201
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Yang Xilu's guards are in danger.

202
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
It's urgent.

203
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I will go to the city to find the guards.

204
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I will not let him get the order.

205
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Is my father too busy with the military?

206
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
The enemy of the south army is not so strong.

207
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
At least there are a thousand people.

208
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Now Yang Xilu is in the north.

209
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Lingzhou is in the city.

210
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
He is not in danger.

211
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I'm afraid he can't hold on for long.

212
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Even if Guo Bingmao gets up,

213
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Yang Xilu still has the strength to stop him.

214
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
But Yang Xilu's army is not in control.

215
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Even if we ask for reinforcements,

216
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
no one dares to make the decision.

217
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
If we inform the imperial court at this moment,

218
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
and bring the imperial decree,

219
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
the situation will be over.

220
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Who said Yang Xilu is not in control?

221
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Someone said that

222
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
the situation is in danger.

223
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I know that Guo Bingmao's army

224
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
has a bad feeling about me.

225
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
The south army has been in Lingzhou for many years.

226
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
They are in danger.

227
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
But they are out of the force.

228
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
They are in danger.

229
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Yang Xilu is in danger.

230
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I'm afraid that

231
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
we can't ask for reinforcements.

232
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I'm afraid...

233
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
What are you afraid of?

234
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I'm afraid that you are in danger.

235
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
The old army is still in danger.

236
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
They are the people of Wenjing.

237
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I believe that they will never be defeated.

238
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Yang Xilu's order is to stop the south army from being in control.

239
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
If the south army comes, they will be the enemy.

240
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
If the military order is to be taken care of,

241
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,000
all the blame will be on me.

242
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Please think twice.

243
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
The country is in danger.

244
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
We can't let them down.

245
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I have only one thing to do.

246
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Second Young Master,

247
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I can only ask you to do this.

248
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Please do not make any trouble.

249
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Now the army is in danger.

250
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Whether Yang Xilu comes or not,

251
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Lingzhou is in danger.

252
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Tonight,

253
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
you must leave early tomorrow.

254
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I will not let you down.

255
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Please take care of yourself.

256
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Be safe.

257
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Thank you, Young Master.

258
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Master, you are so good.

259
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Yang Xilu is in danger.

260
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
The north king is really in danger.

261
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
You must be prepared.

262
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I will wait for your order.

263
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
It's time to take the throne.

264
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
The army is leaving now.

265
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
The night is dark.

266
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
The army is coming.

267
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
The army is coming.

268
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
The army is coming.

269
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
The army is coming.

270
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
The night is dark.

271
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
You must leave early tomorrow.

272
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Yes.

273
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Let me do it.

274
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Thank you.

275
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Here, put it here.

276
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Your Highness.

277
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Why did you change your way to Yang Xilu?

278
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I was afraid that Yang Xilu would be in danger.

279
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I was afraid that Yang Xilu would be in danger.

280
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I went there.

281
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
You don't have to worry.

282
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I will be back soon.

283
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
You told me to take a step forward.

284
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I will be back in Sha Xi.

285
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Let's go.

286
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Please.

287
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Please.

288
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I don't know when the south army will attack.

289
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Once the battle is over,

290
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
the forest will be burned to ashes.

291
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Blood will flow to the river.

292
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Many years of hope will come back.

293
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Hurry up.

294
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
It's a mistake.

295
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Protect the princess.

296
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Hurry up.

297
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Hurry up.

298
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
There is a trap.

299
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Master.

300
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
It's General Feng.

301
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
If you dare to act,

302
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
General Feng will kill you.

303
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I will kill you.

304
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
You don't have to worry.

305
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Do it.

306
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
He Yi.

307
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Do it.

308
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Go.

309
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Protect the princess.

310
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Go.

311
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Go.

312
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Who are you?

313
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
The southern army.

314
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
The tribe of Pu Ruo.

315
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I can meet you again.

316
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
It seems that I have a relationship with Miss Xiao.

317
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Yi Yi.

318
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Don't be impulsive.

319
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Go.

320
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Who is it?

321
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I have a date with my family today.

322
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Look at the fan.

323
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
It's so nice to meet you.

324
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Your Highness.

325
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Your Highness, you are so lucky.

326
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I am just a lucky man.

327
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Let me see.

328
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
The Imperial Concubine of the Imperial Palace is in the north of the capital.

329
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
The capital is in the border.

330
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I will leave the capital to you.

331
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
The imperial palace is in the middle of the city.

332
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
If you find anything,

333
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
send the message to the front line.

334
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
The emperor is here.

335
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I want to go to the palace of the emperor.

336
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I will go to the palace to greet the empress.

337
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I will go to the palace to rest.

338
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
No emperor is in the palace.

339
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
No one can enter the palace without permission.

340
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
The empress is the emperor.

341
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
She has already won the emperor's special permission.

342
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
She can enter the palace freely.

343
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Why is it so?

344
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Why is it not working today?

345
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
It's the past.

346
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
The present is the present.

347
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
No emperor is in the palace.

348
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
No emperor is in the palace.

349
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
It's all right.

350
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
It's so short.

351
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Why is the palace so strange?

352
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
The guards at the gate of the palace are looking at the face.

353
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
They are being taken away by the people.

354
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
The intelligence of the royal family is not wrong.

355
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Now I just don't know how the palace is going.

356
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
If the guards are really in control,

357
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I'm afraid that this war will be difficult.

358
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
If that's the case,

359
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I have to hurry home and tell the old man.

360
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Go away.

361
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Hurry up and think of a way to enter the palace.

362
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I was thinking about it.

363
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Are you afraid?

364
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
I'm afraid.

365
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
My elder sister is still in the palace.

366
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
I'm afraid.

367
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
What are you waiting for?

368
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Push.

369
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
He wants to push himself.

370
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
I can't control it.

371
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Lord Zhang, I have news.

372
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
His Majesty went to the capital to train.

373
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
He knew nothing about the palace.

374
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
How many soldiers did he bring?

375
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
He used the power of his own guards.

376
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
He only brought a thousand soldiers.

377
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
The imperial guards are investigating.

378
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
The Imperial Army is going to the capital.

379
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
The Imperial Army is going to the capital.

380
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
I'm afraid.

381
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
I'm afraid.

382
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
I'm afraid.

383
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
I'm afraid.

384
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
I'm afraid.

385
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
I'm afraid.

386
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
I'm afraid.

387
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
I'm afraid.

388
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
I'm afraid.

389
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
I'm afraid.

390
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
I'm afraid.

391
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
I'm afraid.

392
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
I'm afraid.

393
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
I'm afraid.

394
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
I'm afraid.

395
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
I'm afraid.

396
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
I'm afraid.

397
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
I'm afraid.

398
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
I'm afraid.

399
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
I'm afraid.

400
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
I'm afraid.

401
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
I'm afraid.

402
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
I'm afraid.

403
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
I'm afraid.

404
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
I'm afraid.

405
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
I'm afraid.

406
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
I'm afraid.

407
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Who is it?

408
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
A-Jing.

409
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
A-Yu.

410
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Eat.

411
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
You've eaten 50 good foods today.

412
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Who is it?

413
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Hurry.

414
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Someone is coming.

415
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Let me go.

416
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Kill him.

417
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Kill him.

418
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Go.

419
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Go.

420
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Go.

421
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Hurry.

422
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Go.

423
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Go.

424
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Your Majesty.

425
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
There are people around the capital.

426
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
There are people from Yexi and Dali Temple.

427
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
They are all killed by the criminals.

428
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
They are all killed by the criminals.

429
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Su Wenchun and Liu Mo

430
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
are all missing.

431
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
It's Yang Xilu.

432
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
The army has arrived.

433
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Let's follow the army.

434
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Let's prepare the army.

435
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Let's go.

436
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Yes.

437
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Go.

438
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
The imperial guards are here.

439
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Let's go back to the palace.

440
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
You go to the palace to protect the Empress Dowager.

441
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
The rest of you go to Changchun Palace.

442
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Yes.

443
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Let's go back to the palace.

444
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Why do you want to conquer the palace?

445
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
You are the imperial guards.

446
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Let's follow the same way.

447
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Now, which one is the commander of the Beiyahu Army?

448
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
We went to the imperial guards a few days ago.

449
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
The rest of the 16 guards from the south are here.

450
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
They are all dead.

451
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Yang Xilu sent troops to attack.

452
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
He tried to stop them.

453
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
But he was killed by the imperial guards.

454
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
He took the imperial guards as his men.

455
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
He is the one who was killed by the imperial guards.

456
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
He is the one who killed the imperial guards.

457
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
He tried to stop them.

458
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
He ordered the empress dowager to kill them.

459
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Kill them.

460
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Empress Dowager.

461
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
I have heard about the moves.

462
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
The palace and the palace are in chaos.

463
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Yang Xilu colluded with the imperial guards.

464
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Even if the palace is in chaos,

465
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
he is still in a bad mood.

466
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
If he wants to get rid of the blame

467
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
and continue to be the imperial guard,

468
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
he must have the empress dowager to be the main force.

469
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
He is the one who can control the imperial guards.

470
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
He is also the new emperor.

471
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
I thought Yu was not allowed to enter the palace.

472
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
I thought the palace was in a different situation.

473
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Now, it seems that the emperor is still in a bad mood.

474
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
He is just a little bit of a nuisance.

475
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
I didn't expect that he would be so bold

476
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
to break into the palace at night.

477
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
I don't think so.

478
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
You are just a little bit of a nuisance.

479
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
I am also worried about the empress dowager.

480
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
I just don't know how the situation is outside the palace.

481
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
The rebels have all been in the battlefield.

482
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
How could Yu have fought them

483
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
with such a cunning and cunning man?

484
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Yu has been a little bit of a nuisance.

485
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
No matter how hard he tried to get into the palace,

486
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
he didn't want to get into the palace.

487
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
But now,

488
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
I have been the one who has made him suffer.

489
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Empress dowager, you are right.

490
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
You and Yu are both in the same blood and blood.

491
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
With his personality, he must be protecting the whole of Ningzhou.

492
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
It's because of Su Wenchun who killed Qian Dao.

493
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
His Majesty should have punished him earlier.

494
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
When he was the only woman he had ever loved,

495
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
I thought he was not good.

496
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
I don't think so.

497
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
What kind of love and kindness are all made up?

498
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
I think that a man like him

499
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
who is so kind and kind and loving

500
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
will not even be able to bear the death penalty.

501
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Empress dowager,

502
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
I am sorry to disappoint you.

503
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
I am sorry to disappoint you.

504
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
I am just... I am too anxious.

505
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
I... I will...

506
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Help!

507
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
I can't.

508
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Yu! Zhang Huanyu!

509
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Zhang Huanyu!

510
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Are you all right?

511
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
I... I can't.

512
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
I am about to go see my wife.

513
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Hurry up and give her a hand.

514
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Okay.

515
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Be careful.

516
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Take it easy. Don't touch the wound.

517
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Let's go.

518
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Be careful.

519
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
You are not allowed to hide in the dark.

520
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
What kind of hero are you?

521
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
I...

522
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Yu, how come you are bleeding?

523
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
What's wrong with you?

524
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000
I... I was injured by someone here.

525
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
I... I was injured by someone here.

526
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
I was stabbed by someone.

527
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,000
And then I was injured by He Yao and Huanzhen.

528
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
I... I can't.

529
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
I was injured by someone here.

530
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
I... I am so hurt.

531
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
I am so hurt.

532
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
I... I...

533
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
No, no, no.

534
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
I... I was kidding.

535
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
I... I was kidding.

536
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
I am fine.

537
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
I was injured by someone here.

538
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
I was injured by someone here.

539
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
No.

540
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Okay, okay, okay.

541
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Don't cry.

542
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
No, no.

543
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Yu, I am really fine.

544
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Look.

545
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
I am really fine.

546
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Really?

547
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Look.

548
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
I am fine.

549
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
I am fine.

550
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
I am really fine.

551
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Yu, Yu, Yu.

552
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Wait, wait, wait.

553
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
I am fine.

554
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
I... I... I was injured by someone here.

555
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
I am really fine.

556
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Let me go.

557
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
I am fine.

558
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,000

559
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:55,040
Mom

560
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,180
This year,

561
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:13,200
she'll be刚自己

562
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:16,960
to work from Stor fall.

563
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:24,940
This is what is trains for 좋 Jennes to affect the girls of Xiyamos製造.

564
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:31,200
A perfect fit

565
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:35,980
for the sight of this nightingale-like gated declaring.

566
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:38,980
I should be able to see her.

567
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:44,580
Last time, I took a photo of the fragrance that the weak woman should use,

568
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:46,580
I wanted to give it to her.

569
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:48,580
It's a pity that I didn't get to see her.

570
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:52,980
This collection of the incense is my first gift.

571
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:56,980
Mr. Wen really has the ability to make a living.

572
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:59,980
I've been using this collection for a long time.

573
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:00,980
It's a rare skill.

574
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:03,980
I can still get it within a short time.

575
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:05,980
As long as you can do it,

576
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:07,980
as long as you can do it,

577
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:11,980
everything I did is worth it.

578
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:14,980
I'm not interested in the idea of leaving.

579
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:20,980
I just care about how Mr. Wen is going to deal with Feng's son.

580
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:30,980
Then we'll see if their son will be able to see the fragrance.

581
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:37,980
Feng's son is the leader of Lingzhou.

582
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:38,980
If I think about it,

583
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:42,980
the people of Lingzhou will surely take it seriously and take it easy on me.

584
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:44,980
If I don't think about it,

585
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:51,980
I'm just a simple and filial son.

586
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:56,980
If you're willing to accompany me on my journey today,

587
00:33:56,980 --> 00:34:00,980
I can consider Liu Feng's father's life.

588
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:11,980
Mr. Yuwen, you can go out.

589
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:12,980
Yes.

590
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:15,980
But Feng's son is not here.

591
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:17,980
I'll go with you.

592
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:19,980
I'll go with you.

593
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:22,980
But apart from Feng's father,

594
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:25,980
I can't hurt anyone around me.

595
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:28,980
I'm really envious of you.

596
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:32,980
I'm so grateful to you.

597
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:35,980
I can't let them go.

598
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:41,980
As long as you can accompany me on my journey.

599
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:46,980
If you're willing to accompany me on my journey today,

600
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:49,980
I will take care of you.

601
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:57,980
I'm not willing to accompany you on my journey today.

602
00:34:57,980 --> 00:35:01,980
I'm really envious of you.

603
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:04,980
I'm really envious of you.

604
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:07,980
I'm really envious of you.

605
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:10,980
I'm really envious of you.

606
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:12,980
I'm really envious of you.

607
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:15,980
I can't let you be free.

608
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:19,980
I'm willing to accompany you on my journey today.

609
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:23,980
If Mr. Yuwen wants to argue with me about these high-ranking scholars,

610
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:26,980
I can't help it.

611
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:30,980
Miss Xiao, please get in the carriage.

612
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:32,980
I'm a very famous woman.

613
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:34,980
I'm a man and a woman.

614
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:36,980
As a princess,

615
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:40,980
I can accompany you on my journey.

616
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:58,980
I've been living in the past for a long time.

617
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:01,980
I wonder how you are doing.

618
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:04,980
Why aren't you moving?

619
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:06,980
You should hurry up and think of a way to get out of here.

620
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:08,980
I've been thinking about it for a whole day.

621
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:11,980
If you have a way, you'll be trapped in this.

622
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:13,980
After my observation,

623
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:15,980
this kind of rope can only be broken with force.

624
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:18,980
It can only be used to fight for one position.

625
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:20,980
It will only be cut and pulled.

626
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:22,980
How can you be so strong?

627
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:28,980
You Jin Yunwei

628
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:32,980
don't have the kind of spell that can be saved by being trapped?

629
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:34,980
Jin Yunwei is also a human being.

630
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:36,980
If it's not Jin Yunwei, then it's fine.

631
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:37,980
You're right.

632
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:39,980
It's like we're trapped here.

633
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:40,980
We don't want to go out.

634
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:42,980
You said that Mr. Yuwen is not a person who can be saved by being trapped.

635
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:43,980
You won't attack me.

636
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:44,980
You're just curious.

637
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:46,980
Why are you so impulsive?

638
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:47,980
You don't know me.

639
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:48,980
Why do you ask me?

640
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:49,980
I don't know.

641
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:50,980
I've never seen anyone asking me.

642
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:52,980
He's just a greedy person.

643
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:53,980
Who is the bull?

644
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:55,980
I'm saying Zhu Yifeng.

645
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:57,980
No one is a bull.

646
00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:00,980
Yunyi, this is just a metaphor.

647
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:06,980
If I were to say, we should start with the first one.

648
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:07,980
If it weren't for Zhu Yifeng,

649
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:08,980
I would have stopped him.

650
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:09,980
I would have killed him.

651
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:10,980
If I had taken him,

652
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:12,980
we wouldn't have been in this situation.

653
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:14,980
Say something, Zhu Yifeng.

654
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:15,980
Chief.

655
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:17,980
If we really attack today,

656
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:19,980
General Feng will definitely die.

657
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:21,980
Besides, what can the Princess Consort do to fight?

658
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:23,980
Once we attack,

659
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:25,980
the Princess Consort will be in danger.

660
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:27,980
If we tell her to protect her,

661
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:29,980
she will be in danger.

662
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:30,980
That's our duty.

663
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:31,980
Wait.

664
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:34,980
You're the one who's protecting her.

665
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:36,980
You're going to get us into trouble.

666
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:37,980
Aren't you?

667
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:40,980
Aren't you the one who's following her?

668
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:41,980
I'm following her.

669
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:42,980
I can do the same.

670
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:43,980
You're not following her.

671
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:45,980
Otherwise, I'll make you go crazy.

672
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:46,980
I...

673
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:47,980
Brother Zhu Yu.

674
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:50,980
A man should be open-minded and generous.

675
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:52,980
How can he be so impulsive?

676
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:53,980
Besides,

677
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:56,980
the only woman in the south is not a gentleman.

678
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:58,980
Shut up!

679
00:37:58,980 --> 00:37:59,980
You shut up!

680
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:00,980
You shut up, too.

681
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:03,980
You all shut up.

682
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:20,980
Why did you bring me here?

683
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:21,980
What's wrong with you?

684
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:23,980
This is where I live.

685
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:24,980
I'll always be there.

686
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:28,980
No matter if she's in danger or in danger,

687
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:31,980
she won't change her original appearance.

688
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:35,980
Actually,

689
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:39,980
you're the mastermind behind Ling Zhou's death.

690
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:42,980
The mastermind behind Chief Luo's death.

691
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:45,700
Chief Luo was the one who committed the crime of

692
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:48,980
making her and Su Errong a couple.

693
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:51,980
He was the one who asked you to be his mastermind.

694
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:53,980
He committed the crime of making her and Su Errong a couple.

695
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:56,980
He's the one who can die.

696
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:58,980
He'll protect you from death.

697
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:06,980
Everyone has their own purpose and passion.

698
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:09,980
Chief Luo is doing this for the sake of the south.

699
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:12,980
Su Errong is doing this for the Su family.

700
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:14,980
He's standing in the position of the people.

701
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:16,980
He's trying to make a right guess.

702
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:20,980
What about you?

703
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:24,980
What's your purpose?

704
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:26,980
To make a right guess?

705
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:28,980
To make a right guess?

706
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:31,980
Or to make a right guess?

707
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:37,980
Look.

708
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:39,980
When I saw Kong Ming,

709
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:41,980
if I was willing to do it,

710
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:43,980
I'd be willing to do it.

711
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:45,980
What kind of wish do you have?

712
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:47,980
No matter what you wish,

713
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:50,980
the mountains and seas are clear and the sky and the sea are clear.

714
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:52,980
I'll definitely do it for you.

715
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:55,980
A few days ago,

716
00:39:57,980 --> 00:40:00,980
Linzhou City was still the most prosperous place in my country.

717
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:03,980
The people of Linzhou City were very well-off.

718
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:05,980
They were very generous.

719
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:06,980
Even when they arrived at night,

720
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:09,980
they were still as lively as the Bai Zhou City.

721
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:12,980
But since the south was in the early days,

722
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:13,980
the people were not at home.

723
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:15,980
The malls were closed.

724
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:17,980
I've always wished for it.

725
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:21,980
Without the south's order to withdraw from the county,

726
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:25,980
I would have been angry with Linzhou City forever.

727
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:30,980
You might have wished for it.

728
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:36,980
I promise.

729
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:38,980
After tonight,

730
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:40,980
Linzhou City will be more prosperous than before.

731
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:42,980
I will never hurt the people of Linzhou City.

732
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:54,980
There is no condition.

733
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:59,980
I hope you can come back to Nanlv with me.

734
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:01,980
When you return to Nanlv,

735
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:03,980
you are still the Princess Consort.

736
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:05,980
The throne is all yours.

737
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:07,980
You will only be the King of the West.

738
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:09,980
I am already the Princess Consort.

739
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:15,980
My husband is the only one.

740
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:20,980
He is the King of the North of the North of the Great County.

741
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:29,980
I know.

742
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:32,980
You were completely confused

743
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:33,980
when you were in the office.

744
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:35,980
You were a little worried.

745
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:37,980
I was a little worried.

746
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:41,980
But I can wait.

747
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:49,980
Wu Pei, what kind of a woman are you?

748
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:50,980
Jin Yunwei is a man.

749
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:52,980
He can't even recognize the King of the West.

750
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:53,980
He is even more manly than a man.

751
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:56,980
That's because he is a man.

752
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:58,980
Why are you so angry with Miss Yun?

753
00:41:58,980 --> 00:41:59,980
Why are you so angry?

754
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:01,980
I just want to be honest with you.

755
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:03,980
I haven't heard you enter the imperial palace.

756
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:04,980
I was in the back room.

757
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:05,980
I was with a girl.

758
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:06,980
I cried for half a month.

759
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:07,980
You cried because you wanted to?

760
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:08,980
You guys have never cried.

761
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:09,980
You laughed at me from the beginning.

762
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:10,980
I was right.

763
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:11,980
I laughed from the beginning.

764
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:12,980
You laughed from the beginning.

765
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:13,980
What's wrong?

766
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:14,980
I just said that.

767
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:15,980
I was just trying to be honest.

768
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:16,980
I was just trying to be honest.

769
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:17,980
Okay, you hit me.

770
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:18,980
You hit me.

771
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:19,980
Stop it.

772
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:20,980
I will beat you all up.

773
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:30,980
It's you.

774
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:32,980
It's not me.

775
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:46,980
Let's go.

776
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:01,980
General.

777
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:03,980
General.

778
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:09,980
General.

779
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:22,980
General.

780
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:28,980
General.

781
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:32,980
Open the gate!

782
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:02,600
The

783
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:04,600
The

784
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,600
The

785
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:08,600
The

786
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:10,600
The

787
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:12,600
The

788
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:14,600
The

789
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:16,600
The

790
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:18,600
The

791
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:20,600
The

792
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:22,600
The

793
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:24,600
The

794
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:26,600
The

795
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:28,600
The

796
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:30,600
The

797
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:35,600
The

798
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:39,600
The

799
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:44,600
The

800
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:46,600
The

801
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:48,600
The

802
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:52,600
The

803
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:54,600
The

804
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:58,640
The

805
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:33,640
世事的眺望

806
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:48,640
棉花里我扔下 灰发光的脸庞

807
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:56,640
手心里的盼望 倾扣在你的手上

808
00:45:57,640 --> 00:46:04,640
点满我来世的半火 有你身将爱与我

809
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:11,640
长过周夜门闯 谁在我身旁

810
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:19,640
爱某一场吗 还是你啊

811
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:32,640
别害怕我会随你去望
