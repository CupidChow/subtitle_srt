00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm going to make a little bit of a

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
little bit of a little bit of a

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
little bit of a little bit of a

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
little bit of a little bit of a little

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
bit of a little bit of a little

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
bit of a little bit of a little

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
bit of a little bit of a little

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
bit of a little bit of a little

00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
bit of a little bit of a little

00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
bit of a little bit of a little bit

00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
of a little bit of a little bit

00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
of a little bit of a little bit

of a little bit of a little bit

00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
of a little bit of a little bit

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
of a little bit of a little

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
bit of a little bit

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
of a little bit of a little

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
bit of a little bit of a little

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
bit of a little bit of a little

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
bit of a little bit of a little

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
bit of a little bit of a little

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
bit of a little bit of a little

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
bit of a little bit of a little

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
bit of a little bit of a little

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
bit of a little bit of a little

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
bit of a little bit of a little

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
bit of a little bit of a little

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
bit of a little bit of a little

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
bit of a little bit

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
bit of a little

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
bit of a little

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
bit of a little

33
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
a little

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
bit of little

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
bit of little

36
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
bit of a little

37
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
bit of a little

38
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
bit of a little bit of a little

39
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
bit of a little

40
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
bit of a little

41
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
touch

42
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,760
it

43
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
it

44
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,820
the

45
00:01:54,820 --> 00:02:03,220
Get them Niezei, 왜냐하면 Gibus, kill them all style.

46
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:07,500
Kill them all.

47
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:13,900
Kill them all style.

48
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,920
Kill them all.

49
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:20,840
Kill them all.

50
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,740
Kill them.

51
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:48,760
while Zeng Man is

52
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:57,740
Xie Tong Yang Xilu, kill the enemy together!

53
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:58,740
Yes!

54
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:25,740
Kill the enemy together!

55
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:55,740
Ah Ye!

56
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,740
Ah Ye!

57
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:24,740
Ah Ye!

58
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:26,740
Ah Ye!

59
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:27,740
Let him go!

60
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:28,740
Let him go!

61
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:32,740
Don't kill him!

62
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:34,740
Put the sword down!

63
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:35,740
Put it down!

64
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:46,740
Put it down!

65
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:47,740
Put it down!

66
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:48,740
Otherwise, I'll kill him right away!

67
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:51,740
Put it down!

68
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:53,740
Put it down!

69
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:03,740
Zeng Shu, let go of me.

70
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:05,740
Xiao Wangyue!

71
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,740
I order you to let go of me!

72
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:13,740
No.

73
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,740
I'm not smart.

74
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:18,740
I only take care of Xiao Wangyue's safety.

75
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:19,740
I can't do anything else.

76
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:21,740
All of you, push him away!

77
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:22,740
Let Xiao Wangyue go!

78
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:29,740
Push him away!

79
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:31,740
Otherwise, I'll kill him right away!

80
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:35,740
Push him away!

81
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,740
Xiao Wangyue, go!

82
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:44,740
Go!

83
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:49,740
When the bell rings,

84
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:52,740
we can't leave without a way.

85
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:55,740
We can't leave without a way.

86
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:02,740
All right.

87
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:04,740
No matter what,

88
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,740
I'll keep Xiao Wangyue alive and well.

89
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:09,740
But...

90
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:11,740
But Xiao Wangyue is in this world today.

91
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:12,740
It's all because of him!

92
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:14,740
I'll kill him first

93
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:16,740
and then I'll die with you.

94
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:18,740
Stop!

95
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:19,740
Stop!

96
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:32,740
Your Highness.

97
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:42,740
Your Highness.

98
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:07,740
I can't take Ling Zhou.

99
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:10,740
I can't get out of the place of my life.

100
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:15,740
I can't get you.

101
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,740
I can't say I'm dead.

102
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:21,740
Mr. Wen!

103
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:26,740
I'm so sorry

104
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,740
that I can't meet you.

105
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:38,740
I'm sorry.

106
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:08,740
Let me go!

107
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:09,740
Where are you taking me?

108
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:15,740
Your Highness.

109
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:38,740
Why?

110
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:40,740
You're still so quiet.

111
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:42,740
You even came to see me?

112
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:45,740
You saw it?

113
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:46,740
Are you satisfied?

114
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:49,740
Sen is my daughter.

115
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:53,740
She's my father's son-in-law.

116
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,740
Blood and water are the same.

117
00:08:58,740 --> 00:08:59,740
If I want to harm you

118
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,740
or come here to see you

119
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:02,740
and see you laugh,

120
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:05,740
what's the point of talking to me?

121
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,740
Now, we don't need to

122
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:11,740
be so selfish.

123
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:12,740
There's no outsider here.

124
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:14,740
You don't have to act anymore.

125
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:30,740
We were not so close.

126
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:32,740
But how to change the situation

127
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:34,740
is just a matter of time

128
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,740
for ordinary girls.

129
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:40,740
Even if you say you're cold,

130
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,740
it's not worth mentioning.

131
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:44,740
But you're so selfish.

132
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:46,740
You care about the reputation of the Ming family

133
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:49,740
and the innocence of the father.

134
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:51,740
If you're involved,

135
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:53,740
you're not only in the family,

136
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:55,740
but also in the people.

137
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:58,740
Sen must understand

138
00:09:58,740 --> 00:09:59,740
how powerful you are.

139
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:00,740
Why do you have to

140
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:01,740
be so selfish

141
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,740
for the money you've invested?

142
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:09,740
Master.

143
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,740
You've been suffering these days.

144
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:15,740
The intention of the Kou and A-ye

145
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,740
is not to punish you.

146
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:19,740
You've already married into the Feng family

147
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:21,740
and become the Feng family.

148
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:24,740
The whole Feng family is ruined

149
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,740
and destroyed.

150
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,740
If you're still obsessed with the cloth,

151
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:31,740
you'll be hurt in the end.

152
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,740
You're still the one who's hurt.

153
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:35,740
You're the one who's hurt.

154
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:37,740
But if he's always right,

155
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,740
he's always trying to make me hurt.

156
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,740
What can I do about it?

157
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:44,740
If you really can't see me well,

158
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:46,740
you'll be the queen

159
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:48,740
of the capital.

160
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:49,740
The two of us

161
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,740
are not related.

162
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:52,740
Ming Chu.

163
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:56,740
Is this really what you think?

164
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:07,740
If you speak like했어요,

165
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,740
I can go back to the capital.

166
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:12,740
No need to worry about your future.

167
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,400
Why do I have to

168
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,740
argue with you?

169
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:26,740
What's going on?

170
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:32,740
I second thought

171
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:34,740
I came to see you.

172
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:44,740
Sister San.

173
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,740
I hope you can live well.

174
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:52,740
I hope our family can be good.

175
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:59,740
I sincerely hope that you can live your life you want.

176
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:05,740
Sister San is so beautiful.

177
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:08,740
We can't have any experience in our family.

178
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:11,740
Let me help you to dress up.

179
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:33,740
Sister San.

180
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:47,740
I don't know.

181
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:51,740
There is someone who always hangs on your comfort.

182
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:56,740
I wonder if you live a happy life.

183
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:57,740
I am sorry.

184
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,740
If he sees your face,

185
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:07,740
he will be heartbroken.

186
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:22,740
Aunt.

187
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:25,740
Aunt.

188
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:27,740
Su Huan.

189
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:40,740
Chuchu.

190
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:44,740
It's ok.

191
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:45,740
It's all over.

192
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:46,740
Look.

193
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:47,740
Look.

194
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:50,740
Aunt is doing well.

195
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:52,740
Don't worry.

196
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:58,740
Chuchu.

197
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:04,740
I know that you want to grow up in Yangxi Road.

198
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:06,740
Now you are in a good mood.

199
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:08,740
You are in a lot of trouble.

200
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:12,740
You are not a good person.

201
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:16,740
Don't be impulsive.

202
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,740
You have to live your life.

203
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:19,740
I am sorry.

204
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:27,740
As long as Sister San is willing,

205
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:31,740
Ming family and A-Yin,

206
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,740
I will be your support.

207
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:50,740
Ming Chu.

208
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:51,740
In the future,

209
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:53,740
if you miss me,

210
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:55,740
I will accompany you to the capital.

211
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:58,740
Don't worry.

212
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:01,740
I will be like before.

213
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:03,740
I will be with you for life.

214
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:07,740
Aunt.

215
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:09,740
I am sorry.

216
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:14,740
It's ok.

217
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:15,740
Get up.

218
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:16,740
It's ok.

219
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:17,740
Get up.

220
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:20,740
It's not important to see Aunt again.

221
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:23,740
I will not let you down.

222
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:27,740
I trust you.

223
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:46,740
Aunt.

224
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:47,740
Aunt.

225
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:15,740
Your Majesty.

226
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:17,740
It couldn't have gone well by myself.

227
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:19,740
My wishes are with you!

228
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:22,740
Master Guo all my life.

229
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:25,740
You and your son is making laws.

230
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:27,740
So I can do it.

231
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:29,740
The children say nothing to you.

232
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:32,740
We need to stay calm.

233
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:37,740
Your children say what you don't want to say.

234
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,740
But they will won't listen.

235
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:41,740
If I am forced,

236
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,740
my father won't shut me down.

237
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:46,860

241
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,780

262
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:38,860
To the palace.

263
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,660
Yu!

264
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:48,260
The emperor is the only one who can use Lu Ting.

265
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,380
If we move out of Lu Ting,

266
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:51,140
our army will be defeated.

267
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:52,860
Chase!

268
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:00,340
Let's go!

269
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:41,540
Stop the emperor!

270
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:51,380
Your Majesty,

271
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:53,660
the Yang Xilu army has come to suppress the enemy.

272
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:55,300
I have used your skills

273
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,340
to kill two people with Guo Bing.

274
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:59,460
But the number of the army is still in the army.

275
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:00,660
There is still something to suppress.

276
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:12,420
catching both

277
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,540

281
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:41,660
Kill!

282
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:01,660
Gu Lingma, you colluded with the evil devil.

283
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,660
Have you ever thought about your own death?

284
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:06,660
Sang Jia Zhi Xuan, what right do you have to say this to yourself?

285
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:11,660
Kill!

286
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:42,660
Your Majesty!

287
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:01,660
Kill!

288
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:11,660
Kill!

289
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:13,660
Kill!

290
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:37,660
Your Majesty, forgive me.

291
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:39,660
I'm here to save you.

292
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:41,660
I'm not late.

293
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:46,660
Today, I will take the moon and ask Yang Xilu to take care of it.

294
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:49,660
Ding Bei Jun, kill!

295
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:54,660
Kill!

296
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:56,660
You are a traitor!

297
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:58,660
The country is in trouble.

298
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:00,660
I will follow you to the battlefield.

299
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:03,660
I will kill you and kill you to death.

300
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:05,660
Kill!

301
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:09,660
What about Ding Bei Jun?

302
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:11,660
I will take the moon and kill you to death.

303
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:13,660
I will take the moon and kill you to death.

304
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:15,660
Kill!

305
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:17,660
Kill!

306
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:34,660
Ding Bei Jun, you are too weak to look at me.

307
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:36,660
You are just a coward.

308
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:38,660
You want to turn the world around?

309
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:40,660
Send the empress to the battlefield.

310
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:42,660
Kill the enemy.

311
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:44,660
Yes.

312
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:46,660
After you have eaten the empress,

313
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:48,660
Yang Xilu is just a middle-aged army.

314
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:50,660
He only knows how to fight with the enemy.

315
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:52,660
The country is in trouble.

316
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:54,660
I will kill you.

317
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:58,660
Good.

318
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:00,660
I will take a look at Ding Bei Jun.

319
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:02,660
How can I turn the world around?

320
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:04,660
Kill!

321
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:16,660
I will kill you.

322
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:46,660
Lord Xiang,

323
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:48,660
do you have a word?

324
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:16,660
When did you

325
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:18,660
enter my door?

326
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:21,660
15 years ago.

327
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:25,660
For 15 years,

328
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:28,660
I helped you to escape from the camp.

329
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:30,660
I have been a good man.

330
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:32,660
I tried to make it through the capital.

331
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:34,660
I have no other choice.

332
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:37,660
You can only kill me and kill him.

333
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:39,660
That country was full of people.

334
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:41,660
I will kill you.

335
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:44,660
I will use my power to kill the enemy.

336
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:47,660
I will kill you.

337
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:58,660
It seems that

338
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:00,660
many years have passed.

339
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:03,660
I have been taking care of you.

340
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:08,660
I can't resist the rumors.

341
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:13,660
You know who is the one

342
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:16,660
who is the one who is the one to kill the enemy.

343
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:19,660
Maybe it's not true.

344
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:21,660
But Brother Si's words

345
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:25,660
are not fake.

346
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:28,660
He ordered you to kill my father.

347
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:39,660
I have no other choice.

348
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:43,660
Why do you have to be so stubborn?

349
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:48,660
I have decided to kill you

350
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:51,660
just like Brother Si.

351
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:56,660
I will not let you down.

352
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:58,660
But

353
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:03,660
my father can't die.

354
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:05,660
He is just a little boy.

355
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:08,660
How can he die with no life?

356
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:13,660
I will not let you down.

357
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:21,660
But I will sacrifice my life for my father.

358
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:24,660
This sword will

359
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:28,660
return my life to Xiang Yan.

360
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:11,660
You can't escape.

361
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:37,660
You can't take what I have.

362
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:39,660
Why do you have to be so stubborn?

363
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:44,660
If you don't want to die,

364
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:47,660
I will sacrifice my life for my father.

365
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:51,660
I will sacrifice my life for my father.

366
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:08,660
No.

367
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:38,660
No.

368
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:08,660
No.

Because she moves up and down

379
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:02,980
shall be used as sir

380
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:04,940
presenter

381
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:06,720
You promised

382
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,520
twenty more length

383
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,960
Having a Exact Bonus

384
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:37,220
Calm down,

385
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:42,460
dad said

386
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:44,780
things are gonna be better for you.

387
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:47,820
I will returned all my validate

388
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:49,740
once we are dead.

389
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:51,060
Ok.

390
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:03,660
Go back to the chest room getting a safe.

391
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:05,660
You and Su Wen Chun

392
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:07,660
are the ones who will ruin the goods!

393
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:08,660
You and Su Wen Chun

394
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:11,660
are the ones who will ruin the goods!

395
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:14,660
The Fourth Prince

396
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:16,660
also investigated the truth

397
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:17,660
about the Princess Consort.

398
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:19,660
The real master of the Fourth Prince

399
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:20,660
is the Su family.

400
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:22,660
It's not the Empress.

401
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:24,660
You said that

402
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:25,660
in the Imperial Library

403
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:26,660
that the two demons

404
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:28,660
were just making up stories

405
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:30,660
and making up stories.

406
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:31,660
No, Your Majesty.

407
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:32,660
Your Majesty, it's Su Zui!

408
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:33,660
It's Su Zui!

409
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:35,660
It's Su Zui who forced me to do this, Your Majesty!

410
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:36,660
Take him away.

411
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:38,660
Call the Court of Judicial Review

412
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:40,660
and make a law.

413
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:41,660
Yes, Your Majesty.

414
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:43,660
Your Majesty, you're right.

415
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:44,660
Your Majesty, you're right!

416
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:45,660
It's Su Zui!

417
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:47,660
It's all Su Zui's rules!

418
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:49,660
Your Majesty! Your Majesty, open the door!

419
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:04,660
Xu,

420
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:06,660
this is a mess.

421
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:08,660
I've finally won with you.

422
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:17,660
Why are you looking at me?

423
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:19,660
If I come here today

424
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:21,660
and you fail to admit your defeat,

425
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:23,660
what will Your Majesty do?

426
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:25,660
Kang Kai is dead.

427
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:28,660
You're now a member of the State of Xu.

428
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:35,660
Your Highness, I have a favor to ask.

429
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:37,660
But Your Majesty, you have to go out personally.

430
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:38,660
Your Majesty,

431
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:40,660
only he can make the rebels

432
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:43,660
not have him in the court.

433
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:45,660
Xu, don't listen to me.

434
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:48,660
I just believe that you can make a big deal out of this.

435
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:49,660
Look,

436
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:51,660
isn't there anything wrong?

437
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:53,660
What else do you want?

438
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:56,660
Your Majesty!

439
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:58,660
Your Majesty!

440
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:00,660
The Palace is here to report that

441
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:02,660
the Empress Dowager is already in Shoukang Palace.

442
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:04,660
She's already returned to her own place.

443
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:31,660
Xu.

444
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:34,660
Xu.

445
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:42,660
I told you so many things just now.

446
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:43,660
Did you hear it?

447
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:44,660
I heard it.

448
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:46,660
How did I realize that

449
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:47,660
the Princess Consort is not here

450
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:49,660
and you've been in a state of mourning?

451
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:50,660
Even the important matters of the court

452
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:52,660
have all been thrown out of the Ninth and the Clouds.

453
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:54,660
Is that true?

454
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:58,660
Has the Princess Consort already gone to the capital?

455
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:03,660
I just calculated it.

456
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:06,660
It should be in two days.

457
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:10,660
The Buddha is here.

458
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:13,660
The bride is in the Prince of Dingbei's Mansion.

459
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:16,660
Although I've already re-published the scriptures for the Buddha,

460
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:18,660
but I'm so lucky that

461
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:20,660
the bride is not afraid to turn around

462
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:21,660
and comes to the palace personally.

463
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:23,660
The bride is in the palace.

464
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:24,660
I hope that the two forces

465
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:26,660
that the Princess Consort of Dingbei's Mansion

466
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:27,660
has been able to produce

467
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:29,660
the two forces that the Princess Consort of Dingbei's Mansion

468
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:32,660
has been able to open the hall and build the ward.

469
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:34,660
If it's not enough,

470
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:36,660
it's fine to have three forces.

471
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:39,660
The bride has one more wish.

472
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:41,660
I want to come to the Buddha's Mansion

473
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:43,660
and have it done.

474
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:47,660
The bride is not afraid to ask too much.

475
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:48,660
She only wants

476
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:52,660
to be safe and sound.

477
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:54,660
When the sweet potato falls,

478
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:56,660
everything will be fine.

479
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:58,660
If she can be considerate,

480
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:00,660
it will be the best if the bride

481
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:01,660
is less affected.

482
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:03,660
Isn't it just that there is still one or two days left?

483
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:04,660
Xu En.

484
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:15,660
This is

485
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:19,660
the first time.

486
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:21,660
The bride also heard

487
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:25,660
that the first wife and son are very proud and filial.

488
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:28,660
The second wife and son are also very proud.

489
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:30,660
The god is very stupid.

490
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:33,660
The bride only wants to be safe and sound.

491
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:35,660
When the marriage is done,

492
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:37,660
the marriage is done.

493
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:57,660
Husband.

494
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:02,660
Why is husband here?

495
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:04,660
Didn't you say that he will be back the day after tomorrow?

496
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:11,660
Tan wants to miss husband.

497
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:13,660
So he asked them to make a fast journey.

498
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:16,660
Have you been tired from the long journey?

499
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:19,660
Yes, I am a little tired.

500
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:22,660
But it's worth seeing husband.

501
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:29,660
This time, I suffered a lot.

502
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:33,660
But after I am back, I will rest well.

503
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:35,660
I will not come back if I am better.

504
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:37,660
I can't bear to suffer.

505
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:40,660
I think that this is a good thing.

506
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:43,660
I can't help but to open my eyes

507
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:47,660
and understand the great will of the family.

508
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:51,660
It's been more than ten years.

509
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:52,660
It's meaningful.

510
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:55,660
You still want to bring Tan back?

511
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:58,660
If I don't bring Tan back,

512
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:00,660
I will die every day.

513
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:02,660
I can't do anything.

514
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:05,660
In the future, where is Tan?

515
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:07,660
Where is my husband?

516
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:16,660
Tan said that

517
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:19,660
peace is healthy and the land is good.

518
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:21,660
What do you mean?

519
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:24,660
I don't know.

520
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:42,660
Is it?

521
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:45,660
I can't say no to the last three months.

522
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:46,660
Really?

523
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:49,660
Before Buddha, I dare not open my eyes.

524
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:56,660
I haven't said

525
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:58,660
where you just came from.

526
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:14,660
It's weird.

527
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:16,660
The mansion is so quiet today.

528
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:20,660
Tan, you really forgot your sister.

529
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:22,660
You didn't even tell me when you came back.

530
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:26,660
Tan.

531
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:29,660
Miss Liao, the princess is still in a coma.

532
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:30,660
Can you please calm down?

533
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:32,660
When is she still in a coma?

534
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:33,660
I will go to her.

535
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:34,660
I have to...

536
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:39,660
I have to let the princess rest.

537
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:41,660
She needs to wait for her.

538
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:44,660
What's wrong with you?

539
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:52,660
It's not right.

540
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:54,660
You are all wrong.

541
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:56,660
Tell me.

542
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:59,660
Why do you want to talk like this?

543
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:01,660
I want to talk like this.

544
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:03,660
I want to talk like this.

545
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:08,660
Prince Dingbei, please don't.

546
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:09,660
Please.

547
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:10,660
I beg you.

548
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:11,660
I beg you.

549
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:12,660
I beg you.

550
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:14,660
A-Xu, don't be so petty.

551
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:16,660
Just say two words.

552
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:18,660
One word, one word is enough.

553
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:20,660
What did you prepare before the marriage?

554
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:21,660
What did you prepare?

555
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:22,660
You were nervous.

556
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:24,660
What did you do to calm down?

557
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:27,660
You taught me a lot when I was in a coma.

558
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:30,660
You said you had experience.

559
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:32,660
What's wrong with you now?

560
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:36,660
One word is one word.

561
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,660
Besides, I only talk about the ice.

562
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:41,660
How can I compare with your physical experience?

563
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:43,660
You are in a coma for three years.

564
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:46,660
Who knows if there will be any changes?

565
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:48,660
A-Xu, there will be no changes.

566
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:51,660
It's not easy to change.

567
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:54,660
You are in a coma.

568
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:55,660
Why do you need to worry?

569
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:59,660
I just think that the marriage is a big deal.

570
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:02,660
That's why I want to add my own little mind.

571
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:07,660
Besides, I can also show my good intentions.

572
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:15,660
Prince, the emperor will make up all the soldiers who have been sent to the capital this year.

573
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:21,660
I know how to be interested and have fun.

574
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:24,660
I have many ideas and intent to cases.

575
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:25,660
I do not have time to chat with you.

576
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:29,660
You are in Prince's mansion now.

577
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:31,640
Zhang, young master,는г hiять

578
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:36,660
They, They will have to honestly talk

579
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:38,260
as a whole

580
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:41,760
I'm adept squandered by really encontramos this hammer on that glass.

581
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,760
The color is not attractive, but it's apparent

582
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:46,760
I'm sure A-Tan will think of me.

583
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:47,760
Is it fun?

584
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:48,760
It's fun.

585
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:49,760
Not only fun,

586
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,760
but also delicious and light.

587
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,760
Then you must wear me

588
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:54,760
next time.

589
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:55,760
I do.

590
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:57,760
But maybe Zhang Shizi

591
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,760
won't come to me for trouble.

592
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:02,760
By the way,

593
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:04,760
Wen Taoghe has a new script.

594
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:05,760
When do you have time?

595
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:06,760
I'll go with you.

596
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:08,760
Okay, I want to go.

597
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:09,760
If you want to go,

598
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:10,760
you can go with me.

599
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:11,760
I'll go with you.

600
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:12,760
I'll go with you.

601
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:13,760
If you want to go,

602
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:15,760
you can go with me.

603
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,760
When did you get interested in the script?

604
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:22,760
A-Tan,

605
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:23,760
why don't we go shopping

606
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:24,760
with you?

607
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:25,760
It's good that Li's shop

608
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:26,760
has a new style of

609
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:27,760
the style of the poem.

610
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:28,760
It's so delicious.

611
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:29,760
I really like it.

612
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:30,760
The style of the poem is so good.

613
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:31,760
You don't have to eat it.

614
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:36,760
Why don't you

615
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:37,760
take all the letters

616
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:38,760
back?

617
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:39,760
Take your time.

618
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:42,760
A-Tan, are you tired?

619
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:43,760
I'm not.

620
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:46,760
Do you need some money?

621
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:47,760
I'm not hungry.

622
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,760
I'd better take some money.

623
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:51,760
Su Qin.

624
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:53,760
Yes.

625
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:55,760
Okay.

626
00:43:58,760 --> 00:43:59,760
A-Tan.

627
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:01,760
Turn around.

628
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:02,760
Turn around.

629
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:04,760
Turn around.

630
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:05,760
Turn around.

631
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:06,760
Turn around.

632
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:08,760
A-Tan,

633
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:09,760
did your son-in-law

634
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:10,760
get a lot of shoes?

635
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:11,760
He

636
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:12,760
is a little bit greedy.

637
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:13,760
He can find a way.

638
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:15,760
If the man after marriage

639
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:16,760
is this kind of rascal,

640
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:17,760
I'm sure he won't marry you.

641
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,760
You can't say that.

642
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:21,760
A thousand people, a thousand faces.

643
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:22,760
I'm different from A-Tan.

644
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:24,760
A-Tan is not a love-hate relationship.

645
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:25,760
How can you

646
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:27,760
talk to me about the script?

647
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:29,760
You and I...

648
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:10,760
I'm not a man.

649
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:12,760
I'm not a man.

650
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:14,760
I'm not a man.

651
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:16,760
I'm not a man.

652
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:18,760
I'm not a man.

653
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:20,760
I'm not a man.

654
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:22,760
I'm not a man.

655
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:24,760
I'm not a man.

656
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:26,760
I'm not a man.

657
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:28,760
I'm not a man.

658
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:30,760
I'm not a man.

659
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:32,760
I'm not a man.

660
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:34,760
I'm not a man.

661
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:36,760
I'm not a man.

662
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:38,760
I'm not a man.

663
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:40,760
I'm not a man.

664
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:42,760
I'm not a man.

665
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:44,760
I'm not a man.

666
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:46,760
I'm not a man.

667
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:48,760
I'm not a man.

668
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:50,760
I'm not a man.

669
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:52,760
I'm not a man.

670
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:54,760
I'm not a man.

671
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:56,760
I'm not a man.

672
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:58,760
I'm not a man.

673
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:00,760
I'm not a man.

674
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:02,760
I'm not a man.

675
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,760
I'm not a man.

676
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:06,760
I'm not a man.

677
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:08,760
I'm not a man.

678
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:10,760
I'm not a man.

679
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:12,760
I'm not a man.

680
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:14,760
Where is he?

681
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:16,760
He is near my door.

682
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:18,760
Who wants to see him?

683
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:20,760
I'll come later.

684
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:22,760
No.

685
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:24,760
Are you done?

686
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:26,760
No, no need, I will go.

687
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:28,760
The food is on sale.

688
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:30,760
I'm running.

689
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:02,760
Oh
