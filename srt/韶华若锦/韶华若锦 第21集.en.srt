Pardon me.

What do Your Highness mean?

What exactly led to

Young Lord Zhang's misfortune?

00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,800
Upon his arrival,

10

the young lord kept visiting

the 180 entertainment spots.

12
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,800
He declined most of

the Maritime Trade Bureau's invitations.

That night, it was raining heavily.

53

that a generous lady

It's said that she is a perceptive woman

Yes, Your Highness are right.

I have a report to make.

164

Before dinner, Prefect Zhang told me

165

that something peculiar had been found

in Young Lord Zhang's case.

The young lord

168
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,180
was assigned by the Emperor to

169
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:35,440
investigate the tax collection here.

170
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,160
He probably discovered
that the administrator

171
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,680
of the Maritime Trade Bureau
embezzled funds,

172
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,290
and that he and the officers under him

173
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:42,350
were in collusion.

174
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,250
They failed to get
the young lord on their side,

175
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,910
so they decided to murder him.

176
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,080
Rest assured, Your Highness.

177
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,400
Prefect Zhang will find out the truth

178
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:51,420
and seek justice for the young lord.

179
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,460
Yes, I will.

180
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,040
Your Highness, I assure you

181
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,300
that I will get to the bottom of this case.

182
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:57,470
With Your Highness here,

183
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:59,710
I believe the case will be solved.

184
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:11,090
Then I'll write a memorial tonight to inform

185
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:12,620
the Emperor of this matter.

186
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,030
Young Lord Zhang

187
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,560
can finally put his mind at ease

188
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,420
as he recuperates in the capital.

189
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,080
Young Lord Zhang has been found?

190
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:28,850
I deliberately

191
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,800
concealed his tracks.

192
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,200
Otherwise, I'm afraid

193
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,530
he wouldn't live to see the capital again.

194
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,340
Your Highness must be joking.

195
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,690
This is a welcome party.

196
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:43,200
In the presence of me, a female,

197
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,200
it's better to change the topic now.

198
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:46,390
Well,

199
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:48,690
Your Highness and Officer Shu
just arrived not long ago.

200
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:50,170
I bet you haven't watched

201
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,960
the famous dance here.

202
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:19,260
[Xianquan Restaurant]

203
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,050
Silk production has been affected

204
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:19,440
by the heavy rainfall in the south this year.

205
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,100
The cost of raw silk has

206
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,410
increased by 30%.

207
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,830
I really can't accept a lower price.

208
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:25,560
Or I'll suffer a terrible loss.

209
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:26,620
If you agree

210
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:28,100
to seal the deal now,

211
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:29,710
you'll be our primary

212
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:30,640
business partner for

213
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,040
all the future orders.

214
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,800
Sounds feasible.

215
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,680
I'll make a little compromise then.

216
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,140
This deal comes second

217
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:39,900
to

218
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:41,210
our friendship.

219
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,440
-Great. Deal!
-Sure.

220
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,070
A deal was closed

221
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,200
over several drinks.

222
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,240
Typical Lingzhou style.

223
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,700
It's indeed different from the capital,

224
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:52,440
where commerce is less valued.

225
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,920
I even start to think

226
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:54,880
this city is more

227
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,540
prosperous than the capital.

228
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:57,320
My Lady,

229
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,300
didn't you

230
00:11:58,330 --> 00:11:59,530
already call it a day?

231
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,440
How can I miss out on

232
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:03,560
the famous 180

233
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,340
entertainment spots?

234
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:07,920
Waiter!

235
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:08,950
Coming!

236
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:11,970
How can I help?

237
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,790
I'd like a portion

238
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,550
of the signature chicken stew,

239
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,980
marinated fish slices,

240
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,170
noodles cooked in duck broth

241
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:19,320
and the five-colored steamed cake.

242
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,160
Got it.

243
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:24,780
Mr. Wu, this fabric doesn't

244
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,200
seem as good as before.

245
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,440
If you mean to pass it off
as quality goods,

246
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,400
then we shouldn't be

247
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,660
cooperating anymore.

248
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,520
Mr. Wen,

249
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:36,320
I wouldn't dare do such a thing.

250
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,140
The quality of this batch is nearly

251
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,670
the same as the former ones.

252
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,920
Unfortunately, it has been rained on,

253
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,720
so the texture is not very ideal.

254
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,700
After it's washed and ironed,

255
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,180
it'll be as good as before.

256
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,500
You're a top merchant

257
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:51,010
in Lingzhou.

258
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,160
Anything you sell

259
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,070
will become a hit product.

260
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:56,220
I'm drawn

261
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,160
by your good reputation.

262
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,800
It is a common type of tie-dyed silk.

263
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,580
Its color seems wrong, tough.

264
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:05,030
The domestically produced kind
is in a light and soft

265
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:06,030
shade of green,

266
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,080
unlike this, heavy and dull.

267
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,430
Show some leniency, sir.

268
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:12,930
I'm sure these tiny flaws won't matter.

269
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,840
40% of the profits will be
yours and 60% mine.

270
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:17,670
We'll both be happy then, right?

271
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:21,200
Its inferior texture

272
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,830
doesn't result from rain,

273
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:24,470
but the low

274
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,940
thread density.

275
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:28,490
That's why it seems loose and rough.

276
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,730
Care to share more insights with us, miss?

277
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:44,830
Lingzhou is a major national trade hub.

278
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:47,080
Mr. Wu is selling shoddy cloths as premium fabric.

279
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,920
This is unethical.

280
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,720
If all merchants defraud

281
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,720
people like you do,

282
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,570
Lingzhou's reputation as a trading center

283
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:56,970
will be ruined, won't it?

284
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:58,660
You're right, miss.

285
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:00,860
I can't agree more.

286
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:05,980
Mr. Wu, pardon me.

287
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:08,250
For not drinking with you.

Are you hired by a cloth merchant

290
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:16,990
to disrupt this deal?

291
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,440
-Mr. Wu.
-Ouch!

How flattering. But I'm afraid not, sir.

I just said a few words.

Not a big favor, I'd say.

I believe all merchants visiting Lingzhou

311

00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:33,990
[Xianquan Restaurant]

347
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,430
If such a restaurant

348
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:35,160
were opened in the capital,

349
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:37,290
it would attract many customers.

350
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:40,310
The five-colored steamed cake

351
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,260
was delicious, with a lovely aftertaste.

352
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,880
Give me a sec, My Lady.

353
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,710
I'll pack up a portion for you.

354
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,500
Little lady, smarten up.

355
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:57,540
Come with us.

356
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,290
-Let’s have fun.
-How dare you!

357
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,300
Quite feisty, huh?

358
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:04,810
Zhuiyu!

359
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,360
Mind your own business!

360
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,700
Are you alright, miss?

361
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,160
My Lady, are you okay?

362
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,090
Yes, I'm fine.

363
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,840
Thank you for your help, sir.

364
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:25,770
You're welcome.

365
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,170
Zhuiyu!

366
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:31,920
Stop it.

367
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,700
I just destroyed a business deal.

368
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:40,930
That attack was not a surprise.

369
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:42,300
Now that I'm safe and sound,

370
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,500
let's not make a fuss.

371
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:46,810
Miss, you know Mr. Wu planned for that.

372
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:48,680
Why not report it to the magistrate's office?

373
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,680
I would be happy

374
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:50,770
to testify for you.

375
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:52,950
Plus, I'm familiar with the officers.

376
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:54,890
It was no big deal.

377
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:57,320
No need to bother the magistrate's office.

378
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,970
I'm somewhat influential

379
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:00,240
in Lingzhou.

380
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:02,730
As long as you want,

381
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:04,490
I'll make sure Mr. Wu

382
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:06,310
never shows up in the city again.

383
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,020
That is unnecessary.

384
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:11,780
I appreciate your thought, though.

385
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:12,560
Goodbye.

386
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,720
What a detached

387
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:31,640
and elegant lady.

388
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:38,200
A drink for Your Highness.

389
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:52,930
Your Highness,

390
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,200
are you satisfied

391
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,820
with Miss Qingyu's service?

392
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,020
Your Highness are away from home.

393
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,260
You need someone to

394
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,560
take care of you.

395
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,120
Guards and maids can't be

396
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,900
compared with

397
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:08,330
a tender and pretty lady.

398
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:18,670
About the tax payment

399
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:20,130
Your Highness asked for,

400
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,120
I must tell the truth.

401
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:24,610
Given the terrible weather
in recent years,

402
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:26,190
many of our ships have been damaged.

403
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:27,600
The Maritime Trade Bureau

404
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,730
faces a dire financial situation now.

405
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,170
Is there any room for negotiation

406
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,670
on the tax payment?

407
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:44,580
Ms. Su,

408
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,560
what do you think?

409
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:54,030
Fill Ms. Su's glass.

410
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:56,460
Do it now, you.

411
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:00,550
Yes.

412
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,200
I'm glad your fine china

413
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,800
didn't fall onto the ground.

414
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,640
You even failed to fill a glass.

415
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,040
How can you serve me well?

416
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:38,530
Officer Yu, you must've spent

417
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:40,390
a fortune hiring these beauties.

418
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,410
I bet the bureau is abundant
in financial resources.

419
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,000
That tax payment won't

420
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:46,370
be a problem for you.

421
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:48,420
In this case,

422
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:49,920
Officer Yu, please

423
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,440
pay interest as well, according

424
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,900
to the common market rate.

425
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,690
It'll be of help to the national treasury.

426
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,420
Yun Yi is nowhere

427
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:05,950
to be found in Su's Mansion.

428
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,720
The Su family has taken Yun Yi hostage.

429
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,840
If she is not here,

430
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,700
she must be hidden by Haiyou Sect.

431
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,530
But they don't have a fixed residence.

432
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:16,020
Where could they possibly hide Yun Yi?

433
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,580
Don't worry.

434
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,720
Whoever did it has given himself away.

435
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,640
I'm sure Yun Yi will be fine.

436
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,610
What do you mean?

437
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,210
Are you onto something now?

438
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:27,530
I'm waiting to hear from Jinyun Guards.

439
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,210
In the dinner party,

440
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:42,010
what was the prince trying to do?

441
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,720
Why would he suddenly

442
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:45,690
take a different attitude?

443
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,780
Was he not satisfied with Qingyu's service?

444
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,390
My love,

445
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,480
I don't think Qingyu is to blame.

446
00:23:56,930 --> 00:23:58,330
What was the reason then?

447
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:00,380
It is probable

448
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:02,990
that we're not allowed to take a share

449
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:05,210
of future tax collection.

450
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:07,990
But paying back what we've owed
in the past five years

451
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:09,850
might not be the Emperor's order.

452
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:12,100
Are you saying

453
00:24:12,130 --> 00:24:14,090
it's Prince of Dingbei's own idea?

454
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:14,820
My love,

455
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:17,740
during Zhang Huaiyu's inspection,

456
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:20,360
he said nothing about this payment.

457
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,540
Prince of Dingbei is

458
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,680
so greedy.

459
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,440
My love,

460
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:33,280
did your father's letter mention

461
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,070
anything about how to tackle this problem?

462
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,640
I'm glad that the prince
made this request.

463
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,270
At least, he wouldn't stubbornly

464
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:41,600
probe into this matter.

465
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,150
It won't be a massive loss.

466
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:47,000
We can earn it back sooner or later.

467
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,720
I'll have the money prepared.

468
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,180
My father told me to

469
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,810
drive the prince away from Lingzhou soon.

470
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,360
What may happen to him on his way

471
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,480
back to the capital

472
00:24:58,850 --> 00:25:01,410
won't have anything to do
with the Su family.

473
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:10,960
I'm glad

474
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,350
you kept my fine china safe.

475
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,400
I spent much money on it.

476
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,460
There isn't a second set in Lingzhou.

477
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,210
If it had shattered,

478
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,440
my heart would be broken.

479
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,490
Don't you know how to properly

480
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:29,400
serve me after such a long time?

481
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,120
I'm so sorry.

482
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,160
It is all my fault.

483
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,040
Please don't be mad.

484
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,240
Please don't be mad.

485
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:45,980
Oh, right.

486
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,640
What on earth happened to Yu?

487
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,720
Has he returned to the capital safely?

488
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:50,590
He got injured,

489
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,280
and is now stuck in Lingzhou.

490
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,160
We had to lie that he died

491
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,240
to deceive the Su family,

492
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,760
which sent assassins after him.

493
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,420
Or he would've been found out.

494
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,390
So, when you said Yu

495
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:03,160
had safely returned to the capital,

496
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:05,090
you were misleading the Su family?

497
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,680
Su Errong is not a dummy.

498
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,880
Besides, Chancellor Su is behind her.

499
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,410
Despite the many people they sent out,

500
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:13,480
they still couldn't find Yu.

501
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,480
How were we supposed

502
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,340
to know about Yu's death so early?

503
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,960
If they had become suspicious again,

504
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,160
Yu would've been in danger one more time.

505
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,360
So, it was better to

506
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,680
distract them with fake news.

507
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,400
It is very wise of you.

508
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,960
Where is Yu now?

509
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:30,880
I don't know.

510
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,360
The Su family is keeping close watch.

511
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,290
I haven't been able to contact him.

512
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,960
Nonetheless, this is perhaps

513
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:37,960
in Yu's

514
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,040
best interest.

515
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,200
We found trails of Haiyou Sect

516
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,370
in a deserted temple
in the southeast of the city.

517
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:50,850
But we're not sure if

518
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,200
Yun Yi is there.

519
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:55,420
Xu,

520
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,170
I'll go with you.

521
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,220
Sir,

522
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,280
this could be a trap.

523
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,810
We might have been tricked.

524
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:22,960
That can't stop me.

525
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,340
Maybe Yun Yi is inside.

526
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,440
Jingran!

527
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,610
Stay put. Don't act on impulse.

528
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:43,970
Zhuiying!

529
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,240
Got it!

530
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:00,900
Yun Yi?

531
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,360
Yun Yi! Yun Yi!

532
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:24,870
Watch out.

533
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,030
Let's go!

534
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,080
Zhuiying,

535
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:22,960
take them away.

536
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,370
Yes.

537
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,840
In the capital,

538
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,780
none of Haiyou Sect's ambushes

539
00:29:31,810 --> 00:29:33,450
could trap Your Highness.

540
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,440
But we're in Lingzhou now.

541
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,720
Your Highness are all alone.

542
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,890
Don't you think you've

543
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,200
underestimated Haiyou Sect?

544
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,390
You captured a secret guard of mine,

545
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,810
but didn't kill her.

546
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,500
You must have a thorough plan.

547
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,020
The fact that I came here alone

548
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,680
means I'm sure I won't get hurt.

549
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,840
I know what brought you to Lingzhou.

550
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,960
Haiyou Sect works for money.

551
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,400
We're doing the Su family's bidding,

552
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,260
and we don't mind doing yours too.

553
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,270
Haiyou Sect

554
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,720
will gladly work

555
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:08,550
with Your Highness.

556
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,040
I'm sure

557
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,960
we will easily achieve

558
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,720
our goals respectively.

559
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:18,240
Haiyou Sect is a menace to the court.

560
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,600
I never talk terms with saboteurs.

561
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:23,720
I bet

562
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,420
you have another identity.

563
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:45,470
When did

564
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,680
Your Highness find it out?

565
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,960
We've fought several times.

566
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,200
How can I be

567
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,730
an army leader if I couldn't

568
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,690
see through this simple trick?

569
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,680
Prince of Dingbei,

570
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,280
you do have a keen eye.

571
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:22,200
[Shengyi Inn]

572
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,240
Here.

573
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,200
I'm afraid

574
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,200
Your Highness

575
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,600
will have to take care of Yun Yi.

576
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,460
Don't worry. She's in good hands.

577
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:43,880

How are Miss Yun's injuries?

607
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:16,680
Is she in serious condition?

608
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,520
Luckily, the injuries are superficial.

609
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:19,310
But she needs to

610
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:20,370
rest for a few days.

611
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,930
Thanks, Your Highness.

612
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,420
Sir.

613
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,710
Where has my wife been today?

614
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,370
Her Highness

615
00:33:36,370 --> 00:33:37,360
spent the entire day in the market.

616
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,360
She did nothing but shop.

617
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:42,010
Then, she ate in Xianquan Restaurant.

618
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:43,960
She just did what a regular girl would do.

619
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,490
Nothing special happened.

620
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,520
I'd love to tell Your Highness

621
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,450
all the details.

622
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,360
First, Her Highness went to

623
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:53,120
buy rouge and gave

624
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,980
the shopkeeper some good advice.

625
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Then Her Highness visited a cloth shop.

626
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,730
Later on, she bought candy, necklaces and rings.

627
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:08,440
Wen Zong invited

628
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,480
Her Highness for dinner,

629
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,760
but she declined.

630
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:12,840
Who is Wen Zong?

631
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,920
I don't know much about him.

632
00:34:15,050 --> 00:34:16,239
Judging from what he said,

633
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:18,239
I think he's a merchant in Lingzhou.

634
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:21,120
He's a young gentleman.

635
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:23,480
He's good-looking, too.

636
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,159
I mean,

637
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,690
plain-looking.

638
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,250
Mr. Wu hired hooligans

639
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,230
to harass Her Highness.

640
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:37,440
Wen Zong came to her rescue.

641
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,880
Her Highness fell into his arms,

642
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,000
so she was luckily unhurt.

643
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,929
What did you say?

644
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,800
-Mr. Wu hired hooligans to...
-The next sentence.

645
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,050
Wen Zong came to her rescue.

646
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:46,980
Her Highness fell into his arms...

647
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:49,800
I shouldn't have left

648
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,080
Her Highness alone.

649
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,239
Punish me if Your Highness want.

650
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:01,960
By tomorrow morning,

651
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,660
I need to know everything about this man.

652
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:07,270
Got it!

653
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:20,570
Xu.

654
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,880
I know this is too much to ask,

655
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,560
but I don't want Yun Yi

656
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:29,700
to be a Jinyun Guard anymore.

657
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,210
I'll bear any cost

658
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:33,820
that may lead to.

659
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:38,630
What do you take Jinyun Guards for?

660
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,540
They can quit anytime.

661
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:43,350
Jinyun Guards are not my personal belongs.

662
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:45,750
I don't decide whether
they'll live or die.

663
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,260
Your Highness,

664
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,040
I want to be with Yun Yi.

665
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,800
Please grant my request.

666
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,670
This is not up to me.

667
00:35:58,420 --> 00:35:59,300
Now, Yun Yi

668
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,800
works for my wife.

669
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,240
Your Highness, I beg you.

670
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,800
Second Young Master Shu,

671
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,820
are you really in love with Yun Yi?

672
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:20,120
I swear I love her with all my heart.

673
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,880
What about your parents?

674
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,280
Will they treat

675
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,720
Yun Yi as well as you do?

676
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,160
I can't decide for Yun Yi.

677
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,600
You should ask for her approval.

678
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,440
Before that, you must

679
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,960
work out plans for the future.

680
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,910
I agree.

681
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,630
You're making

682
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,240
a promise

683
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,320
and a lifelong commitment.

684
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,080
What's wrong, Xu?

685
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,620
Jingran is a timid guy.

686
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:32,600
It must've taken him much

687
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:33,930
courage to say that out.

688
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,170
We should give them some space.

689
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:39,270
In terms of romance,

690
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,960
they need to decide for themselves.

691
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,130
I can tell that Second Young Master Shu

692
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,280
is genuinely in love with Yun Yi.

693
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,400
I hope they can spend the rest

694
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,000
of their lives together.

695
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,570
It'll be a shame if
they miss out on each other

696
00:37:57,570 --> 00:37:59,500
for the gap of their social status.

697
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,510
Where have you

698
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,040
been today?

699
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:09,110
What did you buy?

700
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:10,760
I simply

701
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:11,920
shopped in town

702
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,490
and bought some souvenirs.

703
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,000
Oh, right.

704
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:17,360
I specifically went to
Dingsheng Tea House.

705
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:20,120
I found that the tea ordered to taste

706
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:21,880
in the shop was of good quality.

707
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,440
But when customers leave the shop,

708
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,470
they'll find the tea leaves

709
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:26,320
they've bought are mixed
with those old or inferior.

710
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,440
Dingsheng Tea House

711
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,960
is owned by the Su family.

712
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,060
I will

713
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,640
deal with them later.

714
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,440
Did you not

715
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,760
encounter anyone special

716
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,360
or anything unusual?

717
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:43,930
Yes, I did.

718
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:45,900
Today,

719
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,800
I met a cloth merchant,

720
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,190
Mr. Wu.

721
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,000
I'm sure his tie-dyed silk

722
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,560
wasn't made in Xian.

723
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,240
The color was dull and heavy.

724
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:57,960
It must be from Nanlyu,

725
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:00,240
which is known for its indigo.

726
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,760
My guess must be correct.

727
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,240
Plus, Mr. Wu was

728
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:06,960
behaving suspiciously.

729
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:11,970
What's your plan then?

730
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,370
I'll see what I can find out about him.

731
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,240
Maybe his tie-dyed silk

732
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,640
is related to smuggling.

733
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,150
That is a lead.

734
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,000
But you must act with caution.

735
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,880
If anyone attempts to hurt you,

736
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,120
ask Zhuiyu for help.

737
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:30,400
If he's not up to the task,

738
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,240
come find me.

Did you really

not meet anyone

758
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:00,890
annoying today?

759
00:42:02,050 --> 00:42:03,000
No, I didn't.

760
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,840
I'm new to town.

761
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:11,480
Who would give me a hard time?

762
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,570
What got into you today?

763
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:18,480
Nothing.

764
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:24,880
Oh, right.

765
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,190
that day, in Shaxi,

766
00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:29,090
was it my jade pendant that kept

767
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:30,440
you safe from the stab?

768
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,720
Did you get injured?

769
00:42:37,530 --> 00:42:38,290
No, I'm fine.

770
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:46,480
I thought it had been lost.

771
00:42:47,050 --> 00:42:48,450
Where did you find it?

772
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:51,730
Huiji Hall.

773
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:53,560
When we first met,

774
00:43:00,990 --> 00:43:01,990
your jade pendant

775
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:03,720
really

776
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:04,760
saved my life.

777
00:43:06,490 --> 00:43:09,000
We were strangers at that time.

778
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:11,640
Why would you keep it?

779
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:14,560
I don't know why.

780
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:17,680
Maybe when you prayed for a good husband

781
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:19,400
in Hanyan Temple,

782
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:22,380
-the Buddha was moved...
-Stop talking about that!

783
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:24,480
The universe works

784
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:25,660
in a mysterious way.

785
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:30,910
That pendant belongs to me.

786
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,490
Please give it back to me.

787
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,240
Finders keepers.

788
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:40,940
Do you have to be so unreasonable?
