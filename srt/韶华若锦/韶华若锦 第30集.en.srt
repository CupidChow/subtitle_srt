[Episode 30]

3
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:35,320
If all men are so nagging after marriage,

4
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,680
I'd rather stay single.

5
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,200
You can't say that.

6
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:40,550
Everyone is different.

7
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,120
Xu and I are different.

8
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:43,940
Xu has never been a romantic guy.

9
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,400
How could you compare him to me?

10
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:49,009
You... I... This...

11
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,600
Are you a ghost?
I didn't hear your footsteps.

12
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,400
Go away.

13
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,600
Even if I were a ghost,
I'd haunt no one but you.

14
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,039
You've got the nerve

15
00:01:57,039 --> 00:01:58,320
to gossip about Xu,

16
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,920
yet you're afraid of a ghost?

17
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:00,840
I...

18
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,480
Minmin is beautiful and kind-hearted.

19
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,320
She'd never bicker with a ghost.

20
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,199
I'm pregnant.

21
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,320
Really?

22
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,940
I'm going to be an aunt!

23
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:17,060
Sit down.

24
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:19,940
Sit.

25
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,800
It's nothing serious. Don't make a fuss.

26
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,320
So Prince of Dingbei's Mansion

27
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,880
is going to have an heir.

28
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:29,329
Congratulations, Xu, Tan.

29
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:31,640
Get up.

30
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,160
I didn't expect

31
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,079
that I'm going to be an uncle.

32
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,250
Uncle...

33
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,320
Whose uncle are you?

34
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,720
There isn't even an official engagement.

35
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,579
What does this have to do with you?

36
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,760
The empress,

37
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,720
my elder sister,
personally arranged the marriage.

38
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,000
Of course it's set in stone.

39
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,060
How come it's not official?

40
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:03,720
What does it take to make it official?

41
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,460
It's not official

42
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:05,790
as long as I say it's not.

43
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,310
I've been thinking carefully lately.

44
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:08,920
I feel I don't have to get married at all.

45
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,800
I have Tan now.

46
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,920
And in the future,
I'll have nieces and nephews.

47
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,380
Why would I need a husband?

48
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,720
A husband serves a very important purpose.

49
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,600
Without a husband,
how can you have children?

50
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,060
You like children so much.

51
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:24,200
It's only a matter of time
for us to have children.

52
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,100
I do like children.

53
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,120
But there are lots of good men

54
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:28,920
in this world.

55
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,520
Why would it have to be you?

56
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:32,030
You're just daydreaming.

57
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,280
Are you serious?

58
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,970
Wait, say it clearly.

59
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,040
How am I daydreaming?

60
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:36,760
Where are the good men?

61
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,600
Where? Where?

62
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,320
I'll go talk to them.

63
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,180
I don't want to waste words on you.

64
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,680
Tan, I'm going to buy something

65
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:43,620
for my nephew.

66
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:45,600
Go away.

67
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,880
Cousin, I appreciate

68
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:47,760
that.

69
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,460
Lyu'e, walk her out.

70
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,040
Hurry.

71
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:50,480
Yes.

72
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,320
In my opinion,

73
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,350
she might change her mind
even in three days,

74
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:02,820
let alone three years.

75
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:03,910
Go chase her.

76
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,910
No.

77
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,970
Look at how spoiled she is.

78
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,410
Is my dignity worthless?

79
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,400
Did he ever have any?

80
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,610
I guess never.

81
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,480
Is this cute?

82
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,080
Everything you like is good.

83
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:36,760
Why don't we buy one of each?

84
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,250
Perfunctory and insincere.

85
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,760
Then what gift do you want to give

86
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,840
to your nephew?

87
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,220
Just say the word,

88
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:47,000
and I'll get it done perfectly.

89
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,520
Why don't we hire a skilled carpenter

90
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,940
to make a small bed?

91
00:04:54,159 --> 00:04:56,080
But everything from the design and wood

92
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,140
to the color and patternâ€”

93
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,400
I'll personally oversee it all.

94
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,280
Excellent idea.

95
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,620
Who else could be clever enough
to think of that?

96
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,330
A bed designed by you personally

97
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:04,690
will surely be unique.

98
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,080
It'll be one of its kind in the capital.

99
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,630
When your little nephew sleeps in it,

100
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:09,340
he'll definitely
feel the love from his aunt

101
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:11,070
and sleep soundly and sweetly.

102
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,300
Minmin,

103
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,280
you just mentioned persimmon desserts.

104
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,680
Do you want some?

105
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,360
Okay. Your future husband

106
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:20,270
will take you there now.

107
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,040
Don't you think Xu

108
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,320
is too nervous?

109
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,370
Everyone in the mansion

110
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:27,770
is on edge because of him.

111
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,990
Since childhood,

112
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:31,000
I've never seen

113
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:32,560
Xu so worried about anyone.

114
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,080
But haven't you noticed

115
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,040
that Tan is quite pleased with it

116
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,790
and enjoys it a lot?

117
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,720
Really?

118
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,820
Yes.

119
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:50,920
This is... a peach blossom talisman?

120
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,280
Of course.

121
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:55,080
It's that peach blossom talisman.

122
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:00,610
I heard in Lingzhou,

123
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,640
there is the 180 Pavilion.

124
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,650
The women there are graceful and pretty,

125
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:04,670
full of elegance.

126
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:05,560
It's a paradise

127
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,160
that every man desires.

128
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,030
Have you ever been there?

129
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,540
They're all lovely in their own way.

130
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,540
Then...

131
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,620
compared to the women in the capital?

132
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,940
In terms of elegance,

133
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,450
the women in the capital

134
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:20,400
are better.

135
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:21,910
But when it comes to charm,

136
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,350
the women in Lingzhou

137
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:24,520
are better.

138
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:27,910
Then why didn't you bring the woman

139
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:28,910
who gave you the peach blossom talisman

140
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:30,040
back to the capital?

141
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:32,670
What woman are you talking about?

142
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:35,230
It hurts!

143
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:36,150
It really hurts!

144
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:37,300
Minmin. Minmin.

145
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:38,230
What's wrong?

146
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:39,990
Why did you suddenly get angry?

147
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:40,790
Let me ask you.

148
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:43,990
Do you cherish it very much

149
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:45,750
and carry it with you every day?

150
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:47,550
Of course. Moreover,

151
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:49,310
I worship it every day,

152
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:51,510
worrying it might get dirty or damaged.

153
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:53,760
Shameless!

154
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:54,550
Then spend

155
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:55,720
the rest of your life

156
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:56,990
with that woman!

157
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:57,990
I am going to marry

158
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:59,790
the woman who gave me this talisman.

159
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:00,670
Is there a problem with that?

160
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:01,430
No!

161
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:02,350
Minmin.

162
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:04,470
You went to the Hanyan Temple

163
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:05,430
to specially pray

164
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:07,110
for the talisman for me.

165
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:09,500
Shouldn't I treasure it?

166
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:11,450
Me?

167
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:13,670
Back then, I only wanted

168
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:14,310
to avoid you.

169
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:16,440
Why would I pray for a talisman for you?

170
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:29,770
I...

171
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:33,710
I was praying for a talisman
to ward off mean people.

172
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:37,140
Perhaps I took the wrong one?

173
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:39,480
You made such a mistake?

174
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:46,790
Minmin, look. You took the wrong talisman.

175
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:47,470
Doesn't that prove

176
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:49,270
that we're fated to be together?

177
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:50,670
And

178
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:53,290
we're fated to grow old together.

179
00:07:57,909 --> 00:07:58,710
Wait a minute.

180
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:03,060
What talisman did you say
you went to pray for

181
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:04,310
at the Hanyan Temple?

182
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,410
A talisman to ward off mean people.

183
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:11,820
Why did I hear you say something

184
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:14,130
about a talisman to ward off mean people?

185
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:17,670
Explain yourself.

186
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:18,910
What does that mean?

187
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:19,580
I didn't say that.

188
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:20,840
You thought I was mean?

189
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:23,000
You wanted to get rid of me?

[Jinshun Gate]

The six ministries
still stand without leaders,

192
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:35,010
with no one to fill the vacancies.

193
00:08:35,309 --> 00:08:37,429
Especially the position in Lingzhou.

194

Although the Su family has fallen,

195

they've left behind a mess

196
00:08:41,429 --> 00:08:43,070
for the court to clear up.

197
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:47,190
Do you have anyone in mind
for recommendation?

198
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:48,190
No.

I understand.

206
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:19,070
You were absent-minded
when your wife was not here.

207

But she has returned to the capital.

Why are you still like that?

209

You don't intend to stay in the capital

to accompany her, do you?

211
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:29,230
Yangxi Prefecture is already leaderless.

212
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:32,570
The Dingbei Army
can't go a single day without a commander.

213
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:39,590
Your Majesty, please rest assured.
With Shen Yu there,

214
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:41,310
the Dingbei Army will be fine.

215
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:43,270
Shen Yu is seasoned and capable.

00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:45,030
He can handle things on his own.

217

As for Yangxi Prefecture's position,

I do have someone in mind.

Shu Jingran from the Hanlin Academy,
you may come in!

236
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:37,950
Greetings, Your Majesty.

237
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:41,510
What brings you here, Editor Shu?

238
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:43,070
Your Majesty, are you troubled because you

239
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:45,430
don't have a proper man
to take over Lingzhou?

240
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:48,190
Lingzhou's maritime trade
is a key artery of Xian.

241
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:49,070
It is

242
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:52,040
the most crucial
to the court's reorganization.

243
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:54,950
I have been pondering day and night,

244
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:57,080
but still can't find the right person.

245
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:00,730
Prince of Dingbei
now prioritizes his wife.

246
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:03,150
He can no longer share my burdens.

247
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:09,310
Your Majesty, I recommend myself.

248
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:12,310
I'm willing to go to Lingzhou
to ease your worries.

249
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:22,950
Managing Lingzhou
is no short-term endeavor.

250
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:26,510
You may be stationed there for years.

251
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:28,030
I am aware of that.

252
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:36,650
Does Chancellor Shu know about this?

253
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:39,070
Your Majesty,

254
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:41,510
I didn't study all those years

255
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:43,070
merely to seek a rank

256
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:44,600
or waste the rest of my life.

257
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:46,550
I have thought this through.

258
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:47,880
To serve as an official,

259
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:49,030
to benefit the people,

260
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:50,290
to discipline myself,

261
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:52,270
and to seek no reward.

262
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:01,880
Your Majesty, please approve.

263
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:22,160
Rise, Minister Shu.

264
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:28,830
The court is in need of capable men.

265
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:30,430
If you can go,

266
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:33,390
it will ease my most pressing concerns.

267
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:35,070
But I want to know

268
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:38,510
what made you make this decision.

269
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:46,370
I'm in love with a woman,

270
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:49,150
but the gap between our status

271
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:51,310
has kept us apart.

272
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:53,550
For the one I love,

273
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:56,550
I no longer want to be trapped
by worldly chains.

274
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:58,080
I just want to build a future

275
00:12:58,170 --> 00:12:59,480
with my own abilities

276
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:01,550
and offer it to her with my own hands.

Yes, Your Majesty.

00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:18,310
Approved.

281
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:22,190
Thank you, Your Majesty.

His Majesty

283
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:32,190
looks somber today.

284
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:37,030

we've been

00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,400
â™ª Red threads bind us tightly â™ª

343
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:36,500
â™ª This is what happiness looks like â™ª

344
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:34,840
We come from different worlds.

345
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:37,990
With your family background,

346
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:42,170
â™ª I vow again with raised hands â™ª

347
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:42,390
you deserve

348
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:45,360
the best woman in the world.

349
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:48,030
In my heart, you are the best.

350
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:50,620
â™ª Music plays on, unafraid of time â™ª

351
00:18:53,770 --> 00:19:00,100
â™ª We've weathered
darkness and long nights â™ª

352
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:58,250
I've requested
to be stationed in Lingzhou.

353
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:00,410
After I leave the capital,

354
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:01,710
I will just be myself, free of the chains.

355
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:05,800
â™ª I fall for you in this lifetime â™ª

356
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:03,550
Neither of us will be bound by

357
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:05,550
status or prejudices.

358
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:11,270
â™ª The vows we made together â™ª

359
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:11,830
Back in Lingzhou, you told me

360
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:15,130
â™ª I'll never regret guarding you
or being wild with you â™ª

361
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:13,950
the best life is the one

362
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:15,710
we're living in this very moment.

363
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:21,200
â™ª Because the landscape of fate
always bears your shadow â™ª

364
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:19,070
What I long for most...

365
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:21,310
I don't know.

366
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:22,790
But I think

367
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:25,590
â™ª I wish to become your birthmark â™ª

368
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:25,230
the present moment is the best.

369
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:29,970
â™ª Let time carve our sincerity â™ª

370
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,750
â™ª Red threads bind us tightly â™ª

371
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:33,230
The present moment

372
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:36,190
â™ª This is what happiness looks like â™ª

373
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:35,670
is indeed the best.

374
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:48,010
I want to capture that moment for you.

375
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:51,090
â™ª Palm lines retrace our memories â™ª

376
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:55,050
â™ª Black hair now replaced
with silver strands â™ª

377
00:19:55,300 --> 00:20:02,180
â™ª A thousand turns of fate
woven into verse â™ª

378
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:10,760
â™ª I vow again with raised hands â™ª

379
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,770
â™ª Let me hear your tender thoughts â™ª

380
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:17,380
â™ª Follow the stars in your eyes â™ª

381
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:18,150
Yun Yi,

382
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:21,310
â™ª I'll never lose my way â™ª

383
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:20,970
are you willing to go with me to Lingzhou?

384
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:24,470
Then we can walk side by side

385
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:25,830
â™ª Though the winds may rise,
my hope never fades â™ª

386
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:26,710
on our own path

387
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:30,020
â™ª At dawn and dusk,
love has no beginning â™ª

388
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:28,870
and build

389
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:30,790
a future that belongs only to us.

390
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:37,090
â™ª Time guides us to this vow for life â™ª

391
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:45,730
â™ª When the mountains bloom,
I'll meet you again â™ª

392
00:20:58,030 --> 00:20:58,890
Your Highness.

393
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:06,970
What's wrong?

394
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:12,950
I just feel a bit stifled inside.

395
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:15,830
All my life,

396
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:18,990
only you and His Highness
have treated me well.

397
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:22,350
But now there's someone else.

398
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:25,560
He attaches great importance to me

399
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:26,890
and cares about me too.

400
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:30,830
It feels like...

401
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:35,790
It feels like

402
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:39,390
being held in his hands and cherished

403
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:41,190
at every moment.

404
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:46,290
Whatever you say and want to doâ€”

405
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:49,530
he pays more attention to it than you.

406
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:59,110
What did Second Young Master Shu
say to you?

407
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:03,310
How did you know

408
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:06,310
I... I was talking about him?

409
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:09,120
Back

410
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:11,510
when you were kidnapped by Haiyou Sect,

411
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:13,560
Second Young Master Shu

412
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:15,850
insisted on saving you immediately.

413
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:17,310
For that,

414
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:19,190
he even quarreled with Xu.

415
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:22,150
He once solemnly requested

416
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:25,020
to take you away from the Jinyun Guards.

417
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:32,870
But he...

418
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:35,110
never told me any of that.

419
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:38,210
That's because

420
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:40,310
he knew there were too many obstacles

421
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:41,510
between you two.

422
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:43,990
If he confessed his love for you

423
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:46,360
without 100% confidence,

424
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:47,870
it would only hurt you.

425
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:53,740
I don't know what he said to you.

426
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:56,310
But since he asked,

427
00:22:57,390 --> 00:22:59,190
he must have planned everything

428
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:01,650
and made thorough preparations.

429
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:05,030
He's going to take up a post in Lingzhou.

430
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:05,790
He asked me

431
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:08,070
if I'm willing to go with him.

432
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,700
But I really haven't figured it out.

433
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:13,630
There're so many pretty women

434
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:15,690
from better families in the capital.

435
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:17,470
Why me?

436
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:21,130
There are many delicacies in the world.

437
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:23,160
Why do you only love roast chicken?

438
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:25,550
Love needs

439
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:26,600
no reason.

440
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:29,580
You only need to ask yourself this:

441
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:32,080
When you're with Second Young Master Shu,

442
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,080
are you happy?

443
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:38,570
Is he

444
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:40,750
special to you?

445
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:53,070
Be careful, it's hot.

446
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:57,120
â™ª A quiet wish born in the dark â™ª

447
00:23:57,790 --> 00:24:01,250
â™ª Will it reach someone's ears at all? â™ª

448
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:05,600
â™ª A fleeting brush in a passing glance â™ª

449
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:09,620
â™ª Etching longing deep within â™ª

450
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:14,200
â™ª You are the flame â™ª

451
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:14,690
Miss Yun, do you mean

452
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:16,110
the two of us together

453
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:18,340
â™ª That lights my endless night â™ª

454
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:18,870
can make up for each other's shortcomings

455
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:23,910
â™ª Because of the resolve
we see in each other's eyes â™ª

456
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:20,990
and become greater as a pair?

457
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:25,310
Be careful!

458
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:29,050
â™ª We believe in forever â™ª

459
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:35,140
â™ª May the fleeting years
gather into points of light â™ª

460
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:38,880
â™ª Hold on to this bond year after year â™ª

461
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:43,190
â™ª Side by side through endless tales â™ª

462
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:43,510
But if I don't protect you,

463
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:47,350
â™ª Love rests deep in heart and eyes â™ª

464
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:45,830
I

465
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:48,550
will find it hard to justify it to myself.

466
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:51,180
â™ª May the fleeting years gather into light,
and you are that point of light â™ª

467
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,990
â™ª Time flows in silence,
through lingering nights â™ª

468
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:59,770
â™ª Like stars in the long night â™ª

469
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:03,710
â™ª Through all the changes, near or far â™ª

470
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:10,020
â™ª I'll be with you
to enjoy the unfinished story â™ª

471
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:20,550
â™ª May the fleeting years gather into light,
and you are that point of light â™ª

472
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:24,710
â™ª Stack up all the attachments,
like fireworks in this world â™ª

473
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:29,260
â™ª Through all four seasons,
we walk hand in hand â™ª

474
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:33,440
â™ª We intertwine â™ª

475
00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:37,390
â™ª May the fleeting years gather into light,
and you are that point of light â™ª

476
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:42,160
â™ª Longing winds its way,
blooming into a garden â™ª

477
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:46,000
â™ª Watching the lights twinkle,
intertwined in affection â™ª

478
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:46,270
This trip to Lingzhou

479
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:49,340
â™ª Reflecting smiles,
deep and shallow â™ª

480
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:47,940
has given me much to ponder.

481
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:50,790
Life is unpredictable.

482
00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:55,710
â™ª Keep the past,
just like our first meeting â™ª

483
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:53,080
No one can foresee what the future holds.

484
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:55,270
Miss Yun, you're right.

485
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:56,920
We should cherish the present moment

486
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:59,050
instead of dreaming about the future.

487
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:13,810
The fireworks that nightâ€”

488
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:19,390
I will remember them forever.

489
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:26,350
What you feel is the most genuine.

490
00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:30,470
Even without anyone telling you,

491
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:31,870
you can still feel

492
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:33,630
his feelings for you

493
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:36,550
and your own feelings.

494
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:41,950
I understand.

495
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:44,610
Then do you want to go to Lingzhou?

496
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:49,790
But... But...

497
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:51,990
But if I go to Lingzhou,

498
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:53,470
what about you?

499
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:55,230
What about His Highness?

500
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:56,950
You silly girl.

501
00:26:57,870 --> 00:26:59,150
The Jinyun Guards will always

502
00:26:59,150 --> 00:26:59,850
be your home.

503
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:01,070
It always has been.

504
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:02,110
But you also need a life of your own

505
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:03,710
and a place where you belong.

506
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:05,870
Wherever you want to go,

507
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:07,560
whoever you want to be with,

508
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:10,310
you don't need
to worry about anything else.

509
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:12,150
You only need to ask yourself this:

510
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:13,070
Is the person

511
00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:15,630
in front of you the one you want

512
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:18,070
to be with forever?

[Qi'an Hall]

514
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,730
Where did this satin come from?

515
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:50,550
Your Highness,

516
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,510
His Highness brought it back
before dinner.

517
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:54,030
He said it's getting colder,

518
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:54,990
so he specially went to Jinxiu Workshop

519
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:56,390
and selected a piece of top satin

520
00:27:56,390 --> 00:27:57,750
to make a cloak for you.

521
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:00,830
Where is he?

522
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:03,180
His Highness...

523
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,200
is probably in the study
handling official business.

524
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:13,050
[Nanlyu]

525
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:11,910
This time, Nanlyu

broken the non-aggression pact.

527
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:16,070
We must respond in kind.

528
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:17,940
But

529
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:19,550
the army in Yangxi Prefecture
has suffered heavy losses,

530
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:22,390
and with the recent change in command,
morale is unstable.

531
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:23,070
I'm afraid

532
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,760
we're not ready
to face Nanlyu's army head-on.

533
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:29,320
Since the battle in Dongzhou,
the Dingbei Army has been regrouping

534
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:31,250
and restoring strength for a year.

535
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:33,310
Though the army's primary mission

536
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:34,790
is to resist Beiman,

537
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,100
we are all elite soldiers of Xian.

538
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:39,810
We should stand united against enemies

539
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:43,370
[Nanlyu]

540
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:42,130

[Nanlyu]

543
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:47,080
Whether it's Beiman or Nanlyu,

544
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:48,990
whoever dares to invade Xian

545
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:51,250
must be crushed until they bow in defeat.

546
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:52,020
That's right.

547
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:53,710
Crush them severely.

548
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:55,900
Honey.

549
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,220
Let's go.

550
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,260
It's almost midnight.

551
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:20,030
Why haven't you

552
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:21,630
returned to the room to rest?

553
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:23,500
I'll go back as soon as

554
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,230
I finish my official business.

555
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,030
Honey,

556
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:29,650
I know you meant well by gifting me satin.

557
00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:31,480
You chose it carefully.

558
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:33,770
But I still prefer

559
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:35,720
to wear matching clothes with you.

560
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:38,390
It is stylish and shows our affection.

561
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:45,350
Tan, why don't you
go back to Qi'an Hall first?

562
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:46,210
Later, I'll...

563
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:47,290
There you go again.

564
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:48,970
I...

565
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,520
Honey, I'm hungry.

566
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,310
I want some golden cream pastries

567
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:54,780
and jade dew cakes.

568
00:29:56,610 --> 00:29:58,050
I also want you

569
00:29:58,070 --> 00:30:00,070
to feed me like you did a few days ago.

570
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:06,270
I'll have the kitchen
prepare them right away.

571
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:07,530
Tan, go back to your room and wait.

572
00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:08,080
Come on.

573
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:10,070
Honey, why do you

574
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:12,070
keep trying to send me away tonight?

575
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:14,590
Are you hiding someone here?

576
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:16,520
And you're worried I might see her?

577
00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:20,400
He's hiding you.

578
00:30:22,170 --> 00:30:22,990
Alright then.

579
00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:24,780
Give me a kiss,

580
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:25,750
and I'll leave.

581
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:41,870
We heard something

582
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:43,270

585
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:47,150
stay in this secret room forever, is he?

586
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:50,050
Don't be naughty.
Go back to your room first. Go.

587
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:50,930
No.

588
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:55,870
The study is stuffy.

589
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:56,800
When I return to the room,

590
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,210
I'll personally feed you.

591
00:30:58,210 --> 00:30:58,940
Okay?

592
00:30:59,870 --> 00:31:00,260
Let's go.

593
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:01,140
Then I want...

594
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:03,830
I want you to carry me back.

595
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:20,090
There's a secret room inside.

596
00:31:20,090 --> 00:31:21,130
Before you came,

597
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:24,270
I was discussing something
with my subordinates.

598
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:25,880
Let's go.

599
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,990

Intimacy between husband and wife

is quite normal.

Tan, no need to overthink it.

605
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,010
Rest assured.

606
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,510
I've already warned them.

607
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:23,190
They won't tell anyone

608
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:24,880
about what happened tonight.

609
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:27,730
Your reputation
as a virtuous and gracious lady

610
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:29,450
will not be tarnished.

611
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:33,090
I don't want to talk. I want to be alone.

612
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:36,070
Staying in there too long
might make you unwell.

613
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:38,310
Besides, you should think of

614
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:39,940
the little one in your belly.

615
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:45,180
Didn't you just say you were hungry?

616
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:46,980
How about having some desserts?

617
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:52,810
I went to you to discuss

618
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:55,030
the matter of Yun Yi and Jingran.

619
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:57,930
I didn't expect
to make such a fool of myself.

620

Those two?

621
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:00,680
What about them?

622
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:13,170
That's how it is.

623
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,560
What do you think?

624
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:17,620
To deal with Yun Yi,

625
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:20,050
we only need to do one thing.

626

of your favorite dishes today.

Don't just take care of me.

631
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,240
You should eat more too.

632
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:36,150
Try this.

633
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:42,580
Princess Consort, you summoned me here.

634
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,930
What do you want me to do?

635
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:51,210
There's something I need you to do.

636
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,500
But it won't be easy,

637
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:54,000
and it will take a long time.

638
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:54,960
Are you willing?

639
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:57,630
At your command, Your Highness.

640
00:33:58,580 --> 00:33:59,960
I want you to accompany Jingran

641
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:02,290
to Lingzhou and protect him along the way.

642
00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:04,310
After arriving in Lingzhou,

643
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:05,460
you must stay by his side all the time

644
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:06,660
to ensure his safety.

645
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:09,159
Can you manage this?

646
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:24,650
I...

647
00:34:25,659 --> 00:34:27,159
will not disappoint you.

Yes.

650
00:34:46,449 --> 00:34:47,710
Take care of yourself.

651
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:57,840
Yes.

652
00:35:52,210 --> 00:35:53,560
Your Highness, what are you looking for?

653
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,000
I can help you.

654
00:35:56,310 --> 00:35:57,480
Ms. Zhang said

655
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:58,950
when my mother
married into the Ming family,

656
00:35:58,950 --> 00:35:59,850
Grandmother prepared

657
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:00,800
a set of hair ornaments for her.

658
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,120
Where is it?

659
00:36:02,490 --> 00:36:03,890
All her belongings

660
00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:05,440
are kept in a special place.

661
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,500
I'll go fetch them for you right away.

662
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:08,390
Wait.

663
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:09,990
Later,

664
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:11,400
go to Jinxiu Workshop again.

665
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,670
Based on Yun Yi's measurements,

666
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:14,430
have them tailor a few outfits for her.

667
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:17,030
Also, prepare accessories, shoes,

668
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:18,750
medicine for injuries,

669
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:20,010
and money generously.

670
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:24,160
Your Highness, this looks like

671
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:25,240
you're preparing

672
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:27,560
a dowry for Miss Yun Yi.

673
00:36:28,050 --> 00:36:29,370
Exactly.

674

680

The child hasn't even been born,
