1
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:01,340
It was Sa!

2
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:03,640
Sa!

3
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,960
Why are you을 so rude?

4
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:09,700
As for child...

5
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:11,740
He's a guilty man.

6
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:15,500
I've been looking for him for long.

7
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,000
What do you want with Sa's property?

8
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,160
It's the perquè for his deposition of interest.

9
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,160
13 years later

10
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,840
Miss Bai...

11
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,040
didn't you say you will spare me?

12
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,680
Roubant idiot.

13
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:52,080
Listen I told you mushroom boy is everywhere.

14
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,160
I don't care.

15
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,800
He's working here.

16
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,080
You should have given me an answer.

17
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,480
My lady, the lord's wife has come to the mansion.

18
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,280
She is in a hurry.

19
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,360
Her mansion is in a mess.

20
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,400
Let's go home.

21
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,520
Your mansion is in a mess.

22
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,880
Nanzhi, call my husband here.

23
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:16,440
I want to see how you will explain to the lord.

24
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:23,080
Your lady is really a genius.

25
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,560
Let's go.

26
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,000
Sir, your noodles.

27
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,720
Please enjoy.

28
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,640
My lady, please eat.

29
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,960
We have finished eating. Let's continue our journey.

30
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,680
We have been on the road for a day.

31
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,720
It's already late.

32
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,040
We can't stay here for a night.

33
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,960
You are not even married.

34
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,640
You are the reason why I am here.

35
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,280
It's my lady's duty to take care of you.

36
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,360
You can rest when you are here.

37
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,320
You can rest in peace.

38
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,480
Where should I go?

39
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,240
Lizhou.

40
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,000
Don't worry.

41
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,800
After the wedding, the lord will definitely be happy.

42
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,480
Waiter, give me some more buns and a bowl of soup.

43
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,480
Okay.

44
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,000
You are so generous today.

45
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,720
You are looking for treasure in the mountains.

46
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,880
I just dug it.

47
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,520
I will send it to the city's pharmacy.

48
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,040
It will be a good price.

49
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,280
It's a treasure.

50
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,120
I will go get the buns for you.

51
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,120
Go.

52
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,880
How much is the ginseng?

53
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,400
You have a good taste.

54
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,520
50 taels.

55
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,920
It's so expensive.

56
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,760
It's a hundred years old ginseng.

57
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,320
It's still fresh.

58
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,200
I just bought one ginseng to nourish my body.

59
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,840
How about selling it to me?

60
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,840
I can't even afford to pay you back.

61
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:32,960
100 taels.

62
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,680
I want this ginseng.

63
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,560
Miss, please keep it.

64
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,560
This...

65
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,360
Miss, you are so smart.

66
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,360
Please keep it.

67
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,640
Mother, you don't have much ginseng.

68
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,640
It's good for you.

69
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,640
I am the one who needs to nourish my body.

70
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:01,240
Miss, please keep it.

71
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,320
Wait.

72
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,920
You dare to block my way.

73
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,440
I will show you.

74
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,200
Thank you, sir.

75
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,400
He is the one who didn't keep the ginseng.

76
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,400
And he blocked my way.

77
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,400
Even if he falls, he can't be helped.

78
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,720
Take him to his room.

79
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,720
Yes.

80
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,200
You are going to have a drink here.

81
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,200
Why don't I buy you a drink?

82
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,200
I actually...

83
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,200
You know better than me.

84
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,200
You are the best.

85
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:11,200
Mother, what does he mean?

86
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,200
It's none of his business.

87
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,200
Remember.

88
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,200
We finally came back to the capital.

89
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,200
Remember.

90
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,200
We finally came back to the capital.

91
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,200
We must be careful.

92
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,200
We can't make trouble again.

93
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,200
If we can stay in the capital,

94
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,200
and never come back to Yangxi,

95
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,200
we will be the top masters.

96
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,200
Mother, we only have half a day to go back.

97
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,200
Why don't we take a break here

98
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,200
and have a rest?

99
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,200
This is for 3 people.

100
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,200
Come on.

101
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:53,200
Show me the address.

102
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,200
Let's go.

103
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,200
Who is it?

104
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,200
People's group from Jianan's palace.

105
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,200
It's you...

106
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,200
What are you going to do?

107
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,200
I'm taking you to the capital.

108
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,200
But I love you with all my heart

109
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,680
Whether you are true love or fake love

110
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,680
It's none of my business

111
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,680
Then why do you want me to go back?

112
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,680
I want to...

113
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,200
It's her

114
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,200
Do it

115
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,200
I don't want to die

116
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,200
You are helpless

117
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,200
But you want to take the risk

118
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,200
Do you know what you are doing?

119
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,200
I am doing it for my own good

120
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,200
You are not confident

121
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,200
How can I not be confident?

122
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,200
I will do it

123
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,200
This is your last resort

124
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,200
Do you really think you can go back to the Liang family?

125
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,200
You are not sent by my cousin to protect me

126
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,200
Who are you?

127
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,200
What is going on?

128
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,200
They came to kill you

129
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,200
And now you still believe the promise of the Liang family

130
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,200
No

131
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,200
My aunt promised me

132
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,200
After my cousin's wedding

133
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,200
She will take me and my child to the capital

134
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,200
She won't lie to me

135
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,200
Your aunt has made you the head of the family

136
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,200
And she doesn't want you to go back

137
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,200
Impossible

138
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,200
My father has done so many things for her

139
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,200
They will never treat me like this

140
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,200
You have two choices now

141
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,200
One, go to the Li family and be your housekeeper

142
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,200
Two, go back to the capital with me

143
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,200
And seek justice for the Liang family

144
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,200
There is a third option

145
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,200
You follow me

146
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,200
As long as you help me to get married with the Liang family

147
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,200
I will do my best to help you marry into the Liang family

148
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,200
And make you the rightful wife of Liang Zixuan

149
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,200
Rightful wife?

150
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,200
You are dying

151
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,200
And you still want to marry into the Liang family?

152
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,200
Stop talking

153
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,200
Go and call the police

154
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,200
Call the police

155
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,200
Call the police

156
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,200
You ask Ayu to find a place to hide

157
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,200
When Zhu's father comes to the capital

158
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,200
Tell them to go and see Ayu

159
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,200
Yes

160
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,200
What are you doing?

161
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,200
Come and help me

162
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,200
Okay

163
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,200
She is really going to give birth

164
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,200
Okay, I got it

165
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,200
I heard that the second lady had a miscarriage

166
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,200
So I gave her a body

167
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,200
Be strong

168
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,200
My mother and I just came back from Yangxi road

169
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,200
We don't know much about the local people

170
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,200
I was rude before

171
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,200
Please don't misunderstand me

172
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,200
It doesn't matter

173
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,200
Don't push

174
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,200
Don't push too hard

175
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,200
Take a deep breath and hold it

176
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,200
She seems to be unconscious

177
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,200
Madam

178
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,200
Look, I came in time

179
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,200
I gave her the body

180
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,200
Madam

181
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,200
I am always a good teacher

182
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,200
What should we do?

183
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,200
Madam

184
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,200
Ming Chu

185
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,200
How could it be her?

186
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,200
Madam, there is a body outside

187
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,200
Go and get it for her

188
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,200
If she doesn't wake up, she won't be able to keep the baby

189
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,200
Go

190
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,200
I am kind to give her the body

191
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,200
But I can't waste my money

192
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,200
Please help me

193
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,200
Madam, save her

194
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,200
Pay the money

195
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,200
Is she your wife?

196
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:28,200
Madam, she is pregnant because you took her to the doctor

197
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,200
If you can't keep the baby

198
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,200
How can you explain to master?

199
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,200
Just these?

200
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,200
The body is worth this much

201
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,200
How can you know it's not worth?

202
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,200
You will know when you see it

203
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,200
But I spent a hundred

204
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,200
If someone cheats you, you are willing to be cheated

205
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,200
You can't blame others

206
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,200
She is born

207
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,200
Madam is born

208
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,200
May you live a long life

209
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,200
I know you and Liang Zixuan are in love

210
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,200
But why are you the only one who is wronged?

211
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:21,200
I am willing to do anything for my cousin

212
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,200
I have decided to cancel the marriage

213
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,200
You should come with me to the capital

214
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:29,200
To get what you deserve

215
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,200
You really want to cancel the marriage?

216
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,200
If it's not good, why do you insist?

217
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,200
Men can do anything for the future

218
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:41,200
Why can't women do anything for their own life?

219
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,200
You should do your best

220
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,200
Do what you want

221
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,200
Madam, look at the baby

222
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,200
She is not crying

223
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,200
She is really good

224
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,200
Look at her

225
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,200
What are you doing?

226
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,200
Leave the baby

227
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,200
Madam

228
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,200
The baby is just born

229
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,200
How can you divorce her?

230
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,200
You don't have to force her to come back to the capital

231
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,200
Your father will come back tomorrow

232
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:20,200
You know best if the baby is happy or not

233
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,200
Zhu'er

234
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,200
Don't listen to him

235
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,200
It's a big crime to kidnap a child

236
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,200
I want to report it to the police

237
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,200
Don't bother

238
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,200
Madam, she is right

239
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,200
I am willing to come back to the capital

240
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,200
Welcome to watch

241
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,200
I am sorry

242
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,200
You are so cruel

243
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,200
Madam

244
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,200
Sujith

245
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,200
Is Shatan back?

246
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,200
I still don't have news about her

247
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,200
I am going back to the capital

248
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,200
I am worried about her

249
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,200
Will she be in trouble?

250
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,200
Are you going to tell me or not?

251
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,200
I will report it to the police

252
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,200
No one is stopping you

253
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,200
I have nothing to do with this

254
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,200
I am a noble man

255
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,200
I am innocent

256
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,200
You are going to imprison me

257
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,200
You should report it to the police

258
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,200
I am waiting for the police to investigate this matter

259
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,200
I am waiting for you to apologize to me

260
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,200
I hope you have this chance

261
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,200
Let's go

262
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,200
Go

263
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,200
Sir

264
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,200
Where is the lady who lives in this house?

265
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,200
The man who saved her before

266
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,200
He took her away in the morning

267
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,200
There is a lady with a whip

268
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,200
Did the two of them leave?

269
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,200
She left earlier

270
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,200
She is so stubborn

271
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,200
By the way

272
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,200
That man left you a carriage

273
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,200
Who cares about the bandits' carriage?

274
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,200
I am sorry

275
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,200
I am sorry

276
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,200
Where is the carriage?

277
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,200
I am so bored

278
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,200
Who told you to stop here?

279
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,200
Is this the gate of the mansion?

280
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,200
Are you blind?

281
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,200
Miss

282
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,200
This is the order from my master

283
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:55,200
You asked me and my mother to enter the mansion from the foot

284
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,200
How dare you?

285
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,200
When did you become a mother?

286
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,200
When did an old lady become the master of the mansion?

287
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,200
You

288
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,200
How can you be so cruel?

289
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,200
Father and I are always at the border

290
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,200
We are not allowed to live here

291
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,200
Father is my god

292
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,200
Let's go

293
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,200
Today, mother and I are going to return from the gate of the mansion

294
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,200
You

295
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,200
This child

296
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,200
You should have a sense of humor

297
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,200
How can the gate of the mansion be opened?

298
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,200
I am sorry

299
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,200
You are an old lady

300
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,200
I think you have arranged it

301
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,200
You are not ashamed

302
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,200
Greetings, third miss and sixth aunt

303
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:44,200
You must be tired from the long journey

304
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:47,200
Please go back to the house and rest

305
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,200
Thank you, mother

306
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,200
Thank you

307
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,200
This is the first day I come back

308
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,200
What to do?

309
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,200
Which house are you from?

310
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,200
You are so rude

311
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,200
How dare you block the way of mother and I?

312
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,200
I am Lu'e

313
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,200
Greetings, third miss and sixth aunt

314
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,200
Lu'e

315
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,200
Who am I?

316
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:36,200
I am the little maid who broke mother's love for her

317
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,200
I made a big mistake

318
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,200
I am lucky that you are so kind and generous

319
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,200
You are so merciful

320
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,200
I am sorry

321
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:49,200
I made a mistake by serving the mansion

322
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,200
If you had not been a beggar

323
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,200
I would have begged for your forgiveness

324
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,200
You would have been sold to the Goula house

325
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,200
You have been in the Zhao Shuiyue for so many years

326
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,200
Yes

327
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,200
After I was punished

328
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,200
The little maid wanted to teach me

329
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,200
So she transferred me to the Zhao Shuiyue

330
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,200
They say that the upper and lower levels are not good

331
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:19,200
The maid of Zhao Shuiyue is so rude

332
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,200
I think she is not good

333
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,200
No wonder she didn't come out to welcome me

334
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,200
I was careless

335
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:31,200
I didn't know that you came here

336
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,200
It has nothing to do with you

337
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,200
How dare you talk back to me?

338
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,200
You want me and mother to be unhappy?

339
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,200
I dare not

340
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:44,200
Don't think that you are different from before

341
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,200
You are not the same

342
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,200
You are the same

343
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,200
Forget it

344
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,200
It's the first day of returning home

345
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,200
Why do you want to talk with the same maid?

346
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,200
Leave

347
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,200
Yes

348
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,200
You

349
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,200
How is the family dinner?

350
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,200
Don't worry

351
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,200
The kitchen has prepared everything as you asked

352
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:22,200
Father will have to cook the dinner

353
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,200
Yes

354
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,200
I will go to the kitchen

355
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,200
Miss

356
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,200
I don't know why the 6th sister

357
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,200
made 3rd sister and auntie Liu angry

358
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,200
They are being punished in the front hall

359
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,200
I will go to the kitchen to keep an eye on them

360
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:41,200
Don't make any mistake in the family dinner

361
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,200
Yes

362
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,200
Isn't this the 6th sister of the little miss?

363
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,200
Why is she punished here?

364
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:57,200
She said that she made 3rd miss and auntie Liu angry

365
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,200
Isn't it obvious that she is being punished in front of everyone?

366
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,200
You are the only one who can do this

367
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:05,200
I think who dares to do this in the future?

368
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,200
You are not respected

369
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,200
You are not respected

370
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,200
Continue to beat me

371
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,200
Stop

372
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,200
I dare to ask 3rd sister and auntie

373
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,200
Are you okay?

374
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,200
What happened?

375
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,200
Greetings to the little miss

376
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,200
It's been years

377
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,200
The little miss has become more and more famous

378
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,200
You are indeed a good girl

379
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,200
4th sister

380
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,200
We have not seen each other for many years

381
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,200
We almost can't recognize each other

382
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:47,200
Greetings to 3rd sister and auntie

383
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,200
I don't know what mistake she made

384
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,200
She made 3rd sister and auntie

385
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,200
be punished in the front hall

386
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,200
I thought 4th sister was here to bring me and mother back

387
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,200
I never thought

388
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:03,200
She is here to punish a lowly maid

389
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,200
Don't be rude

390
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:09,200
The little miss is busy with her work

391
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,200
How can she have time to welcome you?

392
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,200
Since you are going home, you are not a guest

393
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,200
We are sisters

394
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,200
Why do you care about these things?

395
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,200
She hit Chuchu

396
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,200
Chuchu just scolded her

397
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,200
She is angry and did something wrong

398
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,200
I am worried

399
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,200
She always does this

400
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,200
She always hits the little miss

401
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,200
So I am worried

402
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,200
I am just a warning

403
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,200
I didn't expect to see the little miss

404
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,200
She is in charge of the whole family

405
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,200
It's really hard

406
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,200
You are worrying too much

407
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:49,200
Our Lue'e has always been the best

408
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,200
She never did anything wrong

409
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,200
She is my daughter-in-law

410
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,200
Even if she did something wrong

411
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,200
3rd sister and auntie should have told me

412
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,200
I should have made the decision

413
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,200
I am thinking

414
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,200
Our family is strict

415
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,200
No matter which maid did something wrong

416
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,200
We should follow the rules

417
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,200
Otherwise if it gets out

418
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,200
People will talk about us

419
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,200
We are not respected

420
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,200
Keep hitting

421
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,200
Hit her until she is 50

422
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,200
I don't believe you can't teach her a lesson

423
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,200
I just said she is my daughter-in-law

424
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,200
Even if she did something wrong

425
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,200
It's not someone else's business

426
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,200
You

427
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,200
Chuchu

428
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,200
Why are you so upset for a servant?

429
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,200
She is a little miss

430
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,200
She should be treated like a little miss

431
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,200
Let's go

432
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,200
Let's go

433
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,200
Miss

434
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,200
It's my fault

435
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,200
Miss, you are so rude

436
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,200
Why are you saying this between us?

437
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,200
Go and apply the medicine

438
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,200
Yes

439
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,200
Your father will be back soon

440
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,200
If he comes back

441
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:11,200
He will see you fight with Minghan

442
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,200
You are sisters

443
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,200
What will you do?

444
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:19,200
Don't lose your father's trust in a moment

445
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,200
Your Majesty

446
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,200
It's not a matter of a day to investigate the case

447
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,200
Now the border is out of control

448
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,200
The army of Dingbei is not stable

449
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,200
I think

450
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:39,200
We should let King of Dingbei return to the north

451
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,200
Your Majesty

452
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,200
Your Majesty

453
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,200
The Court of Justice will take over this case

454
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,200
If King of Dingbei intervenes

455
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:51,200
I'm afraid it will be a difficult task

456
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,200
Since we entered the study

457
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,200
The Prime Minister has not spoken

458
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:08,200
I wonder what he thinks about this

459
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,200
Your Majesty

460
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,200
If we don't investigate this case

461
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,200
It's not that the army of Dingbei is unstable

462
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:19,200
I'm afraid the whole country will be in danger

463
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,200
I think

464
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,200
Let King of Dingbei stay in the capital

465
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,200
To monitor this case

466
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:28,200
It's not exactly a good plan to pacify the army

467
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:34,200
It's rare for the Prime Minister to be in cahoots with me

468
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,200
Your Majesty

469
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,200
I think if we investigate this case thoroughly

470
00:27:38,200 --> 00:28:06,400
King of Dingbei's

471
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,200
Let's go

472
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,200
Yes

473
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,200
Your Majesty

474
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,200
Let's go

475
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,200
11

476
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,200
12

477
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,200
13

478
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,200
14

479
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,200
15

480
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,200
16

481
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,200
17

482
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,200
18

483
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,200

484
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,200

485
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,200

486
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,200

487
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,200

488
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,200

489
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,200
20

490
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,200
21

491
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,200

492
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,200

497
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,200

498
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,200

ALI Genau

576
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,740
Father, you're finally back.

577
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:12,580
But Chuchu has been talking about you for a day.

578
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:13,960
Father, I came here by order of Zhao.

579
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:16,200
I didn't have anyone to practice with me.

580
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:20,040
I'll practice with you later.

581
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:23,500
Are you used to it now?

582
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,880
It's not that I'm not used to it.

583
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:30,800
But when I came back, no one was there.

584
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:33,880
The servants were rude and rude.

585
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:37,880
Father, can't we be a family?

586
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:42,460
I welcome you back.

587
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,680
Please forgive me.

588
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:47,680
My lady is busy with the household affairs.

589
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:50,880
So I couldn't bring you back.

590
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:54,300
But she told me to take good care of you.

591
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:58,300
She has arranged a good servant for you.

592
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:02,300
I hope you can live comfortably after returning home.

593
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:03,800
Look at you.

594
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,800
You've arranged everything well.

595
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,060
Where is Tan'er?

596
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:12,060
My lord, my lady is happy to know that you're back.

597
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:13,300
She said she would cook for you.

598
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:15,800
She said she would cook for you.

599
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:18,560
I've sent someone to invite you to the old lord of the Bai family.

600
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,020
I'll be there soon.

601
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:21,100
I've been in the palace for a long time.

602
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:22,140
I'm hungry now.

603
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:23,300
Let's go.

604
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:27,680
Father, how about we have a meal first?

605
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,060
Okay.

606
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:35,300
This dish is not well-cooked.

607
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:37,300
Please make it again.

608
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:38,300
Yes.

609
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:44,300
Tan, where have you been?

610
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:48,300
Don't hide anything from me.

611
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:50,300
Actually, I went to find Zhu'er.

612
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:52,300
You went to find Zhu'er alone?

613
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:53,300
How dare you?

614
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:54,800
It's a long story.

615
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,800
We want to have a reunion dinner.

616
00:31:56,800 --> 00:32:00,300
I'll tell you the details later.

617
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:03,300
Let's go.

618
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:05,300
Go with me to see if Lu Jinbao is ready.

619
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:06,300
I have to go now.

620
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:08,300
Let's go.

621
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:11,300
Mother, is everything okay?

622
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:13,300
Don't worry, my lady.

623
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:27,300
Father...

624
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:34,300
Tan, I'm here to see you.

625
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:39,300
What's wrong with you?

626
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:41,300
You're so familiar with me.

627
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:49,300
My lady, you're overjoyed.

628
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,300
After five years of leaving the capital,

629
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:53,300
you've been worried about me.

630
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:55,300
I heard that you're going back to the capital.

631
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:56,300
I'm very happy.

632
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:57,300
I'm very happy.

633
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:59,300
I'm very happy.

634
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:01,300
I'm very happy.

635
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:02,300
I'm very happy.

636
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:04,300
I was busy half a month ago.

637
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:08,300
Tan has become a big girl after five years.

638
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:13,300
You've been working alone in the capital for years.

639
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:15,300
It's not easy for you.

640
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:17,300
You've suffered a lot.

641
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:20,300
I should do all these.

642
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:27,300
It seems that you've forgotten me.

643
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:29,300
Isn't that Minmin?

644
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:32,300
Mother, you haven't changed at all.

645
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:35,300
You're just like your father.

646
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:37,300
Who else is like my daughter?

647
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:43,300
It's been a long time.

648
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:45,300
You've become more handsome.

649
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:48,300
You've been living in the capital.

650
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:51,300
I'm not as handsome as you.

651
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:54,300
You're very arrogant now.

652
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:56,300
Brother-in-law...

653
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:58,300
Greetings, uncle and aunt.

654
00:33:58,300 --> 00:33:59,300
Tan.

655
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:01,300
Greetings, uncle and aunt.

656
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:05,300
My lord, you're here.

657
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:07,300
Why don't you go to the kitchen?

658
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:11,300
Miss Tan has asked me to make you some bread.

659
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:15,300
Tan hasn't slept well for days.

660
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:17,300
You should try it.

661
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:19,300
Tan, you're so thoughtful.

662
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:20,300
Let's go.

663
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:21,300
Father, please.

664
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:23,300
Brother-in-law, please.

665
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:27,300
He hasn't slept well for days.

666
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:29,300
What a bad luck!

667
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:31,300
Let's go.

668
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:46,300
Let's start.

669
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:49,300
Father, try this meat.

670
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:51,300
Let's see if it's good.

671
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:53,300
Let me try.

672
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:57,300
How does it taste?

673
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:59,300
It's soft and delicious.

674
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:01,300
It's very delicious.

675
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:04,300
I'm glad you like it.

676
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:05,300
I like it.

677
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:07,300
Why didn't you give me the meat and chicken?

678
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:09,300
I just sent it to the kitchen.

679
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:11,300
Yinxiang, send it to the kitchen.

680
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:13,300
I'll make the meat and chicken.

681
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:16,300
No need.

682
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:18,300
What do you mean?

683
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,300
Sister.

684
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:23,300
I can't decide what to cook and eat in my home?

685
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:27,300
Father, what's the difference between a daughter and a daughter-in-law?

686
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:30,300
I deserve to be bullied by my daughter.

687
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:31,300
I deserve to be bullied.

688
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:32,300
Enough.

689
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:35,300
Tan, you're sisters.

690
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:38,300
And Chu Chu is not a bad person.

691
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:40,300
Look at her.

692
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:42,300
My Lord, the food is here.

693
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:46,300
Sister, the food has been cooked.

694
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:48,300
It needs to be cooked again.

695
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:49,300
So I'm late.

696
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:55,300
I'm here to celebrate your birthday.

697
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:59,300
I won't treat you to a meal.

698
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:05,300
You need to eat while it's hot.

699
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:07,300
Sister, try it.

700
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:13,300
Mother.

701
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:19,300
I can prepare more dishes.

702
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:24,300
Miss, I'm sorry to have prepared more dishes.

703
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:30,300
I'm here to persuade mother.

704
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:35,300
Tan has found the dishes that mother often cooks.

705
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:39,300
Tan has found the dishes that mother often cooks.

706
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:48,300
I miss you.

707
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:07,300
I'm sorry.

708
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:10,300
Mother, what have you done?

709
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:15,300
Mother, it's not easy to live in the country with you.

710
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:18,300
You can't eat with us.

711
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:21,300
The rules of the country are different from the military.

712
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:26,300
I think your mother is a rational person.

713
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:30,300
I'm sorry.

714
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:33,300
I'm also a rational person.

715
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:37,300
But this is a family.

716
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:39,300
What's the rule?

717
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:45,300
It's not easy to live with me in the country.

718
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:47,300
The rules of the country are different from the military.

719
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:51,300
I think you have a lot of respect for me.

720
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:55,300
But now, people are following the rules in Shangjing.

721
00:37:55,300 --> 00:38:00,300
Mother, you told me that the family is strict.

722
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:04,300
If people know about this, they will be accused of being rude.

723
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:08,300
Father's reputation will be ruined.

724
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:11,300
Why did I ruin father's reputation?

725
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:16,300
Sister punished the servants in my house.

726
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:19,300
I heard that she had a fight with mother.

727
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:21,300
She almost hurt her father.

728
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:23,300
I was just teaching them a lesson.

729
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:25,300
They should remember their identity.

730
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:28,300
Mother didn't want to open the door.

731
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:30,300
She wanted us to enter through the door.

732
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:32,300
She wanted to see me.

733
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:35,300
Mother and I, and Lue'er, were also there.

734
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:37,300
She was there to punish me.

735
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:39,300
Lue'er is my personal maid.

736
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:41,300
She is always on the right track.

737
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:44,300
Mother always follows the rules.

738
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:46,300
She is the head of the family.

739
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:49,300
She has been living in the family for a long time.

740
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:53,300
But she hurt people in public.

741
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:57,300
She hurt father and father's reputation.

742
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:13,300
I don't know how many people are watching us.

743
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:15,300
We are the daughter family.

744
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:17,300
We are the daughter family.

745
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:20,300
We can't help father in politics.

746
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:22,300
But we should be reasonable.

747
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:26,300
We should be careful.

748
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:30,300
What Tan'er said is right.

749
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:31,300
Father!

750
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:32,300
Enough!

751
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:34,300
You are too old to understand.

752
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:36,300
Tan'er is right.

753
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:39,300
You should learn from your sister.

754
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:42,300
We are here to welcome brother-in-law.

755
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:44,300
Why are you talking about the education?

756
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:45,300
We will talk about it later.

757
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:47,300
Your uncle is right.

758
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:51,300
Today we are here to have a family reunion.

759
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:54,300
We are here to have a family reunion.

760
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:01,300
Miss, this is from the door.

761
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:03,300
It's very important to you.

762
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:05,300
It's very important to you.

763
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:07,300
It's very important to you.

764
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:09,300
It's very important to you.

765
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:13,300
Who sent this letter?

766
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:15,300
It's the manager of Wentao Pavilion.

767
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:22,300
The two guards who pushed Miss Yatui into the water.

768
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:25,300
They are hiding in the west of Wentao Pavilion.

769
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:35,300
Why didn't you hand the letter to Marquis Jing'an?

770
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:38,300
Why didn't you hand the letter to Marquis Jing'an?

771
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:41,300
I was afraid of trouble.

772
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:44,300
If you had handed the letter to Marquis Jing'an,

773
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:47,300
he would have been suspicious and would have investigated the case.

774
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:51,300
But you came forward and saved us from trouble.

775
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:53,300
If it wasn't for you,

776
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:56,300
I would have already killed the Duke of Lingguo.

777
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:59,300
Marquis Jing'an is a rare talent.

778
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:03,300
If you really married him, it would be difficult.

779
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:06,300
I'm afraid that Miss Mingjia is a very cunning person.

780
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:09,300
Otherwise, this matter would have been delayed for a long time.

781
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:16,300
What happened to the Shangyuan Night?

782
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:18,300
Father,

783
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:20,300
the Shangyuan Night is a very difficult night.

784
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:22,300
The Liang family is very impulsive.

785
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:24,300
They didn't let us go into the water.

786
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:26,300
The Liang family did this

787
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:28,300
to make me forget about my mother.

788
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:30,300
I was lucky to be able to get out of the water.

789
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:32,300
So, Liang Zixuan didn't succeed.

790
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:35,300
You are shameless.

791
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:36,300
You are ridiculous.

792
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:37,300
You are shameless.

793
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:39,300
Does your father know about this?

794
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:40,300
Tan is the witness.

795
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:42,300
He should have found out the truth.

796
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:44,300
So, he didn't tell father.

797
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:47,300
I only know that the Shangyuan Night is still not back.

798
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:49,300
I didn't know that you were in danger.

799
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:52,300
How could you two hide such a big matter from me?

800
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:55,300
We didn't want you to worry.

801
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:57,300
Besides, this matter is not a big deal.

802
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:00,300
It's better to keep it a secret.

803
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:04,300
Tan, don't worry.

804
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:06,300
Father will definitely find justice for you.

805
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:17,300
Don't go.

806
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:19,300
What did you do?

807
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:20,300
I didn't do anything.

808
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:22,300
Don't you know about the Shangyuan Night?

809
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:23,300
Tell me.

810
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:24,300
I...

811
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:27,300
I was just following my father's order.

812
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:29,300
I don't care about anything else.

813
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:33,300
Liang Qiwei, you are a bastard.

814
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:37,300
Did the Liang family get the letter of marriage?

815
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:39,300
The marriage contract has been set.

816
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:40,300
Once the Duke returns to the capital,

817
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:42,300
the marriage will be postponed.

818
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:43,300
Why did he take this decision?

819
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:46,300
Liang Zixuan had a brother and sister-in-law.

820
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:49,300
He just had a son.

821
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:52,300
The Liang family is afraid that father will cancel the marriage.

822
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:56,300
So he had to leave the capital and return to the capital.

823
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:01,300
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

824
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:04,300
I heard that the Liang family has a strong foundation.

825
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:05,300
I don't know about the court.

826
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:09,300
I'm afraid that the marriage will affect father's decision.

827
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:13,300
Which part of the Liang family can affect my family?

828
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:14,300
Come.

829
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:17,300
Go and cancel the marriage.

830
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:20,300
No, I won't go.

831
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:23,300
I won't go.

832
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:31,300
As you expected,

833
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:35,300
the Liang family is afraid that the marriage will affect father's decision.

834
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:37,300
So they won't let go easily.

835
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:39,300
Even if the Duke returns,

836
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:42,300
the marriage will not be postponed.

837
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:43,300
Yes.

838
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:52,300
Speak.

839
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:56,300
Xuan'er fell into the water.

840
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:58,300
The whole Shangjing knows about it.

841
00:43:58,300 --> 00:43:59,300
Yes.

842
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:01,300
Since we entered this door,

843
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:04,300
we have found out the source of the water.

844
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:05,300
The water is not sweet.

845
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:08,300
If we can cancel the marriage today,

846
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:10,300
we will be in a good position.

847
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:13,300
If the water is sweet,

848
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:15,300
it will affect father's decision.

849
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:19,300
Duke,

850
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:22,300
the marriage will be postponed.

851
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:25,300
Why are you so anxious about the marriage?

852
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:26,300
Yes.

853
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:27,300
It must be because of the marriage.

854
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:33,300
We are the only ones who can think of a solution.

855
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:35,300
The whole Liang family is very fond of sweet.

856
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:36,300
When he enters the door,

857
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:38,300
I will treat him like my own daughter.

858
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:41,300
I will not let him suffer.

859
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:44,300
You are still arguing with me.

860
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:45,300
How dare you!

861
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:49,300
Don't think that I don't know that

862
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:52,300
your niece has lived here for a long time.

863
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:55,300
She has a son and a daughter.

864
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:10,300
I will not let you suffer.

865
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:12,300
I will not let you suffer.

866
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:14,300
I will not let you suffer.

867
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:16,300
I will not let you suffer.

868
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:18,300
I will not let you suffer.

869
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:20,300
I will not let you suffer.

870
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:22,300
I will not let you suffer.

871
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:24,300
I will not let you suffer.

872
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:26,300
I will not let you suffer.

873
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:28,300
I will not let you suffer.

874
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:30,300
I will not let you suffer.

875
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:32,300
I will not let you suffer.

876
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:34,300
I will not let you suffer.

877
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:36,300
I will not let you suffer.

878
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:38,300
I will not let you suffer.

879
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:40,300
I will not let you suffer.

880
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:42,300
I will not let you suffer.

881
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:44,300
I will not let you suffer.

882
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:46,300
I will not let you suffer.

883
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:48,300
I will not let you suffer.

884
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:50,300
I will not let you suffer.

885
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:52,300
I will not let you suffer.

886
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:54,300
I will not let you suffer.

887
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:56,300
I will not let you suffer.

888
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:58,300
I will not let you suffer.

889
00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:00,300
