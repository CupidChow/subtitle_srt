00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,380
make them eager to come back for more.

344
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:26,810
Though we finally have hope now,

345
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,230
and it looks promising,

346
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:31,160
if we want to build the relief hall,

347
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:32,320
I'm afraid the money

348
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:33,900
is still far from enough.

349
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:37,190
Helping the refugees

350
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:38,720
can't wait.

351
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:48,830
What the capital has in abundance

352
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:50,470
are poetry salons and literary gatherings.

353
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:51,570
Maybe we should

354
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:52,790
attend more of those.

355
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:53,870
And while we're there,

356
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:55,540
encourage others to donate together.

357
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:56,330
Those events

358
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,600
draw all sorts of influential people.

359
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,570
For the sake of their reputation,

360
00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:00,170
they'll have to donate some.

361
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:02,460
That would work,

362
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:04,030
but only once.

363
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:05,760
It's not a long-term solution.

364
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,890
If only the private businesses

365
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:11,819
under Prince of Dingbei's Mansion

366
00:17:12,109 --> 00:17:14,109
could bring in more profit.

367
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:44,510
Second Young Master Shu,
you truly have extraordinary demeanor.

368
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:46,550
Your Highness, you have a discerning eye.

369
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:47,610
These accessories

370
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,030
are all top quality.

371
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:50,180
Wearing them

372
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:51,420
makes me more dignified

373
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:52,750
and elevates my status.

374
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:55,900
Second Young Master Shu,
you're being too modest.

375
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,520
If the jewelry from Cuojin Pavilion

376
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,720
is to sell well,

377
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:00,260
we'll need to rely on you.

378
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,750
Your Highness, that's a great idea.

379
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:04,510
This way,

380
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:05,420
the business of Cuojin Pavilion

381
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:06,750
will surely boom.

382
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:08,120
Suxin,

383
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:09,940
go select a few more suitable pieces.

384
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:10,590
Yes.

385
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:11,800
No.

386
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,420
This part is not good enough.

387
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:14,900
It can't show Second Young Master Shu's

388
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,510
-Your Highness.
-extraordinary elegance.

389
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:18,160
A tiny flaw can ruin

390
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:19,430
the whole.

391
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:22,030
Though your expertise lies in landscapes,

392
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:23,360
you mustn't treat

393
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:25,000
a portrait so carelessly.

394
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:27,200
Miss, you said it with such certainty.

395
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,160
Why don't you do it yourself?

396
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,220
If I knew how to paint,

397
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,240
why would I hire you?

398
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:35,440
I'll keep quiet.

399
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:36,470
Go on.

400
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:38,550
I wonder why Miss Bai

401
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:40,620
is doing this.

402
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,010
Minmin thinks

403
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:45,010
it would be a terrible waste

404
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:46,350
not to publicize your current style

405
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:47,920
given your popularity.

406
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:48,660
But

407
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,030
the painter Minmin hired is the worst

408
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:51,790
at portraiture in the capital.

409
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:53,350
You can rest assured.

410
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:54,810
No one will recognize you.

411
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:58,020
The worst?

412
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:00,690
You should have asked me

413
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,510
to paint it myself.

414
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,310
What did you say?

415
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:07,840
N-Nothing.

416
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:15,990
This one is not bad.

417
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,530
The fan tassel and jade pendant

418
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:32,890
match Second Young Master Shu's outfit

419
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:33,990
perfectly.

420
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,470
Pack these two as well

421
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,550
-for Second Young Master Shu.
-Yes.

422
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:45,980
If this portrait

423
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:48,140
could be widely circulated in the capital,

424
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:49,750
the publicity

425
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:51,190
would be unmatched.

426
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:52,690
We must

427
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:54,920
trouble you, Second Young Master Shu.

428
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:56,270
No problem.

429
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:05,330
Xu?

430
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:10,980
Bad timing. I was just about to leave.

431
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,030
I'll come back to you later.

432
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:12,750
Tan.

433
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:14,460
You can leave this matter to me.

434
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:16,270
I'll go oversee the painter now.

435
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:18,000
I promise you'll be satisfied.

436
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:27,460
Xu, why are you

437
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:28,680
back so early today?

438
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:33,140
I've finished the military affairs.

439
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:34,570
So I came back early

440
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:36,320
-to...
-Help yourself.

441
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:37,600
When dinner is ready,

442
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,060
I'll ask Suxin to tell you.

443
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:40,790
No.

444
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:41,660
Starting tomorrow,

445
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:43,510
customer traffic will surely spike.

446
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:44,720
Make sure to urge the shopkeeper

447
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,350
to assign tasks in advance.

448
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:46,030
Yes.

449
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:46,980
Also,

450
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,900
remember to place the same items
as Second Young Master Shu's

451
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,240
in the most prominent area.

452
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,510
Emphasize that they're limited-edition.

453
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:53,380
Your Highness, your idea

454
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:55,320
is truly brilliant!

455
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:57,130
Your Highness.

456
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,270
The account book is ready.

457
00:20:59,270 --> 00:20:59,930
Coming.

458
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,110
[On the 15th day,
for their daughter's marriage,]

459
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:13,660
[the Liu family bought a gem-inlaid
tortoiseshell comb, a coronet,]

460
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:14,210
[and three gold-foil floral hairpins.
Total: 200 taels of silver.]

461
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:49,070
What's up, Xu?

462
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:53,500
Today, you

463
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:55,570
specially invited Jingran?

464
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:02,680
You want his help?

465
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:04,140
Yes.

466
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,290
What kind of help?

467
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:15,980
Refugees in the capital
keep growing in number.

468
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:17,330
Our income from storybooks

469
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:18,070
isn't enough.

470
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:18,850
So,

471
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:20,470
I'm looking for ways to boost profits

472
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:21,980
at Cuojin Pavilion and Jinxiu Workshop.

473
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:23,430
Then I'll use some of the profits

474
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:24,670
to help the refugees.

475
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:28,350
What does that have to do with Jingran?

476
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:29,460
Jingran

477
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:30,430
is the most admired gentleman

478
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:32,560
among the noble ladies in the capital.

479
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:33,880
Wherever he goes,

480
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,830
he's scrutinized from head to toe.

481
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:37,140
If he wears

482
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:38,660
Cuojin Pavilion's jewelry,

483
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:39,750
he'll set the trend

484
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:41,980
for young men in the capital.

485
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:42,970
And

486
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:44,880
the young ladies who admire him

487
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:46,640
will flock to Cuojin Pavilion.

488
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,770
I remember Cuojin Pavilion's pieces

489
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:50,970
are quite expensive.

490
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:53,650
You just gave them to him?

491
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:55,780
Of course not.

492
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,060
I just let him

493
00:22:57,090 --> 00:22:58,890
wear them for free for a few days.

494
00:22:58,900 --> 00:22:59,960
Second Young Master Shu

495
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,910
is popular
at poetry salons and literary gatherings.

496
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:03,170
If he wears

497
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,250
our jewelry pieces daily,

498
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:05,750
they'll serve

499
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:07,640
as live promotion.

500
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,180
But why does it have to be Jingran?

501
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:15,570
Who else charms ladies so effortlessly?

502
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:18,030
It has to be Second Young Master Shu.

503
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:19,590
Or do you have someone else in mind

504
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:21,050
who might be more fitting?

505
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:00,750
Your Highness, here is
the newly arrived tea.

506
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:01,880
Please have a taste.

507
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:10,270
How is it?

508
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,140
Not bad.

509
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:17,950
Suxin,

510
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:21,130
did you notice anything strange

511
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:22,690
about His Highness today?

512
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:25,590
He stopped mid-sentence

513
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:28,380
and didn't answer when I asked him about it.

514
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:31,830
From the look on his face just now,

515
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:33,750
could he be jealous of

516
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:35,150
Second Young Master Shu?

517
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,220
That can't be.

518
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:44,710
Jealous over something

519
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:46,180
so groundless?

520
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:47,830
If that's true,

521
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:49,290
it would be a little petty.

522
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:52,840
But think about it, Your Highness.

523
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:53,580
Why did the Prince

524
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:55,780
come back to the mansion so early today?

525
00:24:57,870 --> 00:24:59,220
He must have wanted

526
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:00,530
to surprise you.

527
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:02,260
But who would have thought, upon entering,

528
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:04,110
he'd see you entertaining another man

529
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:05,110
and giving him so many valuable pieces

530
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:07,270
of jewelry right in front of him?

531
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:09,320
No wonder he's jealous.

532
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:10,860
Even if he knows there's nothing

533
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:12,770
going on between you
and Second Young Master Shu,

534
00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:13,760
he's still bound to

535
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,560
feel a little jealous deep down.

536
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:19,710
Even groundless jealousy is still jealousy.

537
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:21,510
The way he behaves

538
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:23,990
shows he cares about me.

539
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,890
So maybe I should do something

540
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:29,110
and try to comfort him a little?

541
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:30,340
Exactly.

542
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:32,550
Think about it. Since your wedding,

543
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:33,770
Your Highness has never given

544
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:35,100
His Highness anything.

545
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,200
But today,

546
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:37,620
you gave all that jewelry

547
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:38,700
to another man.

548
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:40,910
Of course he minds.

549
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:42,550
Have I really

550
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,940
never given Xu anything?

551
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:52,820
I always thought I was
attentive and thoughtful.

552
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:54,390
How could I overlook something

553
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:55,880
so important to him?

554
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:58,980
But what should I give?

555
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:02,590
What can you give?

556
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,810
What can you give?

557
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:10,650
Suxin,

558
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:11,900
do you remember

559
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:13,590
the day we were ambushed
by mountain bandits,

560
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:14,730
I had a black sash

561
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:15,880
tied around me?

562
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:17,190
Yes, I remember.

563
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:18,050
Where is it now?

564
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:20,310
It should be stored at

565
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:21,320
Zhaoshui House.

566
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:22,390
Quickly, go to the Marquis' mansion

567
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:23,390
and bring it back.

568
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,920
His Highness dislikes extravagance.

569
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,070
He's used to simplicity.

570
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:27,240
That sash suits him

571
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:28,330
perfectly.

572
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:30,410
You're giving His Highness

573
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:31,560
something that already

574
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,510
belongs to him?

575
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:34,450
How is that even appropriate?

576
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:36,670
You just don't understand.

577
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,040
-I...
-Go get it.

578
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,040
Got it.

579
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:47,220
I want one too.

580
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:48,590
There's plenty to go around. Come on.

581
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:50,870
No need to push or fight. Everyone gets one.

582
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:51,620
Once you get your portrait,

583
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:53,150
please step aside

584
00:26:53,170 --> 00:26:54,310
so others can get theirs too.

585
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:56,030
You can hang it above your bed,

586
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:57,380
attach it to your wardrobe,

587
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:58,940
or place it on your vanity.

588
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:00,370
Please move aside.

589
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:01,820
Miss Minmin, here you go.

590
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:03,070
Suxin, you came at just the right moment.

591
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:04,830
Nanzhi and I are swamped.

592
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:08,450
Second Young Master Shu is truly popular.

593
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:09,450
Come on.

594
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:11,110
We might need to hire
a few more portrait artists

595
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:12,030
just to keep up.

596
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:13,030
Here you go, no need to rush.
There's enough for everyone.

597
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:14,250
Didn't Miss Minmin say

598
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:15,060
she hired the worst

599
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:16,720
portrait artist in the whole capital?

600
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,580
But this clearly looks like
Second Young Master Shu.

601
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:19,340
Are you dumb?

602
00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:20,540
If it didn't look like him,

603
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:21,410
who'd want it?

604
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:22,840
Then all the planning Tan and I did

605
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,040
would be for nothing.

606
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:25,510
Come on, stop daydreaming.

607
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:26,750
Help us hand these out.

608
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:27,890
Here, I've got some right here.

609
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:29,120
Two more for you.

610
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:30,970
Do you like this one?

611
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:32,490
Why the long face?

612
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,120
Is something troubling you?

613
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:36,280
It's my lady.

614
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:37,790
She's going to
a matchmaking meeting tomorrow,

615
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:39,140
but she couldn't

616
00:27:39,170 --> 00:27:40,450
care less.

617
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,600
What to wear, which accessories,

618
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:43,810
how to do her makeup—

619
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:45,960
she's not paying any attention at all.

620
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:48,110
You seem more anxious

621
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:49,240
than she is.

622
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:51,520
The Princess Consort will be there too.

623
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,710
So don't worry.

624
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,390
Two mace of patchouli,

625
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:04,870
one candareen of borneol.

626
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:14,150
Lyu'e,

627
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,270
go to the trunk

628
00:28:15,290 --> 00:28:16,700
and bring out all of His Highness's clothes.

629
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:18,490
It's mosquito season.

630
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:19,710
Fumigate the clothes

631
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:22,030
to keep him from being bitten
while he's out.

632
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:23,380
Yes, Your Highness.

633
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:28,110
If only Your Highness could see

634
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:29,110
how Miss Minmin is

635
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:31,350
practically desperate to have
everyone in the capital

636
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:32,110
own a portrait

637
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:33,640
of Second Young Master Shu.

638
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:36,660
She might as well be going
door to door, knocking on every household.

639
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:39,400
This kind of task should be left to her.

640
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:40,940
With that kind of enthusiasm,

641
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:41,700
she could make

642
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:44,460
♪ A quiet wish born in the dark ♪

643
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,030
Cuojin Pavilion's jewelry

644
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:44,510
an overnight sensation.

645
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:48,530
♪ Will it reach someone's ears at all? ♪

646
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:53,070

00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,700

00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:16,340

652
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:33,740
Who else charms the ladies so effortlessly?

653
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:35,930
It has to be Second Young Master Shu.

654
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:38,640
I think Tan is

655
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:40,900
gentle, virtuous, well-educated,
and well-mannered.

656
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:42,750
She's exceptional in both talent and beauty.

657
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:45,880
She would be a perfect match
for Second Young Master Shu.

658
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:48,320
A refined gentleman is someone

659
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:50,820
whose knowledge deepens through discussion

660
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:54,220
and whose character
grows nobler through self-reflection.

661
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:04,000
Your Highness,

662
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,740
these are new clothes

663
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:08,670
that the Princess Consort
specially prepared for you.

664
00:30:08,670 --> 00:30:09,660
I'm not wearing those.

665
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:10,520
Take them away.

666
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:14,060
You don't like the style?

667
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:20,250
Her Highness even had a matching set

668
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:21,940
made for herself.

669
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:27,040
Bring them here.

670
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:32,170
The owner of Jinxiu Workshop said

671
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,050
this couple's outfit is one-of-a-kind

672
00:30:34,050 --> 00:30:35,330
in the capital.

673
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:37,460
The pattern, color, and style

674
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:40,480
were all personally chosen
by the Princess Consort.

675
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:41,360
Look,

676
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:43,270
the purple cloud pattern on this garment.

677
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:45,520
It's because I once casually mentioned that

678
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,190
you liked it,

679
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:49,090
and she remembered.

680
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:58,520
Your Highness,

681
00:30:58,900 --> 00:30:59,950
you usually

682
00:30:59,970 --> 00:31:01,730
keep everyone at arm's length,

683
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,090
and we've grown used to it.

684
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:04,850
But you shouldn't

685
00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:06,360
treat the Princess Consort

686
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,660
so coldly too.

687
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:11,210
I'm already past sixty,

688
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:12,550
and I still hope to help prepare

689
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:15,750
for the joyous occasion of
welcoming a new family member.

690
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:21,670
As for the rest of
the Cuojin Pavilion's jewelry,

691
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:24,270
is there anything suitable for me?

692
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:25,820
Yes, definitely.

693
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:29,150
Bring me some.

694
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:30,510
Right away.

695
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:43,110
[Qi'an Hall]

696
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:49,990
Your Highness,

697
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:51,140
the Prince is here.

698
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:52,630
His Highness goes to the training ground

699
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:53,700
at dawn every day.

700
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:55,530
Coming back at this hour

701
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:56,720
isn't unusual.

702
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:58,200
But His Highness...

703
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:42,510
You specially sent me new clothes

704
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:44,550
so we could wear

705
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:46,320
matching outfits as a couple?

706
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:52,270
Your Highness usually
dresses quite plainly,

707
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:53,760
but today, truly,

708
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:57,670
you look like an immortal
descended from heaven.

709
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:02,750
I wonder what it means

710
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:04,310
when husband and wife

711
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:06,790
wear matching clothes.

712
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:10,180
There's a line in the "Book of Songs":

713
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:12,870
"How can you say you have no clothes?
I will share my robes with you."

714
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:14,460
When I was younger, I read that line

715
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:15,660
and the grand, tragic image

716
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,240
of warriors fighting side by side

717
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,900
has stayed with me ever since.

718
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:20,380
I haven't had the chance

719
00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:22,040
to go into battle

720
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:23,190
with you.

721
00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:24,680
But

722
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:26,190
in everyday life,

723
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:28,260
wearing matching outfits helps

724
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,310
make up for that regret.

725
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:34,680
This clothing is nice.

726
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:38,700
It suits us perfectly.

727
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:40,980
Have Jinxiu Workshop

728
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:42,220
prepare a few more sets later.

729
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:42,900
Got it.

730
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:45,980
If Your Highness likes it,

731
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:48,020
clothes will always be aplenty.

732
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,070
But later today,

733
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:52,020
you must wear this set

734
00:33:52,050 --> 00:33:54,120
to Changchun Garden to pick me up.

735
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:57,270
What are you

736
00:33:57,830 --> 00:33:58,960
planning this time?

737
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:03,400
I want to use these couple's outfits

738
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:05,940
to attract customers
for the Jinxiu Workshop

739
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:08,060
and raise funds for the refugees.

740
00:34:12,790 --> 00:34:14,790
Changchun Garden is a royal garden.

741
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:16,070
Most visitors are

742
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:17,710
noble ladies from prestigious families.

743
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:19,900
If we show up dressed alike,

744
00:34:19,949 --> 00:34:21,320
they'll all be envious

745
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:23,739
and try to imitate us.

746
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:29,830
I appreciate your kindness.

747
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:33,000
Once I finish my official business today,

748
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:35,480
I'll head to Changchun Garden to meet you.

749
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:37,830
Wait, Your Highness.

750
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:49,699
You used this sash

751
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:51,620
to save me twice.

752
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:53,190
I always thought

753
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:54,710
it carried

754
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:56,020
the bond between us.

755
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:58,160
So I personally prepared

756
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,230
a special fragrance

757
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:00,420
and infused it into the sash.

758
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:02,280
Now, I give it back to you as a gift.

759
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:04,670
This scent is refreshing and unique.

760
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:08,070
It'll ward off insects and evil
during the summer.

761
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:14,720
It's truly

762
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:17,310
a fine gift.

763
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:24,230
They say courtesy demands reciprocity.

764
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:26,030
Since I've given you something,

765
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:27,220
shouldn't Your Highness

766
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:29,010
return the favor?

767
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:33,410
Why don’t you

768
00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:34,740
help Her Highness

769
00:35:34,770 --> 00:35:36,580
draw her eyebrows, Your Highness?

770
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:37,680
Draw my eyebrows?

771
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:43,640
Do you even know
how to draw eyebrows, Your Highness?

772
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:46,550
Then please draw them for me.

773
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:50,380
Brows come in

774
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:51,460
many styles.

775
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:53,100
What kind of brows

776
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:54,510
would you draw for me?

777
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:57,010
I do have some skills

778
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:58,910
in painting and poetry.

779
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:01,180
Don't worry.

780
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:09,100
Oh, right.

781
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:11,500
When you have a chance,
tell Young Lord Zhang

782
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:12,400
that Minmin

783
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:15,280
will be at Changchun Garden today
for matchmaking.

784
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,630
Why should I tell him?

785
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:22,120
Just trust me, Your Highness.

786
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:32,150
Does it look good?

787
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:32,880
It's done.

788
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:35,030
Once I finish up, I'll come pick you up.

789
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:50,350
How dare he!

790
00:36:56,830 --> 00:36:57,630
Should I

791
00:36:57,670 --> 00:36:58,750
help Your Highness

792
00:36:58,770 --> 00:37:00,700
remove your makeup and start over?

793
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:21,080
[Changchun Garden]

794
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:19,480
The Zhou family

795
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,680
is a renowned scholarly family in Xian.

796
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:23,470
Both the main and collateral branches

797
00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:25,540
have produced many
renowned scholars and ministers.

798
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:26,950
With such a background,

799
00:37:27,310 --> 00:37:28,750
Young Master Zhou

800
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:30,010
is already highly respected

801
00:37:30,010 --> 00:37:31,580
among the gentry.

He and Second Young Master Shu

803
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:34,170
are close friends as well.

804
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:39,310
Master and Madam have instructed me

805
00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:41,190
to make sure you attend

806
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:43,680
today's matchmaking event, no matter what.

807
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:49,400
I'm not good at this.

808
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:51,280
Why don't we just forget about it?

809
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:00,440
Minmin,

810
00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:02,230
do you already have someone you like?

811
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:03,190
Of course not.

812
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:05,160
Then why are you running away?

813
00:38:05,270 --> 00:38:06,270
Matchmaking is just

814
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:07,980
another chance to meet someone.

815
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:09,830
If you really don't like him
after the meeting,

816
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:10,890
you can just say no.

817
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:12,980
But you said

818
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:15,310
Young Master Zhou is exceptional.

819
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:16,790
I'm not even

820
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:17,620
as well-read as

821
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:18,790
the fish in our pond.

822
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,420
How could we possibly be a match?

823
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:21,190
Also,

824
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:22,660
my parents

825
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:23,820
have such high hopes for me.

826
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:25,510
Aren't they worried
I'll just embarrass myself

827
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:27,170
and bring shame to the family?

828
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:29,730
That's exactly why you must go.

829
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:31,240
You need to show

830
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:33,180
Uncle and Aunt that

831
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,350
it's not you who's unwilling,

832
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:36,920
but that those young noblemen

833
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,030
are too picky

834
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:39,210
and unrealistic.

835
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:40,900
Only then will they finally stop

836
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:43,100
pressuring you into more matchmaking.

837
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:46,040
Tan,

838
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:47,600
what you said makes a lot of sense.

839
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:48,660
As expected of you.

840
00:38:49,350 --> 00:38:50,150
Alright then.

841
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:51,930
It's best not to have outsiders present

842
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:53,280
during a matchmaking meeting.

843
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,140
I'll wait for you in the pavilion.

844
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:56,510
Let's go.

845
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:09,150
That jewelry shop in the suburbs

846
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:09,940
is quite nice.

847
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:10,900
Let's visit it tomorrow.

848
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:11,670
Sure.

849
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:15,870
Suxin,

850
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:17,270
go check

851
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:19,420
if Young Lord Zhang
has arrived at Changchun Garden.

852
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:20,540
If you see him,

853
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:23,190
ask him to head to the koi pond
by the western garden.

854
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:26,060
Why is Your Highness
inquiring about Young Lord Zhang?

855
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:27,190
If he's here,

856
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:28,350
Uncle and Aunt

857
00:39:28,350 --> 00:39:29,190
won't have to worry about

858
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:30,710
Minmin's marriage anymore.

859
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:32,630
What if he hasn't come?

860
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:35,100
If he doesn't show up,

861
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:37,020
it would still be good for Minmin

862
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:38,820
to get to know Young Master Zhou.

863
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:40,440
But I believe

864
00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:43,380
Young Lord Zhang must have already
heard the news

865
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:45,530
and arrived early to prepare.

866
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:46,870
Yes.

867
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:04,450
Princess, are you alright?

868
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:07,870
I suddenly feel a sharp pain

869
00:40:07,870 --> 00:40:08,980
in my abdomen.

870
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:11,230
Madam,

871
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:13,350
maybe we should reschedule the matchmaking.

872
00:40:13,350 --> 00:40:14,310
Yes, Madam.

873
00:40:14,310 --> 00:40:15,420
Princess,

874
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:17,980
your little tricks

875
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:19,540
won't fool me.

876
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:21,020
I...

877
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:24,700
Princess,

878
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:26,550
the Empress Dowager

879
00:40:26,570 --> 00:40:28,830
has worn herself out
worrying about the Su family.

880
00:40:28,830 --> 00:40:31,550
You should try to be more understanding.

881
00:40:32,790 --> 00:40:34,790
Your engagement to Young Master Gao

882
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:36,900
is also part of her thoughtful plan,

883
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:38,630
all for the sake of your future.

884
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:39,920
No matter

885
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:41,540
how idle Gao Chen may seem now,

886
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:43,470
one day, he will inherit the title.

887
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:45,700
When that time comes,

888
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:47,750
you'll be a marquise,

889
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:49,440
with the whole marquisate

890
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:51,360
under your command.

891
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:53,000
Madam is keeping a close eye.

892
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,730
I really couldn't do anything.

893
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:00,800
Well, since things have come to this,

894
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:02,330
I'll go then.

895
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:13,560
What is she doing here?

896
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:25,740
Madam,

897
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:28,310
I was thoughtless before

898
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:31,060
and didn't appreciate Grandmother's efforts.

899
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:32,440
But what you just said

900
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:33,710
has enlightened me.

901
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:35,430
Since I'm already here,

902
00:41:35,430 --> 00:41:37,160
there's no harm in meeting him.

903
00:41:38,270 --> 00:41:40,310
I'm glad you've come around, Princess.

904
00:41:40,310 --> 00:41:42,100
Young Master Gao will be here shortly.

905
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:44,380
Let me accompany you
to the side room while we wait.

906
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:45,020
Let's go.

907
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:48,980
When it comes to matchmaking,

908
00:41:49,150 --> 00:41:51,150
men and women should speak

909
00:41:51,230 --> 00:41:52,890
freely and honestly.

910
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:54,020
Only then can they

911
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:55,640
truly get to know each other.

912
00:41:55,830 --> 00:41:57,290
If you're present,

913
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:00,250
Young Master Gao might be
too formal and hold back.

914
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:02,230
He won't show his true self.

915
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:05,230
Why don't you wait outside, Nanny?

916
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:06,630
I'll meet with him alone.

917
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:10,650
Madam,

918
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:12,620
I'm already here.

919
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,570
It's not like I can just run off now.

920
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:16,090
Besides,

921
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:17,400
whether I go through
with the matchmaking or not,

922
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,040
Grandmother will find out either way.

923
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,440
Why would I lie to you?

924
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:25,650
Take your time, Princess.

925
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:28,270
Have a proper conversation
with Young Master Gao

926
00:42:28,270 --> 00:42:30,400
and get to know him better.

927
00:42:30,430 --> 00:42:31,100
Alright, Madam.

928
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:31,950
Don't worry.

929
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:10,790
He can't even be punctual for a matchmaking.

930
00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:13,710
What value is there
in all his so-called talent and virtue?

931
00:43:13,710 --> 00:43:14,980
Nanzhi, let's go.

932
00:43:19,210 --> 00:43:20,150
Miss Bai.

933
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:23,310
Miss Bai,

934
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:24,980
I apologize for being late.

935
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:26,460
I was teaching my younger brother
the Nine Arithmetical Operations,

936
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:27,590
part of the Six Arts.

937
00:43:27,630 --> 00:43:29,380
I got so engrossed
that I lost track of time.

938
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:30,530
It was truly thoughtless of me.

939
00:43:30,530 --> 00:43:32,130
Please forgive me, Miss Bai.

940
00:43:32,790 --> 00:43:35,470
What are the Six Arts
and the Nine Arithmetical Operations?

941
00:43:35,470 --> 00:43:36,610
To instill proper conduct
in the youth of our nation,

942
00:43:36,610 --> 00:43:38,070
we teach them the Six Arts.

943
00:43:38,270 --> 00:43:39,530
First: the Five Rites.

944
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:40,940
Second: the Six Forms of Music.

945
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:41,960
Third: the Five Techniques of Archery.

946
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:42,730
Fourth: the Five Techniques of Horsemanship.

947
00:43:42,730 --> 00:43:43,640
Fifth: the Six Styles of Calligraphy.

948
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:44,530
And sixth: the Nine Arithmetical Operations.

949
00:43:44,530 --> 00:43:45,640
The Nine Arithmetical Operations include:

950
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:46,730
measuring farmland, converting grain ratios,

951
00:43:46,730 --> 00:43:47,780
calculating tax distribution,
measuring land dimensions...

952
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:48,500
Young Master Zhou.

953
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:49,710
Estimating earthworks,
calculating transport costs,

954
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:50,540
solving equations,
computing gains and losses...

955
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:51,390
Young Master Zhou!
