1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
little bit of a

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
little bit of a

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
little bit of a

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
little bit of a

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
little bit of a

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
little bit of a

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
little bit of a

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
little bit of a

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
little bit of a

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
little bit of a

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
little bit of a

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
little bit of a

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
little bit of a

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
little bit of a

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
little bit of

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
a little bit

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,860
of a

19
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:57,400
There's certain employers who

20
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,400
Why did you eat the fish?

21
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,400
Your highness picked the fish yourself.

22
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,400
It's very good.

23
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:05,900
If I don't eat it,

24
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,900
I will not let him down.

25
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:10,400
But luckily I don't eat too much.

26
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,400
It will be fine in a few days.

27
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:17,900
Oh, right.

28
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:18,900
When you return,

29
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,400
you should pack up all the things you haven't used in the past two years.

30
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,400
Use them as much as you can.

31
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:25,900
You don't need to spend money to buy the same things anymore.

32
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,400
Yes.

33
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,900
Your highness, you have to go out tomorrow.

34
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,400
You should rest early.

35
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,400
I will serve you to wash and change your clothes.

36
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:39,900
I'm leaving.

37
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:42,900
Go.

38
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:47,900
Your highness.

39
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,400
The money and food sent by the Ministry of Revenue has been cleared.

40
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,400
There is no mistake.

41
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:53,900
Okay.

42
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:54,900
Let's go.

43
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:55,900
Yes.

44
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:58,900
Go.

45
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:02,900
Father!

46
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:03,900
Father!

47
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:05,900
Yu!

48
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,400
Lord Xu.

49
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:14,900
Why are you here?

50
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,400
I heard that father is in danger.

51
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,400
So I came to see you off.

52
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,400
My wife is worried that Lizhou is cold.

53
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,900
So she sent you to save her.

54
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,900
Beile Gu is a naughty man.

55
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,900
Please take care of yourself.

56
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,400
And return to the capital safely.

57
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,400
Tan'er is a child.

58
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,900
She is afraid of separation.

59
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,900
My wife Yang Xilu didn't come to see me off.

60
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,900
But she sent me a tiger.

61
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,900
She said that tiger can be with father every day.

62
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,400
Yuanzhang.

63
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,900
There are some antidotes for the poison.

64
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,900
There are several other hidden weapons.

65
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,400
I have prepared them for you.

66
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,400
Maybe.

67
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,400
You are so thoughtful.

68
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,900
I'm sorry to see you go to Lizhou.

69
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,900
Now that the doctor of Yang Xilu is in danger.

70
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,900
The army is in danger.

71
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,900
I hope you can be careful.

72
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:25,900
Take care of yourself.

73
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:27,900
Yuanzhang.

74
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:28,900
Be careful.

75
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:34,900
Liu Bu.

76
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:37,900
Go.

77
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:55,900
Your highness.

78
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:56,900
What's wrong?

79
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:58,900
Your highness.

80
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,900
I'm here to give you medicine.

81
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,900
You can't eat the lotus.

82
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,900
You will get sick.

83
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,900
I know you care about your health.

84
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,900
So I want to give you another medicine.

85
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,900
So you can get better soon.

86
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,900
I know I can't eat it.

87
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,900
Why don't you eat it?

88
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,900
You are so kind.

89
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,900
You are so kind.

90
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,900
Give it to me.

91
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:55,900
Liu Bu.

92
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,900
I look like a villain.

93
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:28,900
Like...

94
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:55,900
Stupid.

95
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,900
I hope you can bless me.

96
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,900
I will be as beautiful as a man.

97
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:00,900
I will be beautiful.

98
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,900
Only then can I be with you.

99
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,900
If I can be more than seven fingers.

100
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,900
I will be very happy.

101
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:07,900
If I can learn martial arts.

102
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,900
I will be happy.

103
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,900
I will be very cool.

104
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,900
So when we learn martial arts.

105
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,900
I will be happy.

106
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:25,900
Can see now.

107
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:30,400
I am your crow,

108
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,900
And come into the border for my continued развитion

109
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:37,900
I wish for變化為你的志

110
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:41,900
Let time take it away from our war

111
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,900
Principle of unity is to entangle each other

112
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,900
And share happiness

113
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,900
Jing An's 4th princess.

114
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:55,100
I, Zhe, am married to Prince Dingbei,

115
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,900
and I am going to marry Princess Dingbei.

116
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,900
Even if I have never expected it,

117
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:04,900
I can't help but feel anxious.

118
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,900
The flowers are only for you and me.

119
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:09,900
I can't help but feel anxious.

120
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:12,900
Now that things have come to this,

121
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:17,900
I don't know if I married you because of my love for you,

122
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,900
or because I wanted to marry you.

123
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:23,900
I am only able to do this because of you.

124
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:26,900
I am only able to do this because of you.

125
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,900
What are the other things that Princess Dingbei does during her days off?

126
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:59,900
Your Highness, Princess Dingbei can't eat smokey food,

127
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,900
and she doesn't like the smell of wild birds.

128
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,900
She is also very picky about spicy food.

129
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:06,900
She also has a lot of other kinds of spices.

130
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,900
Get a list for the kitchen,

131
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,900
and tell them to write it down.

132
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:11,900
Yes.

133
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:21,900
Are you blaming us for not taking good care of Princess Dingbei?

134
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:22,900
Be careful.

135
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:23,900
What?

136
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:24,900
This is not a blame.

137
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:27,900
This is clearly love for one's wife and one's heart.

138
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:53,900
Suxin.

139
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:02,900
Your Highness.

140
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:08,900
You're smiling.

141
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,900
It's all thanks to Your Highness taking good care of me for a whole night.

142
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:13,900
Your Highness's symptoms have healed so quickly.

143
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:14,900
Your Highness?

144
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,900
Last night, Your Highness...

145
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:22,900
Last night, Your Highness was resting in Qi'an Hall.

146
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:27,900
Your Highness took some high-pressure medicine and sent it to me.

147
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:30,900
Naturally, it was her who personally gave you the medicine.

148
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,900
I really don't know what to do.

149
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:41,900
Your Highness, which outfit are you going to wear when you go out today?

150
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,900
That's right.

151
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:46,900
I also made an appointment with Mimi today to go to the art gallery to draw.

152
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:48,900
What time is it?

153
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:49,900
It's already 4 p.m.

154
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:51,900
4 p.m.?

155
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,900
Why didn't you call me earlier?

156
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,900
It's because His Highness didn't allow me to call you.

157
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,900
He said he wanted you to sleep a little longer.

158
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:01,900
Your Highness, His Highness really cares about you.

159
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:04,900
He even asked you for a few things to help you with your work.

160
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,900
You talk too much.

161
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:14,900
Hurry up and tell me.

162
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:15,900
Yes.

163
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:18,900
What is this?

164
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:19,900
What is this?

165
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:20,900
What is this?

166
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:21,900
What is this?

167
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:22,900
What is this?

168
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:23,900
What is this?

169
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:24,900
What is this?

170
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:25,900
That's right.

171
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,900
Nowadays, people in the Shangjing District listen to songs.

172
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,900
The most popular song is Wen Tao Ge.

173
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,900
Which theater is this?

174
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:33,900
Which drama do you think of?

175
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:34,900
I've never seen this before.

176
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:35,900
I've watched it before.

177
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:37,900
I heard that those people...

178
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:38,900
Wifey.

179
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:39,900
Yes.

180
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:40,900
How is it possible?

181
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:41,900
...are preparing to save themselves.

182
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,900
I can't think of a better way.

183
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,900
I can only walk around and not look at people.

184
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,900
But there are quite a lot of people today.

185
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:57,900
Let me repeat.

186
00:11:58,900 --> 00:11:59,900
When he was hurt,

187
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:00,900
your heartless and heartless heart

188
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,900
is not the real heartless heart.

189
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,900
You have to show the kindness of this character.

190
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,900
And his subtle change of mind.

191
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,900
And when you fight later, be careful of each other.

192
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:09,900
Work well together.

193
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:10,900
Get ready.

194
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:11,900
Everyone,

195
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:12,900
today's new drama

196
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,900
is the story of the old disaster

197
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,900
of Prince Man Ba's wife,

198
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:17,900
Princess Jiao.

199
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,900
The story of the love story

200
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,900
between Prince Xiao Xiong and his wife,

201
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,900
and the old disaster.

202
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,900
If you are interested,

203
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,900
please stay and listen.

204
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:28,900
Okay.

205
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:29,900
Good.

206
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:30,900
Good.

207
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:31,900
Good.

208
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:32,900
Good.

209
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:33,900
Good.

210
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:34,900
Good.

211
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:35,900
Good.

212
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:36,900
Good.

213
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:37,900
Good.

214
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:38,900
Good.

215
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:39,900
Good.

216
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:40,900
猎神的긴磅水

217
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:41,900
喀清祥

218
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:47,900
岳热水

219
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:49,900
河南坊

220
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:08,900
A Dan.

221
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,900
Why are you here?

222
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,900
You are so far away. How can you see clearly?

223
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,900
I am telling you, after today,

224
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,900
our paintings will be spread all over the world

225
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,900
and become the best.

226
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,900
Good!

227
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,900
Good!

228
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,900
I didn't make any mistake.

229
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,900
Wake up! Why are you all asleep?

230
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:43,900
Go back to work!

231
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,900
Er Bao!

232
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,900
Boss, you are here.

233
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:51,900
What's going on?

234
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,900
Normally, Wen Tao Ge is always in a state of restlessness.

235
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,900
Why is there no guest today?

236
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:56,900
You don't know, right?

237
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,900
The lady from Changgu Palace

238
00:13:58,900 --> 00:13:59,900
suddenly opened her door

239
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,900
and wrote a very interesting script.

240
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:04,900
She has been singing in Nan Yu He Street for a day.

241
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,900
The guests are all new.

242
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,900
So they all went there to listen to the opera.

243
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:10,900
She?

244
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:13,900
What script can she have to compete with Wen Tao Ge?

245
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,900
I don't know.

246
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:19,900
How about you go and have a look?

247
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,900
You can also go to the opera house.

248
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:25,900
Er Bao, come on.

249
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,900
Take this fan and hit it yourself.

250
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:34,900
Xia Yu, take it.

251
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,900
Let them go home and rest.

252
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,900
You can get a few days' pay.

253
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:40,900
What about me?

254
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,900
You can go to the opera house.

255
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,900
Good!

256
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,900
If you like this opera,

257
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,900
as long as the sky is beautiful,

258
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,900
we will meet here tomorrow.

259
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,900
Good!

260
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,900
Tomorrow is a good day!

261
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:13,900
Good!

262
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,900
Good!

263
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,900
You are so ridiculous.

264
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,900
How many days can you hold on?

265
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,900
Lord Zhang.

266
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,900
Are you here to steal the poem?

267
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,900
I just happened to pass by.

268
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,900
If you like it,

269
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,900
come early tomorrow and take a good position.

270
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:44,900
I don't mind you coming to the so-called princesses' house.

271
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,900
Mimi, Tan.

272
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,900
The princess is here too.

273
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,900
Why are we so far today?

274
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:51,900
I'll take you to the restaurant.

275
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,900
Let's go.

276
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:54,900
But the money,

277
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,900
we have to use it to save the refugees.

278
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:59,900
I'm the owner, of course I have to use the money.

279
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:01,900
I can't lose my income from the painting.

280
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,900
Don't worry.

281
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,900
What about Lord Zhang?

282
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,900
He is a rich man.

283
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,900
He is a man.

284
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,900
Let's go.

285
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,900
We have a lot of money today.

286
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,900
I...

287
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:22,900
Tan,

288
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,900
we have so much money.

289
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,900
This is far beyond our expectations.

290
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,900
Come on, let's celebrate.

291
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,900
Come on.

292
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,900
With this money,

293
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,900
we can build a rescue team.

294
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,900
I'll write more in the next few days.

295
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,900
If I want to go back,

296
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,900
I have to make them happy.

297
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,900
I can't keep chasing them.

298
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:53,900
Although we have a hope,

299
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,900
we have to wait.

300
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,900
But if we want to build a rescue team,

301
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,900
I'm afraid we don't have enough money.

302
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:03,900
We can't afford to lose the refugees.

303
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,900
The most important thing in Shangjing is the poetry and painting.

304
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,900
How about we have a feast later?

305
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,900
We can donate together at the banquet.

306
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,900
These people are all very brave.

307
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,900
They have to donate for the sake of their reputation.

308
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,900
That's a good idea.

309
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,900
But it's not a long-term solution.

310
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,900
Hmm.

311
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,900
If the private store of our mansion

312
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,900
can make more money,

313
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,900
that would be great.

314
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,900
You're really not angry.

315
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,900
Your Highness, you have a good taste.

316
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,900
These jewelry

317
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,900
are all top-notch.

318
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,900
I can't take the lead

319
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,900
and increase the price.

320
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,900
You're too modest.

321
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,900
If we want to sell our jewelry,

322
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,900
we have to rely on your reputation.

323
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,900
Your Highness, that's a good idea.

324
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,900
In this way, the business of our mansion

325
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,900
will be very prosperous.

326
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,900
I'm sure.

327
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,900
Suoxin, go and pick some more suitable ones.

328
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,900
Yes.

329
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,900
No, it's not full enough.

330
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,900
It doesn't show the extraordinary temperament of the second son.

331
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,900
Your Highness.

332
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,900
The so-called poetry is good, and the difference is far.

333
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,900
What you're good at is the mountains and rivers.

334
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,900
But you can't be so careless in portrait painting.

335
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,900
You're a pretty girl.

336
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,900
Why don't you paint yourself?

337
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,900
If I can paint,

338
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,900
I don't need to spend the money to invite you.

339
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,900
I can paint myself.

340
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,900
I don't know what Miss Bai wants to do.

341
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,900
What does she want?

342
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:03,900
She thinks

343
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,900
it's a waste to report

344
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,900
the talent of the second son

345
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,900
without his permission.

346
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,900
But she invited the most unruly painter

347
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,900
in Shangjing.

348
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,900
Don't worry, the second son.

349
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,900
Others won't recognize you.

350
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,900
The most unruly?

351
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,900
Why should I

352
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,900
paint myself?

353
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,900
You're a good painter.

354
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,900
You should paint yourself.

355
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,900
What did you say?

356
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,900
Nothing.

357
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,900
This is good.

358
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,900
The fan and jade

359
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,900
are very similar to the second son's.

360
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,900
Put them together.

361
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,900
Give it to the second son.

362
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,900
Yes.

363
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,900
If such a painting

364
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,900
is popular in the capital,

365
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,900
nobody will be able to

366
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,900
make it.

367
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:19,900
Thank you, second son.

368
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,900
You're welcome.

369
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,900
Ah Xu?

370
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,900
I'm leaving.

371
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,900
I'll come back to see you.

372
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,900
Tan, don't worry.

373
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,900
I'll go to the painter

374
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,900
and help you.

375
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,900
Why are you back so early today?

376
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,900
I'm going to the painting studio.

377
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,900
Why are you back so early?

378
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,900
I came back earlier

379
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,900
because of military affairs.

380
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,900
I want to...

381
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,900
I'll let Su Xin invite you.

382
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,900
No.

383
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,900
From tomorrow,

384
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,900
you must go to the painting studio.

385
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,900
Yes.

386
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,900
And remember to put the same

387
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,900
painting as the second son.

388
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,900
And make sure it's limited.

389
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,900
Your Highness is so clever.

390
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,900
Your Highness.

391
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,900
The account book is ready.

392
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,900
Here it is.

393
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,900
Your Highness.

394
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,900
What's the matter, Your Highness?

395
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,900
Today, the Princess Consort

396
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:21,900
invited me.

397
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,900
You want me to help you?

398
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,900
Yes.

399
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,900
What do you want me to do?

400
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,900
The number of people in the capital is increasing.

401
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,900
The income of our paintings is not good.

402
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,900
So I want to improve

403
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,900
the sound of the painting studio and the painting studio.

404
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:49,900
And then I'll raise some profit

405
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:51,900
to save the people.

406
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:53,900
What does this have to do with Shu Er?

407
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,900
Shu Er

408
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,900
is the most favored son of the princess.

409
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,900
Every time he goes out,

410
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:01,900
he's always been watched.

411
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:03,900
If he wears the jewelry of the painting studio,

412
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,900
he can lead the children

413
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:07,900
to dress up.

414
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,900
And he can let the princesses

415
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,900
come and go to the painting studio.

416
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:15,900
I remember the jewelry of the painting studio

417
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,900
is very expensive.

418
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:19,900
The Princess Consort is so generous.

419
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,900
Of course not.

420
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,900
She just let Shu Er wear it for free.

421
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:25,900
Mr. Shu Er

422
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,900
is a famous painter.

423
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,900
If he wears our jewelry every day,

424
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,900
he can show off

425
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,900
and attract people.

426
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,900
Why is it Shu Er?

427
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,900
He's the one who has the daughter, Huaichun,

428
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,900
and the baby.

429
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,900
Or else, what other

430
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,900
suitable person would you like?

431
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,900
Princess Consort, this is the tea you just got.

432
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,900
Please try it.

433
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:25,900
Is it okay?

434
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,900
Not bad.

435
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:33,900
Su Xi,

436
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,900
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

437
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:37,900
I'll be back soon.

438
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,900
Okay.

439
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,900
I'll be back soon.

440
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:43,900
Su Xi,

441
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:45,900
do you think

442
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,900
His Highness is a little strange today?

443
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:51,900
He's half talking,

444
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:53,900
but he's not answering.

445
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,900
Look at His Highness.

446
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:59,900
Is he jealous of

447
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,900
Mr. Shu Er?

448
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:07,900
No way.

449
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:09,900
He's jealous

450
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,900
of Princess Consort.

451
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:13,900
If he's jealous,

452
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:15,900
His Highness will eat it too?

453
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:17,900
If that's the case,

454
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:19,900
he's being petty.

455
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:21,900
Princess Consort, think about it.

456
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,900
Why did His Highness come back so early today?

457
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,900
He must want to give you a surprise.

458
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,900
Who knew that when he came in,

459
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,900
he saw you invite other men

460
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,900
and gave you so many precious jewelry

461
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,900
in front of him?

462
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:37,900
His Highness is not jealous.

463
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,900
He's just being petty.

464
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:41,900
He must be jealous

465
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,900
of you.

466
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,900
He's jealous of me too.

467
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,900
His Highness

468
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,900
is jealous of me too.

469
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,900
Should I

470
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,900
show him my love?

471
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,900
Of course.

472
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,900
Princess Consort has never

473
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,900
given you anything before.

474
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:03,900
Today, you gave so many

475
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,900
jewelry to other men.

476
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:07,900
I don't mind.

477
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,900
Did I really

478
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,900
not give anything to His Highness?

479
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,900
I'm always

480
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:19,900
self-righteous.

481
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:21,900
How could I forget everything

482
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,900
when I'm with His Highness?

483
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:25,900
But what should I give him?

484
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:29,900
What should he give me?

485
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,900
What should I give him?

486
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:37,900
Su Xian, do you remember

487
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,900
the black belt

488
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,900
that I was wearing when we were

489
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,900
being attacked by bandits?

490
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,900
I remember. Where is it?

491
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,900
It should be in the Zhaoshui Courtyard.

492
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,900
Go back to the Marquis's mansion and get it.

493
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,900
His Highness is not fond of making a mess.

494
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,900
He's used to it.

495
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,900
The belt is the most suitable for him.

496
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:57,900
Princess Consort gave you

497
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,900
something of her own.

498
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:01,900
Is this called a suitable gift?

499
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:03,900
You don't understand.

500
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:05,900
Go and get it.

501
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,900
Yes.

502
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,900
I want this one, too.

503
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,900
It's a gift for the one who gets the flower.

504
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:19,900
It's for the one who gets the flower.

505
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,900
I like it.

506
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,900
Next one.

507
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:25,900
Let's put it on the table.

508
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:27,900
Miss, here you are.

509
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,900
Su Xian, you're just in time.

510
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:31,900
Nan Chu and I are too busy to come.

511
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,900
You're really popular.

512
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:35,900
Come on.

513
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:37,900
We'll have more painters to come.

514
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,900
We have Mo Jie.

515
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:41,900
Didn't Miss Miao say that she's the best

516
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:43,900
at drawing pictures?

517
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:45,900
It looks like you're the second son.

518
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,900
If you can't tell who wants the flower,

519
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,900
the plan I made with Tan is in vain.

520
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:51,900
Stop standing there.

521
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:53,900
Give me your hand.

522
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:55,900
Here, I'll give you two.

523
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:57,900
Do you like it?

524
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,900
What's wrong? Why are you so upset?

525
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:01,900
It's not my daughter.

526
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:03,900
She's going to see her tomorrow.

527
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,900
But she's not concerned about her own business.

528
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:07,900
What she wears tomorrow,

529
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:09,900
what she wears, what she draws,

530
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,900
it's all a mess.

531
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,900
You're not worried about your daughter.

532
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,900
You're worried about your maid.

533
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,900
My princess consort is here tomorrow.

534
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:19,900
Don't worry.

535
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:27,900
The fragrance of the flower.

536
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,900
And...

537
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,900
A part of the dragon's brain.

538
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:41,900
Lv'er, go to the incense room

539
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:43,900
and get all the clothes for the prince.

540
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:45,900
There are many mosquitoes in the market.

541
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,900
Bury the clothes.

542
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,900
So he won't be bitten by mosquitoes.

543
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:51,900
Yes, my princess consort.

544
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:53,900
I didn't see the princess consort.

545
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:55,900
Miss Mimi wants to see everyone in the capital.

546
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,900
Everyone in the capital.

547
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,900
Everyone has a picture of the second prince.

548
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:01,900
I almost got a beating.

549
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,900
This thing

550
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,900
has to be done by her.

551
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:07,900
Her shot

552
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:09,900
will make our jewelry

553
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,900
red.

554
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:27,900
The fire of the night

555
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:29,900
shatters.

556
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:33,900
Because of the firmness

557
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:35,900
in each other's eyes,

558
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:39,900
the heart is forever.

559
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:57,900
With the girl, Huaichun,

560
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:59,900
and the fruit,

561
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:01,900
I am the second prince.

562
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,900
I think our Tan

563
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:05,900
is gentle, virtuous,

564
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:07,900
and educated.

565
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:09,900
He is talented and good-looking.

566
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,900
He is very compatible with the second prince.

567
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:13,900
With the bandit,

568
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,900
he is as good as his wife.

569
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:17,900
He is as good as his wife.

570
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,900
My lord,

571
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,900
this is the new clothes

572
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:31,900
that the princess consort

573
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:33,900
specially prepared for you.

574
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,900
I won't wear it.

575
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,900
Take it away.

576
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:39,900
You don't like this style?

577
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:45,900
The princess consort

578
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:47,900
specially made the same style.

579
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:53,900
Take it.

580
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:57,900
The shopkeeper said

581
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:59,900
that the princess consort

582
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,900
wears the same clothes.

583
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:03,900
The pattern, color, and style

584
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:05,900
are all ordered by the princess consort.

585
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:07,900
Look.

586
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,900
The purple cloud pattern on this dress

587
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:11,900
was just mentioned by me.

588
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,900
The princess consort remembered

589
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:15,900
that you like this pattern.

590
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:17,900
My lord,

591
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:19,900
you are just a man.

592
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:21,900
The whole mansion is used to it.

593
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:23,900
But you can't

594
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:25,900
treat the princess consort so coldly.

595
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:29,900
I have been a painter for a year.

596
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:31,900
I hope I can have a few

597
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:33,900
heavenly nail art shows soon.

598
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:39,900
The wrong military style

599
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,900
is not the right one.

600
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,900
I think it's the wrong one.

601
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:45,900
The rest of the jewelry

602
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:47,900
in the wrong style

603
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:49,900
is suitable for me?

604
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:51,900
Yes, definitely.

605
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:55,900
Make it more.

606
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:57,900
Okay, I'll do it.

607
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:15,900
Princess Consort,

608
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,900
the prince is here.

609
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:19,900
The prince goes to the dance hall at dawn.

610
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:21,900
It's not surprising

611
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:23,900
that he goes back home at this time.

612
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,900
But the prince...

613
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:45,900
The princess consort sent you

614
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:47,900
a new dress.

615
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,900
She wants you and me

616
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:51,900
to wear the same one.

617
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:53,900
I'm afraid

618
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:55,900
I can't.

619
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:57,900
I'm afraid

620
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:59,900
the princess consort

621
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:01,900
will be sad.

622
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:03,900
I hope you can understand.

623
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,900
I'm afraid

624
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,900
that the princess consort

625
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:09,900
will be sad.

626
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:11,900
I hope you can understand.

627
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:13,900
Thank you.

628
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:17,900
You're used to

629
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:19,900
the formal dress.

630
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:21,900
Today the dress

631
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,900
looks like the one you wear.

632
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:29,900
What do you mean

633
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:31,900
by wearing the same dress

634
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:33,900
between the couple?

635
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:35,900
There's a saying

636
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:37,900
that if a man and a woman

637
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:39,900
play together,

638
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:43,180
I can't forget the glorious

639
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:44,180
soldiers who fought together.

640
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:46,460
Tan was not lucky enough to

641
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:47,980
work with my husband

642
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:49,180
and work with him.

643
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:52,180
So I can only wear the same clothes

644
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:54,140
as my husband

645
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:56,140
to make up for the pain.

646
00:33:56,140 --> 00:34:00,540
This dress is good.

647
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:04,660
A good match for a married couple.

648
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:07,020
Let Jin Xiu Fang

649
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:08,060
prepare more clothes.

650
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:08,980
Yes.

651
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:11,980
As long as you like it,

652
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:13,980
it's enough.

653
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:15,980
But today is a little later.

654
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:17,980
You need to wear this dress

655
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:18,980
to sing the Spring Spring.

656
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:20,980
Take Tan back to the mansion.

657
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:22,980
What did you

658
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:24,980
sell in the queen's gourd?

659
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:28,980
Tan wanted to borrow this dress

660
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:31,980
to make up for Jin Xiu Fang's business.

661
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:33,980
To help the refugees to raise money.

662
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:40,980
Changchun Garden is a royal garden.

663
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:41,980
For those who go to travel,

664
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:43,980
it is a noble place.

665
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:45,980
If you and I wear the same clothes,

666
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:47,980
we can kill others.

667
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:49,980
It will make all the ladies laugh.

668
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:55,980
Thank you.

669
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:58,980
After I finish my business,

670
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:00,980
I will go to Changchun Garden to see you.

671
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:03,980
Wait a minute.

672
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:09,980
Your Highness,

673
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:12,980
you saved me twice with this book bag.

674
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:13,980
I thought

675
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:16,980
it was a witness to our fate.

676
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:18,980
So I made a match for you

677
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:20,980
and made this bag.

678
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:22,980
I gave it back to you.

679
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:25,980
The fragrance is very strong.

680
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:28,980
You can use it to cure your fever.

681
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:30,980
The fragrance is very strong.

682
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:33,980
You can use it to cure your fever.

683
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:43,980
This gift is good.

684
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:49,980
It is said that the gift is good.

685
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:51,980
Tan gave you a gift.

686
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:54,980
So you should give back something.

687
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:57,980
I have a gift for you.

688
00:35:57,980 --> 00:35:59,980
What is it?

689
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:03,980
I have a gift for you.

690
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:05,980
What is it?

691
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:07,980
I have a gift for you.

692
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:09,980
I have a gift for you.

693
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:11,980
You can have it.

694
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:13,980
Thank you.

695
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:16,980
I will keep it.

696
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:19,980
Thank you.

697
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:21,980
Thank you.

698
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:23,980
Thank you.

699
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:25,980
It's a bit of a coincidence.

700
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:27,980
Don't worry.

701
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:34,980
By the way,

702
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:36,980
tell the crown prince

703
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:40,980
that you will go to the Spring Garden today.

704
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:44,980
Why should I tell him?

705
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:48,980
He will listen to me.

706
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:56,980
Is it pretty?

707
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:57,980
Okay.

708
00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:00,980
I will pick you up after I finish my work.

709
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:16,980
A man in a mask!

710
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:18,980
What?

711
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:26,980
How about I put on makeup for you?

712
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:28,980
Smile.

713
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:59,980
You're still friends with Mr. Shu?

714
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:08,980
Madam told me to keep an eye on you no matter what.

715
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:16,980
I'm not in the business. I'd better not do it.

716
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:19,980
I'm not in the business. I'd better not do it.

717
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:27,980
Mimi, do you have someone in mind?

718
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:28,980
Of course not.

719
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:30,980
Then why are you running away?

720
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:33,980
It's just an opportunity to make friends.

721
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:35,980
If you meet someone, you'll be happy.

722
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,980
It's not worth it to be together.

723
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:40,980
As you said, Mr. Zhou is very important.

724
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:42,980
I don't have enough water in my stomach.

725
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:44,980
I don't have enough fish in my pond.

726
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:46,980
How can you be together?

727
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:49,980
Besides, my parents really look up to me.

728
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:52,980
They're not afraid of me being rude.

729
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:55,980
Then you have to go.

730
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:58,980
You have to make your uncle and aunt realize the situation.

731
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:00,980
Understand that it's not that you don't want to.

732
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:04,980
It's that those noble gentlemen are too high-minded and picky.

733
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:08,980
Only then can they stop wanting you to continue to look at each other.

734
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:13,980
Tan, you're very reasonable.

735
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:14,980
You're really...

736
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:16,980
All right.

737
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:18,980
When you look at each other, there are outsiders around.

738
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:20,980
I'll wait for you in the pavilion.

739
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:22,980
Let's go.

740
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:35,980
The jewelry store in the city is still good.

741
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:36,980
Let's go tomorrow.

742
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:37,980
Okay.

743
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:42,980
Su Xin, go ask around.

744
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:45,980
Did Lord Zhang come to Changchun Garden the other day?

745
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:48,980
If you see him, tell him to go to the west side of the well.

746
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:51,980
Why are you asking about Lord Zhang?

747
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:52,980
If he comes,

748
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:56,980
Uncle and Aunt don't have to worry about Mingming's wedding anymore.

749
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:58,980
What if he doesn't come?

750
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:00,980
If he doesn't come,

751
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:03,980
it's good to be friends with Mr. Zhou.

752
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:08,980
But I think Lord Zhang must have moved by the wind.

753
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:11,980
He came early to plan with Ziwei.

754
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:12,980
Yes.

755
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:29,980
Princess, are you all right?

756
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:34,980
Why do I feel a sudden pain in my stomach?

757
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:38,980
Aunt, let's not look at this for now.

758
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:39,980
Yes, Aunt.

759
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:44,980
Princess, you can't fool my wife with your tricks.

760
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:45,980
I...

761
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:51,980
Princess, the old lady of Empress Dowager

762
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:53,980
is worried about the Su family.

763
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:56,980
You should understand her.

764
00:40:57,980 --> 00:40:59,980
The marriage between you and Young Master Gao

765
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:02,980
is also a good thing for Empress Dowager.

766
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:06,980
No matter how hard Gao Chen tries,

767
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:08,980
he will be defeated in the future.

768
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:13,980
By then, you will be the wife of the Marquis.

769
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:16,980
The whole Marquis's mansion will be yours.

770
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:18,980
I can't help it.

771
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:20,980
I really can't help it.

772
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:27,980
Then, I'll go instead.

773
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:28,980
Let's go.

774
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:39,980
Why is he here?

775
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:54,980
Aunt, I was not sensible before.

776
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:56,980
I didn't understand the hard work of the grandmother.

777
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:59,980
Your words just reminded me of something.

778
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:02,980
Since you are here, why not meet me?

779
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:05,980
It's good that you can figure it out.

780
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:07,980
Young Master Gao will be here soon.

781
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:09,980
I'll go with you to the room and wait for you.

782
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:16,980
The thing between men and women is to open up.

783
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:18,980
We should talk about our personal matters.

784
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:20,980
Only then can we understand each other.

785
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:22,980
If you are here,

786
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:25,980
Young Master Gao will definitely see you from the outside.

787
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:27,980
It's hard to show your true feelings.

788
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:30,980
You should wait outside.

789
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:32,980
I'll go with him.

790
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:37,980
Aunt, I'm here.

791
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:39,980
I can't just run away.

792
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:42,980
Besides, whether you want to see me or not,

793
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:44,980
grandmother will know.

794
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:46,980
Why should I lie to you?

795
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:50,980
You don't have to rush out.

796
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:53,980
You can talk to Young Master Gao.

797
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:55,980
Let's get to know each other better.

798
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:57,980
Okay, aunt. Don't worry.

799
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:25,980
You are so clumsy.

800
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:27,980
You are so talented.

801
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:29,980
Lanzhi, let's go.

802
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:35,980
Miss Bai.

803
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:38,980
Miss Bai, I'm late.

804
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:40,980
I was walking around the place

805
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:42,980
and saw a wine tree.

806
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:44,980
I saw it.

807
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:46,980
It's a very rare tree.

808
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:48,980
It's very rare.

809
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:50,980
It's a rare tree.

810
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:52,980
I was in the place of teaching.

811
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:54,980
I saw a wine tree.

812
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:56,980
I was so late.

813
00:43:56,980 --> 00:43:58,980
Miss Bai, please forgive me.

814
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:00,980
What is a wine tree?

815
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:02,980
The fruit is here.

00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:04,980
