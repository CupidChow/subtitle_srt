1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,360
God, I am still waiting fornew.

2
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,460
Return to the H buzzing flower.

3
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,360
Go home.

4
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,280
Unless I am justice.

5
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:56,340
One thousand hearts.

6
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:01,340
I heard that the Empress Dowager is looking for a candidate to be your side consort.

7
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:04,340
How do you know about this?

8
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:08,340
The Empress asked Ayu to go to Changchun Palace a few days ago to mention this matter.

9
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:12,340
She wanted Ayu to tell you that you should prepare early.

10
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:15,340
How do you plan to handle this matter?

11
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:18,340
The Empress Dowager intends to make a false accusation against you.

12
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:21,340
But she is trying to make a false accusation against the royal family.

13
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:23,340
How can you go?

14
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,340
How can you go?

15
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:27,340
I want to go. Why do you need a reason?

16
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:29,340
You are forcing yourself to go.

17
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,340
You are trying to win the favor of the Empress Dowager.

18
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:33,340
This is your fault.

19
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:34,340
This is absurd.

20
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:38,340
What I am doing is for the royal family, the Emperor, and the people.

21
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,340
What is wrong with that?

22
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:41,340
Your Highness, you are really being ungrateful.

23
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,340
You sacrificed a lot for the people of the country.

24
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:47,340
But the royal family is a small country.

25
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,340
If you don't open a business as soon as possible,

26
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:54,340
how can you cultivate a useful talent like you for the court?

27
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:59,340
You know everything.

28
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:02,340
I am fine.

29
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:11,340
This is your usual medicine.

30
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:13,340
It is the most effective.

31
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:19,340
Your Highness, you will recover in a few days.

32
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:24,340
Then you can continue to cultivate the future of the court.

33
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:31,340
You are really thoughtful.

34
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:34,340
I didn't know you would use this medicine.

35
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:38,340
There are other people who are really thoughtful.

36
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:42,340
How can I know about your years of habit?

37
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,340
How can I know?

38
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:54,340
You are really thoughtful.

39
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:58,340
Your Highness, don't let your heart down.

40
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:10,340
Your Highness, I heard that Your Highness had a heart attack.

41
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:12,340
I came to visit you.

42
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:16,340
The so-called love between husband and wife is more than one word.

43
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,340
Yes, yes, yes.

44
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:22,340
I heard that the Empress Dowager wants to marry the side consort for you.

45
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:24,340
I also have this intention.

46
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:26,340
Why don't you take a few days off in the palace

47
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:30,340
and let me choose a good match for you

48
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:33,340
so that you can personally decide?

49
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:38,340
The Empress Dowager's intention is clear.

50
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:40,340
I will find a way to deal with it.

51
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:42,340
You will be marrying the side consort sooner or later.

52
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:45,340
Instead of having the Empress Dowager to choose,

53
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:48,340
why don't you choose a loyal one?

54
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:49,340
Don't worry, Your Highness.

55
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:54,340
I will definitely choose a woman who is a family member and is good at everything.

56
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:56,340
It's best if she is better than me.

57
00:04:56,340 --> 00:05:00,340
But it's really a little bit wrong for a good girl like this to be a side consort.

58
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:02,340
After she marries the side consort for you,

59
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:05,340
it's also not right for her to be a side consort.

60
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:12,340
What does the Princess mean?

61
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,340
Your Highness, you need to send some medicine.

62
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:28,340
How many days do you need to soak in water?

63
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:36,340
Your Highness, rest well.

64
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:38,340
I won't bother you anymore.

65
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,340
I will come again another day.

66
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,340
Please wait, Second Young Master.

67
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:45,340
I should be the one to send the medicine.

68
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:49,340
Your Highness, I will send it.

69
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:52,340
Your Highness.

70
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:55,340
What's wrong with you?

71
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:56,340
How do you know?

72
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:59,340
Where did you offend her?

73
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,340
I just finished the work for her.

74
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:03,340
How can I offend her?

75
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:05,340
There are things that I shouldn't say.

76
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:07,340
If you shouldn't say, then don't say it.

77
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:09,340
I can't.

78
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:12,340
I have to say it for the sake of the Princess.

79
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:12,660
The Princess should know that she can tolerate the

80
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,340
person who is too generous.

81
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,340
She can be a queen.

82
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:18,340
The flowers and plants need to be far away.

83
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:20,340
The woman needs to be gentle.

84
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:21,340
The Princess is not happy.

85
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:23,340
She has her own reason for not being happy.

86
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,340
The woman is too worried and suspicious.

87
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:26,340
She is not in a good mood.

88
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,340
That's common sense.

89
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:31,340
All the mistakes are the mistakes of men.

90
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:33,340
The Princess, you should learn to be tolerant.

91
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:36,340
You should be able to raise a woman who is not afraid of anything.

92
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:41,340
You should be able to raise her who is not afraid of anything.

93
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:43,340
You don't need to ask her why.

94
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:45,340
You don't need to argue about her right and wrong.

95
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:47,340
Everything needs to be sincere.

96
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,340
You need to be able to make up with her.

97
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:50,340
You need to be able to make up with her.

98
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,340
You are talking nonsense.

99
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:55,340
You don't even have a girlfriend.

100
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:57,340
Why are you calling me?

101
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:59,340
This is the right way to talk.

102
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:01,340
I will stop here.

103
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:05,340
You should know that I will come back to visit you another day.

104
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:07,340
You...

105
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:09,340
You don't need to see me off.

106
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:11,340
I am not hurt.

107
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:26,340
Lord, please be patient.

108
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:38,340
I am not hurt.

109
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:08,340
I am not hurt.

110
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:39,340
Why is there a girl like this?

111
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:57,340
Chai Gui, it's hot.

112
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:59,340
Hurry up and send it to the Lord.

113
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:01,340
Wait.

114
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:05,340
What did the Lord do today?

115
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:09,100
Port of Qizhan mainly蠶ly

116
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:12,340
So many things have happened.

117
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:13,340
The pot.

118
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:15,340
Don't go so late.

119
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:24,340
These ingredients andüll Muronger

120
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:26,340
Are all treatments of your beloved Lord.

121
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:29,340
Ok Trans ז

122
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:33,340

00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:35,340
This even 50 percent이라고

124
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:37,420
People don't come out casually.

125
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:38,980
It's very cool.

126
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,700
You can't past her.

127
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:49,060

00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:50,220
Don't thinkワンドー

129
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,980
Pretty hypocrisy.

130
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:56,100
But

131
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:59,580
Kon merica

132
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:03,020

K reverberation

134
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:06,340
But, Your Highness.

135
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:10,340
This time, Your Highness, you're not afraid of the consequences.

136
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:12,340
You're angry with me, Your Highness.

137
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:15,340
I can see your love for me.

138
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:21,340
But, Your Highness, that is really too much.

139
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:22,340
I can't stand it.

140
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:24,340
But, Your Highness, don't worry.

141
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:27,340
The entire palace is looking at you.

142
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:28,340
We only recognize you.

143
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:30,340
Only you are the lady of the palace.

144
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,340
Right?

145
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:37,340
What is it?

146
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:07,340
Your Highness, dinner is ready.

147
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:17,340
Is there a lot of people in the palace lately?

148
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:19,340
I...

149
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:21,340
I don't know.

150
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:23,340
I don't know.

151
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:25,340
I don't know.

152
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:27,340
I don't know.

153
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:29,340
I don't know.

154
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:31,340
I don't know.

155
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:33,340
I don't know.

156
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:34,340
I...

157
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:04,340
I don't know.

158
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:36,340
You should tell Concubine Yun to give this to His Highness.

159
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:39,340
She will smell it and find peace of mind.

160
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:40,340
She will feel better.

161
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:41,340
Yes.

162
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:46,340
I think the Princess Consort is the most beautiful woman.

163
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:48,340
It's not a good thing.

164
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:50,340
But I think she is.

165
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,340
I think she is.

166
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:54,340
Yes.

167
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,340
I think she is.

168
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,340
I think she is.

169
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:58,340
I think she is.

170
00:12:58,340 --> 00:12:59,340
She is.

171
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:00,340
I think she is.

172
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:01,340
I think she is.

173
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:02,340
She is.

174
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:03,340
I think she is.

175
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:07,340
She was hurt because of me.

176
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:10,340
I don't want to owe her.

177
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:13,340
Yes.

178
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,340
Your Highness,

179
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:22,340
there are a lot of new jewelry on the Nanyu River Street.

180
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:23,340
Why don't you take a look?

181
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:27,340
It's better to go out and have a look than to stay in the palace.

182
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:33,340
Your Highness.

183
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:34,340
Your Highness.

184
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:35,340
Your Highness.

185
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:36,340
Your Highness.

186
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:39,340
Your Highness.

187
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:41,340
Your Highness.

188
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:42,340
Your Highness.

189
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:49,340
Your Highness, where are you going?

190
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:52,340
How can you be so rude?

191
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,340
It's just a dance competition.

192
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:56,340
A dance competition is nothing.

193
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:58,340
You are a concubine now.

194
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:00,340
You should keep the rules.

195
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,260
and spent all of the money on me.

196
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:05,100
Take this and iron and dry them.

197
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:24,940
chipmunk,

198
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:26,560
You have 어떤 problem that I can't solve,

199
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,980
What happened?

200
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:33,100
I can't go out with you and the princess

201
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,380
unless I get permission.

202
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:35,380
I know.

203
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:37,980
You know but you are so impudent.

204
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,580
This is the order of the prince.

205
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,980
The prince said if the princess went out,

206
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:43,580
I must be there.

207
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:49,580
Is this a test or a way to make me recognize the princess?

208
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:52,780
I...

209
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:54,380
Since this is the order of the prince,

210
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:56,180
let me follow you.

211
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:58,380
Otherwise, I will be told that

212
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:02,380
I am too young to be a princess.

213
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:29,580
Miss, look at the fan.

214
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:30,780
It's made by our own family.

215
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:32,180
Let me see.

216
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:41,780
This is a light-colored one.

217
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:44,380
This is a big one.

218
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:48,180
Each one has its own purpose.

219
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:50,780
Which one do you like?

220
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:51,980
Thank you, Your Highness.

221
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:54,780
I don't usually use a fan.

222
00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:00,780
I don't usually buy a fan for my mother.

223
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:10,180
Why is Yunyi so ignorant?

224
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:12,980
When will she stop following us?

225
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:16,180
She has been following us.

226
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:18,380
I feel strange.

227
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:19,780
What's strange?

228
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,380
I don't know.

229
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:27,180
You should find a way to get her back.

230
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:29,380
I want to be alone.

231
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:39,980
You have a carriage.

232
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:41,580
You can follow me.

233
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:44,380
Yunyi, you should go back.

234
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:46,780
I can't go back.

235
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:49,380
What if she is in danger?

236
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:51,580
It's more dangerous if you follow me.

237
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:53,380
What do you mean?

238
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:55,180
Yunyi, can't you see that

239
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:58,380
the Princess doesn't want to see you?

240
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:02,380
Why doesn't the Princess want to see me?

241
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:24,380
Thank you.

242
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:24,380
Why is the Princess upset today?

243
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:28,380
Your Highness, I think she is not upset.

244
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:33,180
She went to Nanyuhe Street with Yunyi and Suxin.

245
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:36,580
She said she wanted to buy some food.

246
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:44,380
Your Highness, is it good?

247
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:46,580
Please tell her to come back.

248
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:48,780
I don't want to see her.

249
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:51,180
Is it good?

250
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:53,580
Please drink some water.

251
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:57,580
I'm not as good as you.

252
00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:00,980
It's just a wound.

253
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:02,980
The battlefield is a place of food.

254
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:06,580
But when you eat, you can't eat the skin.

255
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:08,980
It's better than that.

256
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:11,380
But it's a matter of taste.

257
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:15,580
If you don't have enough food, why do you compare it with the skin?

258
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:22,180
Go to the city and buy some food.

259
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:23,980
Yes.

260
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:27,580
How is Liu Mo's situation?

261
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:32,180
He has no other place to go except for the court and his job.

262
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:35,380
He is alone and doesn't have any friends.

263
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:37,380
He never talks to anyone.

264
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:40,780
But the person who burned the food just now sent a message.

265
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:44,180
He went to Nanyuhe Street tonight.

266
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:48,380
You said that the princess went to Nanyuhe Street too?

267
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:49,780
Yes.

268
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,380
Your Highness.

269
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:56,580
Geng Yi.

270
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:05,580
I'm the deputy minister of the Ministry of Revenue, Liu Mo.

271
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:10,580
I never thought that I would meet the princess again.

272
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,580
Who is that?

273
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:19,580
The princess doesn't look like someone like her.

274
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:22,580
It's not the princess' business.

275
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:25,380
It's not my business.

276
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:28,780
We are all friends. We should be friends.

277
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:31,180
Who is your friend?

278
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:37,380
How did you recognize me?

279
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:43,580
Princess, you really don't remember me?

280
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:48,580
You have repaired this zither for dozens of times.

281
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,380
You really can't repair it again.

282
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:52,780
Why don't you change it?

283
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:55,780
I will change it when I have a salary.

284
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:01,580
Manager Fang.

285
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:04,980
Please take care of my little miss' zither.

286
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:06,780
Of course.

287
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:10,580
It's good that the zither that you ordered last time has arrived.

288
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:13,380
Thank you, Manager.

289
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:19,380
You are really a good person.

290
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:25,580
Manager.

291
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:28,980
Do you have any old and new zithers in your shop?

292
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:31,580
I only sell new ones.

293
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:34,580
If you really want them, I can help you.

294
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:37,780
But I don't know when I will have them.

295
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:39,380
Thank you, Manager.

296
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:42,980
By the way, if you don't mind,

297
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:45,780
I can come to your shop and do some work.

298
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:47,780
Then I can change my mood before I go to work.

299
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:48,980
Do you think it's okay?

300
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:50,580
Well...

301
00:21:56,980 --> 00:22:02,580
I wonder if it's a good thing that you asked about my zither.

302
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:05,380
My zither is already repaired.

303
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:07,580
I'm afraid I will disappoint you.

304
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:09,180
Suoxin.

305
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:11,380
Bring me the zither.

306
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:21,380
Green hair,

307
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:23,180
a beautiful woman.

308
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:26,580
The seven seasons are like a dream.

309
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:33,380
If you don't mind, I will go and give you the zither.

310
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:40,780
Thank you.

311
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:13,980
I will give you the zither.

312
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:16,180
I will give you my love.

313
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:20,980
It's my pleasure to give you the zither.

314
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:23,780
But I can't afford to give you the zither.

315
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:26,780
I will remember your kindness.

316
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,180
Goodbye.

317
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:30,980
Please wait.

318
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:33,780
My lady has changed her zither.

319
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:37,580
I'm afraid she will buy a new one.

320
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:40,580
Please take this zither and take good care of it.

321
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:43,180
I hope you can help me with it.

322
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:55,980
I can hear the zither and the music.

323
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:57,980
I can hear the music.

324
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:59,580
I can hear the music.

325
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:02,580
I can hear the music.

326
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:07,380
I hope you can play the zither like you did before.

327
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:10,980
I can hear the music.

328
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:13,780
I can hear the music.

329
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:20,580
I can't play the zither without permission.

330
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:22,780
You played the zither just now.

331
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:25,780
It's the best zither in the world.

332
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:30,180
I can't afford to buy a new one.

333
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:40,580
I can't afford to buy a new one.

334
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:43,580
I can't afford to buy a new one.

335
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:46,580
I can't afford to buy a new one.

336
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:49,580
I can't afford to buy a new one.

337
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:52,580
I can't afford to buy a new one.

338
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:55,580
I can't afford to buy a new one.

339
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:58,580
I can't afford to buy a new one.

340
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:01,580
I can't afford to buy a new one.

341
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:04,580
I can't afford to buy a new one.

342
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:06,780
Thank you.

343
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:16,740
Mr. Liu,

344
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:20,380
where do we begin?

345
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:33,980
Miss Lin,

346
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:36,420
I'm just following the fate of the zengqin.

347
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:40,980
I've already thrown this matter into the back of my head.

348
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:43,980
You're following the fate of Miss Ming.

349
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:46,460
But you're following me in this life.

350
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:49,380
You're right.

351
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:52,380
I'm married and I'm a wife.

352
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:54,100
I'm the princess of the king of Dingbei.

353
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:58,820
I entrust my life to the king of Dingbei.

354
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:01,500
Mu Reilly will take care of others in the時 I wish.

355
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:06,300
Mu Reilly may be wrong to вот this tubesuit to계.

356
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:10,580
Mu Reilly,

357
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:12,860
please stop yourself from being ungrateful about courage.

358
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:14,780
And do this yourself.

359
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,340
This fragrant.

360
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:26,020
I may not deserve Miss Ming,

361
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:29,740
Did you please him for Mr. Liu and his palace?

362
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:32,780
What does this have to do with it?

363
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:35,700
Don't you know how brave the position ofuro Launch Organizer is?

364
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:37,380
Yes.

365
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:39,860
But he never lost.

366
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:47,980
Hurry and save Beautiful Tiger and Miss Flute Man.

367
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:48,780
Move!

368
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:50,540
Miss Flute Man!

369
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:53,100
Where the hell did you suddenly come from?

370
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:54,740
Where is Miss Flute Man?

371
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:57,740
This is too much.

372
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:59,740
It's not.

373
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:07,740
You are bothering me.

374
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:11,740
What do you want?

375
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:13,740
Don't be so arrogant.

376
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:15,740
It's okay if you wrong me.

377
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:19,740
But don't misunderstand me.

378
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:21,740
You are a wise and kind person.

379
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:26,740
I'm afraid that some people will be planning something and do something.

380
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:28,740
I will...

381
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:30,740
I don't care what you are doing here tonight.

382
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:33,740
The safety of the princess is in your care.

383
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:36,740
I will protect her for the rest of her life.

384
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:40,740
Please be careful.

385
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:53,740
I'm sorry.

386
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:55,740
I'm sorry.

387
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:22,740
Why are you in a bad mood today?

388
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:26,740
Yes.

389
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:43,740
Please forgive me for my어야nal feminine быстро.

391
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:51,740
Yes.

392
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:59,620
I've known you for five years.

393
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:09,260
Is it inappropriate for the princess to meet strangers at night?

394
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:11,220
I met strangers?

395
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:14,180
Do you think it's inappropriate when you meet strangers?

396
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:16,780
I've been busy with the work in the camp.

397
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:18,300
Why would I have time to meet strangers?

398
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:21,580

400
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:29,460
There are more appearances on the internet,

401
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:30,980
such as White House,

402
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:33,060
or Youtube.

403
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:36,340
However, these types of Instagram42

404
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:40,180
cannot match illusions of the rise of social incident.

405
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:45,380
You are a cowardly man,

406
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:47,380
You are the one who is pretending to be a fool.

407
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:54,380
A few days ago, the Empress Dowager was determined to be the concubine of the Prince of the North.

408
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:58,380
So the Prince of the North went to the side of the river and took the concubine.

409
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:05,380
Why don't you just welcome Feng Zhao into the house?

410
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:08,380
The Empress Dowager wanted to make you two a couple.

411
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:13,380
In this way, the Prince of the North can enjoy the happiness of the concubine.

412
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:15,380
I don't like people in the house.

413
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:17,380
You don't like people in the house?

414
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:18,380
Yunyi is the secret guard of the Imperial Guards.

415
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:20,380
She is not a spy.

416
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:23,380
She can be the concubine of the Prince of the North.

417
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:27,380
She can protect you from the Empress Dowager's attack.

418
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:39,380
So she is not a spy.

419
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:41,380
She is just a spy.

420
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:47,380
No one told me.

421
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:51,380
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

422
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:54,380
You almost wronged my husband.

423
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:58,380
You can't tell me that you are pretending to be a concubine.

424
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:00,380
Yunyi is a very obedient person.

425
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:03,380
I told her not to tell anyone that she is pretending to be a concubine.

426
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:05,380
She is the secret guard.

427
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:06,380
Can't anyone tell me?

428
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:08,380
Can't Tan tell me?

429
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:10,380
You made Tan angry for nothing.

430
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:16,380
Why are you looking at me like that?

431
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:29,380
Tan thought that you were angry because of Gao Chen.

432
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:34,380
I heard that Yunyi had a fight with you for many years.

433
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:36,380
She was hurt badly.

434
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:38,380
She was hurt badly.

435
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:43,380
I heard that Yunyi had a fight with you for many years.

436
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:49,380
I told you that you can't be blamed for this.

437
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:59,380
I don't care.

438
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:04,380
Anyway, you should be responsible for this misunderstanding.

439
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:07,380
You should make up for Tan.

440
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:11,380
How do you want me to make up for this?

441
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:14,380
I have to think about it.

442
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:24,380
Like this?

443
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:28,380
Like this?

444
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:32,380
Or like this?

Like this?

456
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:01,380

459
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:07,380
Like this?

460
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:11,380
No, first come, first served.

461
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:13,380
I heard that you called our father.

462
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:16,380
Father's doing nothing.

463
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:18,380
Father's doing nothing.

464
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:22,380
That night he manifestations was very strong.

465
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:26,380
Father's since released to the femelle.

466
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:30,080
Friend of那个是最te乎的父亲——

467
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:34,380
Tan's as a father.

468
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:37,580
My lady, please wait for a few days.

469
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:40,660
I will recover soon.

470
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:45,940
Your Highness, it's time to change your medicine.

471
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:37,420
Here.

472
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:47,580
Why does my lady look reknowledged?

473
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:48,940
You're injured.

474
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:50,940
You can't eat these milk.

475
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:54,460
I asked the kitchen to make a couple of bake a few than sizings.

476
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:56,980
It's all the food you love.

477
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:59,380
Here.

478
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:02,300
I even made more spiced porridge.

479
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:04,780
Drink it and make someone will eat it.

480
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:06,380
I'm sorry.

481
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:09,380
What are you talking about?

482
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:12,380
I offended you and you are not good enough.

483
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:15,380
I shouldn't have let you misunderstand me.

484
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:18,380
I didn't expect that

485
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:20,380
a beautiful girl like Yunyi

486
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:22,380
is the secret guard of the Imperial Guards.

487
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:26,380
You are weak.

488
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:28,380
You should get up early.

489
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:29,380
When I'm recovered,

490
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:31,380
you can go to the martial arts field with me

491
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:32,380
to train your muscles.

492
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,380
I'm not going to be able to do that.

493
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:35,380
I want to learn some defense techniques.

494
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:36,380
Me?

495
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:37,380
What do I need to learn?

496
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:38,380
What do you want to learn?

497
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:39,380
I don't want to learn anything.

498
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:42,380
I can teach you archery

499
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:45,380
or archery.

500
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:47,380
Archery?

501
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:50,380
Archery requires arm strength.

502
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:52,380
Tan is a talented person.

503
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:54,380
I'm afraid he can't even hold a bow and arrow.

504
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:56,380
As for archery,

505
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:58,380
it requires more endurance.

506
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:00,380
Tan has been weak since he was a child.

507
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:01,380
He can't lift his arms or his hands.

508
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:03,380
He can't lift his arms or his hands.

509
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:05,380
He has to train his muscles.

510
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:07,380
He has to train his muscles.

511
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:09,380
If Tan trains, he will be able to do it.

512
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:11,380
If he doesn't, he will have to rest.

513
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:13,380
He has to rest for a long time to be able to do it.

514
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:14,380
He can't do anything anyway.

515
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:16,380
I can't kill the enemy or go to battle.

516
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:20,380
Husband, please forgive me.

517
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:25,380
Tan thinks that life is short.

518
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:27,380
He can live however he wants.

519
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:29,380
That's what he deserves.

520
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:31,380
You're right.

521
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:36,380
I'll ask Min Min to send the gifts to the Old Hall.

522
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:39,380
I've already ordered Su Xin to add more softener.

523
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:41,380
You can go back to your room and rest.

524
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:43,380
I'll be back before nightfall.

525
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:45,380
I'll accompany you to have dinner.

526
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:47,380
Put on your clothes.

527
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:49,380
The refugees have come to the city.

528
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:51,380
You have to be careful when you go out.

529
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:55,380
You have to be careful too.

530
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,380
Don't get hurt.

531
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:01,380
Let's go.

532
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:03,380
Should I stay here too?

533
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:05,380
Ah Young would really be scared.

534
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:07,380
Ah Young is always afraid.

535
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:11,380
Ah Young wasn't busy.

536
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:13,380
Young is not that such a child.

537
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:15,380
Ah Young likes the old general fully.

538
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:17,380
Ah Young likes the man.

539
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:21,380
That's all.

540
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:23,380
He's MmAhDi Min.

541
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:25,380
He seems to be very tormenting.

542
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:27,380
I fully학 criminals want to serve LinNan.

543
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:28,660
I almost forgot.

544
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:34,300
Mr. Zhou is really a man of talent.

545
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:36,660
But he is a little...

546
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:38,420
A little what?

547
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:41,500
A little bit of a father-son relationship.

548
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:43,260
He is very filial.

549
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:46,500
He married his wife just for this matter.

550
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:47,700
He can marry anyone.

551
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:52,060
What do you think of Mr. Zhang?

552
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:54,420
Why are you talking about him again?

553
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:58,060
Didn't you notice that Mr. Zhang is different from the others?

554
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:00,260
Of course he is different.

555
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:02,060
He treats others with respect.

556
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:03,660
But I don't like him.

557
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:06,380
I will see him less often.

558
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:09,620
This is called marriage.

559
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:12,140
If I can't marry him, you marry me.

560
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:13,580
I marry you?

561
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:20,500
Here.

562
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:22,420
Of course he is different.

563
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:28,420
Here.

564
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:31,380
Eat slowly.

565
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:34,820
You go over there.

566
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:39,180
Here.

567
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:40,740
Drink some medicine.

568
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:46,580
Here.

569
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:48,660

00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:03,240
You are so strange

575
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:07,060

00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:50,060
I've never seen you before.

591
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:52,060
You just entered the palace.

592
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:54,060
Do you know me well?

593
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:56,060
You don't live in the palace.

594
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:58,060
It's normal that you haven't seen me.

595
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:02,060
There are 164 refugees in the country.

596
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:04,060
20 per day.

597
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:06,060
Two per person.

598
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:08,060
These numbers are all right.

599
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:10,060
It shows that you brothers are very careful.

600
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:14,060
The princess made us all embarrassed.

601
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:16,060
I'm sorry.

602
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:18,060
We are all embarrassed.

603
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:20,060
We have to think for you.

604
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:22,060
We can't take the money for nothing.

605
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:28,060
This...

606
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:30,060
This place is for the repair, medicine and other things.

607
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:32,060
It needs money.

608
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:34,060
Take it.

609
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:36,060
You can use it to pay the bill.

610
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:38,060
Thank you, princess.

611
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:40,060
I'll go to the front and check the fire.

00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:08,060
known

624
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:09,060
You are the one.

625
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:11,060
You are yourself.

626
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:13,180
You don't need to be the master.

627
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:18,500
But Su Xin and Lü E...

628
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:20,460
are all your masters.

629
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:23,820
This is just their job.

630
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:27,500
If one day they find a good home...

631
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:30,740
and understand what kind of life they want...

632
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:33,660
I won't force them.

633
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:36,540
I only have one person in this life.

634
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:39,220
I won't go anywhere with you.

635
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:48,900
Open the door.

636
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:56,420
The Jin Dynasty is in disarray.

637
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:57,620
They are all responsible.

638
00:41:57,620 --> 00:41:59,500
They don't care about the people.

639
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:00,540
Don't kill them.

640
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:01,540
Don't kill them.

641
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:02,540
Don't kill them.

642
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:03,540
Don't kill them.

643
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:05,540
Please, Your Majesty.

644
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:06,540
Don't kill them.

645
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:07,540
Don't kill them.

646
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:08,540
Go and report to His Majesty.

647
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:09,540
Yes.

648
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:10,540
Everyone, follow me.

649
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:13,540
Ah Xu.

650
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:16,540
Something happened to Marquis Jing An.

651
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:21,540
How dare you!

652
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:30,540
Is this the place where refugees are being taken in?

653
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:33,540
Did you come from Lizhou?

654
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:34,540
Yes.

655
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:35,540
Okay.

656
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:37,540
Everyone, please go to your rooms and rest.

657
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:40,540
After you finish your name card, I'll take you to get food.

658
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:41,540
Let's go.

659
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:42,540
This way.

660
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:46,540
But there's more.

661
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:47,540
What?

662
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:48,540
The power bank.

663
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:49,540
But there's more.

664
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:51,540
This is yours.

665
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:54,540
Greetings, Your Highness.

666
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:58,540
Everyone, this is Princess Dingbei.

667
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:02,540
Princess Dingbei is the one who built this old hall.

668
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:06,540
The refugees from Lizhou were also helped by Princess.

669
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:08,540
Princess Dingbei?

670
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:11,540
Isn't she Marquis Jing An's daughter?

671
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:12,540
Marquis Jing An's daughter?

672
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:14,540
Congratulations, Princess.

673
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:16,540
Everyone, don't be like this.

674
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:18,540
Marquis Jing An is my father.

675
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:21,540
I can't help him with the disaster in Lizhou.

676
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:24,540
I can only help him with the situation.

677
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:27,540
If you need anything, just tell me.

678
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:30,540
It's Marquis Jing An who caused our family to be in danger.

679
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:31,540
He's not a disaster.

680
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:33,540
He's a victim of the people.

681
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:34,540
Yes.

682
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:36,540
How can it be?

683
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:37,540
Father ordered the disaster.

684
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:40,540
He must have done everything to protect the people.

685
00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:42,540
How can he be like you said?

686
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:43,540
How can it be?

687
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:48,540
Marquis Jing An's disaster has caused so many lives to be lost in Lizhou.

688
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:50,540
My son was not well.

689
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:56,540
But Marquis Jing An was so furious that he forced my son to go to the defense.

690
00:43:56,540 --> 00:43:57,540
My son was washed away by the flood.

691
00:43:57,540 --> 00:43:58,540
My son was washed away by the flood.

692
00:43:58,540 --> 00:44:00,540
He didn't even find his body.

693
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:02,540
Give my son back.

694
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:03,540
Don't be impulsive.

695
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:04,540
Don't be impulsive.

696
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:05,540
Give my son back.

697
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:06,540
Don't be impulsive.

698
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:07,540
Give my son back.

699
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:08,540
You...

700
00:44:57,540 --> 00:44:58,540
Father.

701
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:28,540
Father.

702
00:45:57,540 --> 00:45:58,540
Father.

703
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:28,540
Father.
