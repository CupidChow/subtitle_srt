00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,300
Come on.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm going to make a little bit of a

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
little bit of a little bit of a

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
little bit of a little bit of a little

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
bit of a little bit of a little

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
bit of a little bit of a little

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
bit of a little bit of a little

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
bit of a little bit of a little

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
bit of a little bit of a little

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
bit of a little bit of a little bit

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
of a little bit of a little bit

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
of a little bit of a little bit

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
of a little bit of a little bit

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
of a little bit of a little bit

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
of a little bit of a little

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
bit of a little bit

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
of a little bit of a little

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
bit of a little bit of a little

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
bit of a little bit of a little

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
bit of a little bit of a little

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
bit of a little bit of a little

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
bit of a little bit of a little

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
bit of a little bit of a little

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
bit of a little bit of a little

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
bit of a little bit of a little

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
bit of a little bit of a little

28
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
bit of a little bit of a little

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
bit of a little bit of a little

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
bit of a little little

31
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
bit of a little

32
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
bit of a little

33
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
bit of a little

34
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
bit of a little

35
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
bit of a little

36
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
bit of a little

37
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
bit of a little

38
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
bit of a little

39
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
1 month Friday

40
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,880
On the 6th of February,

41
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,160
the 3rd and 5th of March,

42
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:56,960
the 4th and 5th of April,

43
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:57,840
the 6th of May,

44
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,760
the 6th and 9th of June,

45
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,920
the 9th and 9th of May,

46
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,080
the Fang Tian Song Mi,

47
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,120
the Shao Feng Shao Guang.

48
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:02,920
Mr. Zhou.

49
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,000
The Shang Gong Jun Shu,

50
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:04,720
Fang Cheng,

51
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,040
the...

52
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:05,720
Mr. Zhou!

53
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:10,720
Although Mr. Zhou

54
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,720
is not as good as Shu Er Feng Hua,

55
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,320
he is still a good man.

56
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,680
But why does he

57
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,800
look like a man

58
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,120
who is so young and handsome?

59
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:22,320
I'm done.

60
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,120
Miss Bai broke up with Zhou Mo.

61
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,120
She must have something to say.

62
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,080
Zhou Mo will take it as a compliment.

63
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,080
I don't know if Mr. Zhou

64
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,600
is willing to see you today.

65
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:31,760
The marriage is

66
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:32,800
from my parents' order.

67
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,800
It's one of the three principles of ancient gold.

68
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,600
Zhou Mo will come to me

69
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,200
and respect me

70
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,560
without any hesitation.

71
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,400
That's also called willing?

72
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,680
Then Mr. Zhou thinks

73
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,520
after marriage,

74
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,080
how should we follow the husband's instructions?

75
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,840
The husband's instructions

76
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,480
are as follows.

77
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,880
He thinks

78
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,280
for the sake of the husband and the wife,

79
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,560
the husband should be responsible for the family's burden

80
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,480
and be considerate of the way he thinks.

81
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,160
The wife should be a good man

82
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,360
to raise the child,

83
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,160
so that the husband can have no more worries.

84
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,960
If he continues to do so,

85
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,680
he will be happy in life.

86
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,320
The child is not a fish.

87
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,640
It's the joy of the fish.

88
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,880
Mr. Zhou's joy of life

89
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,320
is just a few more

90
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,640
strong fish.

91
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,760
Zhang Huai Yu?

92
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,400
Why are you here?

93
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,920
Youcan stay and talk to me.

94
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,240
Sister Su Xin,

95
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,120
why did you come here?

96
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:41,560
In case sheeland

97
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,200
I will not say it to master and xiao.

98
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,680
No, I must look at her.

99
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,000
Listen,

100
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,600
why did Miss Biao want to look Laser today?

101
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,840
You can be Mr. Zhou or Mr. Zhang.

102
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,840
The most important thing is when you're right.

103
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,840
Right?

104
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,840
You should be the one who looks after the two young masters today.

105
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,840
Two young masters?

106
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,840
Mr. Zhang is right.

107
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,840
I'm Zhou Yanxi, the late-in-law of the state.

108
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,840
Mr. Zhang was right just now.

109
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,840
But it's not me.

110
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,840
I don't know the meaning of the word.

111
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,840
I don't know the meaning of the word.

112
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:19,840
Is there not?

113
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:22,840
Neither.

114
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,840
Even if you don't believe it,

115
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,840
don't you know that the people know

116
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,840
that is interesting?

117
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:35,840
You don't ask.

118
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,840
If you can't believe it,

119
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,840
you can't tell.

120
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,840
The people in this world

121
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:45,840
I'm here to save you.

122
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,880
Mr. Zhou,

123
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,880
I have business to discuss with Miss Bai.

124
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,880
I'll leave first.

125
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,880
I'm not leaving.

126
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,360
If you don't want to leave, just leave.

127
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,680
Mr. Zhang is really interesting.

128
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,600
Zhang Huaiyu.

129
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,600
What do you want to do if you want to leave?

130
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,640
If you don't leave, you can stay and watch.

131
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,200
What do you mean?

132
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,800
Now, the lady with the purple earring doesn't want to watch.

133
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,000
Besides,

134
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,400
I think Mr. Zhou is not bad.

135
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,040
He's just a little polite.

136
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,160
Unlike you,

137
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,840
you're not as beautiful as you think.

138
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,640
If I can't get married, you can marry me.

139
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,640
I'll marry you.

140
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,200
No, that's not it.

141
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,680
I came to find you today.

142
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,840
I really have business to discuss.

143
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,680
Then I won't make any more trouble.

144
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,880
I want to buy you a painting.

145
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,840
Painting?

146
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,040
I'm not sure.

147
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,040
I'm not sure.

148
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,040
I'm not sure.

149
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,040
I'm not sure.

150
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,040
I'm not sure.

151
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,040
I'm not sure.

152
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,040
I'm not sure.

153
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,040
I'm not sure.

154
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,040
I'm not sure.

155
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,040
You're not going to stop me from making trouble.

156
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,040
I'm not sure.

157
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,040
I'm not sure.

158
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,040
I'm not sure.

159
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,040
I'm not sure.

160
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,040
I'm not sure.

161
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,040
I'm not sure.

162
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,040
Then I'll go in.

163
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,040
I'll give you a five-point bet.

164
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,040
Don't worry.

165
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,040
I won't take your score.

166
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,040
Think about it.

167
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,040
You can't be so good at painting.

168
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,040
You can just take it as a joke.

169
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,040
But if it rains,

170
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:40,040
no one will come to watch the painting.

171
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,040
If your score is good enough,

172
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,040
I'll give you a five-point bet.

173
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:45,040
You can win at least three points.

174
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,040
Five-point bet?

175
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,040
Nine points.

176
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,040
Fine.

177
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,040
I'll give you four points.

178
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,040
You'll give me six points.

179
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,040
You can't be so good at it.

180
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,040
I'll give you seven points.

181
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,040
You'll give me three points.

182
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,040
Mrs. Gu.

183
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,040
I'll give you a point.

184
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,040
The point is the point.

185
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,040
The point is the point.

186
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,040
I'll give you a point.

187
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,040
I didn't give you any of these.

188
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,040
I'll give you a point.

189
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,040
No matter what,

190
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,040
you can't make me a compensation seller.

191
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,040
Then,

192
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,040
you should do whatever you've never done before.

193
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,040
Three, three, three.

194
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,040
Three, nine, three.

195
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,040
I'll go to you now.

196
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,040
You decide on the rest.

197
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,040
I'll draw with you.

198
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,040
Don't worry.

199
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,040
I'll decide on the rest.

200
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,040
Mrs. Gu,

201
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,040
this is my bottom line.

202
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,040
What else do you want?

203
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,040
Draw a book.

204
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,040
Tan is also a teacher.

205
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,040
I'll discuss it with him.

206
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,040
You won't be late.

207
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,040
Fine.

208
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,040
Here.

209
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,040
Where's the princess?

210
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,040
This is the princess's grave.

211
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,040
Where is she?

212
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,040
Miss,

213
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,040
have you seen my princess?

214
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,040
Yes.

215
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,040
Wei Zong.

216
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,040
Miss,

217
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,040
have you seen my princess?

218
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,040
No.

219
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,040
Miss,

220
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,040
have you seen my princess?

221
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,040
No.

222
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,040
Even if you want to get together,

223
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,040
we're family.

224
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,040
You can leave

225
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,040
the business of the Cultural Revolution.

226
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,040
But you have to draw

227
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,040
from the books to the lines.

228
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,040
You have to draw it yourself.

229
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,040
So,

230
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,040
you have to come to the Cultural Revolution

231
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,040
every day.

232
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,040
Every three days,

233
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,040
you'll meet me at the Dongjia meeting.

234
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,040
You'll forget it.

235
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,040
I can't do it.

236
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,040
There's no rule.

237
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,040
It's not a rule.

238
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,040
If we want to work together,

239
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,040
we have to follow the rules.

240
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,040
Only then

241
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,040
can we have a stable and stable business.

242
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,040
How about you?

243
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,040
What do you think?

244
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,040
I want to draw

245
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,040
whatever I want.

246
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,040
I can draw whatever I want.

247
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,040
I can draw whatever I want.

248
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,040
And,

249
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,040
the daily drawing is not

250
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,040
me to you.

251
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,040
But you.

252
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,040
You're the one who tells me

253
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,040
the situation every day.

254
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,040
Deal.

255
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,040
So fast?

256
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,040
As long as you come,

257
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,040
I can do anything.

258
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,040
Miss Liao.

259
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,040
Miss Liao.

260
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,040
Oh, no.

261
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,040
The princess is missing.

262
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,040
What?

263
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,040
Master,

264
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,040
I've found out that

265
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,040
Liu Mo Yu is a 15-year-old girl.

266
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,040
She can't go to the market

267
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,040
before she goes to the market.

268
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,040
Even the official doesn't have the talent.

269
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,040
Zhao Li said

270
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,040
that she can't enter the academy

271
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,040
in this situation.

272
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,040
But she didn't only enter the academy

273
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,040
this year.

274
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,040
She also entered the best academy

275
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,040
in the capital.

276
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,040
But someone helped her

277
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,040
to make the money.

278
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,040
Yes.

279
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,040
She is a famous accountants.

280
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,040
I found out

281
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,040
that the one who works for Mr. Wu

282
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,040
has been working for the Prime Minister

283
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,040
for many years.

284
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,040
He was sick six years ago.

285
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,040
So,

286
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,040
Liu Mo is the Prime Minister?

287
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,040
In this way,

288
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,040
I can say that

289
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,040
the princess was married before she was married.

290
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,040
She was the one who

291
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,040
ordered the Prime Minister to arrange it.

292
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,040
She can't be trusted.

293
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,040
But I continue to investigate.

294
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,040
I found that Liu Mo and the Prime Minister

295
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,040
were not in a good relationship.

296
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,040
Even she went to the market

297
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,040
that year

298
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,040
didn't meet the Prime Minister.

299
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,040
On the contrary,

300
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,040
Liu Mo and Ling Zhou

301
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,040
are in a relationship

302
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,040
that is worth a thousand or four thousand years.

303
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,040
I found out that

304
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,040
Liu Mo went to the capital

305
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,040
to ask some information.

306
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,040
What is that?

307
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,040
But it is the

308
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,040
most precious thing

309
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,040
that we can do together.

310
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,040
We live in a abandoned house.

311
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,040
We wake up in the morning,

312
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,040
and we wake up at night.

313
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,040
We beg for a warm hug.

314
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,040
But there is a person

315
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,040
who is really lucky.

316
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,040
She is very lucky.

317
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,040
She is always

318
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,040
holding books,

319
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,040
and she is very clever.

320
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,040
She doesn't know how to be hungry.

321
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,040
A girl

322
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,040
who is always with her father and mother.

323
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,040
Not only does someone give her food,

324
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,040
but also a special guest

325
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,040
who comes to give her a lesson.

326
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,040
Do you still remember

327
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,040
what kind of person

328
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,040
Song Fan is?

329
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,040
How can I remember that?

330
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,040
It has been so many years.

331
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,040
But

332
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,040
Liu's surname

333
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,040
is always called Brother Si.

334
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,040
When he came,

335
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,040
we had a meal and a drink.

336
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,040
So

337
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,040
we are always called Brother Si.

338
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,040
But after half a year,

339
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,040
Liu has gone.

340
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,040
He said he was

341
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,040
in the Academy of Books.

342
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,040
He is lucky.

343
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,040
He has a lady to take care of him.

344
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,040
Now,

345
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,040
he is not sure where he is going to serve.

346
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,040
He deliberately hid the body.

347
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,040
I think

348
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,040
there is something that can't be told.

349
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,040
No matter how

350
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,040
a person is hiding,

351
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,040
it is impossible for him

352
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,040
to take me to the West.

353
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,040
Continue to investigate.

354
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,040
And that person named Si.

355
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,040
Maybe it is a clue.

356
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,040
Yes.

357
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,040
No

358
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,040
No

359
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,040
Calm down.

360
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,040
Old Jiang

361
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,040
Old Jiang

362
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,040
Miss, I asked the one who has the fate,

363
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,040
they all said they have never met the Princess.

364
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,040
Let's find it again.

365
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,040
What's wrong?

366
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,040
Your Highness, the Princess is missing.

367
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,040
We have searched the garden,

368
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,040
but there is no trace of her.

369
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,040
She's missing?

370
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,040
Where did the Princess go?

371
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,040
She was resting in the market.

372
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,040
But with the Princess's surname,

373
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,040
she wouldn't leave without saying a word.

374
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,040
Are you sure that

375
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,040
the whole garden has been searched for?

376
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,040
I've searched for her for a long time,

377
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,040
but I haven't seen her.

378
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,040
Your Highness,

379
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,040
I asked the guards

380
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,040
and said they haven't seen the Princess.

381
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,040
By the way,

382
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,040
there is another unknown trace.

383
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,040
The Changchun Garden is the royal garden.

384
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,040
It's dedicated to the royal family

385
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,040
and the royal family.

386
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,040
The royal family is especially equipped

387
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,040
with a good background.

388
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,040
The background is especially well-dressed.

389
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,040
Princess,

390
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,040
I'm here.

391
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,040
Princess,

392
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,040
you're here.

393
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,040
You even helped me to

394
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,040
make her stay here.

395
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,040
I want to see

396
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,040
how this wedding

397
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,040
will turn out after today.

398
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,040
The scenery is so beautiful.

399
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,040
I'm so happy.

400
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,040
I'm so happy.

401
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,040
Mingtan,

402
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,040
you're going to be a good wife

403
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,040
and you'll be a good husband.

404
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,040
I wonder how you'll be

405
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,040
in the future.

406
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,040
How you'll have a good life.

407
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,040
As for Gao Chen,

408
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,040
he will be the one

409
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,040
who will take care of the family.

410
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,040
No matter how much the family

411
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,040
asks for the marriage,

412
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,040
I can only do

413
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,040
the wedding with him.

414
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,040
Princess,

415
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,040
you're so smart.

416
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,040
You're so smart.

417
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,040
Don't worry.

418
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,040
You can come here with someone.

419
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,040
It's best

420
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,040
to have the whole family

421
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,040
to take care of them.

422
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,040
Yes.

423
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:37,040
I'm not a good wife.

424
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,040
Then you all

425
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,040
should not think of being a good wife.

426
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,040
I'm here to eat.

427
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,040
I'll let you know.

428
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:53,040
Your Majesty, you're so considerate.

429
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,040
He knows you're a good wife

430
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,040
and doesn't want to marry anyone.

431
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,040
He's so considerate.

432
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,040
He'll cook for you first.

433
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,040
I'm so considerate.

434
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,040
You're so considerate.

435
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,040
You're so considerate.

436
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,040
You're so considerate.

437
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:06,040
I'll help you get off.

438
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,040
I know how to be considerate.

439
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,040
But it's better now.

440
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,040
You're the son of Marquis Jiang.

441
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,040
I'm not the princess of Fengzhao.

442
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,040
You've misunderstood me.

443
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,040
Please let me go.

444
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,040
I'll kill you.

445
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,040
Don't be afraid.

446
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,040
I just pretend

447
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,040
that I know you're not the princess.

448
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,040
That's enough.

449
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,040
Besides,

450
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,040
I have the letter

451
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,040
from the Empress Dowager.

452
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,040
Who dares to make things difficult for me?

453
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,040
I'm so happy.

454
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,040
Why do you have to

455
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,040
make me cry?

456
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,040
Help!

457
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,040
Help!

458
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,040
Help!

459
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,040
You still want to run?

460
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,040
Help!

461
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,040
Help!

462
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,040
Help!

463
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,040
Help!

464
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,040
Help!

465
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,040
Help!

466
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,040
Princess, is that enough?

467
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,040
Not yet.

468
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,040
Just a little more.

469
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,040
Only the smoke is enough

470
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:11,040
to attract more people.

471
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,040
Yes.

472
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,040
Come on.

473
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,040
Help!

474
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,040
Help!

475
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,040
You're still so strong.

476
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,040
You've broken the Heavens.

477
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,040
Help!

478
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,040
You're so wise.

479
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,040
Why are you here?

480
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,040
Why can't I be here?

481
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,040
Don't do this.

482
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,040
My husband...

483
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,040
Princess.

484
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,040
It's my fault

485
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,040
for coming here.

486
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,040
Are you okay?

487
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,040
Take Princess away.

488
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,040
Okay.

489
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,040
Let's go.

490
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,040
Your Majesty.

491
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,040
Mimi.

492
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,040
Li'er.

493
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,040
Li'er.

494
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,040
Li'er.

495
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,040
Li'er.

496
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,040
Li'er.

497
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,040
Li'er.

498
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,040
I'm sorry.

499
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,040
Please forgive me.

500
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,040
It's okay.

501
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,040
It's her.

502
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,040
She's the one who attacked me.

503
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,040
Have my clothes off.

504
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:17,040
They will be all dirty for you.

505
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,040
Where are your딜?

506
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,040
Clue me.

507
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,040
What is it?

508
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:44,040
That's my queen.

509
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,040
You're in danger today.

510
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,040
How dare you do this to me!

511
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,040
You're going to be in trouble!

512
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,040
What about the princess?

513
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:16,040
The prince is guilty of the crime.

514
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,040
You want to get rid of the princess?

515
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:20,040
Nanzhi, report to the official.

516
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,040
Yes.

517
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,040
What about the official?

518
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,040
The Empress Dowager is my grandmother.

519
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,040
She will take care of it for me.

520
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,040
I will definitely make you all pay for it.

521
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:32,040
I almost forgot about this case.

522
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:37,040
You came to Changchuan today to see the Empress Dowager's order.

523
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,040
What?

524
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,040
What's the matter?

525
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,040
This is a rumor.

526
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,040
No one knows about it.

527
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,040
The Empress Dowager's order is to make the princess a good fighter.

528
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:48,040
Zhang Huayun, throw her in.

529
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,040
You...

530
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,040
What are you doing?

531
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,040
Stop right there!

532
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,040
Stop!

533
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:58,040
What do you want? Let me go!

534
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,040
Let go of me!

535
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:02,040
Let go of me!

536
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,040
Let me out!

537
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,040
Open the door!

538
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:09,040
Don't go!

539
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,040
I'll kill you!

540
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,040
What happened just now?

541
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:16,040
What happened just now?

542
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,040
It's strange.

543
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,040
Did she find the place?

544
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,040
The prince is here.

545
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:26,040
I want to see the princess with Feng Zhao.

546
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:29,040
I want to let the Empress Dowager know about it.

547
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:31,040
So it's Feng Zhao and the prince.

548
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,040
It's a coincidence.

549
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:36,040
They're so beautiful.

550
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:40,040
I didn't expect a man to be so young.

551
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:42,040
Especially this lady.

552
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,040
She's so beautiful.

553
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,040
Little cat.

554
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:09,040
Are you separated from your mother?

555
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:21,040
Is there anything else?

556
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:35,040
Are you scared?

557
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,040
You don't have to be scared.

558
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,040
I'm here.

559
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:59,040
Feng Zhao is here.

560
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,040
I'll take care of her.

561
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:03,040
Feng Zhao is waiting for me.

562
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:05,040
Feng Zhao is waiting for me.

563
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,040
Wait for me.

564
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:12,040
My husband.

565
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:16,040
Where are you going?

566
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,040
You're so cruel.

567
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:30,040
I've met with the princess and the prince.

568
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,040
I've met with the princess.

569
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:36,040
I've met with the prince.

570
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,040
Don't remember the princess.

571
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:05,040
For the sake of the prince,

572
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,040
I have nothing to fear.

573
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:12,040
I feel so high in the air,

574
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:15,040
so I can protect you.

575
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,640
I'm sorry

576
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,040
Lord

577
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,360
why did you travel

578
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,080
Caterpillar

579
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,640
must go to Caterpillar

580
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:54,760
Ha

581
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,040
In this matter

582
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,160
I have an explanation

583
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,040
Your Majesty is waiting for me in the palace.

584
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,040
Don't worry, Your Highness.

585
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:17,040
I'll be back soon.

586
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:20,040
I won't let it happen.

587
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:32,040
I'll be back soon.

588
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:34,040
Your Majesty.

589
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:36,040
I'll be back soon.

590
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:38,040
I'll be back soon.

591
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:06,040
The Empress of the Palace

592
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,040
It's been more than a few hours.

593
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:13,040
You only came here now.

594
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,040
What?

595
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,040
You used the dinner in the palace.

596
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:18,040
You only thought of leaving the palace after you finished the palace.

597
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:20,040
How did Your Majesty know?

598
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,040
If I suddenly went out of my mind that day,

599
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,040
you would be angry.

600
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:30,040
You should take a good look.

601
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:32,040
You came here like a snowy snow

602
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:34,040
before you entered the palace.

603
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:36,040
The Marquis of Jiangyang only came to the capital

604
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:38,040
to do such a thing.

605
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,040
How can I take the place?

606
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:42,040
I thought you married a wife.

607
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:44,040
You could be more mature and give me less money.

608
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,040
You could have a bigger house.

609
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:48,040
You can't take it away.

610
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:51,040
I will marry myself.

611
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,040
I don't care about anyone.

612
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:57,040
I even signed the edict.

613
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:59,040
I even signed the edict.

614
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:01,040
Tomorrow, when she gets the edict,

615
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:03,040
she will be in trouble again.

616
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:06,040
The Empress Dowager doesn't have this chance.

617
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:10,040
The edict is what the Empress Dowager wants.

618
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:13,040
I have already locked her up in the Grand Hall.

619
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,040
What?

620
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:18,040
If the Empress Dowager wants the edict to be fine,

621
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:21,040
she needs to be cautious and be careful.

622
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,040
I will marry you.

623
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:38,040
You are so generous.

624
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,040
You still have to do it.

625
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:41,040
If you are in the hands of someone else,

626
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:44,040
who would dare to use such a brazen method?

627
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:52,040
I will marry a concubine for Your Majesty.

628
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,040
Why should I marry a concubine?

629
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:59,040
Longyan is a very different person.

630
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:02,040
Can Your Majesty miss it?

631
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:11,040
I did make a mistake today.

632
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:14,040
I will order the Ministry of Justice to punish me.

633
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:18,040
But you are too impulsive and you are too slow.

634
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:20,040
It's hard to save you.

635
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:23,040
It's my fault to enter the palace.

636
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:25,040
I have to punish Your Majesty.

637
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:28,040
Such a trick is very important.

638
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:34,040
Is it possible to stop the war?

639
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:40,040
I am willing to do it.

640
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,040
What smell?

641
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,040
It's like a human.

642
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:52,040
Did you swallow the public's bucket?

643
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,040
Liu Yiding.

644
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,040
I am here.

645
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,040
What smell?

646
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:59,040
Your Majesty, I also smell something.

647
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:02,040
It's like a smell of incense.

648
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:05,040
It smells like incense.

649
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,040
It's a lesson.

650
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:30,040
You said you had a few days off.

651
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:32,040
At least you are married.

652
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,040
You should be punished for this.

653
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,040
Liu Yiding.

654
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,040
I am here.

655
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,040
Open the door.

656
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,040
Yes.

657
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,040
I am sorry.

658
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,040
I am sorry.

659
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,040
I am sorry.

660
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,040
I am sorry.

661
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:56,040
This scent is very special.

662
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:59,040
It can be reused when you wear it.

663
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:02,040
It's good.

664
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:15,040
I went to the Marquis's Mansion just now.

665
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:19,040
Gao Chen must have been in a difficult position.

666
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:22,040
Today's ceremony is to hold the wedding of the princess

667
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:24,040
and Marquis of Jiangyang's Mansion.

668
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:26,040
The princess is going to be the next one.

669
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:28,040
Princess Consort Dingbei will be the next one.

670
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:31,040
The horse is not a good match.

671
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:34,040
It's a little bit like Gao Chen's life.

672
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,040
From now on,

673
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:38,040
Gao's family and Prince Dingbei are not enemies.

674
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:40,040
Although the wedding is not done,

675
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:42,040
at least Marquis of Jiangyang

676
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:45,040
will not be able to have a dream with Prince Dingbei.

677
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:49,040
I will wait for you in the future.

678
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:52,040
Don't worry, Marquis.

679
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:54,040
Everything is in order.

680
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:57,040
Prince Dingbei's 60th card is not moving for half a month.

681
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:59,040
It's enough for us to wait.

682
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,040
Your Highness, you especially told me

683
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,040
that with this trick,

684
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:14,040
it can relieve the pain of the wound.

685
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,040
Tan, how are you?

686
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:20,040
I just got some shock.

687
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,040
I'm fine.

688
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:24,040
I thought that Zhai Nianci

689
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,040
was just a child.

690
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,040
He was used to it.

691
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:28,040
I didn't expect him to be so wise.

692
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,040
But don't worry.

693
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,040
I've already helped you

694
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,040
to take care of him yesterday.

695
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:33,040
I've given you a lot of regret.

696
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:36,040
Zhai Nianci was born in a noble family.

697
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:38,040
She was favored by the Empress Dowager.

698
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,040
But in the end,

699
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:42,040
she is still the son of the Su family.

700
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:45,040
Even the Grand Master Zhongshen is hard to control.

701
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,040
He was forced to do it.

702
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:49,040
That's why he did it.

703
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:52,040
But the Grand Master Zhongshen was forced to do it.

704
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,040
He shouldn't be married to anyone.

705
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,040
Exactly.

706
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:57,040
His father allowed him to be in the Grand Court.

707
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,040
He is considered to be the most worthy of his title.

708
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,040
Since then,

709
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:02,040
the marriage and marriage are all the parents' lives.

710
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,040
How many people can make their own decisions?

711
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,040
For example, you,

712
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,040
the one who has the main sword and the sword,

713
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,040
and the one who is in charge of the battle,

714
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,040
and the one who is in charge of the royal army,

715
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,040
there are only a few.

716
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:11,040
You are so obedient.

717
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,040
Yesterday,

718
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:14,040
I saw that the Prince was very concerned about you.

719
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:16,040
He is indeed a good man who can't be taken care of.

720
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,040
But if there is a new person in the family,

721
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,040
it's impossible to say.

722
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,040
What new person?

723
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,040
You still don't know?

724
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,040
My old man mentioned that

725
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:31,040
the Empress Dowager wanted to give the palace to three people.

726
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:34,040
He said that the palace is not suitable for the people.

727
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:37,040
The Prince should have a concubine to be able to open the palace.

728
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:46,040
How long has the Prince and the Prince been married?

729
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:49,040
Even if the Empress Dowager is in a hurry,

730
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,040
it shouldn't be like this.

731
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:52,040
It's not reasonable to say that there are three people.

732
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,040
Maybe there are three people now.

733
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,040
What about in the future?

734
00:32:57,040 --> 00:33:00,040
My old man asked me to give you a word.

735
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:02,040
He said that the Prince is young and has a high status.

736
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,040
He is very high.

737
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:05,040
The Prince is only you.

738
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:07,040
It doesn't mean that there is only you in the future.

739
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:10,040
The most important thing in the palace is the childbirth.

740
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:12,040
While your husband is very affectionate and has no one to fight with,

741
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,040
he has been raising you up.

742
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:16,040
The position of the Princess is the most important thing.

743
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:19,040
The husband and the wife are still far from each other.

744
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:21,040
The child is more beautiful.

745
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:24,040
Tan, don't blame my old man for being straightforward.

746
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:26,040
Although I don't think he is right,

747
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:29,040
you should be more willing to do the plan for yourself.

748
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:35,040
I know that uncle is doing this for me.

749
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:38,040
So you have to be careful with the childbirth.

750
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:40,040
If there is a real trust in the future,

751
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,040
and if there is a son to be given to the Prince,

752
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:43,040
who will be able to say who is the son in the future?

753
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,040
Don't think too much.

754
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:48,040
The Prince is very generous.

755
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:50,040
He is not so kind as to be so careless.

756
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:52,040
I don't think he is so kind.

757
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:55,040
Moreover, the Empress Dowager wants to get married.

758
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:57,040
She has to see if the Prince agrees.

759
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,040
Yes.

760
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:05,040
Princess Consort, I am here to ask for your help.

761
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,040
What?

762
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,040
What mother?

763
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,040
A mother?

764
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,040
A mother?

765
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:44,040
Greetings, Princess Consort.

766
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,040
You...

767
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,040
Are you Aunt Yun?

768
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,040
Yes.

769
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,040
You...

770
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:44,040
You are a liar.

771
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:55,040
Is this the kind of woman the Prince really likes?

772
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,040
No.

773
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,040
What are you looking at?

774
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,600
Oh, oh.

775
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:06,240
We look at her face and can't get along.

776
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,800
It wasn't your thought.

777
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,100
You're of也是个盗邦 under Thyme

778
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:12,120
conmu Prosecutor.

779
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:14,760
You have yet to know the secret.

780
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:18,700
And so nothing became clear in our world.

781
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,640
We want Li Ju and some people to share.

782
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:27,780
It seems he supported her courage.

783
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:30,880
You just disagree.

784
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:31,820
Your highness,

785
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:32,960

the

816
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,480
Your Highness, you're injured like this.

817
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,980
You must be taken care of.

818
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:05,480
I'm here to help you.

819
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:09,980
Uncle Fu.

820
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:12,980
I know. I won't let you down.

821
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:14,480
It's not good!

822
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:16,480
Your Highness, it's not good.

823
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,980
It's a big deal.

824
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:19,480
Why are you so angry?

825
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:21,480
His Majesty ordered me to kill you 60 times.

826
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,980
You were in the palace last night.

827
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:24,980
You were in the palace.

828
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:27,480
60 times?

829
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,480
Isn't that a life?

830
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,980
It's a good deal.

831
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:38,980
Your Highness, I don't know what you're doing.

832
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:41,980
Just now, Second Young Master and the shadow were taking you home.

833
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:44,480
Your Highness, you're so stupid.

834
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,480
You're not even a good person.

835
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,980
Luckily, you didn't have a life.

836
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:51,980
Your Highness, you've been thinking about your Highness.

837
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:53,480
You're afraid that you'll worry about her.

838
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:55,480
You won't let me do this.

839
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,480
But Your Highness, you're so considerate.

840
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,480
Your Highness, you've been fighting too much.

841
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,480
There's only one Noble Consort in the study room.

842
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,480
No one is looking after her.

843
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:05,480
How can she be so kind?

844
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,480
This is the medicine that His Highness often uses.

845
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,480
It's more useful than the normal gold-chong medicine.

846
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,980
His Highness can take this medicine to cure His Highness.

847
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:27,980
This is...

848
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:31,980
This is Yun Yi.

849
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:34,980
This is the aunt of the noble family.

850
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:35,980
She just came in today.

851
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:36,980
What?

852
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:37,980
Aunt?

853
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:39,980
You can't even make up for it?

854
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:40,980
There's Yun Yi's mother.

855
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:42,980
No need to worry about her.

856
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:43,980
I'll take care of her.

857
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:45,980
Yun Yi's mother knows you so well.

858
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:47,980
She's so kind.

859
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:49,980
She can take care of you no matter how much she's going to serve you.

860
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:51,980
If Yun Yi's mother finds out about this,

861
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:55,980
I'm sure she'll cry and cry.

862
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:57,980
Don't hesitate.

863
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:03,980
Please take the medicine.

864
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:06,980
Please take care of Yun Yi's mother.

865
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:09,980
I'll follow your orders.

866
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:13,980
Wait, wait, wait.

867
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:14,980
Come back.

868
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:17,980
I've served you for the rest of my life.

869
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:20,980
I've never heard of your aunt.

870
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:22,980
She's a good girl.

871
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:24,980
She's a good girl.

872
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:26,980
There must be some misunderstanding.

873
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:27,980
Your Highness,

874
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:31,980
I don't want to let you worry about her.

875
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:32,980
You can see that

876
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:36,980
you're the only one in my heart.

877
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:43,980
Besides,

878
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:46,980
you're the one who's hurt this time.

879
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:48,980
You don't say it,

880
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:50,980
but I'm sure you're the one who's hurt.

881
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:52,980
You're the one who's hurt.

882
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:59,980
Who can understand your thoughts?

883
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:03,980
Today, my aunt is in the mansion.

884
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:07,980
Maybe you're the one who's hurt.

885
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:09,980
Your aunt was injured before.

886
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:11,980
The military is trying to get her to take the medicine.

887
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:13,980
The others don't care.

888
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:23,980
Yun Yi's mother is really good at

889
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:27,980
understanding the king.

890
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:30,980
I wonder

891
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:33,980
when you two met.

892
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:35,980
Your Highness,

893
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:38,980
Yun Yi has been with the king for years.

894
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:40,980
Years?

895
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:42,980
Could it be that...

896
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:45,980
What misunderstanding is there?

897
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:46,980
The queen Dowager is still here.

898
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:48,980
She's the one who's hurt.

899
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:50,980
Your Highness, don't worry.

900
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:52,980
I'll go find the king and ask him.

901
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:54,980
Yes, you should.

902
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:03,980
If the king doesn't like me,

903
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:05,980
why should I tell him?

904
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:14,980
It's better to make another decision.

905
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:19,980
Your Highness!

906
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:21,980
Your Highness, wait for me!

907
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:23,980
Why did you go out of the house?

908
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:25,980
I'm going to tell you!

909
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:27,980
Your Highness!

910
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:44,980
I've never seen you so calm.

911
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:47,980
If His Majesty hadn't been so kind,

912
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:49,980
even if you had him do it personally,

913
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:51,980
he wouldn't have been so happy.

914
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:54,980
I'm so lucky to have a doctor.

915
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:55,980
I don't need to think too much.

916
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:58,980
It's my biggest mistake to keep him alive.

917
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:03,980
You're a good person.

918
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:06,980
But this sword

919
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:09,980
will also make you feel better.

920
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:11,980
The Su family is already in the past.

921
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:13,980
Why did you have to make him do it?

922
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:16,980
What's his son's condition?

923
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:17,980
He's not feeling well.

924
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:19,980
Gao Chen is a rich man.

925
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:21,980
He has nothing to do with

926
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:23,980
the central fish house with the Jiangyang Marquis.

927
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:24,980
If that's the case,

928
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:27,980
the Jiangyang Marquis won't do anything.

929
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:28,980
Ah Xu,

930
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:30,980
what you're saying is enough.

931
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:32,980
You think I'm not hurt enough?

932
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:34,980
I'm not in a good position, am I?

933
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:36,980
Be gentle.

934
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:43,980
I heard that the Empress Dowager is choosing a person

935
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:45,980
to be your concubine.

936
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:48,980
How do you know this?

937
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:49,980
A few days ago,

938
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:51,980
the Empress Dowager asked Ah Yu to go to Changchun Palace

939
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:52,980
to mention this matter.

940
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:54,980
