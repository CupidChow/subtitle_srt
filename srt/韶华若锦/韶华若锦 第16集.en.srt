[Youthful Glory]

2
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:32,890
[Episode 16]

3
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,120
The Marquis of Jing'an
holds a court position;

4
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,120
getting involved was inevitable.

5
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,080
He chose the Prince of Dingbei
as a son-in-law

6
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,759
because he was

7
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,240
the best choice

8
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,320
to elevate the Ming family.

9
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,680
In the world of politics,

10
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,600
everyone has the same ambitions;

11
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,360
the Prince of Dingbei is no exception.

12
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,640
If he could marry into the Ming family

13
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,700
for its influence,

14
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,640
then naturally, he could also break ties
with the Ming family

15
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,440
for the sake of the Dingbei Army.

16
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,760
Godfather, you're right.

17
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,000
I have only

18
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,200
one last question:

19
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,600
You really

20
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,520
can't help him,

21
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,570
for the sake of our past relationship,

22
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:52,920
and save my father?

23
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,440
Your father rendered
great service to Xian.

24
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,600
If he confessed,

25
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,320
perhaps His Majesty would spare
the Ming family

26
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,300
from collective punishment.

27
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:57,620
All this time,

28
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,800
I treated you

29
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,200
with sincerity and respect, like a father.

30
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,600
I once believed that

31
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,040
the bond between us

32
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,170
would not be changed by personal gain.

33
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,640
But in the end, I was simply too naive.

34
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,320
I didn't realize that

35
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,560
the bustling world

36
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,960
runs on profit,

37
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,409
that all comings and goings

38
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,159
are driven by interest.

39
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,400
I'm just like this bracelet,

40
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,360
merely a tool you use to win favor

41
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,280
and gain power,

42
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,520
a pawn in your plans.

43
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:23,920
But while items can be gifted at will,

44
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:28,420
a person cannot be used to distort truth

45
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:30,880
or be manipulated at whim.

46
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:17,190
Your Majesty,

47
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:20,400
is there no room left

48
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,760
to turn it around?

49
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,700
I have already summoned
Guo Bingmao to the capital.

50
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,520
He served under Marquis of Jing'an
for many years,

51
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,710
and it was the Marquis of Jing'an himself

52
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:32,600
who once recommended him

53
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,080
to succeed as Commander.

54
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,640
If Guo Bingmao

55
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,720
can prove his innocence,

56
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,120
there may still be a sliver of hope.

57

[Prince of Dingbei's Mansion]

58
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,040
[Harmony and Abundance]

59
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:56,350
Greetings, Your Highness.

60
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,860
[Harmony and Abundance]

61
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:09,720
Shen Yu,

62
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,680
didn't the Dingbei Army

63
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,500
almost run into serious trouble

64
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:17,080
while escorting Father back
to the capital?

65
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,540
Your Highness, you must
have heard about it.

66
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,880
But please don't worry,

67
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,410
His Lordship is doing well.

68
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:29,550
Does His Highness

69
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,140
know about this?

70
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,490
He had already made
arrangements in advance

71
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:36,730
to save His Lordship.

72
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,810
Was that person really a soldier
of the Dingbei Army?

73
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:46,390
He truly was a soldier.

74
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:49,720
Afterwards, His Highness, knowing
his family was poor,

75
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,850
gave him an additional compensation.

76
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,040
It was my mistake to misjudge him;

77
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,370
I almost jeopardized the entire mission.

78
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:03,810
You were just following orders;

79
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:05,850
how can you be blamed?

80
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,960
The matter isn't settled yet;

81
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:10,220
there might still be a chance to
turn things around.

82
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:11,770
Please don't let worry overwhelm you

83
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:13,100
and damage your health.

84
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:26,800
Greetings, Your Majesty.

85
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:28,450
Liu Yiding!

86
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:30,340
At your service.

87
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,820
You may step aside now.

88
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,720
Yes.

89
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:39,770
Guo Bingmao,

90
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,200
you may rise.

91
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,960
[Deputy Commander of Yangxi Prefecture,
Guo Bingmao]

92
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,120
Thank you, Your Majesty.

93
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,250
I've called you here today in private,

94
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,900
hoping you'll speak openly and honestly

95
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,320
without holding anything back.

96
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,600
How has the Marquis of Jing'an

97
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,660
conducted himself

98
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:00,630
during his decades guarding
the southern borders?

99
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,120
Your Majesty,

100
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,760
the Marquis of Jing'an

101
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,560
once led the Yangxi Prefecture,

102
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,880
repeatedly defeating the enemy

103
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,000
and reclaiming lost territory.

104
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,120
The entire army

105
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,520
holds him in great admiration and respect.

106
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,800
The people of the southern region

107
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,040
also revere and support him,

108
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,640
praising him as

109
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,960
the pillar of stability in the south.

110
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,200
Has Marquis of Jing'an,

111
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,330
ever disregarded the court's orders,

112
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,380
overstepping his authority,

113
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,400
or maintained any private dealings

114
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,800
with Nanlyu?

115
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,360
Well...

116
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:40,000
I only know that he is stubborn by nature;

117
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,240
once he sets his mind on something,

118
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,800
no one can persuade him.

119
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,940
Eight years ago, after the
victory of Yongzhou,

120
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,200
he insisted against all opposition

121
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,930
on meeting privately with the
Nanlyu Commander.

122
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,360
But what was discussed

123
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,090
remains unknown to anyone.

124
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,400
Guo Bingmao,

125
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,160
are you aware if the Marquis of Jing'an

126
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,790
has had any correspondence with
Nanlyu over the years?

127
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:06,650
There has been.

128
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:08,920
Your Majesty,

129
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,200
he has never concealed this matter.

130
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,920
The letters from Nanlyu were merely

131
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:15,480
attempts to negotiate border trade,

132
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,400
and often included bribes.

133
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,920
However, he never paid them any heed.

134
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:21,880
Then how did he

135
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:24,530
respond to Nanlyu's requests?

136
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,320
Well...

137
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,800
Your Majesty, I don't know.

138
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:33,560
But he usually did not reply.

139
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,330
He simply set the matter aside.

140
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,280
To my knowledge,

141
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,600
he only responded once or twice,

142
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,680
but I am unaware of

143
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,450
the contents of those letters.

144
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,870
Greetings, Chancellor.

145
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:40,970
Just a small token of respect
â€”nothing of real value.

146
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:42,800
I hope you will kindly accept it.

147
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,000
Lord Guo, you are too courteous.

148
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,160
Have a seat.

149
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,600
Tonight, Chancellor has prepared
a modest banquet

150
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,530
to welcome Lord Guo and
celebrate your safe arrival.

151
00:11:57,530 --> 00:11:59,080
You are too kind, Chancellor.

152
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,840
Lord Guo, you're brave and accomplished

153
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,120
at such a young age.

154
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,720
This cup I offer in honor of

155
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,680
your bright future and boundless success.

156
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,450
Thank you, Chancellor.

157
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,120
Thank you.

158
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,120
I'm a man of the armyâ€”

159
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,200
rough by nature.

160
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,840
This way of drinking suits me best.

161
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,000
Lord Guo, your capacity for drink is truly impressiveâ€”

162
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,530
worthy of a hero in the army.

163
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,840
With your testimony,

164
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,440
there is no longer any doubt that
the Marquis of Jing'an

165
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,160
is guilty of collusion and smuggling.

166
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,880
Though I did not openly
accuse him of treason,

167
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,120
His Majesty's mind

168
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,680
must already be wavering.

169
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:54,280
Between ruler and subject,
suspicion is most dangerous.

170
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,960
Marquis of Jing'an has defied
the Emperor's willâ€”

171
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,820
no matter his past achievements,

172
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,720
he can no longer remain in favor.

173
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,000
Now that both evidence and
testimony are in hand,

174
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,320
he cannot escape a death sentence.

175
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,840
This case is already settled.

176
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,320
For your meritorious service
in disaster relief,

177
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,480
I have submitted a memorial to His Majesty

178
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,590
recommending you

179
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,000
as the

180
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,560
new Commander of the Yangxi Prefecture.

181
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:23,080
The command is now yours.

182
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:28,010
Rest assured, Chancellor,

183
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:29,120
from this day forward,

184
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,200
I shall follow your lead

185
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,720
without question.

186
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:42,160
The evidence seized from

187
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,070
the Ming family's ancestral estateâ€”

188
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:45,480
was it all

189
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,400
aimed at Father?

190
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,120
Tan.

191
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:05,760
At this point,

192
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:07,880
what is there left to hide?

193
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,960
Xu, please just speak plainly.

194
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,440
What exactly happened?

195
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,160
The Imperial Guards have uncovered
Nanlyu's involvement.

196
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,040
They bribed officials with
100,000 taels of silver,

197
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,300
smuggled five chests of rare treasures,

198
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,130
and there was also correspondence

199
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,820
between their court and your father.

200
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,900
The evidence of collusion and smuggling

201
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,320
is conclusive.

202
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,480
What will happen

203
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:58,920
to my father?

204
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:02,570
The imperial decree has been issued.

205
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,620
Out of regard for his past merits,

206
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:11,970
His Majesty has chosen not
to implicate the entire Ming family.

207
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,140
As for your fatherâ€¦

208
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,240
In three days, he...

209
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,400
In three days what?

210
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,680
Tell meâ€”what happens in three days?

211
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:43,200
This matter is not yet over.

212
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,020
I swear I will do everything in
my power to find a way.

213
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:49,880
Tan!

214
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:53,600
Tan!

215
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:56,760
Tan!

216
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,520
Tan!

217
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,280
Tan!

218
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:12,530
I will do everything in my power.

219
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:16,319
But for now, you must pull
yourself together.

220
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:17,119
Tan.

221
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,640
How can I pull myself together?

222
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:25,290
â™ª It's a journey full of ups and downs â™ª

223
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,960
How should I pull myself together?

224
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,440
He's my father.

225
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:33,030
â™ª It's a journey full of coldness â™ª

226
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,600
My only father.

227
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,720
â™ª The wind combs through my hair â™ª

228
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:42,110
â™ª Putting pen to paper, I write about our past â™ª

229
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:46,490
â™ª Tears on the face, pain in the heart â™ª

230
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,160
Tan.

231
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,210
I only ask you for one thing.

232
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:55,890
â™ª Looking back, what a long road filled with uncertainties â™ª

233
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,040
Let me see Father for the last time.

234
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:03,600
â™ª Who to share
the wavering candle light with? â™ª

235
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:08,400
â™ª Words are cold â™ª

236
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:12,050
â™ª I always remember the promise
to get old with you â™ª

237
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:17,070
â™ª Sigh! Vows are like snowflakes
resting on my palm â™ª

238
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,640
At this point,

239
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,640
he won't let me go.

240
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,930
I've examined those stolen goods myself.

241
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,060
They are indeed unique to Nanlyu.

242
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:34,580
Nanlyu and the Yangxi Prefecture
have been at war for many years,

243
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:35,440
so it's most likely that

244
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,160
the contraband came in through
the southern border.

245
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,560
But the Su family controls the
maritime trade at Xian.

246
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,800
If they wanted to smuggle in a few

247
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,760
items and

248
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,160
frame someone,

249
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,420
it wouldn't be difficult.

250
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:48,960
But

251
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,610
to overturn the case within three days

252
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,340
seems all but impossible.

253
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,600
The enemy hides in the shadows.

254
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,260
How can we guard against them?

255
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,440
Your Highness, you've done your best.

256
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,030
I just didn't expect

257
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,800
our old friendship

258
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,530
to vanish like a mirage in water

259
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,300
in the face of power and politics.

260
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,320
I've spent my life on horseback,

261
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,010
defending the nation and
protecting its people.

262
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,720
Having lived this long, I can say
I've had my share.

263
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:35,280
The only thing I can't let go of

264
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,600
is Tan.

265
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:46,280
These days must be
especially hard for her.

266
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,970
I'll have to trouble Your Highness

267
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,970
to look after her with care,

268
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,840
and offer her guidance and comfort.

269
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:00,800
As for you,

270
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,080
this may look like a dead end.

271
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:06,800
But

272
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,120
it is not the end.

273
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,600
Though things seem bleak now,

274
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,400
the tide is turning in our favor.

275
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,450
Rather than fighting endlessly

276
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:28,250
over a single piece on the board,

277
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,840
it's better to step back

278
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,740
and see the whole game.

279
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:33,520
Your Majesty,

280
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:36,290
the Lizhou case is only the beginning.

281
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,960
Among the trusted officials

282
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,400
at your side,

283
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:41,230
there are those

284
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:44,130
who will inevitably follow the same path.

285
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:58,050
The Su family has been entrenched
in Xian for many years,

286
00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:00,130
with deep and widespread influence.

287
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,740
If we are to strike at the root,

288
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,880
many others may be dragged
into the matter.

289
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:09,220
The court of Xian

290
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:12,760
has already been deeply corroded by
the Su family's presence.

291
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:15,890
To move even one thread is to
shake the entire structure.

292
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:16,820
Your Majesty,

293
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:20,350
the Su family's true power
lies in Lingzhou.

294
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,960
If Lingzhou is taken,

295
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,530
the Su family

296
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:25,300
will lose all support.

297
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:48,210
[Bieyu House]

298
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,040
What do you mean?

299
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:51,440
You...

300
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,420
What brings you here today?

301
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:55,110
It's not even your day off yet.

302
00:21:56,570 --> 00:21:57,630
What's the matter?

303
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:01,240
I'm here to introduce you to
a special guest.

304
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,280
Enough.

305
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,360
Just meeting someone,

306
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,820
no need to look so anxious.

307
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,040
The Empress herself

308
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,160
is my elder sister.

309
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,240
Do you think I

310
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,500
meet with just anyone?

311
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:17,840
Watch your mouth.

312
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:22,600
Which household

313
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,400
does the young master come from,

314
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,440
to have the Commander of
the Imperial Guards

315
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,040
and the top-ranked scholar at his service?

316
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,720
It's just a visit to Bieyu House.

317
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,720
No need to make such a grand display.

318
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,720
Brother-in-law.

319
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:44,600
Your Majesty!

320
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,000
No.

321
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,560
Your Majesty.

322
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:47,880
Your Majesty.

323
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,400
Just now...

324
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:49,960
I didn't...

325
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:50,880
I didn't know it was you.

326
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,000
If my words were rude,

327
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:52,920
it was truly unintentional.

328
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:55,120
No, it was my own foolishness.

329
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,840
Your Majesty's visit is a great honor.

330
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,440
Forgive me for

331
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,580
not coming out to welcome you sooner.

332
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:03,990
Rise.

333
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,180
I'm also visiting in disguise today.

334
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,880
You don't have to be so polite.

335
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,840
I've long heard that

336
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,310
you've made a successful business.

337
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,520
This Bieyu House is truly one of a kind,

338
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:21,120
standing out above all in the capital.

339
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,320
I've always wanted to see it.

340
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,760
Now that I have, it lives up to the name.

341
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,120
No wonder

342
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,960
you've never been
interested in court affairs

343
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,620
and only focused on business.

344
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:38,480
Your Majesty. That's very kind of you.

345
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,520
It's a great honor

346
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:43,800
to have you here.

347
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,060
It's truly a blessing.

348
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,730
It's their fault

349
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,960
for not informing me in advance.

350
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:49,430
If...

351
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:51,000
If I had known you would come,

352
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,480
I would have prepared it

353
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,760
and made sure everything was ready

354
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,440
to give you

355
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,440
a pleasant visit.

356
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,080
May

357
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,610
I ask what

358
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,740
brings you here in secret?

359
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:12,200
Iâ€™d like you to help me
look over a ledger.

360
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:17,410
[The Ledgers of the Maritime Trade Bureau
of Xian at Year 7 of Chengkang Era]

361
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:17,730
[The Ledgers of the Maritime Trade Bureau
of Xian at Year 7 of Chengkang Era]

362
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,560
At first glance,

363
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,080
the numbers seem to match.

364
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,920
But look closer.

365
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,520
The seal from the Maritime Trade Bureau

366
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,280
was stamped first,

367
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:36,200
then the numbers were added afterward.

368
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,800
Otherwise, the ink wouldnâ€™t

369
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,460
spill over the seal like this.

370
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,240
Your Majesty.

371
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,840
This is clearly a forged ledger.

372
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,280
Based on these numbers,

373
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,360
at least sixty to seventy percent
of Lingzhouâ€™s

374
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,890
maritime import tax revenue
has been hidden.

375
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,040
And this is just

376
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,200
from the past five years.

377
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,840
If we continue to trace it for ten years,

378
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,480
I'm afraid it'll be even worse.

379
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,960
Lingzhou's taxes have been
a mess for too long.

380
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,280
The court shouldâ€™ve intervened long ago.

381
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,520
The country has its laws.

382
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,320
Lingzhou

383
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,360
is not a place beyond the law.

384
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,340
The treasury is already running low.

385
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,680
Rebuilding Lizhou after the disaster

386
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,920
will need a large sum.

387
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,240
If Lingzhou can

388
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,480
quickly repay the owed taxes

389
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,880
and enrich the treasury.

390
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:35,440
Weâ€™ll be able to get through this.

391
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,240
Lingzhou is the territory
of the Su family.

392
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,760
They've been firmly in control of

393
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:41,280
the maritime taxes

394
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,960
for years.

395
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,080
Trying to fix it

396
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,120
and make them pay up

397
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,440
wonâ€™t be easy.

398
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,680
To handle this,

399
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,160
we need someone

400
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,120
who truly knows all the ins and outs.

401
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,760
Investigating the taxes of Lingzhou,

402
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,220
we can send a clear warning

403
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,760
to the Su family.

404
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,720
The tax of Lingzhou.

405
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,880
Isnâ€™t it the same one

406
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,280
that the court sends people to every year,

407
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,560
yet

408
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,720
no one ever returns?

409
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:46,400
This person

410
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:48,960
who knows the ins and outs,

411
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,760
donâ€™t tell me

412
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:52,720
you mean me?

413
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,680
Thanks to Xu's advice.

414
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,840
He said you're a good businessman.

415
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,570
And you are good at accounting.

416
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,250
After careful thought,

417
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,040
I believe thereâ€™s no one

418
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,960
better for the task.

419
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,280
Yu.

420
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:14,320
The reason I came in secret

421
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,070
because I don't want to
suppress you with royal authority.

422
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:19,200
This isnâ€™t a decree,

423
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:20,760
but

424
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:23,520
a sincere request.

425
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,570
Does my sister know?

426
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,040
I'll take that as a yes.

427
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,160
Rise.

428
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,680
Where is Xu?

429
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:53,240
Tell him to come see me.

430
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:06,800
His Majesty has already ordered
Young Lord Zhang

431
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,760
to Lingzhou

432
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,680
to investigate the import tax evasion.

433
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,720
Tax revenue is Lingzhouâ€™s lifeline.

434
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,650
Chancellor, you should make plans

435
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,800
to take precautions.

436
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:18,800
Over the years,
among those sent to Lingzhou,

437
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:21,600
there were always one or two
who never made it back.

438
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,960
Zhang Huaiyu has no official job.

439
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,860
Heâ€™s not a real threat.

440
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,520
Iâ€™ll write to Errong.

441
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,160
Sheâ€™ll know what to do.

442
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:47,120
So this is what you called

443
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:47,960
a banquet?

444
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,560
This is the most popular dish right now.

445
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,760
The wild chicken wontons

446
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,400
with fresh bamboo shoots
and fiddlehead ferns inside.

447
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,960
The taste is crispy and smooth.

448
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:54,760
Eat up.

449
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:55,960
In a few days,

450
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,500
you won't be able to eat it.

451
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:58,480
Why?

452
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,280
Is the wonton shop closing down?

453
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,480
This is my personal seal.

454
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:12,280
This is the key to the Bieyu House.

455
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,880
This is the key to the accounting room.

456
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,480
This is the key to Wentao Pavilion.

457
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,880
This is the key to the back door
of Wentao Pavilion.

458
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,640
This small one
unlocks the hidden compartment

459
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,880
in Bieyu Houseâ€™s bedroom

460
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,660
where the contracts are stored.

461
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:21,240
And this

462
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:24,000
is the jade pendant
Iâ€™ve worn since childhood.

463
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:24,760
No matter what

464
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,020
happens in the future,

465
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:28,000
take this to the Duke of Ping's Mansion.

466
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,600
Theyâ€™ll help you with
everything theyâ€™ve got.

467
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,280
W-What's wrong?

468
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:36,840
What happened?

469
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:43,920
Could it be

470
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,350
an incurable disease?

471
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,260
Hey, donâ€™t lose hope.

472
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,400
You are young and strong.

473
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,880
The imperial physicians are top-notch.

474
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,940
Thereâ€™s no illness they canâ€™t treat.

475
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,800
It's really bad luck lately.

476
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:58,000
Uncleâ€™s in trouble,
and now youâ€™re sick too.

477
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,080
I should choose an auspicious day

478
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,610
to go pray at Hanyan Temple.

479
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,460
I'm going to Lingzhou.

480
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,020
We'll leave tomorrow.

481
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,200
That's it?

482
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,520
Youâ€™re just going on a trip,

483
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,880
but youâ€™re acting like
youâ€™re entrusting me with your dying wish.

484
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:12,740
Let me be clear,

485
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,800
aside from Wentao Pavilion,

486
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,040
I canâ€™t help with anything else.

487
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,600
Take this jade pendant back.

488
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,520
Itâ€™s something youâ€™ve worn since young.

489
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,120
How can you just give it away?

490
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,280
Minmin, you have no idea.

491
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,760
The court sent Zhou Baoping to Lingzhou

492
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,320
to investigate the import tax evasion.

493
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,160
He was an upright official

494
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,960
but suddenly died in a brothel.

495
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,400
The official sent last year

496
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,520
has disappeared

497
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,600
before he arrived in Lingzhou.

498
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,600
His whereabouts are still unknown.

499
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,440
As for the official sent two years ago,

500
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,200
he went mad

501
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,360
for no reason

502
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,200
and started killing people.

503
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,060
He was beaten to death on the spot.

504
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,800
I don't know

505
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:44,600
how

506
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:45,920
Iâ€™ll die this time.

507
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,360
Young Lord Zhang, do you know

508
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:54,360
what kind of man

509
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,200
can win a womanâ€™s heart?

510
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,400
Most women like brave heroes

511
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,200
who stand up to power

512
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,000
and serve the country and the people.

513
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:05,640
Think about

514
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,120
the male leads in storybooks.

515
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:07,760
Arenâ€™t they

516
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,440
all righteous and fearless?

517
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,920
So Miss Bai

518
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,600
likes those kinds of men.

519
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:17,920
Good.

520
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,360
I will go to Lingzhou this time

521
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:22,480
to solve the problem for the court

522
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,740
and return in triumph.

I'm talking about most women.

524
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,880
What I like

525
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,210
is different from them.

526
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:31,840
Then...

527
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,760
what kind of man

528
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:35,360
do you like?

529
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,200
You still like Jingran.

530
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,240
But you and Jingran were never a match.

531
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,370
Zhang Huaiyu, are you out of your mind?

532
00:31:56,430 --> 00:31:57,200
When did I say

533
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,600
I like Second Young Master Shu?

534
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,280
I admire his talent.

535
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,080
Besides,

536
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:01,840
how can you say that

537
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,040
I don't match Jingran?

538
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,200
If even Jingran

539
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,160
isnâ€™t a match for me,

540

541
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:07,720

in Qingzhou at the time,

587
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,920
so he brought back

588
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,800
this local cloth tiger.

to Yangxi Prefecture,

I went to see him off.

595

to give him the cloth tiger.

he had kept it

who truly wants your Father dead?

610
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:33,000
Itâ€™s your husband, the Prince of Dingbei.

611
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,680
It was he who volunteered

612
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:36,760
to send the Dingbei Army

613
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,120
to escort your Father back to the capital.

614
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,480
And it was a soldier from the Dingbei Army

615
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,720
who helped the Marquis of Jing'an
escape by night.

616
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:43,640
They claim it was
the Prince of Dingbeiâ€™s order

617
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:45,040
to help the Marquis of Jing'an escape.

618
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,600
Heâ€™s using this

619
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,840
to cement

620
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,040
your Fatherâ€™s guilt

621
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,040
and distance himself from it all.

622
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,690
That's impossible.

623
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,520
Before your Father was convicted,

624
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,200
Prince of Dingbei already
led the Imperial Guards

625
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,280
to raid the Marquisâ€™ Mansion.

626
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,480
Why?

627
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,200
He clearly wanted to cut ties

628
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,480
and keep himself clean.

629
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,360
Tan.

630
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,640
Think about it.

631
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,440
Since your Fatherâ€™s arrest,

632
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,120
what has Jiang Xu done

633
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,400
for the Ming family?

634
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,600
Marquis of Jing'an has been
guarding the border for years.

635
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,480
He's diligent and
never makes a single mistake.

636
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,760
How could he cause such trouble

637
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,480
the moment he returned to the capital?

638
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,520
Since they haven't found out the truth,

639
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:21,240
why did they raid

640
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,640
the Marquis of Jing'an's Mansion?

641
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:23,920
Haven't you heard?

642
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,280
Today, the Prince of Dingbei

643
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:28,040
brought the Imperial Guards
to confiscate the mansion.

644
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,370
He must be afraid of implicating himself.

645
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:33,160
That's why he volunteered

646
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,880
to raid it in advance

647
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,600
to prove his innocence.

648
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:39,800
Why did the Imperial Guards
raid the mansion?

649
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,960
Is it His Majesty's order

650
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:45,880
or Prince's order?

651
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,920
He truly was a soldier.

652
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:54,120
Afterwards, His Highness,
knowing his family was poor,

653
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:56,250
gave him an additional compensation.

654
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,040
Father said

655
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:16,850
if even the Prince of Dingbei

656
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,800
canâ€™t protect someone in Xian,

657
00:38:21,350 --> 00:38:24,640
no one else can.

658
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:30,680
But I never thought

659
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,560
my marriage

660
00:38:37,170 --> 00:38:39,640
would turn into
Fatherâ€™s death sentence.

661
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,550
What does it have to do with you?

662
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:42,760
This is not Uncle's fault,

663
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:43,920
nor your fault.

664
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:44,840
The real fault

665
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:45,840
lies with those corrupt men

666
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,560
fighting for power.

667
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,400
No.

668
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,700
I canâ€™t just sit here and wait.

669
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,280
I'm on my own.

I still have so many things

673
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:07,040
I havenâ€™t said to him.

674
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:13,600
Donâ€™t panic.

I will think of a way.

677
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:27,600
Uncle.

678
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:28,240
Hurry!

679
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,320
Old man, how is it going?

680
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,680
Everythingâ€™s arranged.

681
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:40,400
Luckily, His Majesty
ordered the Imperial Guards

682
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,520
to handle the prison.

683
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,540
So that I can make it.

684
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,120
Otherwise, even I

685
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,980
wouldnâ€™t have been able to get in.

686
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,560
But...

687
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:51,600
Do you have

688
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:52,840
any difficulties?

689
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,280
If you really can't do it...

690
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,000
No.

691
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,320
The jailer said

692
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:02,300
your Father

693
00:40:02,330 --> 00:40:04,160
refused to see you.

694
00:40:05,930 --> 00:40:08,280
W-What do you mean?

695
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,880
He wonâ€™t see me

696
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:12,200
or he wonâ€™t see anyone?

697
00:40:12,530 --> 00:40:14,360
Tan. Donâ€™t worry.

698
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,640
Donâ€™t think too much.

699
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:16,480
I think

700
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:18,270
your Father didn't want you

701
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:19,840
to see him in such a mess.

702
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,160
Old man.

703
00:40:27,330 --> 00:40:28,410
Forget it.

704
00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:29,540
Forget what he wants.

705
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:31,410
If you want to see him, let's meet him.

706
00:40:31,410 --> 00:40:32,410
Once it gets dark,

707
00:40:32,890 --> 00:40:34,810
weâ€™ll go in when the two shifts

708
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:36,520
of the Imperial Guards switch.

709
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:38,650
But we only have time for one cup of tea.

710
00:40:40,970 --> 00:40:42,250
You shouldnâ€™t go.

711
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,920
-Me?
-It'll draw attention.

712
00:40:43,950 --> 00:40:45,090
Uncle has always cared for me.

713
00:40:45,090 --> 00:40:46,090
I have to meet him.

714
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:47,840
Fine.

715
00:40:48,090 --> 00:40:49,410
When we go in later,

716
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:50,630
stay close behind me.

717
00:40:50,970 --> 00:40:52,270
Don't look around.

718
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:53,320
Donâ€™t give yourself away.

719
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:53,850
Let's go.

720
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,240
That's the plan.

721
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:01,060
Before 1 a.m.,

722
00:41:01,490 --> 00:41:03,490
Yuâ€™s convoy must leave the capital.

723
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,000
Yes.

724
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:06,670
But

725
00:41:07,070 --> 00:41:09,400
Young Lord Zhang doesn't know about this.

726
00:41:09,490 --> 00:41:11,120
If something happens on the way,

727
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,090
can I tell him?

728
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:13,720
Only if absolutely necessary.

729
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:15,760
The fewer people know, the better.

730
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:18,200
Yes.

731
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:19,760
I'll arrange

732
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,020
the secret guards now.

733
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:21,640
Wait.

734
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:25,800
Go deliver a message to Chancellor Su

735
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,860
in the name of the Marquis of Jing'an.

736
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:36,920
Chancellor.

737
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:39,590
Marquis of Jing'an sent word from prison.

738
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:41,450
He wished to see you one last time.

739
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:58,400
Why are you still frowning?

740
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:03,720
I never wanted to go

741
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,200
against the Ming family.

742
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:12,240
But Ming Tingyuan

743
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:14,000
was too stubborn.

744
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:18,560
I've known him for more than 20 years.

745
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:21,830
Even though he always refused

746
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:23,520
to openly support

747
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:25,920
the Su family,

748
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:31,160
I always treated him the same.

749
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,240
He shouldnâ€™t

750
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:41,520
marry Tan

751
00:42:42,950 --> 00:42:45,080
to Prince of Dingbei.

752
00:42:54,690 --> 00:42:56,080
His Majesty has ordered Young Lord Zhang

753
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:57,040
to Lingzhou

754
00:42:57,710 --> 00:42:59,910
to investigate the import tax evasion.

755
00:43:00,030 --> 00:43:01,940
Tax revenue is Lingzhouâ€™s lifeline.

756
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:03,870
Chancellor, you should make plans

757
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:05,920
to take precautions.

758
00:43:15,350 --> 00:43:17,350
These are all your favorite dishes.

759
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:18,920
Iâ€™ve kept this wine

760
00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:20,620
sealed for twenty years.

761
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,560
We only really drank up

762
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:25,760
on the night of Tan's wedding.

763
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:27,980
Who wouldâ€™ve thought
that the next time we met,

764
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:30,600
itâ€™d be like this?

765
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:33,680
What is there for you to sigh about?
