Sir,

24
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,840
since what happened to Marquis of Jing'an,

25
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,079
outside Prince of Dingbei's Mansion,

26
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:45,200
there have been people from Haiyou Sect

27
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,329
secretly watching.

28
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,320
It's been days.

29
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:50,540
Should we eliminate them?

30
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,640
How many?

31
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,520
Two.

32
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,460
Chancellor Su is suspicious.

33
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,680
The more clearly they see,

34
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,610
the more convinced he'll be

35
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:07,040
that there's nothing suspicious
about Father-in-law's death.

36
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,920
Have Zhuifeng and Zhuiyu

37
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,800
continue to secretly protect Tan.

38
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,080
Don't alert them.

39
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,560
Yes.

40
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,860
You can't bear
to see Her Highness heartbroken,

41
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,820
so you can only endure in silence.

42
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,200
But now that it's over,

43
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,200
why don't you tell her the truth?

44
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:30,930
Telling her now

45
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,520
might relieve her pain for a moment.

46
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,680
But should this plan go awry,

47
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,140
it could lead to irreparable consequences.

48
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,440
So we can only let Her Highness

49
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,760

clearly shows

53
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,400
he still harbors doubts about this matter.

54
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:50,760

During the days at the Court of Review,

73
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,200
Chancellor, you've suffered.

74
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,730
Rest assured, Chancellor.

75
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,640
After the Minister of Justice
learned about this matter,

76
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,320
he started an investigation personally.

77
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,440
Since the Court of Review

78
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,520
closed the case with the conclusion
that the prisoner took his own life,

79
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,880
there should be no further complications.

80
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,560
Prince of Dingbei lured me into his trap.

81
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,050
How could he not have a backup plan?

82
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,200
These days,

83
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,320
has there been anything unusual
at Prince of Dingbei's Mansion?

84
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,320
Since that night,

85
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,330
people from Haiyou Sect

86
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:22,120
have been closely watching
Prince of Dingbei's Mansion.

87
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,120
Nothing unusual has been observed.

88
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,130
But that's precisely what puzzles me.

89
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,960
Given Prince of Dingbei's methods,

90
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,760
he would never resort to mere trickery.

91
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,640
If his goal was to frame you

92
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,520
with such a crude means,

93
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,200
that's like disturbing the grass
only to startle the snake.

94
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,560
An act that gains him nothing, right?

95
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,870
Are you suggesting

96
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,640
this trap

97
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:45,000
was never meant to convict me

98
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,320
of poisoning?

99
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,120
Then what was his true purpose?

100
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,520
Steamed buns for sale!

101
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,720
Big, fragrant, and sweet steamed buns!

102
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,330
Miss, how about two?

103
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,440
Try my steamed buns.

104
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,360
A time-honored brand, honest and fair.

105
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:06,880
We use

106
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,200
only the finest wheat flour.

107
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,200
Two coins each.

108
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,520
Miss, don't go!

109
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,200
Miss, how about a bowl of noodles?

110
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,320
The broth is rich.

111
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,240
The noodles are chewy.

112
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,000
The shredded chicken inside

113
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,400
is tender and delicious.

114
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,280
Why are you following me?

115
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,800
I apologize

116
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,940
for offending you.

117
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,000
You almost fell into the water,

118
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,120
so I helped you.

119
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,450
How was that an offense?

120
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,680
You're right.

121
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,760
Thank you for saving me.

122
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,000
Then can you tell me

123
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,650
why you've been following me

124
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,680
all the way from East Market Street?

125
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,210
You misunderstood.

126
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,000
I happened to see you just now

127
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,880
and thought we are acquainted,

128
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,280
so I should greet you.

129
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,320
But I couldn't find

130
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,780
the right moment to speak.

131
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,940
So I followed you all the way here.

132
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:33,799
How are we acquainted?

133
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:35,740
At the relief hall,

134
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,440
when you handed out roast chicken
to the children,

135
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,880
I was there too.

136
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,620
We even exchanged a few words.

137
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:45,320
Well, you've greeted me.

138
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,200
You can leave.

139
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,210
Roast chicken. Roast chicken.

140
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,320
Hot and fresh daily.

141
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,200
You've wandered
both East and West Markets today.

142
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,600
What are you looking for?

143
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,300
Something delicious.

144
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,280
What kind of delicious food?

145
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,440
Sweet? Glutinous?

146
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,960
Light? Strong-flavored?

147
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,290
Perhaps I can make a few recommendations.

148
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,560
Her Highness doesn't like strong flavors.

149
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,280
She prefers sweet and glutinous things.

150
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,280
But lately, her appetite hasn't been good.

151
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,680
Some soup or porridge might be better.

152
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,710
You're buying food for Her Highness?

153
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,800
Her Highness lost her father.

154
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,680
She's heartbroken.

155
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,480
She hasn't eaten for three days.

156
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,810
What happened to the Ming family

157
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:34,460
has chilled many hearts.

158
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,320
His Lordship risked his life for Xian,

159
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,440
only to meet such an end.

160
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,440
Sir, come and try my meat buns.

161
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,960
Do you have a way to help the Ming family?

162
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,100
I'd better continue searching for food.

163
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,430
Using delicious food

164
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:54,450
to heal a broken heart

165
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:55,410
is not baseless.

166
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,200
Every plant and every taste

167
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,080
in this world

168
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,440
hold their own charm.

169
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,010
As they say, everything is lovable,

170
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:02,080
and everything has a soul.

171
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,790
The warmth of daily life comforts

172
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:04,840
people's hearts the most.

173
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,300
That's exactly the basis.

174
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,670
Why are you looking at me?

175
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,230
You always use

176
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:15,590
such flowery language?

177
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,510
What I meant is

178
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:20,790
tasty food can indeed soothe our hearts.

179
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,250
Then tell me,

180
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,480
what kinds of food

181
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,540
can soothe hearts?

182
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:28,800
Over there.

183
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,800
Youchang's pancakes.

184
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,960
Crispy, fragrant, and sweet.

185
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,000
And on the east side of the bridge,

186
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,080
there's a dumpling shop—

187
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,070
quite famous.

188
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,480
Their dumplings are thin-skinned
and full of filling,

189
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,560
with rich broth.

190
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,080
And...

191
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:38,660
Enough.

192
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,340
Mr. Flowery, please lead the way.

193
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,680
Sure, please.

194
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,060
Your Highness,

195
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,160
have a bite at least.

196
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,040
If you continue like this,

198
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,980
how can your body take it?

199
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,280
Yeah.

200
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,600
Yun Yi

201
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,720
waited in line

202
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,040
to buy these for you specially.

203
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,770
She doesn't know what you like,

204
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,130
so she bought one of everything she could.

205
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:17,110
Sorry for making you worried these days.

206
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,160
I'm fine.

207
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:21,440
I just don't have much appetite.

208
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,320
I'm sure Uncle

209
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,370
wouldn't want to see you like this.

210
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,960
If you feel sad,

211
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,560
just cry freely.

212
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,600
Or if you want to go somewhere,

213
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,440
see someone,

214
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,160
or do something,

215
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,280
we'll go with you.

216
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,020
But you can't swallow

217
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,310
all your grief alone.

218
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,370
If this continues,

219
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:43,770
it will make you fall ill.

220
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,150
I'm so worried.

221
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,340
Your Highness,

222
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,840
I've never told you this.

223
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:00,800
Since I could remember things,

224
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,930
I've been an orphan.

225
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,880
I didn't know who my parents were

226
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,290
or what a home was like.

227
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,690
And I didn't know

228
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,560
where I truly belonged.

229
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,620
In those years,

230
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,960
I wandered from place to place,

231
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,420
with no place to call home.

232
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,840
What I remember most vividly is

233
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,020
I had no one to rely on when it was cold.

234
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,800
And when I was hungry,

235
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,960
I had no food to eat.

236
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:32,850
At that time, I really thought

237
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,800
the world was just that cold.

238
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,740
But after joining the Jinyun Guards,

239
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:41,790
I realized something.

240
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,910
There must be warmth

241
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:48,320
and light in this world.

00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,320

wanted to arrange a marriage for you?

This is important.

298

Your wife's matter is important,

299
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,090
but my marriage

300
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:38,110
is not important?

301
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,680
I've got an idea.

302
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:48,080
Winning her heart
comes down to three key moves.

303
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,800
First, cook for her.

304
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,800
Second, help raise the children.

305
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,380
Well said. You've outshone me.

306
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:59,360
But Xu, you are not much of a cook,

307
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,080
and you and she have no children.

308
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,960
You can only cater to her pleasure

309
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,040
and never give up.

310
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,860
How to cater to her pleasure?

311
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,740
That means

312
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,960
everything Her Highness likes...

313
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,840
You must like them too.

314
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,720
Everything Her Highness wants to do...

315
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,320
You do it with her.

316
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,440
As the saying goes: stand by
your friends through thick and thin.

317

-That's right.
-That's right.

322
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:20,910
Your Highness,
it doesn't look like you're pruning.

323
00:17:21,349 --> 00:17:22,950
More like cutting the roots.

324

It's better to be harsh
than to let things slide.

325
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,340
Perhaps I've grown too used to it.

326
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,360

327

the new buds.

328
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,480

Why don't you let me do it?

332
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,340
Why is tending flowers and plants

333
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,770

I'll surely find a way

Your Highness,
I want to buy a roast chicken.

377
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,520

you like roast chickens too?

00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:39,750
I came here because of its reputation.

But unfortunately,

00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,010
I'm not fated to try the roast chicken.

419
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,550
He's so strange.

420
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,970
He talked about fate with a roast chicken?

421
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:02,880
Are you really giving it to me?

422
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,160
Because last time,

423
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:04,760
you took me to buy

424
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,050
those delicious food.

425
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,040
I can't give you any more.

426
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,700
I only have one roast chicken.

427
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,600
Thank you, Miss Chicken Leg.

428
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,330
Eat.

429
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,960
Eat it while it's hot.

430
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,290
It tastes best that way.

431
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:23,590
Okay.

432
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,260
Tender, juicy, and not greasy at all.

433
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,130
It's definitely worth trying.

434

This shop's roast chicken is indeed good.

435
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:35,950

436

what His Highness makes

437

is much better.

439
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,410

441
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,480
know your name?

442
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,690
My name is Yun Yi.

443
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,600
I'm a concubine
in Prince of Dingbei's Mansion.

444
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,480

I'm leaving first.

448

They only sell fifty
roast chickens per day.

449
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:15,210
If you want to eat it,
you'd better come early.

450
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:26,370
When did Xu take a concubine?

451
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,390
Tan, I found a merchant

452
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:42,270
selling particularly exquisite jewelry

453
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:43,760
a few days.

454
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,290
You'll definitely like it.
It's right there.

455
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,000
Ladies,

456
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,860
take a look and
see if anything catches your eye.

457
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,900
The design of this hairpin

458
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:01,000
is indeed unique.

459
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,160
I suppose it's quite expensive.

460
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,840
You ladies are elegant.

461
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,720
You two have exceptional taste.

462
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,010
This hairpin is of the finest quality.

463
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,400
The gems on it are of excellent quality.

464
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,480
If you wear it,

465
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:15,850
you'd surely look like
a fairy descending from the heavens.

466
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,530
The totem on it

467
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,960
looks quite unique as well.

468
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,390
It doesn't seem to be from Xian.

469
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,570
May I ask

470
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,130
where does this jewelry come from?

471
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,620
How can I reveal that?

472
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,250
If everyone knew

473
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,440
the source of my goods,

474
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,890
how could I make a profit?

475
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,150
I suppose these jewelry

476
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,800
were all transported by sea, weren't they?

477
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,280
I can see they have

478
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:52,360
clear signs of saltwater corrosion.

479
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,440
They can't be sold for
a high price like this.

480
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,440
To be honest,

481
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:56,850
these goods

482
00:24:56,890 --> 00:24:58,710
did indeed come by sea.

483
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,440
That's what makes them
even more extraordinary.

484
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,350
Here in Xian,

485
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:02,910
they are truly one of a kind.

486
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,580
If you ladies like any of them,

487
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,000
I won't charge a high price.

488
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,680
Consider it as making a friend.

489
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,780
In the future, when I have good items,

490
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:10,380
I'll save them for you first.

491
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:12,680
Then I'll take all of these.

492
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,030
What? Are you serious?

493
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,960
If you get new designs in the future,

494
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,360
you must save them for me first.

495
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,960
Miss, you're truly
a straightforward person.

496
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,760
Boss Minmin,

497
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:22,810
Buy.

498
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,480
Wearing these jewelry pieces out

499
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,810
is indeed presentable.

500
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,850
However, your stall

501
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,410
might not be here every day.

502
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,600
How will I find you in the future?

503
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,500
I live in

504
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:35,880
the Datong Inn on the street.

505
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:36,880
My surname is Zhu.

506
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:39,850
I'll be setting up my stall here
for the next few days.

507
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,440
Tan, your taste is truly excellent.

508
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,260
You were just asking about

509
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,440
where the merchant lives.

510
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,680
Are you planning to establish
a long-term partnership with him?

511
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,920
These kinds of accessories

512
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,920
won't take long to

513
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:56,360
become popular in the capital.

514
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,570
The business of Cuojin Pavilion

515
00:25:57,570 --> 00:25:59,300
will surely reach new heights.

516
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:00,960
If that happens,

517
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:03,500
Cuojin Pavilion will shut down for good.

518
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,960
The prince's mansion will suffer
the consequences as well.

519
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:07,960
Why is that?

520
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,760
The patterns on these pieces

521
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,400
and the designs

522
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:14,180
are definitely not from Xian.

523
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:16,240
I suspect they were smuggled in.

524
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,680
So you were deliberately asking

525
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,680
about that person's residence earlier.

526
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,090
You learned he's staying at an inn

527
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:24,680
and doesn't plan to settle down.

528
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,880
It seems he intends to

529
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,500
finish this batch of business

530
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:28,960
and then move on to another place.

531
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:29,870
Then these items

532
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:31,010
must be illegal.

533
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,360
Father's case

534
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:35,680
was because it involved

535
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,610
smuggled goods.

536
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,040
That led the court

537
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,500
to convict him of treason.

538
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:42,400
Since these goods have already
made their way to the capital,

539
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,330
it shows this isn't the first time.

540
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,760
I suspect someone's
making a profit off this,

541
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:47,960
and framing my father

542
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,960
for smuggling.

543
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,050
But even so,

544
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,560
it doesn't prove

545
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:56,710
that Uncle has nothing to do with this.

546
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,450
These items all came by sea,

547
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,440
and the only route for maritime trade

548
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,990
in Xian was through

549
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,070
Lingzhou.

550
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:20,680
Your Highness.

551
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,030
Two deserters from Yangxi Prefecture

552
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:23,230
have come to meet you.

553
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:27,280
They claim to be former subordinates
of the Marquis of Jing'an.

554
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,080
Bring them in.

555
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:29,800
Bring them in!

556
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:38,100
Greetings, Your Highness.

557
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,120
Please rise and speak.

558
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,580
Thank you, Your Highness.

559
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,360
Your Highness, we are

560
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,200
former subordinates
of the Marquis of Jing'an.

561
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,400
When Guo Bingmao took office,

562
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,040
he used the excuse of military
training to eliminate his enemies.

563
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,760
Those who opposed him in the past

564
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,450
have all been beaten to death.

565
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,640
We had no choice but to escape

566
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:56,990
during the chaos.

567
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,360
We've come to see you

568
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,400
because we can't bear to
see the Marquis of Jing'an die unjustly,

569
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,240
and we hope you

570
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,960
will thoroughly investigate
the Lizhou case.

571
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:04,790
You two

572
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,360
also participated
in the Lizhou expedition?

573
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,200
Yes.

574
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,200
We've been following
His Lordship for a long time

575
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,860
and known his character well.

576
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:13,280
When we were in Lizhou,

577
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,520
the recruitment of civilians
for disaster relief

578
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,360
was entirely voluntary.

579
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,760
However, after the incident,

580
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,440
many civilians claimed they had been

581
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,480
forced by
the soldiers of Yangxi Prefecture.

582
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,280
So we secretly investigated,

583
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,520
and found

584
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,200
that those few reckless soldiers

585
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,000
had all been promoted by Guo Bingmao.

586
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,600
There must be some hidden truth
in this matter.

587
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,520
Guo Bingmao holds so much power

588
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,860
in Yangxi Prefecture.

589
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,410
We truly had no other choice

590
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,440
but to come and seek refuge
with you.

591
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,400
You two

592
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,920
can stay in the camp for now.

593
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,240
First, tend to your wounds.

594
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,300
What you have said,

595
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,680
I will investigate.

596
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,680
Thank you, Your Highness.

597
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:48,940
I'll take my leave.

598
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,180
Investigate these two men's
backgrounds thoroughly.

599
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:57,660
If what they say is true,

600
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,640
Yangxi Prefecture abandoned them,

601
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,360
but the Dingbei Army can keep them.

602
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:01,960
Yes.

603
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,100
Your Highness.

604
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,040
Your Highness.

605
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:08,440
A message from the palace.
His Majesty urgently summons you.

606
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:13,190
[Wentao Pavilion]

607
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,520
We specially invited Commander Lu to come

608
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,180
because we have a favor to ask.

609
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,440
Whatever it is, Your Highness,
please feel free to ask.

610
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:20,170
There's no need to be so polite.

611
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,000
I would like to ask you

612
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,760
to help me put on a show.

613
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,480
Young Master.

614
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:35,580
Take a look and see if
anything catches your eye.

615
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:37,760
This is good.

616
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:38,880
The agate on this

617
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,280
is of excellent quality.

618
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,100
Arrest him.

619

This...

620
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,440
What are you doing?

621
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,370
Do you know

622
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:49,100
the penalty for selling smuggled goods?

623
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,760
I'm just running a small business.

624
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,880
What smuggling? I know nothing about it.

625
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,840
Confiscate the goods and take him away.

626
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,640
Take him away.

627
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,800
I-Is there no justice?

628
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,680
This...

629
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,800
Speak.

630
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,930
Where did these smuggled goods come from?

631
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,400
It's a misunderstanding,
a huge misunderstanding.

632
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,010
What smuggled goods?

633
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,360
These were all items

634
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,400
I bought them with my own money.

635
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,840
These goods are legitimate.

636
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:15,240
You can't just make baseless accusations.

637
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,680
Sir, who are you really?

638
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,240
If you're after money,

639
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,200
please let me go.

640
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,360
I'll get the money for you right away.

641
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,600
Right. But I'm not

642
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,760
after your little money.

643
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,200
Tell me who

644
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,160
your supplier is.

645
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,330
Then I'll let you go.

646
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:33,600
Otherwise, I'll chop you up right now.

647
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,610
Looks like you won't cry
until you see the coffin.

648
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,200
Cut off his hand.

649

Let's see how long he can endure.

650
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:49,680
No, you can't!

651

Please don't!

00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,360
I'll tell you.

It's a jewelry shop in Lingzhou.

654
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,240
It's called Fu Lu Gold Store.

655
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,160
The owner's surname is Luo.

656
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:01,690
He sent someone to supply me
with these goods.

657
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,530
Should've said so earlier.

658

00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,660
Empress, please don't be too anxious.

681
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,440
I share your feelings.

682
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,980
The current news only says

683
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,760
that his whereabouts are unknown, right?

684
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:14,360
Well...

685
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:16,880
No news

686
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,960
can be considered good news, right?

687
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:21,680
Your Majesty.

688
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,880
Yu hasn't married or had children yet.

689
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,280
If something really happened to him,

690
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:26,130
how can I

691
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,690
explain this to my parents?

692
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:31,960
Your Majesty.

693
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:33,920
I was the one who strongly recommended Yu

694
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:34,920
to go to Lingzhou.

695
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,530
I cannot escape the blame for this matter.

696
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,620
I have decided to
go to Lingzhou personally.

697
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:41,880
Whether alive or dead,

698
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,200
I will bring Yu back.

699
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,860
You want to go to Lingzhou?

700
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,010
For the past few months,

701
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:50,480
I've been investigating
the Lizhou matter.

702
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,210
And I suspect

703
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,760
someone in Yangxi Prefecture
has become disloyal.

704
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,120
Your Majesty, do you remember

705
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,960
who recommended Guo Bingmao

706
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:00,920
to take charge of
the disaster relief in Lizhou?

707
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,440
The situation at court
is already unfavorable.

708
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:07,240
Lingzhou is the only breakthrough.

709
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,240
Moreover, the Lizhou case

710
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,700
involves smuggled goods.

711
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,960
I'm afraid Lingzhou's problem

712
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,290
is not just about taxes.

713
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,520
I must go.

714
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:25,320
[Qi'an Hall]

715
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:48,480
Your Highness, the food is getting cold.

716
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,160
Why don't you start eating first?

717
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,280
Once Princess Consort returns,

718
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,140
I'll have someone bring the food.

719
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:08,659
Your Highness.

720
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,080
Are you concerned about
Princess Consort

721
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:12,880
because of the trip to Lingzhou?

722
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,159
If I suggest

723
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,170
taking her with me to Lingzhou,

724
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:22,719
as a way to

725
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:24,639
get her mind off things,

726
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,560
do you think she would agree?

727
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:29,139
Your Highness, why don't you ask her?

728
00:34:29,139 --> 00:34:31,670
It might be just what
Princess Consort wants.

729
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,340
It's better not to.

730
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:35,920
This trip to Lingzhou
is filled with danger.

731
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:38,250
It's best not to involve her
in such risks.

732
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,280
Today, the kitchen

733
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,280
made your favorite White Jade Soup.

734
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,440
After a day of shopping,

735
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,500
you must be hungry.

736
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,400
Why don't you

737
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,560
have a meal with me?

738
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:57,690
No need.

739
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,040
Something has happened to Yu in Lingzhou.

740
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,100
I need to go there as soon as possible.

741
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,300
While I'm away,

742
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,160
you must take good care of yourself.

743
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,120
Eat well and sleep soundly every day.

744
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,400
Don't worry too much.

745
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:20,720
If you go out, be extra careful.

746
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:23,820
Have Yun Yi stay
by your side at all times.

747
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,330
How is Young Lord Zhang's
current situation?

748
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,020
The situation is unclear.

749
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:31,840
I've already sent secret guards
to investigate in advance.

750
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,880
Once military affairs
are properly arranged,

751
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,940
I will immediately head to Lingzhou.

752
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,570
Can you

753
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,920
eat this meal with me

754
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:43,680
as a farewell?

755
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:49,750
I'm going with you.

756
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,570
Your Highness, everything is packed.

757
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,960
You may leave.

758
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,360
-Yes.
-Yes.

759
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:15,500
Tan.

760
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:19,600
Do you think Zhang Huaiyu is still alive?

761
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:25,490
His Highness has always been close to him.

762
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,360
Is there no definite news?

763
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,440
The most important thing
for his trip to Lingzhou

764
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,440
is to get to the bottom of this matter.

765
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,440
He has already sent secret guards

766
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,480
to go ahead.

767
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:36,560
Once there's news,
they'll inform us right away.

768
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,800
Don't worry too much.

769
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,240
The previous report from the secret guards

770
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,800
said he was missing.

771
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,280
At least it means that Young Lord Zhang

772
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,610
hasn't fallen into the hands of the enemy.

773
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:48,840
But Minmin,

774
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:51,890
are you concerned about Young Lord Zhang?

775
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:53,520
I...

776
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,100
Just...

777
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,080
Just...

778
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,920
Because we're business partners after all.

779
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,160
Whether he's alive or dead,

780
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,690
I should show some concern.

781
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,360
Besides, the Wentao Pavilion

782
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,880
is such a back-breaking business.

783
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,960
I don't want to handle it all by myself.

784
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,440
Naturally, I hope he comes back soon.

785
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:16,160
I've ordered Zhuiying to depart early.

786
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,190
He'll head to Lingzhou and make contact

787
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:18,360
with the secret guards around Yu.

788
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,260
The last message from the Jinyun Guards

789
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:20,240
was sent from

790
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,700
a remote area in Lingzhou.

791
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,560
It seems Yu has already escaped

792
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:25,220
from the Su family's pursuit.

793
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,020
I wonder if Yu is out of danger.

794
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,400
The Su family

795
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:31,520
truly controls everything in Lingzhou.

796
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,600
They disregard the Emperor's authority

797
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,330
and are bent on eliminating Yu.

798
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,220
This time,

799
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,040
the Su family will certainly
keep a close watch.

800
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,160
Before entering Lingzhou,

801
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,920
our people must act low-key

802
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,120
and conceal our movements
as much as possible.

803
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:47,240
Tan, do you really want to go with

804
00:37:47,270 --> 00:37:48,730
His Highness to Lingzhou?

805
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,160
From childhood,

806
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,280
except for Hanyan Temple,

807
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,960
you've never left the capital.

808
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:53,960
This trip to Lingzhou

809
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,720
is a long journey, full of hardships.

810
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:57,280
Can your body handle it?

811
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:58,880
I've made up my mind,

812
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,500
so I'm not afraid of these things.

813
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,320
This trip will take
at least several months.

814
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,300
Leaving me alone here

815
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:06,480
in the capital.

816
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,280
I really don't want you to leave.

817
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,280
I'll be back soon.

818
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,400
However, it's been so long,

819
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,600
and you still won't

820
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:17,550
resolve things with His Highness?

821
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:20,120
Just treat this trip as a vacation.

822
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:23,100
It's better than
staying in the mansion anyway.

823
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:24,960
I've heard that in Lingzhou,

824
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,240
there are 180 pavilions

825
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,370
built along the water.

826
00:38:27,370 --> 00:38:29,000
Small boats travel back and forth,

827
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,750
and the women there
are graceful and beautiful,

828
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:32,880
with every kind of figure imaginable.

829
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,160
It's good that you're going too.

830
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:36,020
To prevent His Highness

831
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:37,160
from suddenly bringing back a girl.

832
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:39,690
At least there'll be
no surprise concubines.

833
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,580
If he really falls into a love affair,

834
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:45,500
I will find

835
00:38:45,530 --> 00:38:46,930
my own place in the world.

836
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:49,050
Becoming single again

837
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,100
would be a kind of liberation.

838
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,480
But a mutual divorce is not an option.

839
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:56,000
I must be the one to
give him a letter of divorce

840
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,880
to preserve my dignity.

841
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,880
Writing a divorce letter to His Highness?

842
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:04,120
I have never heard of that before.

843
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,920
If it really comes to that,

844
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,140
I'm already prepared.

845
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,520
I was just joking.

846
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,320
You're really considering it?

847
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,680
If it really comes to that,

848
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,040
you don't need to prepare anything.

849
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:19,920
Of course, I'd prepare

850
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,440
to send someone to Hanyan Temple

851
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,600
to tear down that promise-breaker...

852
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,000
No, no, no!

853
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,000
Your Highness, have you
packed your clothes?

854
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Should I load it into the carriages?

855
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:43,120
Your Highness, you usually travel

856
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,800
with light luggage.

857
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Why the big change this time?

858
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,160
I've served in this household

859
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,600
for most of my life.

860
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,560
I've seen the previous
Princess Consort's travel arrangements

861
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:53,000
quite a few times.

862
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:55,040
But such a grand arrangement

863
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,880
is truly unheard of.

864
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:04,820
[Prince of Dingbei's Mansion]

865
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:04,500
Your Highness.

866
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:06,470
I've checked all the luggage.

867
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:09,440
Qizhi.

868
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:10,800
Are these

869
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,760
all the luggage we need to bring?

870
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,560
Princess Consort needs five carriages

871
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,020
for a trip to Hanyan Temple

872
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:18,320
The journey to Lingzhou is long,

873
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,960
so I naturally wanted to prepare for her

874
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:20,820
and plan ahead.

875
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:26,120
One, two, three, four, five,

876
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,720
six, seven, eight.

877
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,120
Ten carriages.

878
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:35,520
You handled this matter quite well.

879
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:36,440
When Tan goes out,

880
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:39,100
there should be
proper arrangements like this.

881
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,480
This is the luggage list

882
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,080
that the prince personally
prepared for Your Highness.

883
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,360
Whatever you need on the journey,

884
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,960
just check the numbers
marked on the carriages,

885
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,880
and you can easily get it.

886
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:52,640
Your Highness, please check

887
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:53,970
if anything is missing.

888
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:54,930
I'll go fetch it.

889
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,440
I never noticed before,

890
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,840
but Qizhi is truly good
at managing things.

891
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,440
I wonder how all this luggage

892
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,700
has been categorized.

893
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,160
This first carriage

894
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:18,400
is for them to travel in.

895
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,000
Lingzhou is far,
and the weather will be scorching.

896
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,360
They'll need ice along the way.

897
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:22,880
Therefore, an ice container
has been prepared inside.

898
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:23,640
The curtains at the doors and windows

899
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:25,120
have all been lined with ice silk.

900
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:26,840
There are also bamboo curtains outside.

901
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,000
Sitting inside,

902
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,240
you won't feel the sun

903
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:30,970
and feel cool and comfortable.

904
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:32,460
There's a multi-compartment box
on the table

905
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:34,480
for storing items you might need at hand.

906
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,880
Soft cushions have been laid on the couch,

907
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:36,560
and the top layer

908
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,020
is made of ice silk fabric.

909
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,090
Sitting on it won't feel stifling.

910
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:41,600
Except for the last empty carriage,

911
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:44,340
[Prince of Dingbei's Mansion]

912
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:42,880
the other carriages are

913
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,540
clothes, utensils, and food.

914
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:45,960
Princess Consort's clothes and accessories

915
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:46,960
are luxurious and delicate,

916
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:47,920
so they need to be stored carefully

917
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,360
to prevent wrinkling and dampness.

918
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,880
Therefore, His Highness
specifically instructed

919
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,250
that all carriages carrying clothes

920
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:54,310
should be sealed with leather paper.

921
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:55,220
Additionally,

922
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,790
the carriages carrying utensils

923
00:41:56,790 --> 00:41:59,990
should be padded with
quilts and such to prevent shaking.

924
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:01,360
Take

925
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:02,960
the 42 boxes later.

926
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:03,800
Don't forget anything.

927
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:04,120
Yes.

928
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:06,360
Also, Princess Consort's soft jade pillow

929
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,640
should be brought along as well.

930
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:08,290
Yes.

931
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:10,480
Tan. You’ve truly

932
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:11,960
married a thoughtful husband.

933
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,760
It truly saves you a lot of worry.

934
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:17,080
Upon learning that Her Highness
would be going to Lingzhou,

935
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:19,600
His Highness not only
personally selected the caravan,

936
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:21,640
but also counted the luggage

937
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,160
to ensure

938
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:24,520
Her Highness's comfort

939
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:26,400
during the long journey.

940
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:28,600
Look at this grand setup.

941
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:29,320
Those who don't know

942
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:30,600
might think our Prince

943
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:31,840
is going to take over Lingzhou

944
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:32,970
and never come back.

945
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:37,040
Packing luggage is reasonable,

946
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:39,120
but why bring an empty carriage?

947
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:41,760
Lingzhou is a thriving commercial hub,

948
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,860
home to rare treasures in Xian.

949
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:45,160
With an empty carriage,

950
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:46,890
she can buy whatever she likes,

951
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,800
whether for personal use or as souvenirs.

952
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,260
No need to worry about
how to bring them back.

953
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:53,640
Qizhi's thinking is thorough.

954
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:55,270
I am extremely impressed.

955
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:57,210
No wonder you were the first to marry

956
00:42:57,210 --> 00:42:58,320
among us.

957
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:00,860
We were all showing off before,

958
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:03,280
but from now on, when
it comes to married life

959
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:05,000
and the rules of loving my wife,

960
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,960
I will have to

961
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,440
learn more from Qizhi.

962
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:13,280
In the past, our travels
were always short distances.

963
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,920
The scale of the entourage
didn't matter much.

964
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,840
But this time, we're traveling far
to Lingzhou.

965
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:19,840
It's quite inconvenient like this.

966
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:21,500
Xu, please

967
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:23,460
reduce the carriages to just two.

968
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:25,440
One is for me.

969
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:27,520
The other is for you.
