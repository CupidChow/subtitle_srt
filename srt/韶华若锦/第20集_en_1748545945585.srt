1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
little bit of a

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
little bit of a

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
little bit of a

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
little bit of a

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
little bit of a

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
little bit of a

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
little bit of a

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
little bit of a

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
little bit of a

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
little bit of a

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
little bit of a

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
little bit of a

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
little bit of a

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
little bit

16
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
little bit

17
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
little bit

18
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
little bit

19
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,440
你儿郎

20
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
的是

21
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
蒙恨故里

22
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
妖蛮跋扈

23
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
那护儿郎

24
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
甘饮去

25
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Linux计成

26
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
作作亲富

27
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Yin Fu?

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
How dare you call me a girl?

29
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I am a noble and noble man,

30
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
and I am a man of pure and pure blood.

31
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
And you are even imprisoned here.

32
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
You should report to the government.

33
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I will wait for the government to investigate this matter.

34
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I will wait for you to compensate me.

35
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
If you insist on taking the medicine for me,

36
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
it's not impossible.

37
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I will go.

38
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I have a banquet for you.

39
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I will give you a letter of my love.

40
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I will tell the whole family to teach you.

41
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I hope you will understand my feelings.

42
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I will do my best.

43
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
You are a noble and noble man.

44
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
You don't know how to love.

45
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
You don't know how to love.

46
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I will give you a letter of my love.

47
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I will wait for you to understand my feelings.

48
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Thank you for your birthday.

49
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I am very happy.

50
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Miss, Zhang Shizi is really considerate.

51
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
He is a fool.

52
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
He would not say anything directly.

53
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Report!

54
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
The Crown Prince of the Prime Minister of the State of Ping is killed in Lingzhou!

55
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
What is going on?

56
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
The Crown Prince of the State of Ping is killed in Lingzhou!

57
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
What did he say?

58
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Did he hear it wrong?

59
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
The Crown Prince of the State of Ping

60
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
is not Zhang Huaiyuan.

61
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
We don't know his identity.

62
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Lu Dianshui, Zhang Huaiyuan...

63
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Miss.

64
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Miss, don't scare me, Miss!

65
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Miss!

66
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
What should I do?

67
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Don't scare me.

68
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
How could this happen?

69
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
How is this possible?

70
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
He's not the Emperor's son, who do you think you can harm him?

71
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
He's just going to Lingzhou to work. How could he...

72
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
His Majesty has ordered the investigation to be completed.

73
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
His Highness is also arriving in Lingzhou soon.

74
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
This matter will be settled.

75
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Xiaoqi!

76
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Miss Yun!

77
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Miss Yun!

78
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Your luggage is ready.

79
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Stop!

80
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Stop!

81
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Young Master, according to His Highness's order,

82
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
we must leave immediately and meet with Grandfather in Sha Xi.

83
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
The news of the death of Crown Prince Zhang has been reported to Shangjing.

84
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
With His Highness's plan, we must return to Lingzhou as soon as possible.

85
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Prime Minister, a spy has reported that

86
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Prince Dingbei and Ling Qingxian were on separate routes.

87
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
On what routes?

88
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I don't know yet.

89
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
The spy reported that Prince Dingbei took Princess Consort to go alone.

90
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
The two of them went around a few places and then left Ding Shao behind.

91
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Afterwards, they were sent to the south.

92
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
How is the arrangement in Lingzhou?

93
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Miss Yun has already followed the orders of the Prime Minister.

94
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Everything is well arranged.

95
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
This trip will concern the entire Su family.

96
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I will use my full strength to help Er Rong.

97
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Stop!

98
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Stop!

99
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Stay in the carriage.

100
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Don't come out.

101
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Don't come out.

102
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Don't come out.

103
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Don't come out.

104
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Go!

105
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Jin Yunwei, I will kill you!

106
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Go!

107
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I won't spare anyone who tries to save His Majesty.

108
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Go!

109
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Your Highness, I am Xiao Anqi!

110
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Die!

111
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
My Lord!

112
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
My Lord, are you hurt?

113
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I am fine.

114
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Be careful, Your Highness!

115
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Your Highness, go back to the carriage! It's dangerous!

116
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Go!

117
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Yunyi!

118
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Your Highness!

119
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Are you crazy?

120
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Protect him.

121
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Go!

122
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
We have been ambushed here.

123
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
We should be on guard.

124
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Hold on!

125
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Your Highness, I will train more.

126
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Retreat!

127
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Retreat!

128
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Young Master!

129
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Your Highness, you go first!

130
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Yunyi!

131
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Go!

132
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Leave me alone!

133
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Leave me alone!

134
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
My Lord, it's far.

135
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
It's very deep.

136
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
It will hurt a little.

137
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
We are on guard.

138
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
We are searching the way to Lingzhou.

139
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
If there is no clue, we will continue to investigate Lingzhou.

140
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
We must find Yunyi.

141
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Yes.

142
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Yunyi fell into the hands of Haiyou Sect.

143
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Could it be...

144
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
No.

145
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Yunyi will not be in danger again.

146
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
They are threatening my husband with Yunyi.

147
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Ayu is missing outside Lingzhou.

148
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
The Su family is very close to him.

149
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Why do they have to search everywhere?

150
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
It seems that Ayu has the Lingzhou Department of the Ministry of War

151
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
and the evidence of the tax on the tax.

152
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Haiyou Sect took Yunyi away.

153
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Or they want to find clues from him.

154
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
So they are looking for evidence.

155
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
But...

156
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Yunyi fell into their hands.

157
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
They will suffer a lot.

158
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Ah Xu!

159
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
The Su family even dares to kill you.

160
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
What else can they do?

161
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Yunyi fell into their hands.

162
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
It must be a terrible death.

163
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
We must go to Lingzhou immediately.

164
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
We must find the Su family.

165
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Calm down.

166
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
We must find the evidence first.

167
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
What's the use of me being calm?

168
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I know he is suffering.

169
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I know he is in danger.

170
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
But I can only do nothing for him.

171
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I...

172
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I hate to have no right to listen to you.

173
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I hate to have no right to learn martial arts.

174
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
In the end,

175
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I can't even protect the one I want to protect.

176
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
To protect my master and uncle,

177
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
what's the use of being a gold medalist?

178
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
In the end,

179
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
it's all a lie.

180
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
If you don't go,

181
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I'll go myself.

182
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
If something happens to you,

183
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
what should your parents do?

184
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
What about Yunyi?

185
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
If something happens to her,

186
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
will anyone think for her?

187
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
If you delay for a moment,

188
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
she'll be in danger.

189
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Jiang Qizhi,

190
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
there's no time to remember.

191
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
If you stop her,

192
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
the love of the Su family will be broken.

193
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Yunyi and Beile,

194
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
both of us are very anxious.

195
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
It's just about Yunyi's safety.

196
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
We can't act on impulse.

197
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Otherwise, it's very likely to harm Yunyi.

198
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
If we go to the Su family to save people,

199
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
we'll only alert them.

200
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Because we can't prove that

201
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Yunyi is in their hands.

202
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
They may also kill

203
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
and destroy the evidence.

204
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I know that the second young master is very worried about saving people.

205
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
But the more dangerous it is,

206
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
the more we can't mess up the situation.

207
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
What my husband said just now,

208
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
is not to abandon Yunyi and be indifferent.

209
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
But to make sure that everything is fine.

210
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Dongshen,

211
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
stay in Lingzhou tonight.

212
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:40,000
why

213
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
why

214
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:03,840
darling

215
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,640
possibly

216
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,640
You and Shun'er are close friends.

217
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:19,640
Why bother to be so gloomy over a few words?

218
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:27,640
Moreover, you are not from the capital.

219
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,640
We've been friends for years.

220
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,640
You still don't understand what I think.

221
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:40,640
You think that I am cold-blooded.

222
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,640
I'm the one who's cold-blooded.

223
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,640
I was wrong.

224
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,640
You're worried about the chaos.

225
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,640
You're not saying anything when you're in danger.

226
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:52,640
He wanted to save Yunyi as soon as possible.

227
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,640
If he's captured by Atan today,

228
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:58,640
you must be more anxious than him.

229
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,640
What are you waiting for?

230
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,640
Go!

231
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,640
Aren't you a very capable person?

232
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,640
It's not right to delay the task of saving people.

233
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,640
You shouldn't rush it.

234
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,640
It will take you more time to take the carriage.

235
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,640
Your Highness, you're not saying it right.

236
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,640
Don't worry, Young Master.

237
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,640
The King's Command

238
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,640
Do you have an answer for your wound?

239
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,640
Where's the anger you had just now?

240
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,640
I'm not sure.

241
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,640
There's one condition for a man to die in peace.

242
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,640
It's that I have to live in Lingzhou first.

243
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,640
You want to live?

244
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,640
I was in a hurry just now.

245
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,640
I didn't think carefully.

246
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,640
If I'm in trouble,

247
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,640
my parents can't take it.

248
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,640
I think the cold-blooded Qi Zhi can't take it.

249
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,640
So the fight between you men

250
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,640
is more dangerous than the fight between us women.

251
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,640
Your Highness, you're laughing at me.

252
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,640
I'm laughing at you.

253
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,640
You're so childish.

254
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,640
I'm laughing at you.

255
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,640
You're so childish.

256
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,640
Your Highness,

257
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,640
I'm sorry.

258
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,640
I'm sorry.

259
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,640
I'm sorry.

260
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,640
I'm sorry.

261
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,640
The next one.

262
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,640
Here you are.

263
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,640
Get in.

264
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,640
What are you doing?

265
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,640
To be honest, I have no reason to.

266
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,640
Get in.

267
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,640
This is mine.

268
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,640
Let's go.

269
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,640
Thank you.

270
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,640
Go.

271
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,640
Next one.

272
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,640
Thank you.

273
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,640
Go.

274
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,640
Go.

275
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,640
Stop.

276
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,640
Lock it.

277
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,640
Lock it.

278
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,640
Hey,

279
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,640
is this your first time in Lingzhou?

280
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,640
There are rules in Lingzhou.

281
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,640
It's easy to follow.

282
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,640
What rules?

283
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,640
Are you pretending to be poor or stupid?

284
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,640
You have no money, right?

285
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,640
You can't get in.

286
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,640
Stop talking nonsense.

287
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,640
You can't get in.

288
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,640
Why can't I get in?

289
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,640
Because you don't know the rules.

290
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,640
Who set the rules?

291
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,640
I did.

292
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,640
I'm the boss here.

293
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,640
Get in.

294
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,640
Go.

295
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,640
Don't move.

296
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,640
Don't move.

297
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,640
Go away.

298
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,640
Go.

299
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,640
Sir, you haven't paid yet.

300
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,640
Sir.

301
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,640
Stop him.

302
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,640
Don't move.

303
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,640
Sir, you haven't paid yet.

304
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,640
Go away.

305
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,640
You...

306
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,640
Go and ask around.

307
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,640
I've never paid in Lingzhou.

308
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,640
Who dares to argue with me?

309
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,640
Listen,

310
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,640
my sister

311
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,640
is going to serve the nine girls of the Su family.

312
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,640
I'm not going to serve them.

313
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,640
After she gets the money,

314
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,640
she'll be afraid that

315
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,640
she can't afford you.

316
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,640
My sister

317
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,640
is very popular

318
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,640
in front of the nine girls.

319
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,640
Don't you look down on her.

320
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,640
Get out of here.

321
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,640
You're so arrogant

322
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,640
for eating white food.

323
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,640
I want to eat white food.

324
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,640
Get out of here.

325
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,640
You're so arrogant.

326
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,640
How dare you argue with me?

327
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,640
You're so arrogant.

328
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,640
Sir,

329
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,640
forget it.

330
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,640
It's better to take one thing than one thing.

331
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,640
I don't want to cause trouble.

332
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,640
The boss wants to keep his reputation,

333
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,640
but he can't keep the money.

334
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,640
It's not the way to solve

335
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,640
the problem.

336
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,640
You're so arrogant.

337
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,640
I'm so arrogant.

338
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,640
I'm so arrogant.

339
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,640
Enough. Let him go.

340
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,640
You're still waiting for me?

341
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,640
Boss,

342
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,640
do you have a toothpick?

343
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,640
I've already given

344
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:14,640
your two people the

345
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,640
money.

346
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,640
What do you mean?

347
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,640
You're in a hurry to get to the Su family.

348
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,640
I'm going to follow you.

349
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,640
Besides, the Su family will treat you well.

350
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,640
I'm under their eyes.

351
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,640
I know.

352
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,640
We're good people.

353
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,640
You want to investigate the case of the Su family?

354
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,640
How do you plan to do it?

355
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,640
There are many women in Lingzhou City who are injured.

356
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,640
So I plan to be a merchant.

357
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,640
I'll do whatever I can.

358
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,640
As for Princess Dingbei,

359
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,640
she's weak.

360
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,640
She can't stand the long journey.

361
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,640
When she was killed by the assassin,

362
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,640
she was frightened and went back to the capital.

363
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,640
What do you think?

364
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,640
She's been out for only a few days.

365
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,640
She's getting more and more tired.

366
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,640
You must save Yunyi.

367
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,640
I will.

368
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,640
Don't worry,

369
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,640
I'll stay in the best hotel in Lingzhou.

370
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,640
There are many people in Lingzhou.

371
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,640
It seems that everything is peaceful.

372
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,640
There are many people who are like the previous one.

373
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,640
I'm worried about your health.

374
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,640
I've thought about it.

375
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,640
I'll let Zhuyu follow you.

376
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,640
It's good.

377
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,640
I'll go.

378
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,640
You're a good man.

379
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,640
Princess Dingbei has never been to Lingzhou.

380
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,640
If you lose this status,

381
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,640
you'll be in danger.

382
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,640
I'll be careful.

383
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,640
Take care.

384
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,640
I'll wait for your good news.

385
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,640
What's wrong?

386
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,640
There's some tea in here.

387
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,640
I ordered local tea.

388
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:22,640
Yunxian House is one of the most famous tea houses in this place.

389
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,640
Why is it so crowded?

390
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,640
I'm sorry.

391
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,640
I'll go to the kitchen.

392
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:40,640
Where did you buy the tea?

393
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,640
What can I do for you?

394
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,640
I think it's good.

395
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,640
I want to bring back some.

396
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,640
We buy tea from Ding Sheng Tea House.

397
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,640
Ding Sheng is a cheap tea.

398
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,640
They sell good tea.

399
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,640
The tea you ordered is the best.

400
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,640
Ding Sheng Tea House?

401
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,640
Yes.

402
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,640
Thank you.

403
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,640
Enjoy.

404
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,640
Stop it.

405
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,640
Stop it.

406
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,640
Don't touch my tea.

407
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,640
I'll kill you.

408
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,640
I'll kill you.

409
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,640
I'll pay you back.

410
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,640
I'll pay you back.

411
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,640
Let us go.

412
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,640
You're a bastard.

413
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,640
I'll kill you.

414
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,640
I'll kill you.

415
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,640
You're still alive.

416
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,640
You don't know who's boss?

417
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,640
I'll kill you.

418
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,640
I'll kill you.

419
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,640
I'll kill you.

420
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,640
It's him.

421
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,640
How dare he stay here?

422
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,640
I must let you know

423
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,640
who is the boss of Lingzhou City.

424
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,640
Guys, kill him.

425
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,640
Kill him.

426
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,640
Get out of the way.

427
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,640
The governor is here.

428
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,640
Get out of the way.

429
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,640
The governor is here.

430
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,640
Mr. Zhao, help.

431
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,640
Help, Mr. Zhao.

432
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,640
How dare you make trouble in my house?

433
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,640
You want to die?

434
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,640
Those foreigners

435
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,640
are not even close to you.

436
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,640
You don't even know them.

437
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,640
You still want to be the boss?

438
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,640
Stop it.

439
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,640
It's him.

440
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,640
You make trouble here.

441
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,640
You're not related to the governor.

442
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,640
Governor,

443
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,640
he's my uncle.

444
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,640
Where's the manager of Yunxian House?

445
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,640
I'm here.

446
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,640
Yunxian House is in the middle of the road.

447
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,640
The manager is on the second floor.

448
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,640
I'm innocent.

449
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,640
You're here to make trouble.

450
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,640
You're not even close to him.

451
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,640
You make trouble here.

452
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,640
You're not even close to him.

453
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,640
Yes.

454
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,640
You make trouble.

455
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,640
Arrest him.

456
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,640
You'll be sentenced to three months of jail.

457
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,640
Hurry up.

458
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,640
Wait.

459
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,640
The big trial law

460
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,640
will be passed by the author.

461
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,640
He didn't say a word just now.

462
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,640
How can he make trouble here?

463
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,640
In the big trial law,

464
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,640
you'll be attacked

465
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,640
and your wealth will be lost.

466
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:20,640
Although others can make it up to you,

467
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,640
But these people beat the shopkeeper to destroy the property

468
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:24,640
We did it on purpose

469
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,640
How could we be trusted

470
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,640
when we sent them off?

471
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,640
The store was taken by Baishi

472
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,640
The shopkeeper was attacked by someone

473
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,640
He is a bitter master

474
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,640
But you betrayed him and hid the money

475
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,640
You solved the case so easily

476
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,640
It's a mistake

477
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,640
I made a mistake

478
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,640
What are you talking about?

479
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,640
How did you make a mistake?

480
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,640
You taught me?

481
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,640
I am Shu Jingran

482
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,640
I work in the border of Hanlin

483
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,640
I am not sure if I can help you

484
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,640
with the law

485
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,640
You are the second son of Prime Minister Shu

486
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,640
I am sorry for my rudeness

487
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,640
Please take back the crime

488
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,640
and settle the case according to the law

489
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,640
Sure

490
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,640
I will take them back first

491
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,640
and make a decision after the trial

492
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,640
I will do it right away

493
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:18,640
It's my duty to interrogate

494
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,640
How can I let others do it?

495
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,640
I don't know who is the one who

496
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,640
was ordered to go to Lingzhou

497
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,640
Who is he?

498
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,640
Are you King Dingbei?

499
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,640
Your Highness

500
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,640
Your Highness

501
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,640
Your Highness

502
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,640
Take them all

503
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,640
and go to the Su family with me

504
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,640
Go

505
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,640
Why haven't they arrived yet?

506
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,640
They came from Yunxian House

507
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,640
It's only two hours

508
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:56,640
Madam, why don't you go to rest?

509
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,640
The servants are here

510
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,640
I will call you later

511
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,640
King Dingbei is going to marry you

512
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,640
How can I not go with him?

513
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,640
I think you want to

514
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,640
make a big mistake in the Su family

515
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,640
You don't know the importance of the family

516
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,640
You have been busy these years

517
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,640
I was not careful enough

518
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,640
Please don't worry

519
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,640
The Su family welcomes King Dingbei

520
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,640
I greet Your Highness

521
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,640
and Shu Hanlin

522
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,640
I am Yu Bozhong, the Prefect of Lingzhou

523
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,640
I greet Your Highness

524
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,640
and Shu Hanlin

525
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,640
I didn't make any connection with anyone

526
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,640
Miss Su

527
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,640
has a good reputation

528
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,640
It seems that the Su family

529
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,640
is really in Lingzhou

530
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,640
How dare the Su family

531
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,640
not welcome you personally?

532
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,640
I'm afraid that

533
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,640
I have broken the etiquette

534
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,640
and offended Your Highness

535
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,640
I have already asked for your permission

536
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,640
Miss, they are here

537
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,640
This is the servant

538
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,640
that Your Highness summoned

539
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,640
Please greet Your Highness

540
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,640
I greet Your Highness

541
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,640
Is this your brother?

542
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,640
Yes, Your Highness

543
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,640
Do you know that he

544
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,640
is making a big mistake

545
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,640
when he saw your name outside?

546
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:45,640
I don't know

547
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,640
Have you ever taken care of him

548
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,640
when you were in the Su family?

549
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:51,640
I have never done that

550
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,640
How did you do that?

551
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,640
You are just a maid

552
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:57,640
How dare you take the opportunity to steal the Su family's name?

553
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,640
You not only implicated the Su family

554
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,640
but also offended the Prince

555
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,640
Take it away and make it into a new one

556
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,640
and sell it to the Gou Lan Academy

557
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,640
Yes, Your Highness

558
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,640
Miss Su, you are taking the responsibility for me

559
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:15,640
Your Highness is joking

560
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:17,640
In the end

561
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:19,640
the Su family is the one who teaches the servants

562
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,640
I am thinking that I should punish them

563
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:23,640
and give them a good lesson

564
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:25,640
so that I can give an explanation to Your Highness

565
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:27,640
Miss Su, you are right

566
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:29,640
This is the family matter of the Su family

567
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:31,640
I have made a big mistake

568
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:33,640
by taking the initiative

569
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,640
But Lingzhou is not a strict school

570
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,640
It is necessary to punish them severely

571
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:41,640
It is not just the family matter of the Su family

572
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:43,640
Go after them

573
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:47,640
This is the guard of Lingzhou

574
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:49,640
When the Prince entered the city

575
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:51,640
he said that the city of Lingzhou had its own rules

576
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:53,640
If you have no money, you should not follow the rules

577
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:55,640
and do not allow the entry of the city

578
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:57,640
And he is the one who decides the rules of the city

579
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,640
Your Excellency

580
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:03,640
I am just laughing at him

581
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:09,640
This person only has the power to eat white food

582
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,640
and act recklessly

583
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:13,640
because of the Su family

584
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:15,640
This person

585
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:17,640
eats the food of the royal family

586
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,640
but he is not good enough to be a good citizen

587
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:21,640
and he is not good enough to be a good citizen

588
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,640
I have just entered the city of Lingzhou

589
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,640
I have already seen it

590
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:29,640
Is it possible that

591
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,640
this place is not a strict school

592
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:33,640
and the citizens only know the Su family

593
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,640
and do not know the strictness of the Su family

594
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,640
Your Highness, you are too serious

595
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,640
Your Highness, what happened today

596
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:45,640
Even if these two people are talking nonsense

597
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:47,640
the Su family is being bullied by the innocent

598
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:49,640
I hope Your Highness can be the one to punish these two people

599
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:51,640
so that they can prove the Su family's name

600
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:53,640
and solve the problems

601
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,640
The matter of Lingzhou

602
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,640
is up to Zhang's family

603
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,640
Right?

604
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,640
Zhang's family

605
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:05,640
According to the great law

606
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,640
these two people

607
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:11,640
should be punished by the law

608
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,640
20 times per day

609
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,640
The former person will be double compensated for the loss of the restaurant

610
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,640
The latter person will be suspended from work

611
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:19,640
and will be fined

612
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:23,640
and will be sent to the city of Yuji

613
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,640
to be a good friend

614
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:29,640
Approved

615
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:31,640
Your Highness is wise

616
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,640
Your Highness has been working hard all the way

617
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:39,640
and you have to personally investigate the case

618
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,640
It is really hard for you to investigate the case

619
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,640
I hope Your Highness can spend some time with Shu Hanlin

620
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:45,640
and have a rest

621
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,640
No need

622
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,640
I and Shu Hanlin are in the Su family

623
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:51,640
and we can discuss

624
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,640
the issue of tax evasion

625
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,640
Your Highness is willing to live in the house

626
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:03,640
The Su family is lucky

627
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,640
I will call someone to prepare dinner

628
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,640
Yes, yes

629
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:11,640
Your Highness

630
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:15,640
Your Highness

631
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:17,640
After the murder

632
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:19,640
the Oman Sea will not find the time

633
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,640
to bring Prince Dingbei to Lingzhou

634
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,640
I have heard

635
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:25,640
that they should be treated well

636
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:27,640
and be treated well

637
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:29,640
If they just pay the tax

638
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,640
they can deal with the tax evasion

639
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,640
It is okay to break some money

640
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,640
Tell them to hurry

641
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:39,640
Don't let them stay too long

642
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,640
to avoid long nights and dreams

643
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:43,640
Yes

644
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:09,640
The Su family is in the Su family

645
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,640
and we can discuss

646
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:13,640
the issue of tax evasion

647
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,640
The Oman Sea will not find the time

648
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:17,640
to bring Prince Dingbei to Lingzhou

649
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,640
I have been wearing this jade pendant since I was a child

650
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:21,640
No matter what you encounter in the future

651
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,640
you can use this jade pendant to go to the Duke of Pingguo

652
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,640
The house will help you with all your might

653
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,640
I am a noble and noble person

654
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,640
and I am innocent

655
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,640
and you are even imprisoned here

656
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:37,640
I am waiting for the government to investigate this matter

657
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,640
and you to compensate me

658
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:41,640
I hope you have this chance

659
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,640
I can feel your love

660
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:49,640
and I will choose a new one

661
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:51,640
the day after tomorrow

662
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:53,640
to show my gratitude

663
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:55,640
to your beauty

664
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:57,640
No need

665
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:59,640
My girl, you are a pure and pure girl

666
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:01,640
and you don't need to show your affection

667
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,640
You and I are both pure and pure

668
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:05,640
I understand

669
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:07,640
I know you like to read

670
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:09,640
and I can open the whole Wentao Pavilion

671
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,640
for you

672
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,640
Zhang Huaiyu, why do you think I don't match with Shuer?

673
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:15,640
If Shuer doesn't match with me

674
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:17,640
who else can match with me?

675
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,640
You...

676
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:23,640
Then I am more compatible with you

677
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,640
You are rude and rude

678
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,640
You don't know how to treat me

679
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:39,640
If I can't marry you, you marry me

680
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,640
I will marry you

681
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,640
Miss Bai, will you come to see me off tomorrow?

682
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:58,640
Please come to your hand

683
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,640
Don't scold me

684
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,640
I will make you a good wife

685
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,640
Is that so difficult?

686
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,640
I will love you forever

687
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,640
Leave this greedy business

688
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,640
It's more troublesome than Yinzi

689
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:13,640
You are always so impulsive

690
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:15,640
You don't have any sense of accomplishment

691
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:17,640
How will you keep your place in the Wentao Pavilion?

692
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:19,640
How can you keep people from making mistakes

693
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:21,640
and make mistakes?

694
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:28,640
I am afraid that I will follow you

695
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:33,640
to the end

696
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:35,640
Er Bao

697
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:40,640
Miss Bai

698
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:41,640
Tell them

699
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:44,640
to reopen the Wentao Pavilion in three days

700
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,640
There will be new pieces and new rehearsals

701
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,640
and the best Juerracheng noodles in Shangjing

702
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:50,640
What?

703
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,640
Your boss can leave

704
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,640
I can't

705
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,640
Since everything is under Yin Cheng's control

706
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,640
I have no other choice

707
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,640
He doesn't believe that I can keep the Wentao Pavilion

708
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,640
I have to fight for it

709
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,640
Not only keep it

710
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:09,640
I have to make it more important

711
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,640
Shangjing

712
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:36,640
Shangjing is more lively than the place of Jin Shang

713
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:37,640
Look

714
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:38,640
It's so beautiful

715
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,640
It's surrounded by five lakes and four seas

716
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,640
It's hard to get used to it

717
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,640
The way it's done

718
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,640
is like being in a flowered mirror

719
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,640
with the light of the five suns

720
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,640
It makes people can't see

721
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,640
Take a look

722
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:57,640
Put it on

723
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,640
Madam, it's not appropriate

724
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:01,640
What madam?

725
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:03,640
What's wrong with it?

726
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:05,640
You are the guardian of the mountain

727
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:07,640
How can you be so cold-hearted?

728
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:08,640
Relax

729
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:09,640
Don't be so cold-hearted

730
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:11,640
Madam

731
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:13,640
Thank you

732
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,640
Madam, what's your plan?

733
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:19,640
I am Miss He now

734
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:23,640
Madam, what's your plan?

735
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,640
I don't have any plan

736
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:28,640
There are many treasures in Linzhou

737
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:31,640
Shangjing doesn't have many things

738
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:33,640
Since I am here

739
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:35,640
I have to make a lot of money

740
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:47,640
Put this set of dishes away

741
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:49,640
and put on my Chinese porcelain

742
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:50,640
Yes

743
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:54,640
These flowers are not suitable for the wedding

744
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:56,640
Let the bride dress up again

745
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:57,640
Yes

746
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:01,640
Miss He is not trying to entertain the King of Dingbei

747
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:04,640
She even used your favorite Chinese porcelain

748
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:08,640
I just don't know if this Prince Hangwu is in trouble

749
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,640
It doesn't matter if he is in trouble

750
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:12,640
The key is whether he understands the situation

751
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:14,640
I have also told him

752
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:16,640
As long as we can coax him

753
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,640
the tax in Linzhou will be fine

754
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:23,640
But he is not as easy to deal with as the Crown Prince Zhang

755
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:25,640
The King of Dingbei is cold-hearted

756
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:28,640
I heard that he even dares to take away His Majesty's dignity

757
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:31,640
I don't know how to show him off

758
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:34,640
There must be a weakness in the world

759
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:38,640
Men are nothing but money and women

760
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:43,640
But now I don't know the happiness of this Prince

761
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:46,640
I still have to work hard

762
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:48,640
You should be careful

763
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:51,640
You can't make any mistakes tonight

764
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:52,640
Yes

765
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:12,640
The Su family in Lingzhou is indeed famous

766
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:13,640
I don't need to tell you

767
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:17,640
But a guest room should be more exquisite than my Qi'an Hall

768
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:20,640
I just hope you can live comfortably

769
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:25,640
I can live comfortably if you don't think too much

770
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:28,640
I am stupid

771
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:31,640
I don't know what you mean

772
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:37,640
