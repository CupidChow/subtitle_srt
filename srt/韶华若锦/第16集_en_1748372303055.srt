1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,960
Take out when you need it.

2
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:35,880
Let the dates sit on the table for a while.

3
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,800
Don't change the date!

4
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:41,560
No comments or videos of what you did.

5
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,500
13

6
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,900
POLSH TO YANGZ cái 沒?

7
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,100
My lord Jing'an isara,

8
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:59,180
there must be something interesting to him.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
He chose King Dingbei as his son-in-law

10
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
because he is the best of the best

11
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
and he can lead the Ming family to the top.

12
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
The court is changing.

13
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Everyone has the same thoughts.

14
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
King Dingbei is no exception.

15
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
He can marry you because of the Ming family.

16
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
He can also sing for the Ming family

17
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
for the sake of the King of the Northern States.

18
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I am sorry.

19
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
What Godfather taught me

20
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
is the last question

21
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
in my heart.

22
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I can't think of the past.

23
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I have to save my father

24
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
with my own hands.

25
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Your father has done a great service.

26
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
If he can admit his crime,

27
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
His Majesty will not punish the slaves

28
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
and pardon the sin of the Ming family.

29
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I am sorry.

30
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
All along,

31
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Tan has been loyal to you.

32
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
You thought

33
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
this father-daughter relationship would not change because of power?

34
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
But in the end, I was too naive.

35
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I didn't know the world was full of ups and downs.

36
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
It was all in vain.

37
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
The world was full of ups and downs.

38
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
It was all in vain.

39
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Tan is just like this bracelet.

40
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
It is just a necklace that is in the heart of the people.

41
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
It is just a piece of material that is in the whole world.

42
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
It is just a chess piece.

43
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
But material can be given to anyone.

44
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
But people cannot be turned upside down

45
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
and be angry at will.

46
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Your Majesty,

47
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
this case is really irreversible.

48
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I have already called Guo Bing Mao to the capital.

49
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Guo Bing Mao has been with Duke Jing An for many years.

50
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Before, Duke Jing An recommended Guo Bing Mao

51
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
to take over the throne.

52
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
If Guo Bing Mao

53
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
can prove Duke Jing An's innocence,

54
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
this case will be a great success.

55
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
There is still a long way to go.

56
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Greetings, Your Highness.

57
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Your Highness,

58
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I have brought you some food.

59
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Please eat.

60
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Thank you.

61
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Thank you.

62
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Thank you.

63
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Thank you.

64
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Thank you.

65
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Thank you.

66
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Thank you.

67
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Thank you.

68
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Thank you.

69
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Thank you.

70
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Thank you.

71
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Thank you.

72
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Thank you.

73
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Thank you.

74
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Thank you.

75
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Thank you.

76
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Thank you.

77
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Thank you.

78
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Thank you.

79
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Thank you.

80
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Thank you.

81
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Thank you.

82
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Thank you.

83
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Thank you.

84
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I was wrong about someone.

85
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,360
I almost made a mistake.

86
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,840
You're just a servant.

87
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:24,880
How can I blame you?

88
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,000
It's not over yet.

89
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,840
Maybe there's a chance to turn things around.

90
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,920
Your Highness, don't worry too much.

91
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:31,840
You'll hurt yourself.

92
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Your Majesty.

93
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:45,960
Lu Weiding.

94
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,840
I'm here.

95
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:48,920
You may leave.

96
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,200
Yes.

97
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,680
Guoqing, get up.

98
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,400
Thank you, Your Majesty.

99
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,040
I called you alone today.

100
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,600
I hope you won't mind.

101
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,960
I'll be frank with you.

102
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,480
Duke Jing'an has guarded Nanjing for decades.

103
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,440
How is his ambition?

104
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,400
How is his behavior?

105
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,000
Your Majesty.

106
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,400
Duke Jing'an led the army of Western Regions

107
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,760
to conquer the enemy and recover the lost territory.

108
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:28,960
The whole army

109
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,200
admires him and respects him.

110
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,560
The people of Nanjing

111
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,040
respect and respect him.

112
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,800
He's the pillar of peace in Nanjing.

113
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:43,000
Did you ever ignore the order of the court

114
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,000
to take the role of Yuezu

115
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,720
and have private relations with Nanjing?

116
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,440
Well...

117
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,800
I only know that you're a tough man.

118
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,040
You can't persuade anyone

119
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,640
to make a decision.

120
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,800
Eight years ago, after the Great Rebellion of Yongzhou,

121
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,920
you had a great reputation

122
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,600
and met with the chief commander of Nanjing.

123
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,720
But no one knew what they discussed.

124
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,440
Do you know

125
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,720
if Duke Jing'an had any letters

126
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,960
with Nanjing these years?

127
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:25,680
Yes.

128
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:27,920
Your Majesty,

129
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,000
Duke Jing'an never hid it.

130
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:34,120
Nanjing's letters are just for business.

131
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,400
They often have a way to bribe.

132
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,040
But you never cared about it.

133
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:43,720
Then how did you answer to Nanjing's request?

134
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,720
Well...

135
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,880
Your Majesty, I don't know.

136
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,560
But you usually don't reply to letters.

137
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,000
You only put aside two letters.

138
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,560
In my impression,

139
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:59,680
you only replied to one letter.

140
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,880
But you don't know the content.

141
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,440
Your Majesty,

142
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,120
not all letters from Nanjing can be received.

143
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,640
back with the Prime Minister.

144
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,760
Please forgive me for dispositional of fine etiquette.

145
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,380
Ah

146
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:32,500
Ha

147
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,160
as explain itsз

148
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,360
Thank you.

149
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:47,120
I'm used to hang out with You.

150
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:50,280
This liquor plasticity is attractive.

151
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,960
choose to drink,

152
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,440
nothing youqualified meη

153
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,960
with your evidence about

154
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,000
why you're abusing passerby

155
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,600
you don't need ask

156
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,120
I

157
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,120
Although he didn't say that you were his enemy,

158
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,720
but there must be something in your heart.

159
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,040
The emperor's court is full of suspicions.

160
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,800
You disobeyed the emperor's order.

161
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,400
Even if you have done a great favor,

162
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,520
it's still hard to be accepted by His Majesty.

163
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,720
Now that we have evidence and evidence,

164
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,280
you can't escape death.

165
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,800
This case is settled.

166
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,000
You did a great favor.

167
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,280
I have informed His Majesty

168
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:39,400
that you will be the leader of Yang Xilu.

169
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,280
You will be in charge of Yang Xilu's power.

170
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,880
Please rest assured, Prime Minister.

171
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,080
From now on,

172
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,160
I will respect you

173
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,720
and guard the war.

174
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,640
Why was theぜ strategies

175
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,840
you found at Ming's результат

176
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:11,960
found

177
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,680
were doing it against his will?

178
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,320
Tan...

179
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,680
Inspite of that,

180
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,800
is there anything we can do?

181
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,200
You may ask him.

182
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:36,860
He can tell me

183
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:38,780
what went on.

184
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:49,780
priorities of Jin axis

185
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,380
Only the authorities

186
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:55,260
could reach out your potatoes.

187
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:01,660
Yue always grand 잠깐

188
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,280
The evidence is clear.

189
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,280
Ying,

190
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,280
what will happen?

191
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,280
I will announce it.

192
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,280
Your Majesty,

193
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,280
His Majesty has been in the palace for a long time.

194
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,280
He has not been able to do anything.

195
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,280
Yuzhang,

196
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,280
three days later...

197
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,280
Three days later what?

198
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,280
Three days later what?

199
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,280
It's not the last moment.

200
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,280
I will try my best to do it.

201
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,280
Tan.

202
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,280
Tan.

203
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,280
Tan.

204
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,280
Tan.

205
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,280
Tan.

206
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,280
Tan.

207
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,280
Tan.

208
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,280
Tan.

209
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,280
I will try my best to do it.

210
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,280
You should cheer up first.

211
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,280
Tan.

212
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,280
How to cheer up?

213
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,280
How should I cheer up?

214
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,280
That's my aunt.

215
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,280
My only aunt.

216
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,280
Tan.

217
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,280
I beg you to explain.

218
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,280
I have been waiting for you.

219
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,280
Now,

220
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,280
he won't let me go.

221
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,280
I have checked those stolen goods.

222
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,280
But they are the only ones in South Lv.

223
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,280
South Lv has been fighting with Yang Xilu for many years.

224
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:01,280
The possibility of the stolen goods to flow from the south is indeed the greatest.

225
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,280
But the Su family is in charge of the big money and the big business.

226
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:10,280
It's not difficult to secretly store some stolen goods and use them to frame the goods.

227
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,280
But now,

228
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:18,280
I am afraid that I will not be able to forget the case in three days.

229
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,280
The enemy is in the dark.

230
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,280
How can we defend ourselves?

231
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,280
Your Highness, you have tried your best.

232
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,280
I just never thought that

233
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,280
the old friendship and friendship for many years

234
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:41,280
is just a purification of the water and the moon in front of the whole world.

235
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:49,280
I have been a guard for the country for half of my life.

236
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,280
I have been living for the people.

237
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,280
I have been living to this day.

238
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,280
The only thing that I can't be at ease with

239
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,280
is Tan'er.

240
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,280
In the coming days, Tan'er will surely be able to endure it.

241
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,280
I still have to ask Your Highness

242
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,280
to take good care of the country.

243
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:22,280
Take good care of the country.

244
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:30,280
I am really tired of the moon and the moon.

245
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,280
But...

246
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,280
It's not a dead end.

247
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,280
The Black Prince is currently in the East Wind.

248
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,280
Instead of fighting for the country,

249
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,280
he should not let the whole country down.

250
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,280
He should take the initiative.

251
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,280
Your Majesty,

252
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,280
the case in Lichou is just the beginning.

253
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:05,280
Your Majesty, you have been a great and important official.

254
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,280
In the future,

255
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,280
you will be able to win the battle.

256
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,280
The Su family has been a great and important official for many years.

257
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,280
There are many important officials.

258
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,280
If you want to win the heart of the people,

259
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,280
you will have to be very involved.

260
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:33,280
The court of the Su family has been taken over by the Su family.

261
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,280
The whole family was moved by the first blow.

262
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,280
Your Majesty,

263
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,280
the Su family's roots are in Lichou.

264
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,280
As long as you take good care of the country,

265
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,280
the Su family will have no more evidence.

266
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,280
What do you mean?

267
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,280
Why are you two here today?

268
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,280
It's not the day to build the tomb.

269
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,280
What are you doing here?

270
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,280
I'm here to meet a guest.

271
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,280
Enough.

272
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,280
It's just a meeting.

273
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,280
The Empress is my sister.

274
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,280
Can I meet anyone I want?

275
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,280
You're so sharp.

276
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,280
You're so sharp.

277
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,280
Who is this gentleman?

278
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,280
He can control the commander of the Imperial Guards and the Hanlin of the charcoal flowers.

279
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,280
He just came to the building.

280
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,280
Why are you so agitated?

281
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,280
Brother-in-law.

282
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,280
Your Majesty.

283
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,280
Your Majesty.

284
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,280
I didn't know it was you.

285
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,280
I was too impulsive.

286
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,280
No, I was too stupid.

287
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,280
Your Majesty, you're here.

288
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,280
I'm sorry for my loss.

289
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,280
Please forgive me.

290
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,280
Get up.

291
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,280
I'm just visiting you in private.

292
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,280
You don't have to be so polite.

293
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:39,280
I've heard that you've been doing business well.

294
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,280
I'm just a layman.

295
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,280
The building is so different.

296
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,280
It's the only one in Shangjing.

297
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,280
I've been wanting to see it.

298
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52,280
It's really extraordinary to see it today.

299
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,280
No wonder you've been trying to do business these years.

300
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,280
You're just trying to get the best of it.

301
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:04,280
Your Majesty, you're so kind.

302
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:10,280
Your Majesty, I'm so honored to be here.

303
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:14,280
It's all my fault that I didn't tell you in advance.

304
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:18,280
If I knew you were coming, I would have prepared it in advance.

305
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:22,280
I'll make sure you come on time and come back in time.

306
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:33,280
I just don't know why you're so modest.

307
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,280
I want you to help me with the bill.

308
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,280
It's all right to look at the bill.

309
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:59,280
But if you look at the bill, it's obviously covered by the official seal of the Ministry of the Interior.

310
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,280
And then the number of people on the back.

311
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:04,280
Otherwise, how did the last word cover the official seal?

312
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,280
Your Majesty, this is obviously a fake account.

313
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:22,280
According to the number on the top, the tax on the withdrawal of the Linzhou Hai Mao was at least six or seven times.

314
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:29,280
The accounts in the past five years have been so poor.

315
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:34,280
If you keep going forward for ten years, I'm afraid you'll be more in the dark.

316
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:40,280
The tax on the withdrawal of the Linzhou Hai Mao has been deeply hurt.

317
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:42,280
The court should have started to organize it long ago.

318
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,280
The country has its own laws.

319
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:46,280
The Linzhou Hai Mao is not a place outside the law of my sister.

320
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,280
The treasury has been empty for the past two years.

321
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:53,280
The recovery of the Lizhou disaster requires a lot of money.

322
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:57,280
If we can make the Linzhou Hai Mao pay off the debt and return the treasury as soon as possible,

323
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:01,280
the disaster of the court can be solved.

324
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,280
The Lizhou is the land of the Su family.

325
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:08,280
The tax on the Hai Mao has been fully controlled by the Su family these years.

326
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:12,280
If you want to make a mistake, let them make up for the tax.

327
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,280
It's not a matter of life.

328
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:20,280
The one who can assess the responsibility must be the one who is deeply at peace in the middle of the door.

329
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:24,280
The tax on the withdrawal of the Linzhou is now being investigated.

330
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:27,280
It can be used to knock down the government and give the Su family a warning.

331
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:37,280
The tax on the withdrawal of the Linzhou is the duty that the court sends people every year,

332
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:41,280
but it's never returned.

333
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:54,280
The tax on the withdrawal of the Linzhou is now being investigated.

334
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:57,280
It's not a matter of life.

335
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:16,280
The one who can assess the responsibility must be the one who is deeply at peace in the middle of the door.

336
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:18,280
It's me, right?

337
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:23,280
Thanks to the advice of Ah Xu, you are a businessman.

338
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:25,280
You are very loyal to your mother-in-law.

339
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,280
I am very familiar with it.

340
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:31,280
I also think that no one in the court is more suitable than you.

341
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,280
Ah Yu,

342
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:43,280
the reason I came here in a dignified manner is because I don't want to be suppressed by the military.

343
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:49,280
This is not a sacred order, but a sincere and sincere love.

344
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,280
I understand.

345
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,280
I will take it as a yes.

346
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,280
Get up.

347
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,280
Where is Ah Xu?

348
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,280
Let him see me.

349
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:32,280
His Majesty has ordered the Crown Prince to go to the Linzhou and investigate the tax on the withdrawal of the Linzhou.

350
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:34,280
The tax on the withdrawal of the Linzhou is the duty of the Linzhou.

351
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:39,280
The Prime Minister should make a plan early to prevent the spread of the plague.

352
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:43,280
There are always two interesting people who go to the Linzhou every year.

353
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:48,280
Zhang Huaiyu has no official or position, which is not a big deal.

354
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,280
I will be patient.

355
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:54,280
He knows what to do.

356
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:13,280
This is the feast that the Crown Prince talked about?

357
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:16,280
This is the most popular wild chicken meat wonton in the county.

358
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:18,280
There is also tender bamboo shoots in it.

359
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,280
The entrance is fresh and smooth.

360
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,280
Hurry up and eat.

361
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:23,280
You can't eat it if you want to eat it in a few days.

362
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:25,280
What? This wonton shop is going to close?

363
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:34,280
This is the hard letter of the Crown Prince.

364
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:38,280
This is the key to the famous store in the villa.

365
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,280
This is the key to the villa's account book.

366
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,280
This is the key to the door of the Wen Tao Pavilion.

367
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,280
This is the key to the back door of the Wen Tao Pavilion.

368
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:46,280
This small one is the key to the secret cabinet in the villa's room.

369
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:49,280
And this is the jade pendant I've been wearing since I was a child.

370
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:51,280
No matter what kind of thing you encounter in the future,

371
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:53,280
you can use this jade pendant to go to the Duke of the Appian Mansion.

372
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:56,280
The house will definitely help you.

373
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:01,280
What's wrong with you?

374
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:03,280
What happened?

375
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:11,280
Did he have some kind of incurable disease?

376
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,280
You... You must not go back to your heart.

377
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,280
You are young and strong.

378
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,280
The medical skills of the Imperial Physicians in the palace are excellent.

379
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:19,280
There is no disease that you can't get through.

380
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:22,280
I've been eating too much lately.

381
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,280
My uncle had an accident and you got sick.

382
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:27,280
I really should choose a good day to go to the Han Yan Temple to pray.

383
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,280
I'm going to Lingzhou.

384
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:31,280
I'll leave tomorrow.

385
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,280
Just this?

386
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:37,280
You went to the faraway gate for the first time and you're acting like an old lady.

387
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,280
Let me tell you.

388
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:40,280
I can't live outside the Chuwen Tao Pavilion.

389
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:42,280
And you can take back this jade pendant.

390
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:44,280
I've been wearing it since I was a child.

391
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:46,280
How can I give it to anyone?

392
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:49,280
Min Min, you don't know.

393
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:53,280
The Imperial Court sent a spy to Lingzhou to investigate Zhou Baoping who was in debt.

394
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:55,280
The official was innocent, but he was killed by a spy.

395
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:57,280
And the officials sent last year

396
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,280
haven't been able to control Lingzhou yet.

397
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,280
The people are disappearing.

398
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:01,280
The whereabouts are still unknown.

399
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:03,280
As for the officials sent last year,

400
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,280
I don't know why,

401
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:06,280
but the people were killed by a spy.

402
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:08,280
They were killed on the spot.

403
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:12,280
I don't know what kind of death I'll be in.

404
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:22,280
Do you know what kind of men can capture the girl's heart?

405
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:31,280
Most girls like heroes who are not afraid of power, for the country and the people.

406
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,280
Look, the male lead in the story

407
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:36,280
is a hero who is not a hero.

408
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:42,280
So Miss Bai likes this kind of men.

409
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:46,280
Okay, I'll go to Lingzhou this time.

410
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:50,280
I'll solve the problem for the court and return with power.

411
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,280
I mean most girls.

412
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:56,280
I like different things.

413
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:02,280
Then what kind of men does Miss Bai like?

414
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,280
You still like Shu Er.

415
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:20,280
You don't match Shu Er.

416
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:22,280
Zhang Huiyu, are you crazy?

417
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:24,280
When did I say I like Mr. Shu Er?

418
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:26,280
I just admire his talent.

419
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,280
Besides, why do you think I don't match Shu Er?

420
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:32,280
If Shu Er doesn't match me, who else can match me?

421
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:33,280
You...

422
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:38,280
Then do I match you more?

423
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:43,280
The moon is full of flowers, you are the light

424
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:47,280
The fireflies are burning the world

425
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:51,280
The four seasons meet in the palm of my hand

426
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:54,280
The paper flowed, the life is a dream

427
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,280
What did you say?

428
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:56,280
I... I... I...

429
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:58,280
Nothing.

430
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:00,280
The moon is full of flowers, you are the light

431
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:04,280
The yearning is endless, the garden is blooming

432
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:08,280
The fireflies are burning the world

433
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:10,280
Take care, come back safely.

434
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:13,280
I don't want to see anyone's life ruined.

435
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:18,280
The paper flowed

436
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:22,280
Will Miss Bai come to see me off tomorrow?

437
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:26,280
The paper flowed

438
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,280
Miss Minmin, you are finally here.

439
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,280
What's wrong?

440
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,280
Princess's father was sentenced to death.

441
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,280
He will be executed tomorrow.

442
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,280
The Princess has not been in the room for a day or two.

443
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,280
What's the matter?

444
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,280
What time is it?

445
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:45,280
Why don't you come to the White House to find me?

446
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,280
Ha Tao!

447
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,280
Ha Tao!

448
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:27,280
Tan, if you feel bad, don't hold back.

449
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,280
Cry if you want to.

450
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,280
Tell me what you want to say.

451
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,280
We are all here.

452
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,280
It's okay.

453
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,280
I'm just a little tired.

454
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:58,280
Princess, drink some.

455
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,280
I'm fine.

456
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:40,280
When the Princess was born, the Marquis was very happy.

457
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:45,280
At that time, he was training in Qingzhou.

458
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:50,280
He brought a local special tiger back.

459
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,280
The Princess was born for the first few years.

460
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:56,280
She always held this tiger and didn't let go.

461
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:01,280
Later, the Marquis was going to Yangxilu.

462
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,280
When I went to send the message,

463
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:06,280
you asked me to bring this tiger to the Marquis.

464
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:09,280
After the Marquis returned to the capital,

465
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:17,280
I found that he had been with him for so many years.

466
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:25,280
Princess, for the Marquis, you must cheer up.

467
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,280
Cheer up!

468
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:46,280
Su Xi, did you get any news?

469
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,280
The Marquis has been waiting outside.

470
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:52,280
If there is news, it will be passed on immediately.

471
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,280
Do you know that the person who really wants to harm your father

472
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:59,280
is your husband, King Dingbei?

473
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:02,280
Your father returned to the capital because King Dingbei asked for it.

474
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:07,280
He sent the Dingbei Army to release the Marquis.

475
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:10,280
He insisted that King Dingbei had the power to help the Marquis.

476
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:12,280
King Dingbei did this

477
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:14,280
to prove your father's innocence

478
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:17,280
and to make himself out of the picture.

479
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,280
How is that possible?

480
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,280
Your father's innocence is not yet determined.

481
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:24,280
King Dingbei led the army to investigate the Marquis' mansion.

482
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,280
Why is that?

483
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:28,280
This is clearly a relationship of separation and a personal affair.

484
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:31,280
Tan'er, think about it.

485
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,280
Since your father's death,

486
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:36,280
what has he done for the Ming family?

487
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,280
The Marquis has been in the capital for many years.

488
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:42,280
He has been busy with business.

489
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:45,280
How did he get into this trouble just after returning to the capital?

490
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:48,280
Why did the Marquis' mansion just copy the news?

491
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,280
Didn't you hear?

492
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:53,280
Today, King Dingbei led the army to copy the mansion.

493
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,280
It must be because King Dingbei is afraid of getting involved.

494
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:59,280
So he took the initiative to ask for the marquis to investigate in advance.

495
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,280
He used his innocence to get himself out of the picture.

496
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:05,280
Then why did the army just copy the Marquis' mansion?

497
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:09,280
Did Lu Dianshun follow the order of His Majesty

498
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,280
or the order of His Highness?

499
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:16,280
He was indeed a soldier in the army.

500
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:19,280
After that, His Highness thought of the family's poverty

501
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,280
and gave him extra money.

502
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,280
Yan said that

503
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:45,280
if King Dingbei couldn't protect the people in the capital,

504
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:50,280
the others would have no choice.

505
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,280
But I never thought that

506
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:05,280
my marriage would be inherited from Father's destiny.

507
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,280
What does it have to do with you?

508
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,280
This is not my fault, and it's not your fault.

509
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:13,280
It's the fault of those who have the power to take advantage of the situation.

510
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:18,280
No.

511
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:20,280
I can't wait any longer.

512
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:23,280
I have to see Father.

513
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,280
I...

514
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:32,280
I still have a lot to say to Father.

515
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,280
Don't worry.

516
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,280
I'll think of a way.

517
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:43,280
I will definitely think of a way.

518
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,280
I...

519
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,280
Uncle.

520
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:58,280
Old man, how are you?

521
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,280
I've ordered everything.

522
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,280
Fortunately, His Majesty ordered the army to guard.

523
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,280
Only then can I get a chance to see Father.

524
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,280
Otherwise, even if I were Father,

525
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,280
I wouldn't be able to see him.

526
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,280
It's just...

527
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:19,280
Is there anything I can do to help you?

528
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,280
If I can't...

529
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,280
No.

530
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:26,280
It's a rumor that

531
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:30,280
your father doesn't want to see you.

532
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:34,280
What do you mean by that?

533
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:38,280
He doesn't want to see me or anyone else?

534
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:40,280
Tan'er, don't worry.

535
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,280
Don't think too much.

536
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:43,280
I think your father

537
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:46,280
doesn't want you to see him in this situation.

538
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:50,280
Old man.

539
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,280
Forget it.

540
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,280
Whatever your father thinks,

541
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,280
we'll go see him.

542
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,280
When it gets dark,

543
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:02,280
we'll go in when the two groups of soldiers are on duty.

544
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:04,280
But only for a while.

545
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:08,280
Don't go.

546
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,280
If there are too many people, it will be a problem.

547
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,280
My father-in-law loves me.

548
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:12,280
I have to see him.

549
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:13,280
Fine.

550
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,280
When it gets dark,

551
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:16,280
follow me.

552
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:18,280
Don't let Dong Zhangxi know about this.

553
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,280
Let's go.

554
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,280
That's the plan.

555
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,280
Before the show tonight,

556
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:29,280
Ayu's team must leave the capital.

557
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,280
Yes.

558
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,280
But...

559
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:34,280
Lord Zhang doesn't know about this.

560
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:36,280
If anything happens,

561
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:37,280
can you tell him?

562
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,280
I have to.

563
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:41,280
The less people, the better.

564
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,280
Yes.

565
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:46,280
I'll arrange for the guards.

566
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,280
Wait.

567
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,280
Go and tell the Prime Minister

568
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:53,280
about this in the name of Lord Jing An.

569
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,280
Prime Minister.

570
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:06,280
Lord Jing An said he wanted to see you for the last time.

571
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:08,280
This is the last time.

572
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:25,280
Why are you still so worried?

573
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:33,280
I'm not the one who can deal with the Ming family.

574
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:37,280
The Ming family is a long-standing family.

575
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:39,280
They are always together.

576
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:44,280
I've known him for more than 20 years.

577
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:49,280
Even though he never wants to show his position,

578
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:52,280
he wants to help the Su family,

579
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:57,280
I always treat him like a friend.

580
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:02,280
He shouldn't do this.

581
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:07,280
He shouldn't have married Tan'er

582
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:10,280
to Lord Dingbei.

583
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:22,280
His Majesty has ordered Lord Zhang to go to Lingzhou

584
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:25,280
and investigate the case of the tax evasion.

585
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:27,280
Tax evasion is the lifeblood of Lingzhou.

586
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,280
You should make a plan

587
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:31,280
to prevent the spread of the plague.

588
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:36,280
One hot red...

589
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,280
The one i'll eat.

590
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,280
These are dishes that you like to eat.

591
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:47,280
This wine is the dedication I've Keeped for 20 years.

592
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:49,280
On the night of Tan'er's wedding,

593
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:52,280
we had a good time.

594
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:53,280
I don't want to see

595
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:56,280
this kind of scenery.

596
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:58,280
Hey.

597
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:00,280
How can you be greedy?
