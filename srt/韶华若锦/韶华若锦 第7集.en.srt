[Episode 7]

3
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,479
Since you're satisfied,

4
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:36,200
then it's settled.

5
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:37,550
It's settled then.

6
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,160
As for Madam Liu...

7
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,560
Her offense is truly unforgivable.

8
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:56,560
I plan to send her to a nunnery,

9
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,520
where she will spend her days
in prayer and fasting

10
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,720
to atone for her sins.

11
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,320
If I remember correctly,

12
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:06,100
your second brother has taken office
in Mei'an.

13
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,680
Mei'an has many temples and nunneries.

14
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:12,340
It's an excellent place for
self-cultivation and prayer.

15
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:15,450
Mei'an?

16
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,590
But, but, but...

17
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:18,400
that's such a remote place...

18
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,800
She coveted a high position

19
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,880
and secretly plotted against my fiancÃ©e.

20
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,600
If she's not severely punished,

21
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,079
I won't be at ease.

22
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:28,850
Good.

23
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,700
Good, Mei'an is excellent.

24
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,920
Mei'an is excellent.

25
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,640
Thank you for your suggestion,
Your Highness.

26
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,560
A mere trifle.

27
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,570
Of course, I should look after
your interests, Father-in-law.

28
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,130
Father-in-law?

29
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,490
Is that inappropriate?

30
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:53,420
No, no, no, it's very appropriate.

31
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:56,170
Very appropriate indeed.

32
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,430
Very appropriate.

33
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:01,870
My Lady, My Lady.

34
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,080
After the Prince of Dingbei left,

35
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,160
His Lordship acted swiftly

36
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,890
and took care of three matters!

37
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,180
Which three?

38
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,850
The first matter was

39
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,750
the marriage of the Third Miss.

40
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,280
The Third Miss has committed
a grave mistake this time.

41
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,880
Finding a suitable husband for her
in such a short time

42
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,200
was already a difficult task.

43
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,079
But the Prince of Dingbei suggested

44
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:19,860
a match that instantly solved

45
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,660
His Lordship's urgent problem.

46
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,610
Who did he suggest?

47
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,240
The third son of General Xuanwei Feng

48
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,230
from Lingzhou.

49
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,790
How wonderful.

50
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,530
Isn't this too good for the Third Miss?

51
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,870
How is it wonderful?

52
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,000
Chu has been

53
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,520
spoiled since childhood,

54
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,880
which is why she has developed
such a temperament.

55
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,640
But I've heard the Feng family is
very strict in managing their household

56
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,280
and that young General Feng

57
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,780
is upright and resolute.

58
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,720
If she marries into that family,

59
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,480
it might just help her mend her ways.

60
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,980
Moreover, young General Feng,

61
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,560
though from a military background,

62
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,760
is said to be a reliable
and considerate man.

63
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,600
As for looks,

64
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,100
he's tall and proper.

65
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,730
For Chu...

66
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:02,580
this might not be a bad match at all.

67
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:07,330
What about the second matter?

68
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,880
The second matter was dealing with
Madam Liu.

69
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,370
His Lordship has decided to send her
to a nunnery in Mei'an,

70
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:17,029
where she will spend the rest of her days
in prayer and abstinence.

71
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:21,160
Not just to have her reflect
on her mistakes here...

72
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,470
but to send her away?

73
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:27,170
Madam Liu's fault today

74
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,240
at most counts as failing to
raise her daughter properly.

75
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,110
Why such a severe punishment?

76
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:35,500
Could it be...

77
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:41,020
that she's the one who has been secretly
colluding with the mountain bandits?

78
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:43,020
Why would she have done such a thing?

79
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,840
If my virtue had been compromised,

80
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,060
Ming Chu could have taken my place

81
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,130
and married the Prince of Dingbei.

82
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,720
They plotted against you like this,

83
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,860
and why would His Lordship choose to
conceal the truth?

84
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,480
Since they committed such a grave offense,

85
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,540
shouldn't they...

86
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,220
be punished according to family law?

87
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,720
This matter involves my reputation
and that of the family.

88
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,250
How could it be made public?

89
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,780
Besides, Madam Liu

90
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:10,100
is one of our own.

91
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:11,380
If someone

92
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,320
were to take advantage of this situation
to stir trouble,

93
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,860
claiming that our family

94
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,860
colluded with mountain bandits,

95
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,400
that would be a disaster.

96
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,860
However, in my opinion,

97
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:24,480
Father might not have been able to

98
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,080
think this through thoroughly.

99
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,080
It must have been the Prince of Dingbei
who advised him.

100
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,520
Looks like he is genuinely

101
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:34,140
considering the interests of
our Ming family.

102
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,750
Marrying him...

103
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,100
might truly allow our family to rest easy.

104
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,710

00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,660
How dare you treat me like this...

172
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,200
You...

173
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:37,440
I...

174
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,540
I want to see my father.

175
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,400
My father is the Governor of
the Capital Prefecture!

176
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,640
Even the Capital Prefecture

177
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,700
can't cover up your crimes this time.

178
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:47,770
In this year's Spring Imperial Exam,

179
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:49,440
how did you get on the list of
successful candidates

180
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,900
and achieve fourth place
in the second rank?

181
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,920
Of course, I got in

182
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:56,270
through my own ability.

183
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,880
Then tell me:

184
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:59,160
how did you answer the Classical Exegesis

185
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,220
and Doctrinal Commentary sections?

186
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,760
I've had too much to drink today.

187
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,710
M-My head's splitting.

188
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,560
I can't recall anything.

189
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:16,350
Wait...

190
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,840
Y-You're getting serious now?

191
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,380
I...

192
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,720
I honestly cannot remember the questions

193
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,280
from the Spring Imperial Exam!

194
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,000
I...

195
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,140
barely wrote anything at all.

196
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,520
Then how did you pass the exam
and achieve such a high rank?

197
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:30,970
Before the exam,

198
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,740
my father told me

199
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,520
he had already arranged everything for me.

200
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,040
As long as I entered the examination hall

201
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,500
and stayed for three days,

202
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,000
I would definitely pass.

203
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,860
That's all I know!

204
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:44,120
If you want to know more,
go ask my father!

205
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,080
Do you know how your father

206
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,600
managed to pull strings?

207
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,200
I...

208
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:49,200
I know even less about that.

209
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:53,320
I... I really don't know anything else!

210
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,280
I only know

211
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,280
my father...

212
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,440
my father went to see the chief examiner,

213
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,540
Lord Hu, several times!

214
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,500
That's all! That's all I know.

215
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:05,230
Your Majesty,

216
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,840
I have a matter to report.

217
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,240
Gu Wenyan, the son of
the Marquis of Cheng'en,

218
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,480
publicly assaulted an imperial
examination candidate.

219
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,560
He has now confessed to

220
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,160
the Marquis of Cheng'en's involvement

221
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,420
in examination fraud.

222
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,640
Based on Gu Wenyan's testimony,
the Court of Review

223
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,740
has arrested the implicated
chief examiner, Hu Changmao,

224
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:20,900
for interrogation.

225
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,160
Within half a day,

226
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,840
he confessed to everything.

227
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,370
Reporting to Your Majesty,

228
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,090
Hu Changmao has admitted

229
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:31,000
to accepting bribes from
the Marquis of Cheng'en

230
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,260
to add Gu Wenyan's name

231
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:33,680
to the examination list.

232
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,480
He also swapped Gu Wenyen's
blank test paper

233
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,880
with another candidate's,

234
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,840
helping him pass the exam and rise
to the top of the rankings.

235
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,280
I have sent people to search his residence

236
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,440
and seize the bribe money
that Hu Changmao received.

237
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,100
The evidence is irrefutable.

238
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,800
Marquis of Cheng'en,

239
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,290
do you admit your guilt?

240
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:51,900
His Majesty is wise,

241
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:54,410
but I... I... I've been wronged!

242
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,040
Your Majesty,

243
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:59,000
the crimes of the Marquis of Cheng'en
extend far beyond this.

244
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,440
After confiscating the bribe money,

245
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,200
we examined the batch and mint marks.

246
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,040
We discovered that it was all from
the military funds

247
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:07,170
allocated by the court to
the Dingbei Army two years ago.

248
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,210
Lord Gu, he...

249
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,360
Your Majesty,

250
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,400
I have been wronged, Your Majesty!

251
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,510
Your Majesty,

252
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,000
as this matter involves embezzlement
of the Dingbei Army's military funds,

253
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,520
I humbly request Your Majesty

254
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,720
to allow me to preside over this case.

255
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:25,800
Granted.

256
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
-Your Majesty, I'm innocent!
-Thank you, Your Majesty.

257
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:29,800
Guards,

258
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,580
take the Marquis of Cheng'en back
to the Capital Garrison.

259
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,610
I am innocent!

260
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:36,400
Your Majesty!

261
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,040
Your Majesty!

262
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,010
I have been wronged, Your Majesty!

263
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,270
Your Majesty!

264
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:46,110
I have been wronged, Your Majesty!

265
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:00,880
Chancellor.

266
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,480
The Court of Review has just searched

267
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,160
the Marquis of Cheng'en's residence
by order

268
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,490
and found another 20,000 taels of silver.

269
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,000
It had been hidden by his concubine,

270
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,060
who is also Gu Wenyan's birth mother.

271
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,360
Perhaps even the Marquis himself

272
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,000
was unaware of this.

273
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:19,460
How incredibly stupid.

274
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:22,440
Any movement from
the Prince of Dingbei's side?

275
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:23,620
No movement yet.

276
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,000
The Marquis of Cheng'en has always been
loyal to you, Chancellor.

277
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:28,760
I believe

278
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:30,490
he won't reveal anything.

279
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,230
The Prince of Dingbei

280
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:36,130
wants to use Gu Jinzhong to
create an opening

281
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,240
and uproot everyone

282
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,520
connected to the case.

283
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,770
He's a man who will stop at nothing.

284
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,360
Gu Jinzhong may not be able to endure it.

285
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,520
In the face of life and death,

286
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,640
how much is loyalty truly worth?

287
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,040
Gu Jinzhong...

288
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:56,910
cannot be kept alive.

289
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:01,200
However, the position of Governor of
the Capital Prefecture

290
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,930
must not fall into enemy hands.

291
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,040
Yes, Chancellor.

292
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,200
Then...

293
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:08,420
what about the Ming family?

294
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,180
I know Tan's temperament well.

295
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,270
If she's unwilling,

296
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:14,630
no one can force her.

297
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,440
The Prince of Dingbei

298
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,930
is absolutely not her destined match.

299
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:20,960
Until the wedding occurs,

300
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,560
anything can still change.

301
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:24,130
No matter what,

302
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:26,530
they can't get married.

303
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:36,350
[Graceful as Orchid, Pure as Angelica]

304
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:54,000
These pieces of craftsmanship
are quite good.

305
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:56,470
Oh, right, Suxin,

306
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,840
don't forget to take in the waist

307
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:58,860
of the wedding robe a bit more.

308
00:14:58,860 --> 00:14:59,890
It should fit snugly at my waist

309
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:01,680
to better accentuate my figure.

310
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,410
Yes, My Lady.

311
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:05,490
Listen, Tan.

312
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,540
You've altered your robe
five times already,

313
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,000
and I can't even notice

314
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,160
the differences.

315
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:11,880
This is about

316
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,840
my and my family's dignity.

317
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,160
How can I not be meticulous about it?

318
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,560
I heard that Bieyu House

319
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,730
is especially lively tonight.

320
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,450
Let's go join in the fun!

321
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,160
Have you lost your mind?

322
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:32,750
Do you know what kind of place
Bieyu House is?

323
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,040
How can young ladies like us

324
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,360
go there for entertainment?

325
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,560
Actually, Bieyu House

326
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,040
is just a place for singing and dancing.

327
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,400
I heard from my second brother

328
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,320
that there's nothing

329
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,050
too scandalous going on there.

330
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,680
It's mostly men gathering
for small parties

331
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:45,640
and enjoying performances.

332
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,360
Even if there are beautiful girls
accompanying them,

333
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,000
it's just for chatting and entertainment,

334
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,330
merely to pass the time.

335
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,110
But I still feel that...

336
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:56,560
for young ladies like us to go there,

337
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,240
it would sound improper if word got out.

338
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,130
Tan,

339
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,410
I only suggested it for your sake.

340
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,640
I heard from my second brother

341
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,820
that before going to Bieyu House,
Miss Shuiying

342
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:06,990
was once a top courtesan,
beautiful and talented.

343
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:08,320
Not only are her singing
and dancing unparalleled,

344
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,650
but she's also an excellent guqin player.

345
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,640
You mean

346
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,870
you want me to go learn
from Miss Shuiying...

347
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:21,240
how to entice my husband?

348
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,400
No!

349
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,800
I mean, you and she

350
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,600
could exchange guqin playing skills

351
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,400
and become musical companions.

352
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,000
We've been busy preparing for
the wedding nonstop lately.

353
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,320
It's truly exhausting.

354
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,640
We really ought to get out for a bit

355
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,100
and release some tension.

356
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,080
It'd be good to go out for some fresh air.

357
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:39,560
If Miss Shuiying is truly skilled at
playing the guqin,

358
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,960
then she's worth a visit.

359
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,440
In fact, quite a few noble ladies
in the capital

360
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,600
have secretly visited Bieyu House

361
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,600
for entertainment.

362
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,960
If so many people have gone,

363
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,320
what's wrong with us going to have a look?

364
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,160
Besides,

365
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,440
we're just going to catch a glimpse of

366
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,880
Miss Shuiying's elegance and grace.

367
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,680
We'll be in a private room,
behind a screen.

368
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,320
No one will recognize us.

369
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:57,560
Moreover,

370
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,200
after you get married,

371
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,040
you'll rarely get the chance

372
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,520
to go out for fun like this.

373
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:03,180
You do have a point.

374
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:07,200
But I've actually seen

375
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,730
Miss Shuiying once before.

376
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:12,680
She is truly graceful

377
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:14,310
and charmingly attractive.

378
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:15,460
Really?

379
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,450
[Bieyu House]

380
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:25,569
[Dancing Wind and Spinning Snow]

381
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:38,080
Miss Shuiying.

382
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,600
That is Miss Shuiying.

383
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,110
This way.

384
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:01,460
Have some tea.

385
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:07,960
Minmin.

386
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,000
Aren't you at odds

387
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
with Bieyu House?

388
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,800
Aren't you afraid of running into
someone we know?

389
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,600
We're both so well covered up.

390
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:18,490
Who could possibly recognize us?

391
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,320
Mr. Bai.

392
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:25,460
Miss Shuiying.

393
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:29,620
This is my sister and my cousin.

394
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,700
[Bai Haoyu, Second Son of
the Duke of Chang]

395
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,400
They've come with me today specifically

396
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:31,960
to glimpse

397
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,160
your grace.

398
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,640
The young ladies are still young,

399
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,840
innocent at heart.

400
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,070
As such,

401
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:42,320
allow me to pour a cup of tea...

402
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,900
for both young ladies.

403
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,560
Thank you for this honor.

404
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,290
If you don't mind,

405
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,940
you could come to my room

406
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,200
and sit for a while.

407
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:05,560
Please, Miss.

408
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,990
Miss Ming's visit today

409
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,630
is not just

410
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,570
to see me, is it?

411
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:22,880
I would like to

412
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,990
learn the art of guqin from you, Shuiying.

413
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:27,920
As it happens, I've just acquired
a rare guqin score.

414
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:34,480
Please wait a moment, Miss.

415
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,240
I'll go

416
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,600
fetch the guqin for you.

417
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,640
Haoyu!

418
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,120
What a rare guest.

419
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:07,600
Young Lord Zhang,

420
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,800
it's been a long time.

421
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,010
Please, have a seat.

422
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,360
Miss Bai?

423
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,980
Miss Bai, this isn't your first visit.

424
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,400
Why so reserved?

425
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,480
You two...

426
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:24,770
know each other?

427
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,080
Yes, we do.

428
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:29,990
Bieyu House is well-known.

429
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:30,880
My sister came here

430
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,540
just to broaden her horizons.

431
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,440
The doors of Bieyu House

432
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,300
are always open for you, Miss Bai.

433
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,360
I'm at your service anytime.

434
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,400
Why is he being so courteous today?

435
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,480
Erbao.

436
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,080
Erbao!

437
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:51,370
Master.

438
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:53,030
Master.

439
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,880
Go fetch that bottle of
imperial tribute wine

440
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,440
that I've been saving all this time.

441
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,680
Also, tell the kitchen

442
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,140
to prepare a proper feast.

443
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,560
Master,

444
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:01,920
which dishes would you like?

445
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:02,880
Please specify.

446
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,640
Whatever's most extravagant.

447
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,480
Tell the kitchen

448
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,460
to prepare the feast according to

449
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:07,790
our highest standards.

450
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:14,330
Understood, Master.

451
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:30,640
Miss Bai,

452
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,400
this is "Grape Wine"

453
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,440
from the Western Regions.

454
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,960
Only five bottles are produced each year.

455
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,280
When the Western Regions presented it
as tribute,

456
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,440
our Xian received only two bottles.

457
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,600
Another bottle is with His Majesty.

458
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,680
Also my brother-in-law.

459
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,680
This is absolutely unique.

460
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,480
Other people couldn't get a taste,
even if they wanted to.

461
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,280
This wine is sweet on the palate,

462
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,440
with a rich, fruity aroma

463
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,770
and a deep, vibrant hue.

464
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,680
It's truly a divine wine,

465
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,550
the finest flavor under heaven.

466
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:58,070
Here.

467
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,570
Such a fine wine,

468
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,690
how can you bear

469
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,920
to serve it to guests?

470
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:06,200
You're worthy of it.

471
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,790
Please, Miss Bai, have a taste.

472
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:14,680
Haoyu,

473
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:16,400
only beautiful ladies deserve fine wine.

474
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,680
If we men were to drink it,

475
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,220
wouldn't it be like a cow
chewing on peonies,

476
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:21,220
a waste of heaven's gifts, isn't it?

477
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,390
Come on, Haoyu!

478
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,370
Don't put down your cup, and drink
as much as you like.

479
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:36,680
How is it?

480
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,800
Fragrant and rich, with a
sweet aftertaste.

481
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,850
It truly is a divine wine.

482
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,290
If you like it,

483
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,620
when the annual tribute comes
in the future,

484
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:48,350
I'll save a bottle just for you.

485
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,350
What's gotten into him?

486
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,880
Eat more, you've gotten thin.

487
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:05,060
And this, try this too.

488
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:13,760
Don't like it?

489
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:14,880
Miss Bai,

490
00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:16,640
whatever you want to eat, just say it.

491
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,440
I'll have the kitchen prepare it
right away.

492
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,280
No, no need.

493
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,440
Young Lord Zhang,

494
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,960
what's wrong with you today?

495
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,020
Are you possessed?

496
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,500
I...

497
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,020
It's that I have

498
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,780
come to learn a few things.

499
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,880
Like a mirror reflecting clear springs,
no words are needed.

500
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:38,130
You and I have a tacit understanding.

501
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,250
I understand.

502
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:43,940
Do you understand?

503
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,240
I...

504
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:48,900
should I understand?

505
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,370
Could it be that the talisman
has taken effect?

506
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,080
Is it really that effective?

507
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,170
No, I must test it.

508
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,280
Zhang Huaiyu!

509
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,280
You're being unusually hospitable today.

510
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,480
Could it be that you have a favor
to ask of me?

511
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,680
I have no favors to ask.

512
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,540
I only want you to come more often.

513
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,600
Perhaps you want to use me

514
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,200
to promote the storybooks from
Wentao Pavilion

515
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,530
and attract customers?

516
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:16,600
Miss Bai,

517
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,080
whether business is good or not

518
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,310
is of no importance

519
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:20,810
to me.

520
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,880
I know you love reading storybooks.

521
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,810
This entire Bieyu House of mine...

522
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,770
That whole Wentao Pavilion of mine

523
00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:31,490
can be opened exclusively for you.

524
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,800
Could it be that Young Lord Zhang
has feelings for you?

525
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,040
Feelings, my foot!

526
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,120
We're lucky not to be

527
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,930
clawing at each other's throats.

528
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:42,570
Then...

529
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,950
If not for money...

530
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,650
could it be for someone?

531
00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:52,690
No way!

532
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:53,800
I don't agree!

533
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:54,850
This is too much!

534
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,160
You've only met Nanzhi a few times,

535
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,680
and you already have such thoughts?

536
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,840
Nanzhi and I grew up together.

537
00:24:58,840 --> 00:24:59,880
We're like sisters.

538
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,490
I must find her a good husband

539
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:02,360
and have her be his wife!

540
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,720
How could she come to your Bieyu House

541
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:04,680
to work for you?

542
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,440
Not you, but Nanzhi?

543
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,240
Wait,

544
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,140
who is Nanzhi?

545
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,240
Drop the act.

546
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,680
Don't I know what kind of person you are?

547
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,560
You always put profit first,

548
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:15,880
and everything's a transaction.

549
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:19,200
You must have an ulterior motive,
offering such fine wine and food.

550
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,320
If you're truly a gentleman,

551
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,400
just speak your mind.

552
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,200
Don't be so evasive,

553
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,440
like a bashful maiden.

554
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,680
No, no.

555
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:25,960
I... I... I...

556
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:28,130
I'm like a bashful maiden?

557
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,240
After all,

558
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,930
we have no friendship between us.

559
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:32,240
Why do I deserve such fine treatment?

560
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,200
I only ask that you and I

561
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,880
go our separate ways from now on,

562
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,540
not interfering with each other
and maintaining no connection.

563
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:38,680
Is that so difficult?

564
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,200
Young Lord Zhang's actions today

565
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,280
have left me truly uneasy.

566
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,740
I don't understand at all.

567
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:46,440
You... you don't understand?

568
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,200
Fine!

569
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,880
Then Miss Bai's meaning

570
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
is even more unclear to me now.

571
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,810
Please, Master, grant me a talisman

572
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:03,710
to help this believer ward off
backstabbers,

573
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:05,840
dispel disasters, and avoid dangers.

574
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,660
Thank you, Master.

575
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,300
Could it be that he found that out?

576
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,280
Young Lord Zhang,

577
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,880
what is the meaning of this?

578
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,640
It should be I who asks you,

579
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,920
"What does this mean?"

580
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,000
That's right!

581
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,080
That's exactly what I mean!

582
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:25,960
So what?

583
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,680
I just want some peace of mind!

584
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,280
Why do you have to treat me like this?

585
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,240
So petty.

586
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,770
Haoyu, let's go.

587
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:32,940
Go?

588
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:33,880
Minmin,

589
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,680
aren't you waiting for Tan anymore?

590
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,360
Minmin!

591
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,800
Ridiculous.

592
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,130
You're ridiculous!

593
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:48,640
Tan?

594
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,560
Miss Ming is here too?

595
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,210
What did you say?

596
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,670
I just asked Shuiying,

597
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:58,880
and she said Miss Ming

598
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,440
is currently in her room.

599
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,200
Miss Ming?

600
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,800
What is she doing at Bieyu House?

601
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,080
She's already here to see Shuiying.

602
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,600
What else could it be?

603
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,240
As the wedding approaches,

604
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:13,000
there are undercurrents stirring.

605
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,800
Bieyu House is full of all sorts.

606
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,200
You...

607
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:44,370
Miss Shuiying...

608
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:48,750
Don't look!

609
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:52,460
You...

610
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:54,610
say "don't" to me?

611
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,760
Y-Y-Your Highness,

612
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,920
why are you here?

613
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:01,940
Give it back to me!

614
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:48,340
I did not come here today

615
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:50,610
for what Your Highness is imagining.

616
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:52,360
Regardless of the reason,

617
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,830
Bieyu House is not a place a lady like you

618
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:54,960
should be visiting.

619
00:28:55,370 --> 00:28:56,890
With the wedding approaching,

620
00:28:56,890 --> 00:28:58,760
many eyes are watching from the shadows.

621
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,520
They'd be all too eager to seize on

622
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,600
any mistake to prevent this marriage.

623
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,800
Miss Ming, you should consider
the bigger picture.

624
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:07,060
I will escort you back to your residence.

625
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:08,610
I wouldn't dare to trouble Your Highness.

626
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:09,930
I can return on my own.

627
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,240
If not,

628
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,530
then I'll go ask the Marquis of Jing'an

629
00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:16,930
to come and take you home.

630
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:21,280
I'll do as Your Highness wishes.

631
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,460
The esteemed Prince of Dingbei,

632
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,440
escorting someone on foot?

633
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:46,550
No carriage is understandable,

634
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,160
but not even a horse?

635
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,080
Truly a brute.

636
00:29:55,770 --> 00:29:56,700
What did you say?

637
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:10,160
Thank you for escorting me, Your Highness.

638
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,190
Now that we've reached your residence,

639
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:13,830
I shall take my leave.

640
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:17,560
Your Highness!

641
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:22,610
Since we're to marry by contract,

642
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,300
it's better to clarify

643
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,280
some things beforehand.

644
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,130
Go on, speak freely.

645
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,020
Why does Your Highness...

646
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,570
frequently visit Bieyu House?

647
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,960
Just now, you didn't even knock

648
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,640
before entering Miss Shuiying's chamber.

649
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,620
Could it be that Your Highness...

650
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,540
is an honored guest of Bieyu House

651
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,320
and has a...

652
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:52,500
special...

653
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:55,210
relationship with Miss Shuiying?

654
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,880
I don't mean to interfere with

655
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,000
Your Highness's personal affairs.

656
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,040
I just think

657
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,240
that since we are to be married,

658
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,500
it's better to know...

659
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,080
certain things early.

660
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:09,040
Bieyu House is a front
for my secret guards.

661
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:11,760
Shuiying is one of them.

662
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:14,330
That's it?

663
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:23,050
Since you're already at the door,

664
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:25,210
why don't you go in and sit for a moment?

665
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,360
Have a cup of tea before leaving.

666
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:28,640
It's getting late.

667
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:29,330
I...

668
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:31,330
shouldn't stay for long.

669
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:33,320
Your Highness has misunderstood.

670
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,650
I was actually thinking

671
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:35,920
that since we've agreed to

672
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,120
a contract marriage,

673
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:39,280
we should properly sign the contract

674
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,390
before the wedding ceremony.

675
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:53,500
[Graceful as Orchid, Pure as Angelica]

676
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,880
After returning from the Capital Garrison,

677
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,200
I have carefully considered

678
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,600
and drafted this contract with great care.

679
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:08,220
Please review it, Your Highness.

680
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:11,920
[Contract]

681
00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:13,410
If there are any disagreements,

682
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,080
we can discuss them further.

683
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:16,880
After the wedding,

684
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:17,800
Your Highness and I

685
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:20,060
must maintain the appearance
of husband and wife.

686
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:22,260
Therefore, I propose three rules:

687
00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:23,680
First,

688
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:25,610
under all circumstances,

689
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:28,500
Your Highness must protect my family
from any harm.

690
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:29,690
Second,

691
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,600
Your Highness needs to

692
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,870
consider my reputation and face
in all matters.

693
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:35,790
No matter how we get along

694
00:32:35,810 --> 00:32:37,850
or any disagreements between us,

695
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,900
whenever there are outsiders present,

696
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:42,430
we must present ourselves
as a loving couple.

697
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:44,640
The young ladies of the capital

698
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,840
previously viewed Your Highness as...

699
00:32:47,850 --> 00:32:49,530
a nightmare for their marriage prospects.

700
00:32:49,530 --> 00:32:51,260
Now that I'm going to marry you,

701
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,200
there are surely many people waiting

702
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,360
to laugh at me.

703
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,080
But I intend to make them

704
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,160
green with envy

705
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,400
and full of regret.

706
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:01,750
Third,

707
00:33:02,970 --> 00:33:04,010
mutual respect,

708
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,000
maintaining a friendly distance.

709
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:06,960
Especially...

710
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,520
especially in our bridal chamber,

711
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:11,560
Your Highness must not make

712
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:12,890
any improper advances.

713
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,080
Fourth,

714
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:17,550
our finances will be managed separately,
with no interference.

715
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:22,120
[Breezes of Grace and Harmony]

716
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,400
The above

717
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:19,560
are all the requests I can

718
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,690
think of at present.

719
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:23,180
Does Your Highness have any objections?

720
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,120
If there are no objections,

721
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,680
please sign and seal it.

722
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,310
Any future disputes will be

723
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:36,310
resolved according to these terms.

724
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:42,100
[Ming Tan] [Jiang Xu]

725
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,360
It's just signing and sealing.

726
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,620
Your Highness doesn't need to...

727
00:33:52,390 --> 00:33:53,990
go to such dramatic lengths.

728
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,680
Miss Ming, you've written so meticulously,

729
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:00,280
clearly placing great value
on this contract.

730
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,810
If I didn't seal it in blood,

731
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,200
wouldn't that be showing disrespect

732
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,730
to your spirit of contract?

733
00:34:13,170 --> 00:34:17,420
[Breezes of Grace and Harmony]

734
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:37,179
I can handle such a small matter myself!

735
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:47,370
[Ming Tan] [Jiang Xu]

736
00:34:58,130 --> 00:35:01,230
[Ming Tan] [Jiang Xu]

737
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:07,120
[Marquis of Jing'an's Mansion]

738
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:21,800
My Lady,

739
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,880
the palace has revised
the embroidery patterns

740
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,280
according to your requirements.

741
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,740
Please take another look.

742
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,000
The wedding is tomorrow.

743
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,840
Even though there are still things
that don't meet my satisfaction,

744
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:31,960
there's no time left

745
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,440
to send it back for alterations, right?

746
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,960
Who would dare neglect the wedding robe

747
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,320
of the Princess of Dingbei?

748
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,180
No matter how late, someone will surely
be waiting.

749
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,530
This revision

750
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:50,140
is very much to my liking.

751
00:35:56,310 --> 00:35:58,770
I can't believe I'm really
getting married.

752
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,440
All of this

753
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,280
feels like a dream.

754
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,800
My Lady's dream

755
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,040
must be a sweet one.

756
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:08,480
You'll be part of the royal family soon,

757
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,480
a member of the imperial household.

758
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,580
After I'm married,

759
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,400
this vast estate

760
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,600
will only have Father left.

761
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:22,920
My Lady,

762
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,680
you're not marrying far away.

763
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:25,840
Why be sorrowful?

764
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,370
The Prince of Dingbei's mansion is only

765
00:36:28,370 --> 00:36:30,080
a few streets away from our mansion.

766
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,880
If you miss His Lordship,

767
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,460
you can come back anytime.

768
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,140
Come to think of it, you're right.

769
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:43,720
My Lady, it's time for your makeup trial.

770
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:44,640
The jasmine rouge you ordered

771
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:45,800
from Lancui Pavilion

772
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,440
has been delivered to the gatehouse.

773
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:47,920
Good,

774
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,540
fetch it, and let me try it on.

775
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,270
Yes, My Lady.

776
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:51,480
The shade of the rouge

777
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,410
needs to match the wedding attire.

778
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:54,640
Yes.

779
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:56,560
Oh, right.

780
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:00,160
Among the betrothal gifts sent by
the Prince of Dingbei,

781
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,620
is there a headdress made of
eastern pearls?

782
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,090
-Eastern pearls?
-Yes.

783
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:06,690
Those pearls

784
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,560
would indeed complement

785
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,320
the princess consort's attire.

786
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,650
Bring that headdress here
for me to try on.

787
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:14,300
-Yes, My Lady.
-Yes, My Lady.

788
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:33,760
Mother.

789
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,520
Ms. Zhang said

790
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,600
that your favorite accessory in life

791
00:37:40,570 --> 00:37:42,100
was this Zhaoshui hairpin.

792
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:49,290
I'm getting married tomorrow.

793
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,370
I will definitely wear it,

794
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,480
as if you were

795
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,760
personally witnessing my

796
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,680
grand wedding.

797
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:13,930
Who's there?

798
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:17,690
His Lordship has secretly searched

799
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:18,590
the entire mansion thoroughly

800
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:20,230
but hasn't found any trace
of the young lady.

801
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:21,720
Has he sent anyone outside
the estate to search?

802
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,360
His Lordship knows this matter is
of great importance,

803
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,400
so he doesn't dare to make it public.

804
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,080
Therefore, he ordered me to report
to you quickly.

805
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:28,750
Please, Your Highness, go and discuss
what should be done.

806
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:29,750
Has there been any

807
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:32,550
unusual activity in the mansion
these days?

808
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,320
I am foolish

809
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,250
and have not noticed anything.

810
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:43,540
Send people to search throughout the city,

811
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:45,200
especially at the city gates!

812
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,450
Yes, Your Highness.

813
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,440
In the room, aside from some rouge

814
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,520
scattered on the floor,

815
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,120
everything else is as usual.

816
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:05,220
It's just that My Lady is missing.

817
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,480
Tan is such a well-liked child.

818
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,610
She's never made enemies with anyone.

819
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,090
After careful consideration,

820
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:16,800
the other party must be targeting
the wedding.

821
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,320
Someone doesn't want

822
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,050
tomorrow's wedding to happen.

823
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:23,480
Although my mansion isn't impenetrable,

824
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:25,280
the guards on duty are present

825
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,750
around the clock without breaks!

826
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:28,240
How could Tan, such a grown person,

827
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,360
just disappear so quietly

828
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,440
without a trace?

829
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:33,200
Sir.

830
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:36,680
The people from the Haiyou Sect

831
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:38,440
were just fighting with the soldiers
at the city gate.

832
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:40,040
It caused quite a commotion.

833
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,400
I chased them out of the city

834
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,610
and discovered they were

835
00:39:42,610 --> 00:39:43,600
deliberately leading pursuers

836
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,260
toward the Western Mountains.

837
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:46,550
Haiyou Sect?

838
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,080
That sect from the martial arts world

839
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,810
that deals in killing for hire?

840
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,250
There's one more thing.

841
00:39:54,390 --> 00:39:56,020
On my way back, I noticed

842
00:39:56,050 --> 00:39:57,350
a set of wheel tracks from a carriage

843
00:39:57,350 --> 00:39:58,190
heading east.

844
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,960
I don't know whether it's a coincidence

845
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:02,980
or if they've split into two groups.

846
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:06,170
Isn't scheming and infighting

847
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:08,260
in the imperial court enough?

848
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:11,140
Now they have to involve my daughter
as well?

849
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:14,060
I'm going to the Western Mountains

850
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:15,320
and burn down their nest right now.

851
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,240
Please wait.

852
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,400
The Haiyou Sect deliberately
caused trouble

853
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,760
at the city gate precisely to

854
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,490
leave a trail and lure me there.

855
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:27,630
Since I am their target,

856
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,650
Miss Ming, being a hostage,

857
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:32,170
should not be in immediate danger for now.

858
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,320
Please leave this matter to me.

859
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:35,640
I ask that you remain here

860
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:37,430
to maintain control of the situation.

861
00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:38,560
Tomorrow's wedding

862
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,800
must proceed without any
further complications.

863
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:43,820
You mean...

864
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,800
the wedding will go on
as planned tomorrow?

865
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:47,600
Of course.

866
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,800
Miss Ming's disappearance

867
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,000
cannot be made known.

868
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:52,760
Before I return,

869
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:55,520
please maintain control of the situation.

870
00:40:58,390 --> 00:40:59,200
Alright.

871
00:41:00,610 --> 00:41:02,340
I will do as Your Highness says.

872
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,260
If I don't make it back in time,

873
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:10,540
then tomorrow,

874
00:41:10,610 --> 00:41:13,120
follow the protocol arranged by
the Ministry of Rites

875
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:15,520
and invite the Prince of Rui here
for the wedding procession.

876
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,320
Rest assured.

877
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:47,400
[Hai Shen, Chief of the Haiyou Sect]

878
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:48,500
Capture the Prince of Dingbei!

879
00:41:52,090 --> 00:41:53,890
Jinyun Guards, heed my command!

880
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,260
Capture every member of the Haiyou Sect.

881
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:08,470
If anyone resists,

882
00:42:08,850 --> 00:42:10,250
execute them on the spot!

883
00:42:46,610 --> 00:42:47,840
Good sir,

884
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:49,370
we are complete strangers

885
00:42:49,370 --> 00:42:50,430
with no grudges between us.

886
00:42:50,430 --> 00:42:51,840
Why did you capture me?

887
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:56,060
Good sir, great hero,

888
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:57,760
if you let me go,

889
00:42:57,780 --> 00:42:58,970
I promise not to tell anyone,

890
00:42:58,970 --> 00:43:00,160
nor will I report this to the authorities!

891
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,770
I can even reward you handsomely,

892
00:43:01,770 --> 00:43:03,500
ensuring you a life of comfort!

893
00:43:19,250 --> 00:43:20,410
Thinking it over,

894
00:43:21,090 --> 00:43:23,090
the only reason to abduct me

895
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:24,360
on the eve of my wedding is to prevent me

896
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:26,420
from marrying the Prince of Dingbei.

897
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:28,700
Oh, Jiang Xu, Jiang Xu,

898
00:43:28,990 --> 00:43:30,680
if I had known that marrying you would be
so dangerous,

899
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:32,350
I might as well have become a nun instead!
