1
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,800
Good!

2
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,880
Is that you?

3
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:11,880
What a coincidence.

4
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,320
What a coincidence?

5
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,400
You two are a perfect couple

6
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,400
Couldn't you two meet frequently?

7
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,240
What a set-up!

8
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,880
There're many responsible people

9
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,560
Every man must meet their multif valour

10
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,480
And they'reaudience to each other

11
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:49,280
습니다.

12
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,040
I'm worried about myself.

13
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,120
I think Tan is a gentleman,

14
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,560
he knows the book and is well-mannered.

15
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,520
He is a perfect match for Mr. Shu.

16
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,360
I've said it.

17
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,400
Miss Ming is interested in Shu.

18
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,880
I don't care if I'm interested in him.

19
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,680
I just hope we never meet again.

20
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,960
It's a bad time for her,

21
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,400
health is the prime news for me.

22
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,440
would you like to have a look around?

23
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,480
Are you silly?

24
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,880
I would go there and look around.

25
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:42,520
You are such a deceive woman.

26
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,640
Why don't you feel ashamed to speak tough letters with me?

27
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,480
Now only questions left.

28
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,680
Your Majesty, I'm here to see you.

29
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,680
I'm not going to make a fool of you.

30
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,680
I called you here today to discuss the marriage.

31
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,680
Your Majesty.

32
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,680
This matter...

33
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:13,680
Do you know that Shoukang Palace has been accused of defying you many times?

34
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,680
It's already been decided.

35
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,680
Your Majesty, the Empress Dowager is right.

36
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:24,680
Your Majesty, the Empress Dowager is not even willing to do her duty.

37
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,680
She's already forced to marry.

38
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,680
But I can give you a second choice.

39
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,680
How about I choose your daughter's husband?

40
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,680
Please take a look, Marquis Jing An.

41
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:46,680
In fact, a daughter's marriage is not your position.

42
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,680
You don't have to worry too much.

43
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,680
You don't have to think about anything else.

44
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,680
You just need to look at the person.

45
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,680
The Empress Dowager and I have chosen for you.

46
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,680
Can you compare them?

47
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,680
Your Majesty, this...

48
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,680
Please allow me to think about it.

49
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,680
The Empress Dowager has always been like this.

50
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,680
She's always been like this.

51
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,680
I was the one who tried to suppress her temporarily.

52
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,680
But I could suppress her temporarily.

53
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,680
But I can't suppress her forever.

54
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,680
Perhaps you haven't left the palace yet.

55
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,680
She's already been in your house.

56
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,680
The Empress Dowager's will has arrived.

57
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,680
Marquis Jing An's name is hereby announced.

58
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,680
Please accept the decree.

59
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,680
Your Highness, Miss Si is not in the palace right now.

60
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,680
Send someone to look for her.

61
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,680
The Empress Dowager is the most strict.

62
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:52,680
She must not be allowed to read the decree.

63
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,680
Yes.

64
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,680
Go now.

65
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,680
Yes.

66
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,680
Marquis Jing An, why are you hesitating?

67
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,680
If it wasn't for that person, I wouldn't have...

68
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,680
Go away.

69
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,680
I'll go.

70
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,680
Lu Yiding.

71
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,680
Yes.

72
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,680
Go and announce the decree to Marquis Jing An.

73
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,680
Yes.

74
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,680
I'm afraid...

75
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,680
Tan'er is not in the palace today.

76
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,680
Young Master Shu!

77
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,680
Why did Young Master Shu ride a horse?

78
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,680
After the horse ride,

79
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,680
everyone is going to cross the river.

80
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,680
Young Master Shu is coming this way.

81
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,680
Young Master Shu!

82
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,680
Miss Bai, Miss Ming.

83
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,680
Young Master Shu is a very talented man.

84
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,680
He is very talented.

85
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,680
I'm very pleased to meet you.

86
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,680
Thank you for your kind words.

87
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,680
I'm very pleased to meet you.

88
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,680
Thank you for your kind words.

89
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,680
Who was I talking to?

90
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:17,680
It was Miss Ming who was just married.

91
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,680
Miss Ming is still a good person.

92
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:28,680
It seems that the marriage was not affected by you.

93
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,680
Thank you for your compliment.

94
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,680
Didn't you say that you would be in Hanyan Temple for 49 days?

95
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,680
I came back to the capital in a few days.

96
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,680
Shu'er!

97
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,680
It's rare to see you.

98
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,680
Greetings, Princess.

99
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,680
Prince Zhang is here too.

100
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,680
I was waiting for Shu'er.

101
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,680
She is very tired and can't cross the river.

102
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:58,680
I knew that you are not a good person.

103
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,680
It's too late to wait for her.

104
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,680
Thank you for your compliment.

105
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,680
You are dressed so well.

106
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,680
Did you just get married?

107
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,680
Did you find a new family?

108
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,680
Enough!

109
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,680
I'm just trying to look good.

110
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,680
I don't want to be a burden to my future.

111
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:26,680
Marriage is a matter of parents.

112
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,680
How can I decide it myself?

113
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,680
There are not many families in the whole of Hanyan

114
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,680
that can be as lucky as you.

115
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:40,680
Your Highness, you are so lucky to marry a man like Prince Dingbei.

116
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:43,680
I heard that there is no other woman in the family.

117
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,680
You married a man who is a single man.

118
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:52,680
You are the only one who can marry a man who is a single man.

119
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:59,680
Do you know why the peonies in Prince Dingbei's family are so beautiful?

120
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,680
I don't know.

121
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:10,680
I heard that Prince Dingbei buried all the women in the family in the garden.

122
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,680
He fed them with their blood.

123
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,680
Oh my God!

124
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,680
Really?

125
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,680
Don't be surprised.

126
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,680
Don't be surprised.

127
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,680
These are just rumors from our family.

128
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,680
It's just a rumor.

129
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:39,680
We are not capable of getting along with a man like Prince Dingbei.

130
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:44,680
Only a woman like you can marry a man who is a man of honor.

131
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:49,680
We will definitely marry you.

132
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,680
I just got married.

133
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,680
I won't be able to spend time with you.

134
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:00,680
Just to tell you that I am screamsome and have en disciplinary powers

135
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,680
Here is the imperial edict.

136
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,480
This is will.

137
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:31,240
heavenly

138
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:39,740
v�

139
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,740
the Princess of the North

140
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,740
and the Prince of the North

141
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,740
will be given a special order

142
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,740
and the order will be given

143
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:49,740
Who is it?

144
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,740
Who is it?

145
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:53,740
You

146
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:55,740
What do you want me to do?

147
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:57,740
What do you want me to do?

148
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,740
Princess of the North

149
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:01,740
This is called the wind and the earth

150
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,740
and you can do whatever you want

151
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,740
Ata

152
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:14,740
Ata

153
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:23,740
Slow down

154
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:25,740
So this marriage

155
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:27,740
was arranged by father himself

156
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:29,740
Of course

157
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:31,740
You don't know

158
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:33,740
Today the Empress Dowager gave a marriage decree

159
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:35,740
Not only one

160
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,740
The first one was stopped by the Emperor

161
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,740
But she can write, speak and write

162
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,740
One decree was stopped by the Emperor

163
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,740
and the second one was stopped by the Emperor

164
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,740
The Empress Dowager knew that

165
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,740
the Emperor was in a hurry today

166
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,740
for the marriage

167
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,740
So the second one

168
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,740
was stopped by the Emperor

169
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:55,740
What about the decree of the Emperor?

170
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:57,740
I was so smart

171
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:59,740
I know Tan'er is not in the palace today

172
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:01,740
and the Empress Dowager

173
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:03,740
is always strict

174
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:05,740
She never gives a decree

175
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:07,740
So I gave Tan'er

176
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,740
the decree of the Emperor

177
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:11,740
in the house of the Emperor

178
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:13,740
and the Empress Dowager

179
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:15,740
I was so smart

180
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,740
I gave the decree first

181
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,740
and the decree was stopped

182
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,740
Although it was a bit of a twist

183
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:25,740
she was happy

184
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:27,740
What's wrong with you?

185
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,740
You must be tired

186
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:31,740
from the wedding

187
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,740
Take a good rest

188
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:35,740
I'll write

189
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:37,740
I won't disturb you

190
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,740
Oh no

191
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:47,740
I'm so speechless

192
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:49,740
What should I say?

193
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:51,740
If King Dingbei is really like a spy

194
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:53,740
What should you do in the future?

195
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,740
I must think that I did a smart thing

196
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:57,740
But the wedding

197
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:59,740
was more difficult

198
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:01,740
than the one of the Liang family

199
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,740
I underestimated

200
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:29,940
the

201
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,140
King Dingbei

202
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:33,140
I think you're right

203
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:35,140
Tan'er, don't be angry

204
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:37,140
We haven't seen King Dingbei

205
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:39,140
If we meet him

206
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:41,140
he will be so confused

207
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:43,140
You saw him

208
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:45,140
at the Shangyuan palace

209
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:47,140
If I marry him

210
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:49,140
I might be

211
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:51,140
in his hands

212
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:53,140
Maybe not

213
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:55,140
The most important thing is

214
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:57,140
that he is blind

215
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:59,140
I won't let him

216
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:01,140
see me as a blind man

217
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:05,140
Oh no

218
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:07,140
I'm so helpless

219
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:09,140
No

220
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:11,140
We must cancel the wedding

221
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:17,140
Father

222
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:19,140
Uncle

223
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:21,140
This

224
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:23,140
This is a milk carton

225
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:25,140
Come on

226
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:27,140
Uncle must be hungry

227
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:29,140
Oh no

228
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:31,140
Try the milk carton

229
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:33,140
You...

230
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:35,140
Tan'er is so filial

231
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:37,140
You girl

232
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:39,140
You're so

233
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:41,140
smart

234
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:43,140
I'm not

235
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:45,140
I'm not

236
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:47,140
I'm not

237
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:49,140
I'm not

238
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:51,140
I'm not

239
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,140
I'm not

240
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:55,140
I'm not

241
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:57,140
I'm not

242
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:59,140
I'm not

243
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:01,140
You girl

244
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:03,140
What's your idea?

245
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:05,140
I want to get married

246
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:09,140
Uncle

247
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:11,140
It's too sudden

248
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:13,140
I don't know anything about King Dingbei

249
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:15,140
I'm worried

250
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:19,140
I understand

251
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:21,140
After all

252
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:23,140
you will marry King Dingbei

253
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:25,140
You should know more about him

254
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:27,140
It's a good thing

255
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:29,140
I don't want to marry him

256
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:31,140
I just want to know

257
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:33,140
how to cancel the wedding

258
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,140
Then

259
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:37,140
Do you know anything about King Dingbei?

260
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:39,140
We are young

261
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:41,140
We can fight with the army

262
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,140
But King Dingbei

263
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:45,140
is so smart

264
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:47,140
He used three thousand soldiers

265
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:49,140
to stop thirty thousand

266
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:51,140
North Indian tribes

267
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:53,140
The scene at that time

268
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:55,140
was a blood-shed

269
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:57,140
King Dingbei was so smart

270
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:59,140
He used the enemy's spy

271
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:01,140
to stop the enemy

272
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:03,140
He was so smart

273
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:05,140
He threw the body

274
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:07,140
back

275
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:09,140
The enemy didn't even recognize him

276
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:11,140
He was so smart

277
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:13,140
He was so smart

278
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:15,140
After three years

279
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,140
King Dingbei

280
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:19,140
hung the body of the leader of the North Indian tribe

281
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:21,140
on the gate

282
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:23,140
He dried it for three days

283
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:25,140
He dried it

284
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:31,140
So King Dingbei

285
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:33,140
is so talented

286
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:37,140
He is so lucky

287
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:39,140
to have such a son-in-law

288
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:41,140
He is so lucky

289
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:45,140
He is a general

290
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:47,140
but he is so handsome

291
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:49,140
He is handsome

292
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:51,140
He is not like the man who was in the street yesterday

293
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:55,140
Is what uncle said true?

294
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:59,140
Anyway, compared to my young

295
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:01,140
I am a man of good character

296
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:09,140
I am a little better

297
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:11,140
See, I told you

298
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:15,140
If you want to say, just kill me

299
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:17,140
What?

300
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,140
Tan, have you really decided?

301
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:27,140
I will go to see him

302
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:29,140
If it is true

303
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:31,140
Even if he is a man of good character

304
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:33,140
I will not marry him

305
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:35,140
You can't listen to uncle

306
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:37,140
He is a man of good character

307
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:39,140
But he was not so bad

308
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:41,140
when he was young

309
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:43,140
Besides, he said King Dingbei

310
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:45,140
is a little better

311
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:49,140
Although he is not so handsome

312
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:51,140
but he is a little bit handsome

313
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:55,140
I am not so handsome

314
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,140
But he is a little bit handsome

315
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:59,140
He said, if a new man

316
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:01,140
is so handsome

317
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:03,140
he will be so handsome

318
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:07,140
But King Dingbei is so handsome

319
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:09,140
He is so handsome

320
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:11,140
I am afraid you will go there

321
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:13,140
I don't think it is right

322
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:17,140
He is not so handsome

323
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:19,140
As long as he can see him

324
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,140
and he can't know his identity

325
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:23,140
then he will be fine

326
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:25,140
See him

327
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:27,140
But he can't know his identity

328
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:35,140
I have an idea

329
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:43,140
Stop! Who are you?

330
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:59,140
We are from the family of Duke Jing An

331
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:01,140
We are here to deliver some food

332
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,140
to General Shen Xiao

333
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:07,140
Come in

334
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:10,140
Come with me

335
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:16,140
I will deliver food to Shen Yu

336
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:17,140
You wait outside

337
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:19,140
If he sees you

338
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:21,140
he will be so angry

339
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:34,140
You follow this young lord

340
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:35,140
to the King's tent

341
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:37,140
and deliver some porridge to him

342
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:39,140
Yes

343
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:41,140
Let's go

344
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:49,140
Please give the porridge to me

345
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:53,140
I don't know

346
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:55,140
This porridge is made of ice

347
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:57,140
and it keeps you cool

348
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:59,140
The ice in our house is made of special materials

349
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:01,140
It is very strong

350
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:03,140
If it is not spread out, it will not be beautiful

351
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:07,140
Please come out after you finish

352
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:09,140
Don't disturb the King

353
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:11,140
Thank you

354
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:31,140
What is the connection between the forest and the airport?

355
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:37,140
Be good

356
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:39,140
Don't bother

357
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:43,140
I will talk to you after I finish

358
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:45,140
Yes, I will leave now

359
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:49,140
It is Chang Wu

360
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:51,140
Thank God!

361
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:53,140
Thank God!

362
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:07,140
The King is very tall

363
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,140
and he is very tall

364
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:11,140
He is taller than Shu Er

365
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:13,140
He is not a big fat man

366
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:23,140
Your Highness

367
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:25,140
Shen Xiao is here

368
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:27,140
Please come in

369
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:29,140
Please come in

370
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:31,140
Please come in

371
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:33,140
Please come in

372
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:35,140
Your Highness

373
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:39,140
General Shen told me to deliver some porridge to you

374
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:41,140
It keeps you cool

375
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:43,140
Put it there

376
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:05,140
The porridge is better when it is cold

377
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:07,140
The flavor is the best

378
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:23,140
He is very considerate

379
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:25,140
He doesn't care about the master

380
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:27,140
He is very considerate

381
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:29,140
He is very considerate

382
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:31,140
He is very considerate

383
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:33,140
He doesn't care about the master

384
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:35,140
He is not a big fat man

385
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:37,140
He is also a big fat man

386
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:41,140
He is short

387
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:43,140
and thick

388
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:45,140
But his hands are long

389
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:47,140
His fingers are long

390
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:49,140
and his fingers are sharp

391
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:51,140
He is very handsome

392
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:53,140
He is very handsome

393
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:55,140
He is very handsome

394
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:57,140
He is very handsome

395
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:59,140
He is very handsome

396
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:01,140
I feel like I am in a cold bath

397
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:03,140
I feel like I am in a cold bath

398
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:05,140
I feel like I am in a cold bath

399
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:07,140
Wait

400
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:09,140
I have seen this face before

401
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:15,140
Why is it you?

402
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:17,140
I have seen enough

403
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:19,140
Why are you here?

404
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:23,140
Your Highness

405
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:25,140
Your Highness

406
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:27,140
Your Highness

407
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:29,140
Speak

408
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:33,140
Your Highness

409
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:35,140
Your Highness

410
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:37,140
You have written several articles

411
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:39,140
You have written several articles

412
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:41,140
Do you have any idea?

413
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:43,140
Just do what I say

414
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:45,140
Yes

415
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:47,140
I will take my leave

416
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:49,140
You write articles

417
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:53,140
Why hasn't she come out?

418
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,140
Will King of Dingbei harass her?

419
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:56,140
No, no.

420
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:59,660
My lady, shall we go in and have a look?

421
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:05,420
No.

422
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:07,540
Tan is always cautious.

423
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:09,500
He won't make any mistake in the big event.

424
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:12,060
Moreover, he is the Princess Consort of Dingbei.

425
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:14,660
Even if he makes any mistake, he won't make it difficult for her.

426
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:20,140
If it doesn't work, we'll wait for another minute.

427
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:22,140
If Tan doesn't come out, we'll rush in.

428
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:24,020
You...

429
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:26,660
Are you the Prince of Dingbei?

430
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:29,460
Could it be that you are the son of the bandits?

431
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:32,740
Then you didn't steal the money from the House of Duke Lingguo?

432
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:36,540
Those officials are the ones who stole the money.

433
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:41,220
What about the Hanyan Temple?

434
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:45,060
The county government of Hanyan Temple and the Haiyou Gate are a perfect match.

435
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:46,420
They stopped me from entering the capital

436
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:50,180
because they didn't want me to investigate the case of the money.

437
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:51,580
Do you have any other questions?

438
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,100
Let me think about it.

439
00:24:58,260 --> 00:24:59,260
Sit.

440
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,500
No, why are you marrying me?

441
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:12,820
I hope that Buddha will bless the bride.

442
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:14,620
I must be as beautiful as Ruyi.

443
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:16,060
I must be beautiful.

444
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:17,380
I am handsome and upright.

445
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:19,180
Only then can I match with the bride.

446
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:20,700
I am more than seven feet tall.

447
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:23,420
If I can be more than seven feet tall, I'll be very happy.

448
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:24,660
Parents are dead.

449
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:27,700
Parents in the family can never return home every day

450
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:29,700
and torture their children.

451
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:32,180
The relationship between the family and the family is simple.

452
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:35,620
Usually, except for the three or five friends you have,

453
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:37,620
you don't have any close friends.

454
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:39,740
You can't have any close friends.

455
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:41,740
You are the cousin of a close friend.

456
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:44,740
So, do you have any questions?

457
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:47,540
No.

458
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:49,980
I am just a talented person.

459
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:51,260
I have a family of my own.

460
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:52,980
I can use the bird's nest porridge anytime.

461
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:55,500
I can use the bird's nest porridge anytime.

462
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:58,820
I can also use the clothes and jewelry I have.

463
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:01,980
Do you have any questions?

464
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,820
I am strong and strong.

465
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:10,500
I am not a mere body.

466
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:13,380
I can protect you from harm.

467
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:15,100
I can use weapons to protect you.

468
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,620
I am strong and strong.

469
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:20,020
I can protect you from harm.

470
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:21,380
No.

471
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:24,380
Why are you so familiar with these words?

472
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:26,520
How do you know my

473
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,520
moral standards?

474
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:30,340
You have all the requirements.

475
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:31,820
Why can't I marry you?

476
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:34,900
A person like King Dingbei who is a man of the north.

477
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:37,940
I, the royal family, will never dare to be a lowly person.

478
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:40,780
They all say that you are a tyrant and a murderer.

479
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:43,140
They also say that the Peony flower in my house

480
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:46,140
is buried in the hand of a woman who was murdered.

481
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:49,740
Then, the rumors outside...

482
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:52,740
are true.

483
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:58,940
I only kill those who deserve to be killed.

484
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:09,940
Even if you satisfy all my requirements,

485
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:13,340
it doesn't mean that I must marry you.

486
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:16,540
You don't want to?

487
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:18,340
It's not about wanting or not wanting.

488
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:21,140
But I have no affection for you.

489
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:23,540
And you and I are not good friends.

490
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:25,940
If we get married,

491
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:30,940
we will live in a mess.

492
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:38,340
Who are you going to marry?

493
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:42,140
If I don't marry you,

494
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:46,140
His Majesty will have other intentions.

495
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:50,420
Senior Madam,

496
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:55,300
anyone shopped your Microcom ainot write?

497
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,180
Anyone?

498
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:58,420
I'm calling in for you, miss.

499
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:02,820
She did that blindly.

500
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:05,220
She is very difficult to be with.

501
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:09,020
If you leave her,

502
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:10,940
she should die of pearl frail.

503
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:16,120
Without

504
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,120
You can understand it like this.

505
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,120
Miss!

506
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,120
You're finally out!

507
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,120
How is it?

508
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,120
Say something!

509
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,120
I'm so jealous!

510
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,120
You're so beautiful!

511
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,120
I'm so jealous!

512
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,120
I'm so jealous!

513
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,120
I'm so jealous!

514
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,120
I'm so jealous!

515
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,120
I'm so jealous!

516
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,120
I'm so jealous!

517
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,120
I'm so jealous!

518
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,120
I'm so jealous!

519
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,120
What's wrong?

520
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,120
Did you see him?

521
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,120
What happened?

522
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,120
Why are you all so dumb?

523
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,120
He's indeed very powerful.

524
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,120
What do you mean?

525
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,120
He...

526
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,120
He's not even as powerful as my uncle, right?

527
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,120
What kind of uncle is he?

528
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:08,120
No matter how powerful he is, he can't be described as rude.

529
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,120
Who said he's rude?

530
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:14,120
Mimi, have you ever heard of the five-on-five theory of the Lijun?

531
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,120
What theory?

532
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:19,120
I heard about this theory from two young masters in the previous year's class.

533
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,120
I don't understand the formation of the army.

534
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,120
But I only heard about it and knew the text.

535
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,120
It's logical and simple.

536
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:26,120
It's not a joke.

537
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:29,120
When I went to your house, my uncle also mentioned that

538
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:32,120
his words are wrong and his heart is not empty.

539
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,120
Have you said it before?

540
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,120
Why don't I remember it?

541
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:40,120
What does this have to do with King Dingbei?

542
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:42,120
He's right about one thing.

543
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,120
He's right.

544
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:48,120
He's a talented man and he's a great man.

545
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:52,120
He's indeed a great man.

546
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,120
Then, are you going to cancel the wedding?

547
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:58,120
I've got a lot of surprises today.

548
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,120
Let me think about it.

549
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:16,120
Prince, this is the tribute you gave to Han Yansi tomorrow.

550
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,120
Please have a look.

551
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:36,120
Prince, this is the account book of the last month of the marriage.

552
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,120
It's written in the book.

553
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:41,120
It's the account book of the last month of the marriage.

554
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,120
Then, I'll take my leave.

555
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,120
Prince, please have a good night.

556
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:01,120
Uncle Fu, you can say whatever you want.

557
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:04,120
Then, I'll say it.

558
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:08,120
I heard that the groom you're going to wed is a young lady from the House of Duke Jing'an.

559
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:13,120
I think this marriage is a good one.

560
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,120
Tell me.

561
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,120
What's the good news?

562
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:19,120
Prince, you've been busy with the war and military affairs.

563
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:22,120
You won't pay attention to the young ladies from the Shangjing.

564
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:25,120
But I know that the young lady from the Ming family

565
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:28,120
is a top-notch beauty in Shangjing.

566
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,120
She's a good-looking and well-mannered lady.

567
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:34,120
She's a talented lady with a good sense of humor.

568
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:36,120
She's a good-looking lady with a good sense of humor.

569
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,120
Especially, she's a good-looking lady with a good sense of humor.

570
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:41,120
She's a good-looking lady with a good sense of humor.

571
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:47,120
The most important thing is that the young lady from the Ming family

572
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,120
is a gentle and gentle lady.

573
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,120
She's a kind lady.

574
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,120
Prince, you...

575
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:58,120
She's a kind lady?

576
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:00,120
Of course.

577
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:04,120
The first two years of the Suo Jin Ge

578
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:06,120
the Northern Empire started a war.

579
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:08,120
The Ministry of Revenue was involved in the war.

580
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:10,120
Prince sent a letter to the House of Duke Jing'an

581
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:13,120
to ask the House of Duke Jing'an to raise funds for the war.

582
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,120
But the money was too much.

583
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:18,120
The House of Duke Jing'an had to pay hundreds of thousands of silver dollars.

584
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:21,120
The House of Duke Jing'an was already in deficit.

585
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:24,120
How could they raise so much money?

586
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:26,120
Even if the House of Duke Jing'an was in deficit

587
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:28,120
it would still take time to recover.

588
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:31,120
Fortunately, Miss Ming was a good-looking lady.

589
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:33,120
She spent a lot of money.

590
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,120
Although she didn't tell me about it

591
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:42,120
I knew that she was just trying to get the money.

592
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:48,120
Miss Ming's daughter was the one who was the most important

593
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:51,120
and that's why she was able to save you from the danger.

594
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:57,120
So she's the one who saved the Dongzhou Empire?

595
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,120
Yes, she's the one who saved the Dongzhou Empire.

596
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,120
Anyway, she's the one who gave the marriage.

597
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:04,120
Prince and Princess are a perfect match.

598
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,120
I've thought about it.

599
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:08,120
In the name of the House of Duke Jing'an

600
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,120
we should give the Princess a chance to be the first.

601
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:14,120
Our Princess must be the most famous bride in Shangjing.

602
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,120
Father.

603
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:32,120
Father, you've been working hard day and night.

604
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:36,120
I've made some mung bean and lily soup for you.

605
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,120
Sit.

606
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,120
It's so late. Why aren't you sleeping?

607
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:01,120
I can't sleep when I'm about to get married.

608
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:12,120
I've never thought about what it's like to leave the House of Duke.

609
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:18,120
I don't know what it's like to get married and move to another place.

610
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,120
Tan'er.

611
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:38,120
I know you're worried about the marriage.

612
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,120
Don't worry.

613
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:46,120
Prince Dingbei is a good man.

614
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:54,120
Father, you're saying that Prince Dingbei is a good man?

615
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,120
Oh.

616
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:03,120
You don't know that.

617
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:07,120
There was a year of the late Emperor's reign.

618
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:12,120
The Crown Prince's Emperor was killed by a man in the forest.

619
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:16,120
Prince Dingbei killed him alone.

620
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:20,120
He was heavily injured and protected the Emperor.

621
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:25,120
No wonder the Emperor was so concerned about him.

622
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,120
Yes.

623
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:31,120
Prince Dingbei's reign was long and difficult.

624
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:37,120
Two years ago, the former Minister of the Ministry of Revenue was involved in the war.

625
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:40,120
Prince Dingbei was lucky to survive.

626
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:46,120
The first thing he did was to kill the Minister and kill his head.

627
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:50,120
He was justifying the cause for the death of the soldiers.

628
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,120
He was a good man.

629
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:01,120
The war in East Zhou was a huge disaster.

630
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:04,120
I think he should have done the same.

631
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:07,120
That's why he went back to the capital to investigate the case.

632
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:17,120
Father, I was going to marry the Liang family.

633
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:21,120
Now that I have agreed to the marriage,

634
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:24,120
it shows that I have a position.

635
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:29,120
Will it be difficult to explain to my father?

636
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:32,120
He chose the wrong person.

637
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:34,120
Why should I explain to him?

638
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:49,120
Do you really think that the Prince of Dingbei is a good man for you and the family?

639
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:56,120
Tan'er, remember that I have been the father of the family.

640
00:36:57,120 --> 00:37:00,120
You don't have to ask for my daughter's life.

641
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:06,120
You or Chu Chu can choose the one you like.

642
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:08,120
You don't have to worry about anything else.

643
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,120
Father.

644
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:15,120
Although your marriage was a marriage,

645
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:20,120
I was very concerned about it.

646
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:23,120
You have to talk about the whole matter.

647
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:27,120
If the Prince of Dingbei is not able to protect you,

648
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:30,120
then others will not be able to do anything.

649
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:36,120
So, I am very worried about your marriage.

650
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:54,120
I really don't understand why His Majesty wants to marry you.

651
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:56,120
The Marquis of Jing'an is in charge of Yangxilu.

652
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:58,120
You are the leader of the Northern Army.

653
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,120
You are so good at military affairs.

654
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:01,120
Does His Majesty not care about you?

655
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:04,120
When did you start worrying about His Majesty?

656
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,120
What about you?

657
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:11,120
Are you willing to marry him?

658
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:13,120
Isn't it because of the marriage?

659
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:15,120
I am not willing to marry him.

660
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:17,120
I am not willing to marry him.

661
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:20,120
Are you willing to marry him?

662
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:24,120
Didn't you say that you are willing to marry him?

663
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:28,120
This is just a joke.

664
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:32,120
I think that if you don't want to marry him,

665
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:34,120
then you shouldn't delay his life.

666
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:37,120
If you are really going to marry him because of my words,

667
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,120
then it is my fault.

668
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:44,120
You don't want to marry him, so I won't marry him.

669
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:48,120
What do you think of him in the future?

670
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,120
Well...

671
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:55,120
Which family of the Marquis of Jing'an can match the family of the Marquis of Jing'an?

672
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:57,120
It doesn't affect the situation in the court.

673
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:01,120
These women from different families are born in a noble family.

674
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:03,120
They are not destined to be married.

675
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:06,120
They are not related to the family.

676
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:12,120
Whether I am sincere or not,

677
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:14,120
as long as he is my wife,

678
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:16,120
I will be his wife.

679
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:20,120
I will protect him for the rest of my life.

680
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,120
Mother,

681
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:29,120
I have some doubts in my heart.

682
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:33,120
I am not willing to marry him.

683
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:37,120
I thought that people who are killed in the battlefield

684
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:41,120
are as brave and rough as Father.

685
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:45,120
But when I met Prince Dingbei,

686
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:49,120
I didn't expect that he was handsome,

687
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:51,120
handsome and handsome.

688
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:54,120
He was not like what people say.

689
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,120
Now,

690
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:01,120
Prince Dingbei,

691
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:03,120
whether he is a family member,

692
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,120
or a family member,

693
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:06,120
or a handsome and handsome man,

694
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:11,120
he is very well-matched with my standards.

695
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:15,120
I thought that he was a bad person,

696
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:17,120
a cold-blooded man,

697
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:19,120
and a man of bad character.

698
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:23,120
But Father was so stubborn

699
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:26,120
that he has already removed my doubts.

700
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:30,120
Father has thought about me.

701
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:33,120
According to Father,

702
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:38,120
Prince Dingbei is indeed a man of great importance.

703
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:41,120
I don't know if he is a man of great importance.

704
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:49,120
But I know very little about Prince Dingbei.

705
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:53,120
I don't know if he is a man of great importance

706
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:57,120
like Father said.

707
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:05,120
So I still have some doubts in my heart.

708
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:07,120
I don't know if I should marry him.

709
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:12,120
If I hear your heart,

710
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:14,120
can you tell me

711
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:20,120
if I agree to this marriage?

712
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:34,120
If I don't say anything,

713
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:39,120
I will just pretend that I am satisfied with this marriage.

714
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:43,120
After I got married,

715
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:46,120
I also arranged for a marriage for my third sister.

716
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:50,120
After I married my third sister,

717
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:52,120
no one in this huge mansion

718
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:58,120
can stay with me and be with me.

719
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:05,120
I am happy to see you come back to the capital.

720
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:11,120
I also want to be closer to you.

721
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:14,120
But...

722
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:18,120
I haven't seen you for many years.

723
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:27,120
I feel that I have some differences between us.

724
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:29,120
But don't worry.

725
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:33,120
I will come back to your mansion often.

726
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:37,120
I will be with you and mother.

727
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:00,120
I will be with you and mother.

728
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:30,120
Stop!

729
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:33,120
You are staring at the sky.

730
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:34,120
Can't you see me?

731
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:36,120
Greetings, Third Miss.

732
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:40,120
I said I wanted to drink milk.

733
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:41,120
I didn't say that I want to drink milk.

734
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:44,120
Why did you send so many milk to the water fountain this morning?

735
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:45,120
Third Miss,

736
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:48,120
we didn't buy fresh milk in the kitchen.

737
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:50,120
The milk that you buy every day

738
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:52,120
is bought by her for extra money.

739
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:56,120
Father and I suffered a lot in Yangxi.

740
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:57,120
She is in the mansion.

741
00:43:57,120 --> 00:44:00,120
She is so poor and poor.

742
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:02,120
No matter how much you spend,

743
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:04,120
you never spend on the money you use in the palace.

744
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:06,120
But the dowry that you left

745
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:08,120
is enough for her to live a life of peace.

746
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:09,120
Besides,

747
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:12,120
you will be the princess of Dingbei.

748
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:14,120
The extra money will be more valuable

749
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:15,120
for the food and clothing.

750
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:16,120
You won't spend it on anything.

751
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:18,120
I will take my leave now.

752
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:19,120
If you drink the milk,

753
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:20,120
you won't feel fresh.

754
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:28,120
Third Miss, please come in.

755
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:29,120
It's time for breakfast.

756
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:27,120
Father,

757
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:28,120
