1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I am not a man.

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I am a woman.

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I am a man.

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I am a woman.

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I am a woman.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I am a woman.

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I am a woman.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I am a woman.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I am a woman.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I am a woman.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I am a woman.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I am a woman.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I am a woman.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I am a woman.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
M ruled

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
M ruled

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
M ruled

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,220
Isn't it beautiful?

19
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:35,920
Yes it is

20
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,520
given to us by a nice man

21
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,700
who taught me how to cut the Hope

22
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,600
to take home

23
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,820
And I got it

24
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:44,600
under my desk

25
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,880
Yes this is your choice

26
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:56,660
Uh,

27
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,400
father

28
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,520
Ah,

29
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,520
friends

30
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,920
But it's still impossible for us to live in peace.

31
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,720
It's so hard to choose.

32
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,440
It's been hard.

33
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,240
But his ankle is really strong.

34
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,240
No one can take it away.

35
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,740
This is destiny.

36
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,740
No one can take it away.

37
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,740
No one can take it away.

38
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,240
Wake up.

39
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,240
Do you want some water?

40
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,240
Drink slowly.

41
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:37,240
You didn't sleep last night either.

42
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,240
Why didn't I sleep?

43
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,240
I fell asleep just now.

44
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:48,240
Then why is the water hot?

45
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,240
You're injured.

46
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,240
You shouldn't drink cold water again.

47
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,240
You should sleep.

48
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:15,240
Mr. Shuu, you don't know how to dance.

49
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,240
When my teacher Ah Xu and the others were practicing,

50
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,240
they always dragged me along.

51
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,240
But I have a bad temper and I'm weak.

52
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,240
So I danced.

53
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,240
You know you don't know how to dance.

54
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,240
So why didn't you escape?

55
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:32,240
If I escape, you'll be the one who'll be hurt.

56
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,240
But if you're hurt, how can I explain to His Highness?

57
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,240
How can His Highness explain to His Highness?

58
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,240
How can His Highness explain to His Majesty?

59
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,240
But if I don't protect you,

60
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:53,240
I can't explain to myself.

61
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,240
I'm sorry.

62
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,240
Miss, please take your medicine.

63
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,240
Is it from the pharmacy?

64
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,240
Yes.

65
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,240
According to your order,

66
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,240
the best medicine is the Tianshan Snow Cicada.

67
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,240
I've been taking medicine for years.

68
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,240
I can't feel my stomach.

69
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,240
How about...

70
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,240
I'm sorry.

71
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,240
I need to take a three-part shot.

72
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,240
If I'm weak,

73
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,240
who will take over the family of Su?

74
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,240
Is this the time to show off?

75
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,240
You've been in the family of Su for so long.

76
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,240
You don't have any eyes left?

77
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,240
I've sounds a bit low.

78
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,240
Take the medicine!

79
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,240
tensions.

80
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,240
You drink a little.

81
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,240
Take these for everyone.

82
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,240
Take you medicated..?

83
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,240
Let's go.

84
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,340
Here you are, madam.

85
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,240
Have you seen what it costs?

86
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,240
There's nothing left.

87
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,840
You mean, she wants to cut the flesh and get rid of the body?

88
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,040
You see...

89
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,160
She wants me to pay her five years' salary.

90
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,400
Plus the interest.

91
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,520
That's ten million.

92
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,880
That's too much.

93
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,840
But there's nothing we can do about it.

94
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:34,200
Why don't you hand over the seal to me?

95
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,200
I'll settle this matter as soon as possible.

96
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,000
Your Highness.

97
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,040
Your Highness.

98
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,720
How was your rest last night?

99
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,640
It was fine.

100
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,640
I was busy with the affairs.

101
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:56,840
Mr. Yu.

102
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,640
Yes, Your Highness.

103
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,240
We can't delay the payment.

104
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,320
If you insist on delaying it,

105
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,120
I can only do it in time.

106
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,280
If we continue to investigate,

107
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,880
it won't be this amount.

108
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,120
Your Highness.

109
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,880
Can we discuss this amount?

110
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,720
It's ten million now.

111
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,880
You can think about it.

112
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,400
I don't mind.

113
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,760
You can think about it.

114
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,120
Okay.

115
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,440
As you said,

116
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,120
if he comsoden to Su Family again,

117
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,280
you can follow him with that deal.

118
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,680
Then I'll keep this method in mind.

119
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:47,960
Don't worry.

120
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,760
You go and get the seal right away.

121
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,560
You must help His Highness to fulfill this deadline.

122
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,520
Don't worry.

123
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,520
I'll fulfill it now.

124
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:02,520
It's a good deal to sell it in the whole of Lingzhou.

125
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,960
Look at this. How elegant it is.

126
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,800
Ji Xiuya, it's not a good deal.

127
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,400
Boss Wu is trying to fool Mr. Wen.

128
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,880
And he wants to fool other merchants.

129
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:14,760
You...

130
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:15,880
Mr. Wen?

131
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:19,240
Boss Wu, you said that no one has seen the material before.

132
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:19,840
No.

133
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,360
You want to cooperate with me?

134
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,360
The silk thread of this material is not dense enough.

135
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,960
Once it's wet, it will deteriorate.

136
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,080
And it will break.

137
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,840
Boss Wu, you want to kill me?

138
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,320
You...

139
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,320
You again.

140
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,280
What do you mean?

141
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:48,040
I want all the silk thread.

142
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,920
Instead of holding the material and touching it,

143
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,400
you should take the gold and use it.

144
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,960
Why are you so happy?

145
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,960
I just want to ask you a few questions.

146
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,960
Boss Wu, you just need to answer truthfully.

147
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,960
The gold will be yours.

148
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,960
Deal.

149
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:17,960
Miss, you can ask.

150
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,960
I know nothing.

151
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,560
Where is this material from?

152
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,960
An Chang, southwest.

153
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,960
Yes.

154
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:29,960
I can't see the color of the silk thread.

155
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,960
Boss Wu, have you figured it out?

156
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,960
You want to use the gold to make you happy?

157
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:37,960
Or you want to be taken to the government office and be punished?

158
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,960
I'll tell you.

159
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:45,960
Miss, this is not the silk thread.

160
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:49,960
It's from the gold-stored shopkeeper.

161
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:53,960
I borrowed it from him.

162
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:58,960
I never thought I would meet a Bodhisattva like you.

163
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,960
Manager Luo?

164
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,960
He's a jewelry shopkeeper in Lingzhou.

165
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,960
His name is Lu Jin.

166
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:04,960
His name is Luo.

167
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,960
He asked someone to deliver the goods.

168
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,960
Boss Wu has been working with Mr. Wen.

169
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,960
I think he knows him well.

170
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:21,960
Do you think he saw the material?

171
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:22,960
Miss, you're joking.

172
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:26,960
How can a smart man like Mr. Wen not see the door?

173
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:41,140
He's a famous

174
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:43,140
I'm Wen Zong.

175
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:46,140
I don't know if I'm lucky enough to invite you to dinner.

176
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:49,140
Thank you for reminding me.

177
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:56,140
You go ask about Wen Zong.

178
00:12:56,140 --> 00:13:00,140
According to Boss Wu's words, he should be involved in the theft.

179
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:03,140
At least he's a well-known person.

180
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:05,140
Miss Hui, I'm sorry.

181
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:07,140
I'm sorry.

182
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:10,140
At least he's a well-known person.

183
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:13,140
Miss Hui, Wen Zong is 20 years old.

184
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:15,140
He has a close relationship with the Su family.

185
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:17,140
He came to Lingzhou less than a month ago.

186
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:19,140
He started a big business for the Su family.

187
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:21,140
Miss Su is very important to him.

188
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:23,140
In less than two years,

189
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:25,140
He took the Su family's connections and his own means

190
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:28,140
to become a great figure in the business world of Lingzhou.

191
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:31,140
What did he do before he came to Lingzhou?

192
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:33,140
I don't know.

193
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,140
He's a fan of the Su family.

194
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:37,140
No one knows who he is.

195
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:43,140
How do you know Wen Zong so well?

196
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:48,140
Because your husband and my grandfather want to make him a good man.

197
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:52,140
I saw him last night.

198
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:54,140
He seemed to be close to Miss.

199
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:56,140
So I kept an eye on him.

200
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:00,140
You guys are really efficient.

201
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:02,140
Miss, what's your plan next?

202
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:04,140
I'm going to the Golden Tower.

203
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:06,140
I'll meet with Manager Luo.

204
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:08,140
They lost so much money.

205
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:12,140
It's time to take the net.

206
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:20,140
Please wait.

207
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:21,140
I'll give you 20% of the money.

208
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:24,140
One day, each customer will buy one sword.

209
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,140
Welcome.

210
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:28,140
What's the matter?

211
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:29,140
Welcome.

212
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:31,140
What can I do for you?

213
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:34,140
What kind of jewelry do you want to see?

214
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:54,140
Miss, this way please.

215
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:58,140
There are many kinds of jewelry in our store.

216
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:06,140
My lady doesn't like to make money with others.

217
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:08,140
She buys everything she wants.

218
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:11,140
I see.

219
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:13,140
Miss, this way please.

220
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:17,140
These are the best jewelry in our store.

221
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:20,140
Miss, do you have any jewelry that you can play?

222
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:27,640
The Golden Tower from Jilin

223
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,140
Happy birthday, miss.

224
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,140
Miss, you're good with eyes.

225
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:45,140
This necklace is the latest model of the year.

226
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:51,140
The color of the top of the��Hz cleaned out is the latest color.

227
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:54,960
velocity that Bon Bon do not allow

228
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,740
to introduce herself

229
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:12,460
this meritorious man

230
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:16,380
not a good quality

231
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,280
In addition,

232
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,280
You are so good at talking.

233
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,280
You are so good at being practical.

234
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,280
You are so good at being practical.

235
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,280
But I was a little bit more advanced than you.

236
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,280
But I was a little bit more advanced than you.

237
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,280
This hairpin was made yesterday by my wife.

238
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,280
This hairpin was made yesterday by my wife.

239
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,280
Waiter.

240
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,280
Did you pay the deposit yesterday?

241
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:39,280
No.

242
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,280
If you didn't pay the deposit,

243
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:43,280
you can buy the hairpin.

244
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,280
you can buy the hairpin.

245
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,280
Otherwise, if you come to the guest again,

246
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,280
you will be in trouble.

247
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,280
Then how do you do business?

248
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,280
Then how do you do business?

249
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,280
Yes.

250
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,280
My wife is the sister of the Princess of the Northern Kingdom.

251
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,280
If you don't bother her,

252
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,280
no one will be happy.

253
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,280
Now the Northern Kingdom is in Lingzhou.

254
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,280
You must have heard about her killing.

255
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,280
You must have heard about her killing.

256
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,280
Your wife is the third young lady

257
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,280
of the General's Mansion of Xuanwei?

258
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,280
Exactly.

259
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,280
Exactly.

260
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,280
You are so smart.

261
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,280
You are so smart.

262
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,280
You are so smart.

263
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,280
How dare you take the title of the Princess of the Northern Kingdom

264
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,280
and take the throne here.

265
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,280
Zhiyu.

266
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,280
This...

267
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,280
You are so kind.

268
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,280
You are so kind.

269
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,280
I admit it.

270
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,280
Stop.

271
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,280
How dare you offend my wife?

272
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,280
She is the sister of the Princess of the Northern Kingdom.

273
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,280
But she is not the Princess of the Northern Kingdom.

274
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,280
She is the sister of the Princess of the Northern Kingdom.

275
00:17:53,280 --> 00:18:11,100
She is a

276
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,280
Goodbye.

277
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,280
Miss Lingzhi?

278
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,280
What's wrong with you?

279
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,280
Ask him!

280
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,280
Manager Luo?

281
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:01,280
You are the General's man, you can't talk.

282
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,280
Go and tell the owner.

283
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,280
Yes.

284
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,280
Miss Lingzhi, we need to talk.

285
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,280
Why did you hurt yourself?

286
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,320
The Hall

287
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:25,300
What a nice hermits girls in Lu argument!

288
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:31,300
You are not necessary German here

289
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:33,280
But we areDavid.

290
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,260
Try to be notebook?

291
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,300
The Su's infighting is always so low.

292
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:41,300
Today we have a lord too.

293
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:43,300
You are the guardian of the country.

294
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,300
Although you are a little bit out of the way,

295
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:48,300
you should have the protection you deserve.

296
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:52,300
By the way, why didn't you see Shu Hanlin with you?

297
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:55,300
The butler said he left early in the morning.

298
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,300
Shu is not interested in business.

299
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:00,300
He must have gone to the south to get some painting.

300
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,300
Miss Su, you don't have to worry about him.

301
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,300
If you like it, I'll make it for you.

302
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:13,300
Sir, look at this painting.

303
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:15,300
It's very beautiful.

304
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,300
It's full of...

305
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:23,300
If you see this mark, it means there must be a goldfish in the square.

306
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,300
But there are so many people on the street.

307
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,300
How can I know who is who?

308
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,300
If you are in the market,

309
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:31,300
most of the guards will be disguised as shopkeepers.

310
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,300
Mr. Shu can't recognize them.

311
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:37,300
They can recognize you by looking at your portrait.

312
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:39,300
You just need to go to the shop and see.

313
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:41,300
I'll go to the shop and see.

314
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,300
I'll be able to see your portrait.

315
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:51,300
The Su family has a large and large business.

316
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,300
I'd like to meet you

317
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,300
and ask you about the business.

318
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:58,300
Sir, you're flattering me.

319
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,300
It's my pleasure to have your guidance.

320
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:03,300
Although the Su family has a large business,

321
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:05,300
they all have a good life.

322
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,300
I'm glad to meet you.

323
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,300
I'm very happy to meet you.

324
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:11,300
I'm also very happy to have you.

325
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:13,300
I'm also very pleased to meet you.

326
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,300
I'm very happy to meet you.

327
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:17,300
I'm very pleased to meet you.

328
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:21,300
Sir, I've been looking for a lot of shops.

329
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:23,300
Don't be rude.

330
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,300
Don't be afraid to hit your lord.

331
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,300
What's up?

332
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:29,300
What's up?

333
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,300
There's a big fuss in our building.

334
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:33,300
There's a big fuss in our building.

335
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:38,300
Sir,

336
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,300
Why don't you try my brother's brush?

337
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,300
Please.

338
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,300
How do you know my surname?

339
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:53,300
You're the second best in the family.

340
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:55,300
The right hand side is the fifth house.

341
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:57,300
Though the lord has heard about the return of the crown prince,

342
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:59,300
The Su family is still in the dark.

343
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:01,300
We cannot be seen for a while.

344
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,300
You better be careful.

345
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:05,300
We'll go in as soon as the time is right.

346
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,300
Okay.

347
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:07,300
Come and have a look.

348
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:08,300
Sir, please come.

349
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:10,300
Okay, thank you sir.

350
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,300
I can only make one in five days.

351
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,300
Sir, have a look.

352
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,300
What about this?

353
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,300
This one has a good base.

354
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:19,300
This fabric is better.

355
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:36,300
Miss, you are very beautiful and have a good attitude.

356
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:41,300
I think you are the most talented man in the city.

357
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:45,300
You are very beautiful and have a good attitude.

358
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:49,300
I think you are the most talented man in the city.

359
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:53,300
I think you are the most talented man in the city.

360
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,300
Miss Ling Zhi.

361
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,300
Stop talking.

362
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:56,300
My wife will definitely like this hairpin.

363
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,300
Miss Ling Zhi.

364
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:58,300
Miss Ling Zhi.

365
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:06,300
Madam, that is the new maid of the third young lady of General Xuanwei's mansion.

366
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:10,300
I heard from the staff that there was a problem on the way.

367
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:14,300
It's also because we are not well equipped and our guests are not good enough.

368
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:16,300
That's why this unnecessary misunderstanding occurred.

369
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:19,300
Why don't you give me a few points of respect?

370
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:21,300
Let's choose another jewelry.

371
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:25,300
Except for today's silk, I'll reduce the price by two points.

372
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:28,300
We have a lot of money in our general's mansion.

373
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:30,300
My wife wants this hairpin.

374
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:32,300
She can't afford it.

375
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:35,300
She is an outsider.

376
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,300
Why should she fight with my wife?

377
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,300
This hairpin...

378
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,300
I want it.

379
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,300
Who are you?

380
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,300
You just want it.

381
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,300
You are not a man of your word.

382
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,300
How dare you!

383
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,300
What is it?

384
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,300
It's here.

385
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,300
What is it?

386
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:14,300
It's a blessing to have you.

387
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:17,300
This hairpin is for you.

388
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:23,300
Tell Ming Chu that if she doesn't get the hairpin,

389
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,940
If she doesn't know how to behave in the future,

390
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:27,860
I will teach her how to behave.

391
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:30,780
Go and reply to her.

392
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:32,300
Yes.

393
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:37,260
You are so polite.

394
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:38,700
I'm so happy.

395
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:49,100

00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:50,860
coral, coral, and jade.

397
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:54,020
This hairpin is perfect for you.

398
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,180
Why don't you give it to her?

399
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:08,060
Thank you, sir.

400
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,100
Although it's a gift,

401
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:14,940
it's also a gift.

402
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:17,660
I've underestimated your acting before.

403
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:19,620
Hydrangea tu folds all lines.

00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:26,220
Sür · Terrisuna ·MC ·P fazericosa · Terras Arthur

405
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:29,260
Who is the first one to teach you the oriental calyxes?

406
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:31,900
Is it you?

407
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:39,460
Is it sada mu'er or prince?

408
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:42,060
Princess,

409
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:43,380

your son called you his majesty a while ago.

412
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:52,200
Miss a very weak girl but was extremely teleported to me.

413
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:55,480
This is really a right, you must offer this flattery.

I am yelling then but be careful your name are in

Your Majesty.

417
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:15,460
What is your name?

418
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:18,180
My name is He.

419
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:20,140
I am the son of a Dukkho.

420
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:23,940
Man Ge is a Dukkho's enemy.

421
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:25,860
I have been guarding the northern border for many years.

422
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:28,380
Every time I see a Dukkho,

423
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:30,660
I know that spring is coming.

424
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:31,980
I will return.

425
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:36,900

I am happy when I see a Dukkho.

432
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:10,700
I am always spoiled.

433
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:14,820
Don't frightened peaceful towards her,

434
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:15,440

435
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,120
Take care now, Dorman.

00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,880
please mind your words.

438
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,620
Do not say everything you want to say here.

439
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:22,180
Thats right.

440
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:27,360
We should end this with a greeting from Ausikarang.

441
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:37,880
Today you trip our Miss He down.

442
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:38,960
First time, I feel Last time.

443
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:44,500
Since Master makes me the key, I will ask his permission.

444
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:48,220
I will be on guard here.

445
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,580
First, you teacher has arrived.

446
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:56,260

447
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:03,400
If you want to meet...

Leave sir.

449
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:08,160
Okay.

450
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,660
Didn't you say that you'll marry them off?

451
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:12,420
Don't evince me.

452
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:15,320
If this Henpeyek subtle

453
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:16,920
is really the 80% of family property,

454
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:20,220
then we should treat them with respect.

455
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:22,380
All right.

456
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:23,040
this child who was not to be very happy,

457
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,040
who was not to be very happy,

458
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,180
and

459
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:28,040
my Universal Lord

460
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,180
is a person who was at first

461
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:33,680
very SEVEN years old

462
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,100
but now

463
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,660
COMPTY

464
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:50,120
KILL

465
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:53,120
I think it's better to be the princess.

466
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,120
After all, no one dares to bully the princess.

467
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,120
Husband, can you help me with a jade token?

468
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:08,120
The princess wants to hit Mingzhu.

469
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:16,120
Husband's prestige and military achievements are all from the battlefield.

470
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:18,120
He came with a knife and a gun.

471
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:21,120
How can I let him be so good?

472
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:24,120
He is so cruel and cruel.

473
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:31,120
I don't care.

474
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:36,120
That's not bad. I haven't spoiled him yet.

475
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:41,120
How do you want to spoil him?

476
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:47,120
I have to think about it.

477
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:50,120
After all, the house is big and the house is big.

478
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:53,120
It's not a day's work to spoil him.

479
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:05,120
My lord, Miss He.

480
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:10,120
That珠hutie is precious. I asked someone to give it to me later.

481
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:14,120
There are many mosquitoes here.

482
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:21,120
I don't know what to do.

483
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:32,120
Let go of me.

484
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:37,120
Why are you so stubborn?

485
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,120
Be careful.

486
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:47,120
Be careful.

487
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:50,120
Be careful.

488
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:53,120
Be careful.

489
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:56,120
Be careful.

490
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:59,120
Be careful.

491
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:02,120
Be careful.

492
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:05,120
Who is it?

493
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:11,120
It's me.

494
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:14,120
It's me.

495
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:17,120
It's me.

496
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:23,120
I don't know who you are.

497
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:26,120
You are hiding a secret from me.

498
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:29,120
I'm telling you.

499
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:32,120
I'm telling the truth.

500
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:35,120
I'm telling the truth.

501
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:38,120
I'm telling the truth.

502
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:40,120
You really think you're the master?

503
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:44,120
In the eyes of the First Miss, what's the difference between you and us?

504
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,320
Lord Gu.

505
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:59,920
You're looking for a chance to deal with that man.

506
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,120
You should also get out of here.

507
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:01,920
Yes.

508
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,520
Go.

509
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:10,120
The Second Miss

510
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,720
My Lord, Miss He.

511
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:18,920
Please sit.

512
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:21,320
I'll go and ask the shopkeeper for some advice.

513
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:23,320
Thank you, Boss Su.

514
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:25,320
The Second Miss

515
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:38,320
Miss He, is this your first time in Lingzhou?

516
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,320
Yes.

517
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:44,920
I didn't expect to meet you in Lingzhou for the first time.

518
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:48,120
It's a coincidence.

519
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,920
Don't joke, My Lord.

520
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:55,320
The second Miss

521
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:00,720
Su A'rong's clothes are strange.

522
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,320
She doesn't look like the normal person.

523
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,520
You must be careful.

524
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:08,320
Also, did you find anything in the brothel?

525
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,320
Boss Luo in the brothel

526
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:13,720
is the master of the smuggling in Beijing.

527
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:17,720
But I haven't got a chance to test her yet.

528
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,920
The sooner you're late, the sooner you're safe.

529
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:22,120
Don't worry.

530
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:26,240
grade.

531
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:32,520
mars thanked

532
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:39,620
Alice of Versailles

533
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:46,740
Celestia

534
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:47,700
What is the specific?

535
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:48,700
You decide.

536
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:50,060
Yes.

537
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:54,420
In this kind of situation,

538
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:57,380
why did you go out of the city

539
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:58,740
when you saw Yubo Zhong was not around?

540
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:01,140
I was greedy and I was greedy.

541
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:03,420
I wanted to use Yubo Zhong's hand

542
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:05,300
to make the Su family take the initiative

543
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:08,540
to pay off all the debts of Dingzhou.

544
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:12,820
Keep an eye on the food and drink.

545
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:14,180
Don't lose anything.

546
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:15,060
Yes.

547
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:16,620
Serve them with a good mind.

548
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:18,020
Don't be lazy.

549
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:19,180
Yes, madam.

550
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:20,540
And

551
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:22,580
bring the girls from the club here.

552
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:25,740
Remember to call Qingyu.

553
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:26,980
Yes.

554
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:28,100
I'll go right away.

555
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:47,580
Miss He,

556
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:49,180
what do you think of this painting?

557
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:50,740
I'm sorry, Your Highness.

558
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:52,580
I'm not good at playing the piano.

559
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:55,180
Your Highness, Miss He,

560
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:56,180
sorry to keep you waiting.

561
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:57,780
I asked the kitchen to prepare

562
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:59,300
some special dishes from Lingzhou

563
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:00,580
and spent some time preparing them.

564
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:02,740
Thank you for your hospitality.

565
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:06,260
Actually, I'm also very grateful to you today.

566
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:08,020
I'm sorry.

567
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:08,860
I'm sorry.

568
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:09,860
I'm sorry.

569
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:10,860
I'm sorry.

570
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:11,860
I'm sorry.

571
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:12,860
I'm sorry.

572
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:13,860
I'm sorry.

573
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:14,860
I'm sorry.

574
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:15,860
I'm sorry.

575
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:18,020
I'll cook it another day.

576
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:20,940
Please let me and Your Highness have a good time.

577
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:23,100
I love the fun.

578
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:24,100
I want to go.

579
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:25,740
What about Your Highness?

580
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:26,420
Okay.

581
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:35,980
Miss He, you're so handsome.

582
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:37,540
And you're so beautiful.

583
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:39,980
I'm sure there are a lot of people

584
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:41,580
who worship you.

585
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:42,980
I'm flattered.

586
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:44,700
I'm from here.

587
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:47,020
Miss He, you can listen to me.

588
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:49,620
You should find a husband

589
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:51,860
who can be your husband

590
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:53,140
and who can be your wife.

591
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:57,300
I think Miss He and Your Highness

592
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:58,700
are a good match.

593
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:08,100
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

594
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:10,780
I've been in business for many years.

595
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:11,980
I'm used to it.

596
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:13,660
I almost forgot

597
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:15,700
that Your Highness has married.

598
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:21,100
I'm flattered.

599
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:23,340
I'm a female merchant.

600
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:26,540
How can I be a match for Your Highness?

601
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:29,660
Miss He and Your Highness are similar.

602
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:38,060
The most important thing in business is the actor.

603
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:40,100
The actor is very important

604
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:41,940
if the business is successful or not.

605
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:45,420
I think Miss He and Your Highness are meant to be.

606
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:49,100
Master, Mr. Wen is here.

607
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:49,940
Please come in.

608
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:50,940
Mr. Wen?

609
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:52,540
The Wen clan came to save her.

610
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:53,620
They arrested the princess.

611
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:01,300
He's young and he looks like a man.

612
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:03,780
He looks quite handsome.

613
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:06,420
I'm late.

614
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:07,700
Please forgive me.

615
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:09,860
Mr. Wen, you're here at the right time.

616
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:10,940
Let me introduce you.

617
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:13,620
This is Prince Dingbei.

618
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:15,380
This is Miss He.

619
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:19,940
Greetings, Your Highness.

620
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:26,860
So Miss He is your surname.

621
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:32,020
You know each other?

622
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:34,940
Rather than saying that,

623
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:37,060
I'd rather say that we're meant to be.

624
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:42,260
If we're meant to be,

625
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:45,420
we'd better be meant to be.

626
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:13,340
Miss He, do you have siblings?

627
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:16,220
I have an older brother and two older sisters.

628
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:17,620
I'm the youngest.

629
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:22,220
Then I'll call you Miss He.

630
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:31,220
Actually, I'm here to see Miss He.

631
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:33,820
I received some things a few days ago.

632
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:35,820
I'm here to see Miss He.

633
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:37,820
I'm here to see Miss He.

634
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:39,820
I'm here to see Miss He.

635
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:43,780
It's cRenju.

636
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:06,660
It's Miss He.

637
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:07,180
I'm here to see her.

638
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:07,700
I'm here to see her.

639
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:10,880
I asked you

640
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,580
Can you read these words?

641
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,880
The color is too bright.

642
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,880
If you mix it with gold and gold,

643
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,880
it will be very expensive.

644
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,880
It's really rare and precious.

645
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,880
It's very valuable.

646
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,880
This blue jade hairpin,

647
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,880
what do you think, Miss Xiao?

648
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:04,880
It's light in color and has a delicate texture.

649
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:08,880
Now, it's so beautiful in the house.

650
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:12,880
I think it's more beautiful in the sun.

651
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:17,880
Good eyes.

652
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,880
Miss Xiao, why don't you guess again?

653
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,880
If these are for sale,

654
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,880
what price can they be?

655
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,880
Mr. Wen, you're making it difficult for me.

656
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,880
These items that are not for sale,

657
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,880
can't be sold at random.

658
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,880
This is a great opportunity.

659
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:35,880
Although there is an opportunity,

660
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,880
Miss Xiao, you can't say it out.

661
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:41,880
If I guess wrong,

662
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,880
don't blame me.

663
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:55,880
What do you think?

664
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,880
I said that Miss Xiao and I have a meeting.

665
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:09,880
My writing can be applied to some important tasks.

666
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:13,880
I don't have genes on the method faironi,

667
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,000
so

668
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,880
I don't need to know the effect.

669
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,880
This case is made of jade water.

670
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:33,880
When the wine is drunk, it becomes clearer with flavor.

671
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:36,800
Miss Su is not afraid of being accused by the Su family.

672
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:39,740
I am a greedy man.

673
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,800
I am a martial artist.

674
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,800
I am not as good as Mr. Wen.

675
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:50,340
I would rather give this to him.

676
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,740
Is this wine or vinegar?

677
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:02,740
Mr. Su is a righteous man.

678
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:04,740
No one dares to slander him.

679
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:08,740
But Miss Su's kindness is not enough.

680
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:11,740
In my opinion,

681
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:14,740
Miss Su should cut the horse head.

682
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:19,740
As a gift to the army of the northern and northern armies.

683
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:22,740
What do you think?

684
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:25,740
In this way, we can fulfill Miss Su's heart.

685
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:27,740
If Miss Su's kindness is fulfilled,

686
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:30,740
the prince and the northern army will be grateful to the Su family.

687
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:33,740
And the emperor is more responsible.

688
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:35,740
If the emperor knows,

689
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:37,740
maybe it will be more.

690
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:39,740
In this way,

691
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:44,740
it's good.

692
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:47,740
The so-called two-way happiness.

693
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:58,740
Consecutive

694
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:08,740
I don't know how to behave.

695
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:10,740
How can I judge you!

696
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:13,740
Give me your life.

697
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:16,740
That woman asked for help.

698
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:19,240
In the Episode,

699
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:20,740
who dares to oppose General Xuan Wei?

700
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:24,340
I am the biological sister of princess.

701
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:25,640
..with $100.

702
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:27,960
I gotta break my gym 1939 ans then stop!

703
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:30,480
Get out of sight, I told you right now, you doit struggle like this,

704
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:32,180
with that Tuni,

705
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:34,640
I said this is the highest level I guess,

706
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:35,860
Who Babe?

707
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:37,900

00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:44,620

What the heck is that massive ship that he egged my frame .

715
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:53,820
Jáéf is your father's business.

716

Is that a good thing?

717
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:55,540
What's wrong with him?

718
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:57,900
I don't know the sad story.

719
00:43:57,900 --> 00:43:59,060

720
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:06,820
