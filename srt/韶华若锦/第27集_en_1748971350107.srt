00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm going to make a little bit of a

00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
little bit of a little bit of a

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
little bit of a little bit of a

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
little bit of a little bit of a little

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
bit of a little bit of a little

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
bit of a little bit of a little

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
bit of a little bit of a little

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
bit of a little bit of a little

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
bit of a little bit of a little

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
bit of a little bit of a little bit

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
of a little bit of a little bit

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
of a little bit of a little bit

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
of a little bit of a little bit

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
of a little bit of a little bit

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
of a little bit of a little

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
bit of a little bit

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
of a little bit of a little

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
bit of a little bit of a little

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
bit of a little bit of a little

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
bit of a little bit of a little

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
bit of a little bit of a little

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
bit of a little bit of a little

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
bit of a little bit of a little

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
bit of a little bit of a little

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
bit of a little bit of a little

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
bit of a little bit of a little

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
bit of a little bit of a little

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
bit of a little bit of a little

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
bit of a little bit of

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
a little bit of a little

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
light

32
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
little

33
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
but

34
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
where

35
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
피

36
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
with

37
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,320
and left the account with the Ministry of Revenue.

38
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,240
In this case, I hope Your Majesty can understand.

39
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,880
What you mean is,

40
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,320
Su Er is easily known as Su Xiang.

41
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,720
He has a father and a daughter.

42
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:10,920
But the law is not related to him.

43
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:11,920
Yes.

44
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,040
cular

45
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,400
This is certainly unc 예

46
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,560
the origin of bullying.

47
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,720
Your Majesty,

48
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,120
these years,

49
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:41,120
Su Xiang wasゲ clearly corn tier

50
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:45,920
Whoeverobeners

51
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:50,380
must be cursed.

52
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:51,680
Jai!

53
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,440
I am here.

54
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:57,160
Everything involved in this is all tooled.

55
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:01,660
You both should be silent.

56
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:10,260
I'll see who's at fault

57
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:14,400
He's capable and humane to realize how dangerous it is

58
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,260
I may obey

59
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,640
Min there

60
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,020
First Miss Ji's first encounter with one.....

61
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:39,280
A versatile with poor cunning

62
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,280
Now, the Ling Zhou Su family has been controlled by the army.

63
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,280
It's a big deal.

64
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:49,280
And now,

65
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,280
what's the surprise?

66
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,280
The Xiaos have been forced to rebel.

67
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:00,280
The first thing is to make sure that the Xiaos are not guilty.

68
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,280
The guilty...

69
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,280
will be executed.

70
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:14,280
The first thing is to make sure that the Xiaos are not guilty.

71
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:19,280
The second thing is to make sure that the Xiaos are not guilty.

72
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:24,280
The third thing is to make sure that the Xiaos are not guilty.

73
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:29,280
The fourth thing is to make sure that the Xiaos are not guilty.

74
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:34,280
The fifth thing is to make sure that the Xiaos are not guilty.

75
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,280
My lord.

76
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,280
I'm incompetent.

77
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,280
I can't kill the King of Dingbei and protect the Miss.

78
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,280
Please punish me.

79
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:00,280
I have one more thing to do.

80
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:03,280
I'll let you do it.

81
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,280
Don't go.

82
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:15,280
What are you doing?

83
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,280
Don't come here again.

84
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:21,280
Don't come here again.

85
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:31,280
You guys are looking for a big-time business.

86
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,280
I can't bear it. If you have a good idea,

87
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,280
how can I explain it to you?

88
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,280
Explain it to you?

89
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:41,280
I'm the King of Dingbei.

90
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,280
I won't let you go.

91
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,280
If you want to blame me, blame you.

92
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,280
You're not good at making things worse.

93
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,280
You're just being blamed by the King of Dingbei.

94
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,280
You're not good at it.

95
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,280
You're not even looking at your dog eyes.

96
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,280
Whose business is this?

97
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,280
You're right.

98
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:03,280
But that guy doesn't know how to live.

99
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,280
He's not well-known.

100
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,280
He's already in the ninth grade.

101
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,280
Zhang Huaiyu?

102
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:13,280
He said he'd do anything for the court.

103
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,280
He's dead.

104
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,280
But you're still here.

105
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,280
Gao Chen,

106
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,280
King of Dingbei should only show your manly temper.

107
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:25,280
And you're going to burn your dog's face!

108
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:31,280
You're a girl who hasn't been out of the school.

109
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,280
You're here to show your face.

110
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:37,280
What kind of a good person can you say he is?

111
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,280
Maybe the guests from the Wen Taoga

112
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:43,280
are all here for Miss Yi Qing.

113
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,280
What are you doing?

114
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,280
Let's go!

115
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,280
What are you doing?

116
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,280
Get out of here!

117
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,280
Get out of here!

118
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,280
Get out of here!

119
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,280
Zhang Huaiyu!

120
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,280
You guys

121
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:33,280
are going to be in the same place as Mr. Gao?

122
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,280
What are you doing?

123
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,280
Mr. Gao,

124
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,280
if you're still not ashamed,

125
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:45,280
I'll let you go to Yu Qian immediately.

126
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:49,280
You'll be the one to decide what's going to happen today.

127
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:53,280
I'm in a bad mood.

128
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,280
I'm going to break a few sticks.

129
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,280
Even if I go to Yu Qian,

130
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,280
he won't punish me.

131
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:03,280
Jiang Yanghou is a good person.

132
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,280
How could he have a son like you?

133
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,280
If I were you,

134
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:11,280
I wouldn't have been in the house and made a mistake.

135
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,280
If you're not the King of Dingbei,

136
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,280
I wouldn't be here!

137
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,280
Are you two going to take him out

138
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:21,280
or am I going to take you out?

139
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,280
What are you doing?

140
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,280
Don't you hear me?

141
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,280
Who are you listening to?

142
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,280
Let me go!

143
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:40,280
영 families

144
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:05,280
Sixth Brother!

145
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,960
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

146
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,440
I should have brought you back.

147
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,880
I'm back.

148
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,480
It's good.

149
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,280
What's good?

150
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,280
Don't go home.

151
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,280
Mi Mi.

152
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,280
It's a big question.

153
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,280
Let go of me.

154
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,280
Let go of me.

155
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,080
Mi Mi.

156
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,280
Mi Mi.

157
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,280
What are you running?

158
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,280
Mi Mi, wait for me.

159
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,680
Mi Mi.

160
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,080
What's wrong?

161
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,080
But those few bastards are angry.

162
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,080
Don't worry.

163
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,080
I'll teach them a lesson.

164
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,080
I'll get you out of this.

165
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,080
I don't need you to take care of me.

166
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,080
Mi Mi.

167
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,480
Mi Mi.

168
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,480
But you're not happy that I'm back.

169
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,480
Of course I'm happy.

170
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,480
I don't need to listen to you

171
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,880
to make noise.

172
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,880
I don't need to be silent.

173
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,080
It's raining.

174
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,080
Why am I unhappy?

175
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,880
Mi Mi.

176
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,480
What's wrong with you?

177
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,280
What's wrong with me?

178
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,880
From your death message,

179
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,880
you've been back to the capital.

180
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,080
You've been unconscious

181
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,680
for a few days.

182
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,080
You didn't even say a word.

183
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:40,680
I...

184
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,680
I'm like a fool.

185
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,680
I watch you watch Brother Wen Tao

186
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,480
and watch you come back every day.

187
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,080
I watch you stay safe.

188
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:46,880
I...

189
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,480
Do you have any conscience?

190
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:49,880
Do you know

191
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,480
what a single gold is?

192
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,680
I wrote it.

193
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,880
Mi Mi, I really wrote it.

194
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,680
I wrote dozens of letters to you.

195
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,280
But the people in the underground

196
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,480
are afraid that I'll be exposed.

197
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,280
They won't let me send it.

198
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,880
I was caught by the Su family.

199
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,480
I was seriously injured.

200
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,480
I had to hide and recover.

201
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,080
You're hurt.

202
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,680
Where were you injured?

203
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,080
Did I hurt you just now?

204
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,080
Do you want to see me?

205
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,680
Mi Mi.

206
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,280
God knows how long I'll be back.

207
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,680
I want to go back to the capital

208
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,480
and use you like this

209
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,280
to go back to the capital.

210
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,280
I want to go back to the capital with you.

211
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,880
I want to go back to the capital with you.

212
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,880
I want to go back to the capital with you.

213
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,880
I've been thinking about

214
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,880
what is the real reason

215
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,880
for my death.

216
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:56,880
What is it?

217
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,280
Who said it was fake?

218
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,480
Well,

219
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,080
your mom and dad arranged a blind date for you.

220
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,880
They just want you to find a good family.

221
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,480
It's just a blind date.

222
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,480
I'll decide whether to marry or not.

223
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,880
Okay.

224
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,880
I'll wear the jade scarf

225
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,880
and go to Changguo Palace.

226
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,280
I'll return to the capital

227
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,880
and get the emperor's permission.

228
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,680
Changguo Palace will be my city.

229
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,880
I'll marry you

230
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,880
if I don't marry you.

231
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,480
You're so shameless.

232
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,480
What if I don't want to?

233
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,880
If you want to,

234
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,880
it's a happy event.

235
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,280
If you don't want to,

236
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,480
I'll marry you.

237
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,880
I'll tell you if you want to.

238
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:00,680
You...

239
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:02,680
Who said it was fake?

240
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,680
You did.

241
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,880
I don't care who said it was fake.

242
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:06,880
You can marry me.

243
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:07,880
I don't want to.

244
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,080
You don't want to?

245
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,280
I don't want to.

246
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,080
You don't want to?

247
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:11,880
I don't want to.

248
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,080
You don't want to?

249
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,080
I do.

250
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,880
You have been hard on yourself for years.

251
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,160
And you had to kadarEP

252
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,280
to fix your troubles.

253
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:37,480
All I know is

254
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:40,600
why I should come to my homeland

255
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,480
by girls like you in my second life.

256
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,280
You wouldn't notice

257
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,360
why Tan brought you here.

258
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,700
The princess is specially

259
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:53,540
enjoyable.

260
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:55,540
I think you and Yun Yi are quite a bit.

261
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:57,540
You should ask the doctor.

262
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,540
A Tai is still thinking about the arrangement.

263
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:04,540
You've already known it.

264
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:06,540
What surprise is this?

265
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:10,540
I don't know what A Tan has prepared.

266
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:16,540
I don't know what he prepared.

267
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:18,540
I don't know what he prepared.

268
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:20,540
I don't know what he prepared.

269
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:24,540
But I want Shu Jing Ran to choose a good love for me.

270
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:26,540
I want to give it to A Tan.

271
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,540
Is this what you give A Tan?

272
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:39,540
I know that A Tan is free and affectionate.

273
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:41,540
He is a famous man.

274
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:44,540
I can't help but talk about love.

275
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:46,540
Thank you, husband.

276
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:48,540
I like A Tan very much.

277
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:53,540
I heard that A Tan played a song

278
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:55,540
that he wrote in the gold play two years ago.

279
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:58,540
It caused a lot of trouble in the capital.

280
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,540
Do you want to hear it?

281
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:03,540
A Tan is not talented.

282
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:05,540
I will take it.

283
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:09,540
No.

284
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:12,540
I just think that he is very beautiful.

285
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:22,540
I want to hear it.

286
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:24,540
I want to hear it.

287
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:26,540
I want to hear it.

288
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:28,540
I want to hear it.

289
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:30,540
I want to hear it.

290
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:32,540
I want to hear it.

291
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:34,540
I want to hear it.

292
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:36,540
I want to hear it.

293
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:38,540
I want to hear it.

294
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:40,540
I want to hear it.

295
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:42,540
I want to hear it.

296
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:44,540
I want to hear it.

297
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:46,540
I want to hear it.

298
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:48,540
I want to hear it.

299
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,540
I want to hear it.

300
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:52,540
I want to hear it.

301
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:54,540
I want to hear it.

302
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:07,540
Yunyi.

303
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:09,540
Yunyi.

304
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,540
It's about time to meet the princess.

305
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:19,540
Let's go.

306
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:49,540
Princess.

307
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:58,540
Open.

308
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:08,540
The fireworks here are big and the colors are beautiful.

309
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,540
If it's a white smoke, it's not bad.

310
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:15,540
It's a pity that the time is running out.

311
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:17,540
I can only prepare these.

312
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:19,540
After you come back,

313
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:21,540
why don't you talk to the emperor?

314
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,540
Although the palace is full of fireworks every year,

315
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:25,540
it's not as good as the one here.

316
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:33,540
No.

317
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:39,540
This is for me.

318
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:42,540
Why do you want others to see it?

319
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:51,540
I just want to see the world

320
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:53,540
that can be as beautiful as the fire.

321
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:55,540
It's as beautiful as the rain.

322
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:00,540
Have you ever had a day

323
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:02,540
that you've been longing for?

324
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:07,540
I've never thought about that.

325
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:11,540
I want to have a room for a meal.

326
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:13,540
Everyone in my heart

327
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:16,540
should have their own favorite food.

328
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:19,540
The life of the king.

329
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:24,540
The king?

330
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:26,540
I don't know.

331
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:28,540
But I think

332
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:31,540
the present is the best time.

333
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:35,540
Where is the second prince?

334
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:37,540
What is the life of the king?

335
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,540
Actually, I haven't thought about it.

336
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:47,540
Ever since I was born,

337
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:50,540
my life

338
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,540
has been arranged for everything.

339
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:56,540
I've been busy with my studies,

340
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:58,540
and I've been living in the world.

341
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:00,540
I've been working hard

342
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:03,540
to be a good person.

343
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:05,540
What I want to do

344
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:06,540
is to move to the capital

345
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:08,540
and not to the king.

346
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:20,540
But I'm afraid that

347
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:21,540
I'll be in trouble.

348
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:23,540
The change in life

349
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:24,540
is a plan.

350
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:25,540
Who can predict

351
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:26,540
what will happen in the future?

352
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:29,540
What Miss Yun said is

353
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:31,540
that rather than rushing into the future,

354
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:33,540
it's better to cherish the present.

355
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:37,540
The present is the best

356
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:40,540
right now.

357
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:50,540
I'm afraid to die,

358
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:55,540
but I have to succeed.

359
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:04,540
I'm becoming stronger.

360
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:13,540
This is An Tan

361
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:14,540
of the firstho.

362
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:16,540
in你们宣工作.

363
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:20,540
In the past, the Marquis's Mansion was cold.

364
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:25,540
But, aunt Zhang could make the Marquis's Mansion warm.

365
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:31,540
So, I want to make the Marquis's Mansion warm.

366
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:32,540
And happy.

367
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:42,540
I wish the Marquis's Mansion is a peaceful and peaceful place.

368
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:45,540
And, husband...

369
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:52,540
Do you miss your mother and the old prince?

370
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:56,540
The reunion is the most important.

371
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:05,540
When you forget, you will be hurt and sad.

372
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:13,540
Although your mother, the old prince and your mother have passed away,

373
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:17,540
they all hope that we can live well.

374
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:21,540
If we miss them, they will be happier.

375
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:25,540
They will be more vulnerable in the world.

376
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:30,540
And they hope that after husband's death,

377
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:33,540
they will be happy.

378
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:40,540
I wish you a happy and happy life.

379
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:51,540
A'Tan.

380
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:54,540
Thank you.

381
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:03,540
Someone has been nice to me these years.

382
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:08,540
But someone has never told me.

383
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:13,540
I hope I can be happy.

384
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:17,540
When the stars are gone,

385
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:21,540
When the moon is gone,

386
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:25,540
When the sky is gone,

387
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:32,540
When the stars are gone,

388
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:37,540
A'Tan will be with you in every mid-autumn festival.

389
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:38,540
Good.

390
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:47,540
When the grass is gone,

391
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:50,540
When the mountains are gone,

392
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:55,540
A'Tan will be with you in every mid-autumn festival.

393
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:58,540
We will eat mooncakes together.

394
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:00,540
We will watch fireworks together.

395
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:05,540
I will not protect you in the way.

396
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:07,540
Because of the ice,

397
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:11,540
I will always be with you.

398
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:13,540
I will always be with you.

399
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:16,540
Don't be sad.

400
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:44,540
What is husband doing?

401
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:47,540
A'Tan is dying.

402
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:42,540
A'Tan.

403
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:43,540
A'Tan.

404
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:44,540
A'Tan.

405
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:11,540
You are awake.

406
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:15,540
You are awake.

407
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:23,540
You are going out?

408
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:28,540
I have something to do.

409
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:30,540
I will come back later.

410
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:31,540
I will go with you.

411
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:37,540
What's wrong?

412
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:39,540
I don't want you to leave.

413
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:43,540
I will go upstairs and rest.

414
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:52,540
Go to sleep.

415
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:02,540
Go to sleep.

416
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:06,540
Go to sleep.

417
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:10,540
Go to sleep.

418
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:20,540
Your Majesty.

419
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:22,920
With the

420
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,540
public opinion of the officials of the

421
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:26,540
Association of the Republic of China,

422
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:28,540
the other officials and the

423
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:30,540
members of the Association of the Republic of China

424
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:32,540
are related to the Lingzhou Su family.

425
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:34,540
According to the statement of the public,

426
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:36,540
the main purpose of this case is

427
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:40,540
to protect the people of the world.

428
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:07,540
Your Majesty.

429
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:32,540
Your Majesty.

430
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:39,540
Do you know the crime?

431
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:04,540
I

432
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:06,540
know the crime.

433
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:14,540
Minister Hu, Liu Mo.

434
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:17,540
colluded with the Lingzhou Su family.

435
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:19,540
He was blind and obedient.

436
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:21,540
He took the court official's

437
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:23,540
and the country's foundation.

438
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:26,540
He immediately took the official's uniform

439
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:27,540
and checked the property.

440
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:31,540
Let's discuss it later.

441
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:36,540
I

442
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:39,540
have

443
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:43,540
the

444
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:45,540
imperial edict.

445
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:06,540
Your Majesty.

446
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:09,540
Before King Dingbei left the capital,

447
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:12,540
he told me to investigate Liu Mo's identity.

448
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:14,540
After that, I investigated the evidence.

449
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:16,540
When Liu Mo was the person

450
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:18,540
who was the person who lived in the

451
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:19,540
Qingzhou County.

452
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:21,540
Due to the local government's

453
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:23,540
household registration and registration,

454
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:24,540
the Gu family has been

455
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:26,540
impatient to find out who the person is.

456
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:29,540
I

457
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:31,540
have a question.

458
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:33,540
What is the reason for this?

459
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:35,540
Do you remember?

460
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:37,540
King Min Cong

461
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:38,540
and King Dingbei

462
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:39,540
were not together

463
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:41,540
in the war in Beijing.

464
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:51,540
What is the relationship between Liu Mo and Liu Mo?

465
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:54,540
At that time, the Crown Prince ordered

466
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:56,540
to support King Dingbei.

467
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:58,540
But because of the delay in the military service,

468
00:29:58,540 --> 00:29:59,540
the Gu family

469
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:00,540
and King Dingbei

470
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:02,540
were not able to fight the battle.

471
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:05,540
Later, the delay in the military service

472
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:06,540
was not investigated.

473
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:07,540
After that,

474
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:09,540
Liu Mo was committed to

475
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:10,540
the crime in prison.

476
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:14,540
It was after that.

477
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:17,540
After the death,

478
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:19,540
Liu Shi was also very soon dead.

479
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:20,540
The son of Qi

480
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:21,540
left the village

481
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:23,540
and went to the capital.

482
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:25,540
Now,

483
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:26,540
he changed his name

484
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:27,540
to Liu Mo.

485
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:29,540
Now, he changed his name to

486
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:30,540
Mu Xing.

487
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:31,540
He also passed away

488
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:33,540
before the entrance examination.

489
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:35,540
Because of this,

490
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:37,540
King Min Cong was killed.

491
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:39,540
I wanted to

492
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:40,540
take King back to Beijing

493
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:42,540
and investigate further.

494
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:44,540
But now,

495
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:45,540
Liu Mo is involved.

496
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:48,540
I can't tell you.

497
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:58,540
I'm sorry.

498
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:23,540
I'm Liu Mo.

499
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:25,540
Greetings, Your Majesty.

500
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:30,540
I'm glad to tell you that

501
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:31,540
I didn't.

502
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:34,540
But if he'd like it,

503
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:36,020
we should

504
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:37,540
watch him die down.

505
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:39,540
Really worth it.

506
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:41,540
I have no idea

507
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:42,540
of what your Majesty has to想.

508
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:44,540
It's just my own choice.

509
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:46,540
It's a matter of no return.

510
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:49,540
This is my great responsibility.

511
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:56,540
I corrected

512
00:31:56,540 --> 00:32:00,960
74

513
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:29,540
I have something to tell you.

514
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:33,540
Your father was involved in the case.

515
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:36,540
He was involved in another case.

516
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:41,540
Your father Yan Changrong was a military commander 15 years ago.

517
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:43,540
He was indeed a dead man.

518
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:45,540
But according to his previous statement,

519
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:47,540
he was in a war with the Xie family.

520
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:49,540
He was unconscious for half a day.

521
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:53,540
At that time, the Tai Sect ordered to withdraw the investigation.

522
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:55,540
The case was not clear.

523
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:57,540
Yan Changrong was in jail.

524
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:01,540
When the coroner found out that he was poisoned,

525
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:03,540
he was in a state of dismay.

526
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:05,540
Dismay is a form of incitement.

527
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:09,540
But this case is over.

528
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:12,540
We can't stop it.

529
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:26,540
Your Majesty,

530
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:29,540
my father was killed by someone.

531
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:31,540
He was killed by someone.

532
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:34,540
Yan Wu's order is true.

533
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:36,540
It's true.

534
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:42,540
Your father was just a criminal.

535
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:49,540
Yan Wu's order has nothing to do with my life.

536
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:52,540
But it's related to the military power of the Bishi.

537
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:57,540
Su Wenchun was in the position of the first officer.

538
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:59,540
He was not in the position to follow the order.

539
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:02,540
He was not in the military.

540
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,540
After the death of Prince of Nincong,

541
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:07,540
he was forced to take the Bishi's army.

542
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:09,540
But he couldn't get it.

543
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:11,540
These years,

544
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:14,540
Prince of Dingbei and I have been thinking about this.

545
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:17,540
It's just that we have no peace and no fear.

546
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:20,540
We have to be on our toes.

547
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:26,540
Su Xiang only knows me.

548
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:42,540
You've been following him for years.

549
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:45,540
It's not that you should know it better than anyone else.

550
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:47,540
If he uses someone,

551
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:50,540
he's the only one who's important.

552
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:54,540
How could he not investigate this person?

553
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:57,540
As I've seen,

554
00:34:57,540 --> 00:35:00,540
he didn't only know you.

555
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:03,540
He even deliberately hired you to the Bishi.

556
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:07,540
He wanted you to die for him like your father.

557
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:09,540
Father.

558
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:24,540
You still want to keep your secret until now?

559
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:26,540
Father.

560
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:37,540
The result of the death of Prince of Nincong

561
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:41,540
is that

562
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:47,540
you have been killed.

563
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:53,540
I want to see him.

564
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:57,540
Lord Bishi, please take a look.

565
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:11,540
We can't go without a trace.

566
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:13,540
Let's not move.

567
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:17,540
Yes.

568
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:21,540
What if we really get to that point?

569
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:24,540
If that's the case,

570
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:27,540
then it's God's will.

571
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:33,540
I will do everything I can to make it happen.

572
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:35,540
Yes.

573
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:39,540
There's one more thing.

574
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:44,540
I want to see you in the prison.

575
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:55,540
As long as he's executed,

576
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:59,540
I can be a good person.

577
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:05,540
The last step is not necessary.

578
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:09,540
Take me there.

579
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:12,540
He's more important to you.

580
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:15,540
You'd better tell him

581
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:18,540
that I will live on.

582
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:22,540
I will live on.

583
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:26,540
You haven't seen each other for years.

584
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:29,540
You should say goodbye.

585
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:32,540
Send him to the last place.

586
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:41,540
Yes.

587
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:50,540
I will do my best to investigate.

588
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:09,540
Brother Sida.

589
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:12,540
Come here.

590
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,540
Come.

591
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:15,540
Here.

592
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:16,540
Thank you.

593
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:18,540
Thank you.

594
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:20,540
You can share it.

595
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:21,540
Thank you.

596
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:22,540
Sit here.

597
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:26,540
I will send you food every day.

598
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:28,540
You can read books.

599
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:30,540
If you can pass the exam,

600
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:32,540
you will have a good result.

601
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:35,540
Why do you treat me like this?

602
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:39,540
You were so stubborn to tell me

603
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:42,540
that you were going to fight for your friends.

604
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:45,540
You can't be so serious.

605
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:50,540
I think you are a good person.

606
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:52,540
You can read books.

607
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:54,540
But how far can you go?

608
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:56,540
You should think about yourself.

609
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:58,540
Thank you.

610
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:00,540
Here.

611
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:17,540
Stop.

612
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:18,540
Come.

613
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:20,540
Come up.

614
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:26,540
This is the letter from the Prime Minister.

615
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:29,540
I can ask him to help me.

616
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:33,540
But I hope you won't be able to use it.

617
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:36,540
Thank you.

618
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:39,540
My name is Si.

619
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:41,540
Brother Si.

620
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:44,540
You...

621
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:46,540
You are not dead.

622
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:48,540
You are not dead.

623
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:53,540
I have no idea.

624
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:55,540
Why did you disappear suddenly?

625
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:57,540
I have been without a trace for years.

626
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:00,540
I am sorry to have offended you.

627
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:02,540
I am sorry to have offended you.

628
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:07,540
Why did you appear suddenly?

629
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:13,540
I came to see you off

630
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:15,540
in front of the Prime Minister.

631
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:28,540
I know you like to eat Biluo.

632
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:31,540
You prepared a lot.

633
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:37,540
I came to the capital 15 years ago.

634
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:40,540
It was also Brother Si who sent me here.

635
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:46,540
It's important.

636
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:58,540
Don't worry.

637
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:00,540
I will not lie.

638
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:05,540
I have committed a crime.

639
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:07,540
I will not repeat it again.

640
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:10,540
This is a murder.

641
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:14,540
But I am still suspicious.

642
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:28,540
Maybe my father was the same as me.

643
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:34,540
It's all the same as my father's.

644
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:37,540
I have committed a crime.

645
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:45,540
I have been grateful to Brother Si

646
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:47,540
for his care for me 15 years ago.

647
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:50,540
And I thank you for sending me here today.

648
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:53,540
The most important two ways I have done in my life

649
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:55,540
are all from you.

650
00:41:58,540 --> 00:42:01,540
I must not delay the matter of the people.

651
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:18,540
I wonder what Prime Minister thought of me.

652
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:21,540
There are so many ancient relics in Shangjing.

653
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:23,540
Why did I choose to go to the north?

654
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:27,540
I have no choice but to go to the north.

655
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:31,540
What do you mean?

656
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:34,540
What about Brother Si?

657
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:37,540
When did you choose to go to the north?

658
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:40,540
Why did you do this for him?

659
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:48,540
15 years ago,

660
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:51,540
I committed a crime because of the poison in the forest.

661
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:54,540
After Prime Minister took my place,

662
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:57,540
I have been a murderer.

663
00:42:57,540 --> 00:42:59,540
I have been chasing after him.

664
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:04,540
It's a great honor to eat monkey's teeth.

665
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:09,540
You have been killing me 15 years ago.

666
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:16,540
It seems I am right.

667
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:21,540
Other than me,

668
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:24,540
the person who involved in this matter

669
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:26,540
left a mark on me.

670
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:29,540
How could you know that?

671
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:37,540
What kind of advantage did Su Wenchun have

672
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:39,540
to let you die for him all your life?

673
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:45,540
If Prime Minister didn't steal the blame for me,

674
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:47,540
I would have been a crybaby.

675
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:49,540
Besides,

676
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:52,540
once I get on this road,

677
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:55,540
I will have no regrets.

678
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:57,540
I will be in trouble.

679
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:03,540
We are the same.

680
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:05,540
We have no God.

681
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:07,540
We have no one.

682
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:14,540
I am sorry.

683
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:17,540
I am not the same as you.

684
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:24,540
I am not the same.

685
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:47,540
I am sorry.

686
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:17,540
I am sorry.

687
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:47,540
I am sorry.

688
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:17,540
I am sorry.

689
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:47,540
I am sorry.
