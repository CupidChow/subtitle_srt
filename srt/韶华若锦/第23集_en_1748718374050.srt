1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,200
how could I not?

2
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:41,160
Oops!

3
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,800
God of War

4
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,320
You just go wander around alone one day,

5
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:50,880
and Funny you are in this darkness.

6
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:53,460
Today, you make закрыed miel오�王

7
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,480
and order me to leave you,

8
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,460
just to marry the prince's son!

9
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:59,460
I didn't go out today.

10
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,460
How could I disturb Prince Dingbei?

11
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:04,460
I didn't do anything to kill him.

12
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:07,460
Prince Dingbei is a traitor.

13
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,460
He is a coward.

14
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:11,460
He doesn't want to be a traitor.

15
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:13,460
Even my General Xuanwei

16
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:16,460
has a reputation for his family.

17
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:19,460
I have never failed in my life.

18
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:21,460
I am old now.

19
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:24,460
But I have to be punished.

20
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:27,460
I am so embarrassed.

21
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:31,460
Prince Dingbei came to Lingzhou.

22
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:33,460
How could I do that?

23
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:35,460
He and Mingtan's husband are close.

24
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:37,460
They always fight with each other.

25
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:40,460
My family's Lingzhou was his handkerchief.

26
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:43,460
Now I am away from the capital.

27
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:45,460
Why don't they want to be punished

28
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:47,460
and take me with them?

29
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:49,460
They even take Feng family with them.

30
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,460
What happened at the Fulu Hall today?

31
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:53,460
Do you think you can hide it?

32
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:55,460
I only ask you.

33
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:58,460
Is Prince Dingbei right or not?

34
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:00,460
Father, don't be angry.

35
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:02,460
I am not good enough to be a daughter-in-law.

36
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:07,460
Go to the court and think about it.

37
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:11,460
Don't let Chunfu think about it.

38
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:14,460
And the one who is called Lingzhi

39
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,460
is a coward.

40
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:17,460
He is a man.

41
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,460
Go out immediately.

42
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:20,460
Yes.

43
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:25,460
How dare you treat me like this?

44
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:26,460
My father is still alive.

45
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:29,460
You even have the guts to mention your father.

46
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:31,460
You are so kind.

47
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,460
You are not like him.

48
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:35,460
You married Feng family.

49
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:39,460
His Lordship said that you are my Feng family's wife.

50
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:41,460
How could you be so arrogant

51
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:43,460
to be my Feng family?

52
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:45,460
You are bullying me without my mother's help.

53
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:47,460
You are bullying my family.

54
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,460
Mingzhu, shut up.

55
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:51,460
If you keep talking like this,

56
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:53,460
I will kill you.

57
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:54,460
I...

58
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,460
I...

59
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:57,460
I will kill you immediately.

60
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:59,460
Don't leave me.

61
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:00,460
Go.

62
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:11,460

63
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,460
Where is she?

Yes.

68
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,480
Are they these girls?

69
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,980
Yes.

70
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:25,820
Let's go to my room.

71
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,820

And the kid is angry.

00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,460
Which one must I attach to each prince?

00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,460
Do you believe in emperor?

80
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:41,900

I will not let you down.

108
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,300
I don't dare to ask Mr. Wen to be my guest.

109
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:26,300
But I have a business to discuss with Mr. Wen.

110
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:29,300
I received Mr. Wu's shoes and shoes.

111
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,300
Mr. Wen wants to help me.

112
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:35,300
The only request is to make the price fair and not cheat the people.

113
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,300
I will do it.

114
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:40,300
Miss, this is a serious matter.

115
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:43,300
Why do you need to burn this?

116
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,300
It's okay.

117
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,300
I have the materials.

118
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,300
I can't just throw it away.

119
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:51,300
I think the money should be earned.

120
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,300
The business should be done.

121
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:55,300
But we should be careful.

122
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,300
We can't ask for the rules.

123
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:03,300
Miss, I am not as good as you.

124
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,300

Your Highness, please forgive me.

The king's spirit is not the king.

128

He only kills enemies and not the innocent.

129
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:35,300
Miss, please leave.

Miss Bingda,

00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,040
I've been to the countryside for a few days.

171
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:31,040
But Mrs. Wu said you knew about this.

172
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,040
After that, Mrs. Wu wanted to kill us.

173
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:36,040
But Mr. Liu was too quick to come.

174
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,040
How long have you been with me?

175
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,040
Miss.

176
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,040
Since you were a father,

177
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:01,040
I've been by your side.

178
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:05,040
I've been waiting for you for years.

179
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,040
You killed me.

180
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,040
I was in the Su family,

181
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,040
I was not worried.

182
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,040
I came to the Kui family.

183
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,040
You know you're from the Su family.

184
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,040
I'm not hiding anything from you.

185
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:22,040
I did help you to kill him.

186
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,040
Why did you do that?

187
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:31,040
I've given you many benefits these years.

188
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:35,040
You can do anything for me.

189
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,040

191
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,040
when you're a servant.

192
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,040
I'm really sorry.

193
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,040
Okay.

194
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,040
Good.

195
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,040
You're a good girl.

196
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,040
You're not afraid of death?

197
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,040
You're not dead?

198
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,040
I'm not dead.

199
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,040
Drink.

200
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,040
Mr. Wen.

201
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,040
Good evening.

202
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,040
Do you drink wine?

203
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,040
You're drunk?

204
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,040
What about I come over?

205
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,040
碚 up.

206
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,040
It's dangerous.

207
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,400
What an exquisite indeed!

208
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,920
I'm impressed!

209
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,760
Come.

210
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,720
Respect fed ate pigeon?

211
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,640
Hey, I'm lost in Cloud flight!

212
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,640
Your Highness...

213
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,080
No need.

214
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,860
Since you, and Master Wen meet each other on time,

215
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:10,960
in case of surprise,

216
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,920
I won't disturb you.

217
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:13,760
Goodbye.

218
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,120
Miss.

219
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:23,640
My lord.

220
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,200
Bastard.

221
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,240
Miss.

222
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,640
Uncle Shuhai Ling said he has something to tell you.

223
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,000
Miss Su.

224
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:44,800
Will you help Miss Su out if she's here?

225
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:57,720
Miss Su?

226
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,180
My lord,

227
00:14:58,580 --> 00:14:59,800
what happened to you?

228
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,360
The body Woman

229
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:07,000
is a very dangerous person.

230
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I'll let her kneel in front of me.

231
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
If she just wants to be a family member,

232
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Miss Su will be willing to do so.

233
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
But if she just pretends to be a member of the Wei State,

234
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
then she has another identity.

235
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Why didn't she come here herself?

236
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Miss Su is a seductive person.

237
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
You can't push her away.

238
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I'll do it myself.

239
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
What's this?

240
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
How could she be so quick?

241
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Yu Bo Zhong, you're a traitor.

242
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Miss Wang trusts you so much.

243
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
The King said that this is a family affair.

244
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
He has nothing to do with it.

245
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
You're a traitor.

246
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
You're fooling me!

247
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
You're fighting against the people of the Sea of Hades.

248
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
You're dealing with me.

249
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
You want to take my power

250
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
and break the rules.

251
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
For so many years,

252
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
the court has been sending people to come

253
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
to investigate my intentions.

254
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
But in the end, there are always mistakes.

255
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
But this time, it's different.

256
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
If the King and I work together,

257
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
we'll do whatever we need.

258
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
We'll have a good relationship.

259
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Do you have any plan?

260
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
As long as the King can help Su Er Rong,

261
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I'll be able to transfer the money to Su's house.

262
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
In the meantime,

263
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I'll take away the part of the deal.

264
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I'll make it.

265
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I'll do as you say.

266
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I've found his way.

267
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
He's never been in my hands.

268
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
The Sea of Hades is a vicious circle.

269
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
It's not easy for the court to make the King of the North order

270
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
to kill the King of the Sea of Hades.

271
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
If there's a counter, we'll punish him.

272
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
The King of the Sea of Hades is a brave man.

273
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
If you betray him,

274
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
you'll be disqualified to be the Su family.

275
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Who's the king of the Su family?

276
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
As long as we can kill the King of the North,

277
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
we'll have the money and the money.

278
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
You're dreaming.

279
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Kill him.

280
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Go.

281
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Kill him.

282
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Miss He.

283
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Mr. Wen and the King have had a big drink.

284
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
You can bring two bowls of beer and a soup.

285
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Yes.

286
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
And some vinegar.

287
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
You two can drink it.

288
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I'll go get it.

289
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
It's me.

290
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
A-tan's husband.

291
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I'm sorry.

292
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
You're drunk.

293
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
You're drunk.

294
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
You're a rich man.

295
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
You're a rich man.

296
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
No one is more capable than you.

297
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
You don't think I'm better when you're sober?

298
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Only when you're drunk can you be sober.

299
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
If time can stop,

300
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I'll help you to get your soul back.

301
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I'll help you to get your soul back.

302
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I'll do everything I can to help you.

303
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I'll do everything I can to help you.

304
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
You have a good relationship with him.

305
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
You don't have my position.

306
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
You're drunk.

307
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
What's wrong with your body?

308
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
You're drunk.

309
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Jiang Qizhi, you're drunk.

310
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Qingyu said you weren't lucky last time.

311
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
When was the last time?

312
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
How did you do it?

313
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
He wanted to help you to get your soul back.

314
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
And you.

315
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Why did you drink with him?

316
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,000
You're a rich man.

317
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Don't think I'll forgive you.

318
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Tan, if I keep on asking you,

319
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
will you agree?

320
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
No.

321
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
You're a rich man.

322
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
What do you mean?

323
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
You're drunk.

324
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Do you mean it or not?

325
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
You have to ask for it first.

326
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Maybe you'll be sober tomorrow.

327
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Don't forget what you said.

328
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I remember.

329
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I'll take it.

330
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
You haven't told me

331
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
when was the last time.

332
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I don't remember.

333
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Jiang Qizhi.

334
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Jiang Qizhi.

335
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Jiang Qizhi.

336
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Jiang Qizhi.

337
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Jiang Qizhi.

338
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
The Haimou Gate is dead.

339
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
If we go to 21 people,

340
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
we'll be in trouble.

341
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I've sent the images to the city.

342
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I'll let the guards in the city

343
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
pay more attention.

344
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
The money is in the house.

345
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Please, sir.

346
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I want to send someone to look for it.

347
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
No need.

348
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Your father

349
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
never does anything wrong.

350
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
The money is gone.

351
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
If we push the Su family back,

352
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
we'll be in trouble.

353
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Today,

354
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
the Su family

355
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
will pay the money

356
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
with their hands.

357
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I'll share this with my brothers.

358
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
I'll take it as a reward for last night.

359
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
I thank you, Your Excellency.

360
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Thank you, Your Excellency.

361
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
But we can't get the money back.

362
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Why do we have to pay the money?

363
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Dingbei King doesn't eat the food.

364
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
You think he only wants people and not money?

365
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
These money is gone.

366
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
How can the Su family

367
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
make up for the loss?

368
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Dingbei King designed the prison

369
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
to be a bird.

370
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
He's been in the Haimou Gate for a long time.

371
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
He's also made our money.

372
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
No matter if he's a prisoner or not,

373
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
I'll return this debt sooner or later.

374
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
I'm incompetent

375
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
and I have to make Yu Bo Zhong get away with it.

376
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
But he was injured last night.

377
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
It's been too long since he came.

378
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Go on!

379
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Even if he's dead,

380
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
I'll pay him back with his hands.

381
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Yes.

382
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
I'll take revenge for the Su family.

383
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
I'll pay him back with my hands.

384
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
After the Su family has paid the money,

385
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
you'll go to Zhang's Mansion.

386
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Once Zhang's Mansion is accepted,

387
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
you'll be able to take revenge for all the cases.

388
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
You mean

389
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
you want to send Zhang's Mansion back to the capital?

390
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
But Zhang's Mansion is the Su family's.

391
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
There are many Su families in the capital.

392
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
That's why

393
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
the Su family will be the first to pay the debt.

394
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
No matter where the money goes,

395
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Zhang's Mansion and the officials of the capital

396
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
will be punished.

397
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
If the government is not willing to pay the debt,

398
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
the Su family will not take action.

399
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Your lordship

400
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
wants to make a deal with the government

401
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
and make it a good job.

402
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
But

403
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
the government under the Su family

404
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
is a bad person.

405
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Someone found a corpse in the imperial court.

406
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
It was the lady who was with the housekeeper.

407
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
But the government took the case and didn't investigate it.

408
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
They didn't ask.

409
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
They just wanted to make a deal with the family.

410
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
They're so useless.

411
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
They really don't want to let them do it.

412
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
It's not that they don't investigate it.

413
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
They just don't want to investigate it.

414
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
They can only make a deal with the family.

415
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
It's not a matter of the case.

416
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
No one can resist others.

417
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
But if they do it,

418
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
some of them will be punished.

419
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
This is Miss He.

420
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
She's very clear.

421
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
She wants to serve the soup for you.

422
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
By the way,

423
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
after I sent you back last night,

424
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Miss He said

425
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
that Mr. Wen was the most unlucky one

426
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
in the bar.

427
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
He's really different.

428
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
He's still a gentleman

429
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
who's been sent personally.

430
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Who's that Wen Zong?

431
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
What's wrong?

432
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Is he not home?

433
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
How did you get along with Ayu?

434
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
He's still in the bar.

435
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
He's still in the bar?

436
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
He's still in the bar.

437
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
He's still in the bar?

438
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
You still have time to talk.

439
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
You just need to rest for a day.

440
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
It's dangerous.

441
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
I'm not worried about Ayu's safety.

442
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
But how can I get out of the bar?

443
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
He's a good man.

444
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
He's a good man.

445
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
I'm very excited today.

446
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
I'm sure you'll be willing to cooperate with me.

447
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
I'm not.

448
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
How can Ashu's temper

449
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
be so strange today?

450
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Why hasn't the three-digit bill

451
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
been opened yet?

452
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
You...

453
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
You...

454
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
You...

455
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Miss He,

456
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
why are you here?

457
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
I thought you were going to the nightclub.

458
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
I was going to have a bath.

459
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
How could you?

460
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Even if you're a professional lady,

461
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
you'll have to win the nightclub.

462
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Hurry up.

463
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Please come in.

464
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Miss He, you can choose.

465
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
What do you like?

466
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
The era.

467
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
No need.

468
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
I really have a feeling

469
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
that you'll be able to win.

470
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
I'm very happy to see you.

471
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Mr. Luo,

472
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
can you show me

473
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
the hairpin that you got from your shop?

474
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
I've never seen this hairpin.

475
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
I've never been sold in a bar.

476
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
I'm not asking

477
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
if it was from the shop.

478
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
I'm asking

479
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
if it was from your shop.

480
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
I've been working at the Fulu Golden Tower

481
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
and I've received the items.

482
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Maybe some merchants

483
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
are using the Su family's flag

484
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
to trick us.

485
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
I can't say no.

486
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
I see.

487
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Mr. Luo is a famous businessman.

488
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Is there anyone

489
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
who uses your flag to trick us?

490
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
There's a boss in Linzhou.

491
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
I just got a pair of shoes from him.

492
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Mr. Wu told me that

493
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
you were the one who got the hairpin.

494
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
If Mr. Wu

495
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,000
really used your flag to trick us,

496
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
I'll have to withdraw the pair of shoes.

497
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
I'll have to ask Mr. Luo to help me make a witness

498
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
so that he won't say that I wronged him.

499
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Well...

500
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Why do you have to make Mr. Luo suffer?

501
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
No matter if it's the gold or the cloth shop,

502
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,000
it's the Su family's business.

503
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Mr. Luo has to take the money

504
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
from the shop to the factory.

505
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
The goods are all from the Su family.

506
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Why are you here, Mr. Wu?

507
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
I'm here to pick a new pair of shoes.

508
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
I'm here to give you some of them.

509
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
I saw some of them last night.

510
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
I'm glad to see them here.

511
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Otherwise, if I didn't send them to you,

512
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
I would have been in trouble.

513
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
You don't have to be so polite.

514
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
But Mr. Wu came here

515
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,000
to ask you to come alone.

516
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,000
I can't compare this pair of shoes with the other.

517
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Mr. Wen is a great man.

518
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
He's a very good man.

519
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
The Dong family told me about it.

520
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,000
I wonder what's special about this pair of shoes.

521
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Why do you have to find someone who sells them?

522
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
I just want to pick some of the best shoes

523
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
and choose the best ones.

524
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
This pair of shoes is a different kind of shoes.

525
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
The pattern on the top is also different.

526
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
I bought it from a small shop

527
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
when I was a little kid.

528
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
I spent a lot of money

529
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
to find out the origin of this pair of shoes.

530
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,000
It's the shop in the capital,

531
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Mr. Luo.

532
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
I came to Linzhou to buy the shoes.

533
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
After meeting Mr. Wu,

534
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
I found that Mr. Luo is a very good businessman.

535
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
He must have a lot of people to buy.

536
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
It's not hard to ask.

537
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
But I didn't expect that little businessman

538
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
would be so generous.

539
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Miss, you have a good taste.

540
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,000
I know a lot about the shops in Linzhou.

541
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Why don't you give me a suggestion?

542
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Really?

543
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
I'll do my best.

544
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Thank you, Mr. Wen.

545
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Miss, you didn't come to Linzhou for this pair of shoes, did you?

546
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:50,000
It's said that Linzhou is the most rich place in our country.

547
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
I came here to visit you.

548
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
I know that you have something interesting to learn.

549
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
I don't want to miss it.

550
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,000
But I'm here to visit you.

551
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
You haven't found anything new.

552
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
You must be disappointed.

553
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
I love video games since I was a child.

554
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
If I can get new things,

555
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
it's the best.

556
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:17,000
But if not, I'll be a tourist.

557
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
I'll be a great actor.

558
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Miss, you're so good-looking.

559
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
You must have been a good-looking man

560
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
when you were in the family.

561
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,000
I didn't expect that you have such a good-looking man.

562
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Mr. Wen, you're so good-looking.

563
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
But there's nothing special about Linzhou

564
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
except the rich and the prosperous.

565
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
I came here to drink the first cup of tea.

566
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
I was so impressed.

567
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
It's a good tea that's worth the price.

568
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
It's good for the taste.

569
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,000
It's high-quality and rich in reputation.

570
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,000
I don't know if it's worth it or not.

571
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Miss, you're so good-looking.

572
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
You have some good-looking people.

573
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,000
I've been shopping a lot these days.

574
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Although every family is made of high-quality products,

575
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
the quality is good.

576
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
But the quality is not good.

577
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Besides the luxury,

578
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
there's nothing special about it.

579
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
I've been trying to be a tourist

580
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
to find a way out.

581
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
I can hide the real good things

582
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
in Linzhou.

583
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
If you really want to be a tourist,

584
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
I'll be a tourist for you.

585
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
If you have a guest,

586
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
you don't have to do it.

587
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Please.

588
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
I'll be a tourist.

589
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
I'm here.

590
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
What's the matter?

591
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
The fragrance is so good.

592
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
It's only good for the warm-hearted.

593
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
It's good for the smell.

594
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
The fragrance is so good.

595
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
It's like a mountain road.

596
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
I wonder how it tastes.

597
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Sit down if you want to drink.

598
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
If you don't, just leave.

599
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Let's sit.

600
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
I'll have some tea.

601
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
I won't eat it.

602
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Please.

603
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Please.

604
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
I'm happy to meet you.

605
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Get some tea.

606
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
So this is a lonely mountain.

607
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
How come there has tea like this?

608
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Miss Xiao is just a bachelor.

609
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
She lives in a exhibition room in the Midwest.

610
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Her ancestors were collaborators in the mountains.

611
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
This tea is their signature.

612
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
If you want to drink good tea,

613
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Lingzhou is the only family in the city.

614
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
No one can stop you.

615
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Mr. Wen, don't bring more people here.

616
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
I'm afraid of people.

617
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,000
My shop is only sold for ten huts a day.

618
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
It's fine to sell huts.

619
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Then you must let this lady choose some good tea today.

620
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Sure.

621
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
I'm selling out.

622
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
I'll be off for a few days.

623
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
There's still business in the world.

624
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Miss, please.

625
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
I'll be off.

626
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Well,

627
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
it's okay.

628
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
I should come to the place.

629
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
I can get the tea.

630
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Just go.

631
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
If you don't,

632
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Boss will get you a drink.

633
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,160
Thanks.

634
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,360
Pills... 6 americans.

635
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:50,440
à seafood... 8 americans.

636
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
I'm not.

637
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
You're not going to say that?

638
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
I'm fine.

639
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
It's perfect.

640
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
It's not bad.

641
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Miss Yun wants to eat barbecue.

642
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Just tell me.

643
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Why do you have to learn it?

644
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
I've been learning it for a long time.

645
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
But no one knows how to do it.

646
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Didn't you say

647
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
that A-Xu's father was the best in the world?

648
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Why didn't you ask him for a lesson?

649
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
I don't dare to ask him for a lesson.

650
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Then how could Miss Yun ask me for a lesson?

651
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
It's different from the second prince and the prince.

652
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Be careful.

653
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Don't move.

654
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
I didn't expect that Ling Zhou could buy a brother.

655
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
He could even choose a wild fox.

656
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,000
That Qin Xian is more suitable for the top.

657
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
He can choose a doctor.

658
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
These pants are all my personal belongings.

659
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
I've never told anyone.

660
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Then what else do you have?

661
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
I've got a lot of things to do.

662
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
I've got a lot of things to do.

663
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
I've got a lot of things to do.

664
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
I've got a lot of things to do.

665
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
I've got a lot of things to do.

666
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
I'll be right there.

667
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Miss Xia, this way, please.

668
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Master.

669
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Why didn't you take your hand when you were in danger?

670
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
You're in danger.

671
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
I think the biggest danger is that you've been followed.

672
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
That's a good news.

673
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
The whole day, you're the one who caused the death of the fox.

674
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
You must have been trying to hide your feelings from me.

675
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Don't you think it's wrong?

676
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,000
But today, you're the one who's been looking for Mr. Wen.

677
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Master, don't worry.

678
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
I'll protect you.

679
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
I'll take care of you.

680
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Master, where are you going?

681
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Mr. Wen,

682
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,000
because of the 10-year-old-in-law's family,

683
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:49,000
the sales of the last month has been over three times.

684
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
This is the best thing about Mr. Wen.

685
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
I'll take care of it.

686
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Thank you, Master.

687
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Master, this is the sales of the last month.

688
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Besides the money I've earned,

689
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
it's all in there.

690
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Please have a look, Master.

691
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
The sound is good.

692
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
This is what you should get.

693
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Thank you, Master.

694
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Miss,

695
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,000
the people of Dingbei are using the money to buy some things.

696
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,000
But they've only received the amount of the money they should buy.

697
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
The rest is gone.

698
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
There are so many people who don't like money.

699
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Where is Mr. Wen?

700
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Where is he today?

701
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,000
The bottom man just said he followed Miss He for the rest of his life.

702
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Why did he follow me?

703
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Miss He and Mr. Wen are in the same place.

704
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
He really looks like that girl.

705
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
You sent someone to look for Miss He.

706
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Please let her stay here tonight.

707
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Thank you, Master.

708
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Enjoy your meal, everyone.

709
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Have a taste.

710
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
I've been eating this for a few days,

711
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
and it's a very memorable taste.

712
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
This noodle is like silver silk.

713
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
It's very chewy.

714
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
I've never tasted this kind of taste.

715
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
This is the local noodle.

716
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
It's made with green bean powder.

717
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,000
The texture and appearance are different from the usual noodles.

718
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Mr. Wen,

719
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
you've been eating this for a long time.

720
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
I've been eating this for a long time.

721
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
I've been eating this for a long time.

722
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
I've been eating this for a long time.

723
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
I've been eating this for a long time.

724
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
I'm a good person.

725
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
I'm not only good at business,

726
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
but I'm also a good cook.

727
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,000
I think Mr. Wen has been here for a long time.

728
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,000
How did you know that I'm not from Lingzhou?

729
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
I'm from Lingzhou.

730
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
I'm a good cook.

731
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,000
I'm a good cook.

732
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,000
I'm a good cook.
