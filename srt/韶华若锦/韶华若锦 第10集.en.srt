[Youthful Glory]

2
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,910
[Episode 10]

3
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:34,890
How is the progress

4
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:36,370
of Gu Jinzhong's case?

5
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:39,880
He has promised to

6
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:41,530
confess everything

7
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:42,960
after meeting his daughter today.

8
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:43,770
However,

9
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:45,570
it's unlikely

10
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:47,370
we'll be able to directly expose

11
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:48,970
the mastermind behind this.

12
00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:50,330
I'm well aware.

13
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:53,090
The opposition is deeply entrenched.

14
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:54,130
How could a mere Marquis of Cheng'en

15
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:55,460
accomplish this alone?

16
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:58,470
Yet, no matter how difficult,

17
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:00,610
we must press forward.

18
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:03,670
Only by uprooting the rot

19
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:06,650
can the court be cleansed.

20
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:09,780
No matter how meticulous his schemes,

21
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:11,850
there will inevitably be a slip.

22
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:15,250
Let's wait for that day together.

23
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:24,250
How do you intend to deal with
the Gu family

24
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:26,610
after the Marquis of Cheng'en
is convicted?

25
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:27,770
According to the law,

26
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:29,100
the men shall be exiled,

27
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:31,210
and the women enslaved.

28
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:36,930
Perhaps the innocent

29
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:38,690
could be pardoned?

30
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:40,590
I've verified that

31
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:41,810
he embezzled funds

32
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:43,610
solely for the benefit of his concubine.

33
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:44,690
His principal wife and legitimate daughter

34
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:45,950
neither received a single coin

35
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:47,600
nor had any knowledge of the crimes.

36
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,720
Pardon him?

37
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:51,710
Xu,

38
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:54,690
since when have you become so sentimental?

39
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:01,750
It is Tan's

40
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:03,770
idea.

41
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:05,360
Why do I feel

42
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:07,640
yours wasn't just an arranged marriage,

43
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:09,650
but rather a love match

44
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:11,730
where both hearts were smitten?

45
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,320
So

46
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:19,280
how's married life?

47
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:22,260
Not much to say.

48
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:25,290
Just rather tedious.

49
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:27,020
Did I ask

50
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,470
if it was tedious?

51
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:31,940
Then what do you want to ask?

52
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:34,630
Forget it.

53
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:36,579
This was your

54
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,040
own idea anyway.

55
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:39,730
Marriage for convenience.

56
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:41,360
With your temperament,

57
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:42,740
I never expected that

58
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,100
marriage would suddenly

59
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,380
make you romantic.

60
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:47,570
But she's a proper noble lady,

61
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,640
your lawful

62
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:49,700
wife—

63
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:52,680
you must treat her with
proper respect in public.

64
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:57,360
Yes.

65
00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:59,060
Why are you leaving so soon?

66
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:00,340
Stay and have lunch in the palace

67
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,860
with Tan.

68
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:12,690
Thank you,

69
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:14,740
but the newlywed is shy.

70
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:16,410
She likely wouldn't be at ease

71
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:17,690
eating here.

72
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:26,840
[Blessings]

73
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:22,290
Now that I think on it,

74
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:23,680
the Princess of Dingbei

75
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,210
was also at the Lantern Festival banquet.

76
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:26,790
She even replied to me then,

77
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:28,840
but we were too far apart

78
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,180
for a good look.

79
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,640
Today, observing her properly,

80
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,960
she's every bit as dignified, gracious,

81
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:35,390
and composed as reputed.

82
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:36,830
No wonder

83
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:38,980
she won the Dowager's favor back then.

84
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:42,170
The Princess of Dingbei is
the adopted daughter of Chancellor Su.

85
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:44,100
So she's practically family to us.

86
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:45,700
She's indeed exceptional,

87
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:48,770
and quite well-matched with Xu.

88
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:57,050
I wouldn't dare

89
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:59,680
claim kinship with Empress Dowager.

90
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:02,080
Your praise alone

91
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,480
is already more than I deserve.

92
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:09,530
The young ladies

93
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:14,000
[Blessings]

94
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:10,470
in the capital

95
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,330
have grown dull these past years.

96
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:13,340
They all say

97
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,310
the same rehearsed pleasantries.

98
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,060
You don't seem to

99
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:19,140
know the slightest thing

100
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,020
about warfare.

101
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:23,570
Do you have anything to talk about
with the Prince of Dingbei?

102
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,700
Ladies in the capital

103
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,020
have always looked to Empress Dowager

104
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:37,670
and the Empress as their examples—

105
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:40,020
learning grace,

106
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:41,700
restraint,

107
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:43,810
and how to manage a household.

108
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,090
That can hardly be called dull.

109
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:47,650
Besides,

110
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:49,600
the Prince of Dingbei

111
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:50,880
discusses military matters

112
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,240
all day in camp;

113
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:53,570
perhaps what he needs

114
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:54,930
at home

115
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:56,080
is a moment of peace.

116
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,560
As his wife,

117
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:59,960
offering a warm bowl of soup

118
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:01,630
and a few kind words

119
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,060
may bring him more comfort

120
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:05,720
than any grand gesture.

121
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,530
So, how does it feel

122
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,160
to marry the man

123
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:21,470
every woman in the capital avoids?

124
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:23,140
You must cry your eyes

125
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:25,230
out in secret where no one can see you.

126
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,560
No need to worry about me.

127
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,500
His Highness and I share

128
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:34,230
mutual respect and harmony.

129
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,590
All those rumors about him

130
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:39,170
are merely hearsay,

131
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:40,960
far from the truth.

132
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,409
Stop being stubborn.

133
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:44,030
Everyone knows

134
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:46,010
what kind of man the Prince of Dingbei is.

135
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:47,409
Now that I think about it,

136
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:48,990
it must be heaven's will

137
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:50,730
that you ended up with him.

138
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:54,730
And you dare to speak of mutual respect?

139
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:56,270
Do you really think he

140
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:57,310
even sees you?

141
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:00,710
In his eyes, who is there

142
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:02,640
besides the Dingbei Army?

143
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:06,450
He's surely cast you aside

144
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:08,610
like worn-out shoes!

145
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:20,770
Don't believe me?

146
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:23,090
Then let's see for ourselves.

147
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:29,030
Are you hurt?

148
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:33,250
I'm fine.

149
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,040
Princess,

150
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,390
you'd best watch your step.

151
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:53,090
Thank you, Your Highness.

152
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:54,190
It's over.

153
00:07:54,409 --> 00:07:55,750
Your Highness, put me down.

154
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:56,420
How lovey-dovey.

155
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:56,980
Yes.

156
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,530
Why is he still holding her?

157
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:00,890
You value reputation above all.

158
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:02,830
Isn't this the perfect way

159
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:04,500
to show the world

160
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:05,890
our marital harmony

161
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:07,400
and deep devotion?

162
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:10,700
Hiding behind the guise of a marriage contract

163
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,360
to suit your own convenience,

164
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,950
using marital harmony to cover up some unspeakable ailment.

165
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:17,870
How truly cunning.

166
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:20,250
You mocked me for being theatrical just yesterday,

167
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,050
but clearly,

168
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:23,090
you're the better actor.

169
00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:34,030
Your Highness,

170
00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:35,970
Lady Gu has arrived as summoned,

171
00:08:36,289 --> 00:08:37,320
but...

172
00:08:38,289 --> 00:08:39,130
But what?

173
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:40,630
The Princess

174
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:41,650
has come with her.

175
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,570
Got it.

176
00:08:44,059 --> 00:08:46,320
Your Highness, why don't you take a look?

177
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:01,840
I'll clean the stable now!

178
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:02,880
Do you enjoy

179
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:04,740
cleaning the stable?

180
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,480
Thank you for

181
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:20,620
accompanying me

182
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,800
today.

183
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:24,810
We've known each other for years.

184
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:26,280
No need to be so polite.

185
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:32,140
You don't need to worry.

186
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:33,840
Visiting

187
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:35,370
and bringing some food

188
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,450
is just

189
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:38,330
a daughter's way of showing care.

190
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,450
Since your father specifically asked to see you,

191
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:42,250
he must

192
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:43,450
have something

193
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:44,870
to tell you in private.

194
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:46,390
As an outsider,

195
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:48,070
and Prince of Dingbei's wife,

196
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,330
it's truly inappropriate for me to be present.

197
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:51,030
I'll

198
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,300
accompany you to the door,

199
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,740
and wait outside for you.

200
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:54,890
Should anything arise,

201
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:56,090
you need only call me.

202
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:57,250
Okay.

203
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:12,530
Father.

204
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,740
Jiurou.

205
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,540
Jiurou.

206
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:20,630
Greetings, Father.

207
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:37,950
Jiurou.

208
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:41,920
It seems the Marquis of Cheng'en

209
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,120
intends to entrust his contingency plan to his daughter.

210
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:53,860
Don't tell anyone about this.

211
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:55,120
Otherwise,

212
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:57,280
your brother's life will be in danger.

213
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:58,310
Got it.

214
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:01,990
The matter is urgent.

215
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:04,670
Don't delay it.

216
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,320
Father specifically asked me here

217
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,700
just to tell me this?

218
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:33,010
There's nothing else

219
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:35,290
you want to say?

220
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:37,280
If you can do this,

221
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:38,900
you'll be a great contributor

222
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,070
for the Gu family.

223
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:44,730
Have you ever considered

224
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:47,340
a way out for Mother and me?

225
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:49,800
Have you thought about

226
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,460
what our future would be like?

227
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,230
I've ended up in such a state.

228
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:59,050
I have no way out.

229
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:01,890
I can't compensate you and your mother.

230
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,910
However,

231
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,850
as long as your brother is safe,

232
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:06,830
he won't

233
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,060
leave you and your daughter behind.

234
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:10,670
Even when my brother

235
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:13,140
was in high favor,

236
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,620
he never looked out for me.

237
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:17,810
Now that he can hardly protect himself,

238
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:21,270
how would he care about Mother and me?

239
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:24,190
I have no choice.

240
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:26,970
Now your brother...

241
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,330
Father.

242
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:34,690
Father!

243
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:35,930
Father!

244
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:38,640
Father, what's wrong?

245
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,280
Father!

246
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:44,950
Father!

247
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:47,410
Father!

248
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:48,660
Father!

249
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:49,800
Father!

250
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:50,720
Father!

251
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,470
Father, wake up!

252
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:53,560
Father!

253
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,260
Father!

254
00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:58,860
Father.

255
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:01,460
How could this be?

256
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:04,370
He was fine just now!

257
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,540
Hurry up!

258
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:15,860
Get the coroner!

259
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:16,480
Okay.

260
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:29,850
Take him away.

261
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:30,490
Yes.

262
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:35,730
The Marquis of Cheng'en did die from poisoning.

263
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:36,880
The coroner also found arsenic

264
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,080
in the leftover wine.

265
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:40,310
Miss Gu,

266
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,410
You were the only one present at the time of the incident.

267
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:44,810
According to the law, we must question you.

268
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:45,960
-I...
-Don't be afraid.

269
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,520
Just answer what you're asked.

270
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,790
If it has nothing to do with you or you don't know,

271
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:50,070
just say so.

272
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:58,130
Your Highness.

273
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:02,310
Was the food and wine the Marquis of Cheng'en

274
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,940
had today brought by you?

275
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:04,740
Yes.

276
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,180
But I don't know

277
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:08,030
-the food and wine...
-Who made these dishes?

278
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:08,430
I?

279
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:09,640
Through whose hands have they passed?

280
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,840
I truly don't know.

281
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,180
It really has nothing to do with me.

282
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,910
Recall the details carefully.

283
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:15,770
From the moment you received the food and wine

284
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:17,500
to the time Marquis of Cheng'en showed signs of poisoning,

285
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,280
whom did you see? Whom did you speak with,

286
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,280
and what was said?

287
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:22,660
Who touched the food and wine?

288
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:24,030
Tell me everything.

289
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:26,540
Don't hide or miss anything.

290
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:27,430
Your Highness,

291
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:28,760
I truly don't know.

292
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:31,740
Here.

293
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:34,090
Today,

294
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,950
I went to the Gu's Mansion to fetch Jiurou.

295
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:36,970
I saw with my own eyes

296
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:38,800
the food and wine sent out from the kitchen

297
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,320
and carried by Jiurou.

298
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:41,420
On the way here,

299
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:43,300
the food box stayed in the carriage the whole time.

300
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,230
After arriving,

301
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:45,450
Jiurou brought it

302
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:46,910
into the cell herself.

303
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:48,460
No one else

304
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:49,890
touched it along the way.

305
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:51,590
In my opinion,

306
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:53,170
the only chance to poison

307
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,380
it was at the Gu's Mansion.

308
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:01,180
Indeed, just as Tan said.

309
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:07,370
What did Marquis of Cheng'en

310
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,990
say to you before he died?

311
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:10,070
I... I don't know.

312
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,300
I... I don't know.

313
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:12,850
Your Highness, you scared her.

314
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:14,130
There's no need to

315
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,910
be so harsh when questioning.

316
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:18,000
By law,

317
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:19,700
Miss Gu must still

318
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:21,130
go to the Court of Review.

319
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:25,830
I...

320
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:27,280
Don't be afraid.

321
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:30,450
I believe Jiurou is innocent.

322
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:32,330
But I know it's a matter of life and death.

323
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:34,190
You can't just listen to my words.

324
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:36,210
Jiurou is but

325
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:37,550
a timid young woman.

326
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:38,770
Since she must

327
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:40,250
go to the Court of Review,

328
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:43,290
I ask you to look after her

329
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:45,810
and not let others make things hard for her.

330
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:49,690
Okay.

331
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:55,650
This trip is unavoidable,

332
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:57,860
but once you're cleared of suspicion,

333
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,390
you'll return home safely.

334
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:01,750
With the Prince's special attention,

335
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,430
you'll be fine.

336
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:06,420
Miss Gu, please.

337
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:12,310
All he thinks about is investigating the case.

338
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:14,610
He doesn't care about the pain of losing family.

339
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:15,780
He has no sense of

340
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,930
pity or compassion.

341
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,300
Actually,

342
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:25,360
His Highness is thinking of Miss Gu as well.

343
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,880
The sooner we find clues

344
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:27,840
and solve the case,

345
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,550
the sooner

346
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:30,230
she can be cleared of trouble.

347
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:40,910
[Prince of Dingbei's Mansion]

348
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,010
You may leave.

349
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:51,410
These dishes are all the princess' favorites.

350
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:52,740
You just gave the order,

351
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:55,080
and the kitchen prepared them right away.

352
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:09,040
The Princess will surely be pleased

353
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,240
when she sees these.

354
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,790
I've served the Prince of Dingbei's Mansion for so many years,

355
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:14,630

356
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:15,730
feels like home.

357

359
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:22,329
Your Highness, what do you mean?

360
00:17:22,569 --> 00:17:23,970
How do I treat others?

361
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:26,410
You're righteous and noble,

362
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:27,670
with great integrity.

363
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:30,150

364

366

368
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,710
You are humble, courteous,

369
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:38,970

370
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:41,040
truly a virtuous gentleman.

371
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:44,700
No,

372
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,180
I'm a fierce,

373
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:48,170
heartless man, with no pity or tenderness.

374
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:50,820
Am I not

375
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:53,010
such a man?

376
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:57,770
Your Highness,

377
00:17:57,770 --> 00:17:59,380
there's no need to show tenderness

378
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:00,450
to other women.

379
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:02,010
Caring for the Princess alone

380
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:03,930
is more than enough.

381
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:05,530
Today, you specially ordered

382
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:07,680
dinner prepared to her taste—

383
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:09,730
such thoughtfulness and care,

384
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:11,110
that is the truest form

385
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:12,570
of tenderness.

386
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:16,070
Your Highness,

387
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:17,970
Tan isn't feeling well

388
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:19,730
and won't be joining the meal.

389
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:22,570
She was still speaking normally before we returned.

390
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:24,100
How is she suddenly unwell?

391
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:26,170
Was it the long day out

392
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,260
that wore her down?

393
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:28,920
Tan is...

394
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:40,990
Well...

395
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:11,030
What's wrong with you?

396
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:23,420
Is it because you're worried about Miss Gu

397
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:24,610
and feeling low?

398
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:31,540
Even so,

399
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:33,810
you can't skip dinner.

400
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:35,840
Starving yourself

401
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:37,810
will only make things worse.

402
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:46,540
Stop persuading me, Your Highness.

403
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,900
I truly don't have the strength to get up and eat.

404
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:57,900
Why do you look so pale,

405
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:02,530
and your hands are freezing?

406
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:06,420

Your Highness,

447
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:17,490
Tan was born prematurely in the eighth month,

448
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:18,960
so she has always been frail

449
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,440
and weaker than others.

450
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:22,850
Though she's been carefully looked after over the years,

451

her cold condition

452
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:25,690
has never fully healed.

453
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:31,810
Add more hot water for Tan.

454
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:33,490
Don't let her soak for too long.

your kind intention.

463
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:54,170
I've urged you many times to buy a house,

but you always refuse.

A dignified Vice Minister of Revenue,

00:23:57,890 --> 00:24:00,120
yet squeezed into a shabby inn,

467
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:01,470
what a disgrace.

468
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:03,810

00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:06,690
Why spend a fortune

471
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:08,350
on an empty residence?

472
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:12,050
Though the man is dead,

473
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:15,790
we must still wrap things up cleanly.

474
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:18,380
Rest assured, Chancellor.

475
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:20,330
Now that Gu Jinzhong is dead,

the military embezzlement case

477
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:23,150

don't hold back.

523
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:04,700
Xu.

524
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:05,930
A word in private.

525
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:07,680
Please.

526
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:13,430
[Utmost Loyalty and Noble Integrity]

527
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:13,390
Greetings, Your Highness.

528
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,810
Greetings, Uncle.

529
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:19,250
Your Highness.

530
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:21,130
Your Highness, no need to be so polite.

531
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:21,930
Come now,

532
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:23,970
we're family, no need for ceremony.

533
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:24,930
Xu.

534
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:27,650
Any leads on Tan's abduction?

535
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:30,260
I just

536
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:32,170
discussed it with the Duke of Chang.

537
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:33,770
As her maternal uncle,

538
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,320
he should be informed.

539
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:37,260
You're one to talk.

540
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:38,360
Such a major incident,

541
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,330
and you kept it from me till now.

542
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:40,470
The moment she went missing,

543
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:41,430
you should've told me.

544
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:43,200
At least I could have helped.

545
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:44,430
That was my decision.

546
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:46,150
On the wedding day,

547
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:47,330
with so many people around,

548
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:48,410
the fewer who knew,

549
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,730
the less risk there was.

550
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:52,590
You were thorough in your thinking, Your Highness.

551
00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:55,570
I have a suspect in mind for the person

552
00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:57,580
who abducted Tan that day.

553
00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:59,630
But I can't confirm anything yet.

554
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:00,840
However, Father-in-law,

555
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,300
I suspect you already know

556
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,330
who's behind it.

557
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,570
The alliance between your two families

558
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:07,830
is essentially a union

559
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:09,340
of Yangxi Prefecture and the Dingbei Army.

560
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:10,660
Such prominence

561
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,180
is bound to invite trouble

562
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:14,360
and make you targets in court.

563
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:16,220
In truth,

564
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:17,560
even before Tan's wedding,

565
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,750
I had decided

566
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:22,020
to return control
of Yangxi Prefecture to the court.

567
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:23,100
I'm old now,

568
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,250
with many ailments.

569
00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:26,530
It's time the court

570
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:28,730
appoints someone more capable.

571
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:31,190
Brother-in-law.

572
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:33,000
You've spent your life on the battlefield,

573
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,200
devoted all

574
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:36,060
your strength to Yangxi Prefecture.

575
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:38,660
Are you truly willing
to retire just like that?

576
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:40,880
Willing or not, what choice do I have?

577
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:42,000
Only by doing so

578
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:43,200
can I dispel suspicion

579
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,340
and keep the peace.

580
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,560
You're oversimplifying things.

581
00:27:46,810 --> 00:27:48,090
Even if you step down,

582
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:49,750
that man won't let it go.

583
00:27:49,810 --> 00:27:51,910
His ambition is far greater than that.

584
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:53,660
But at least he won't drag Tan

585
00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:54,550
into it again.

586
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:55,650
She can return

587
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,940
to a peaceful life.

588
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:59,670
The tree may wish to be still,
but the wind will not stop.

589
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:00,940
You're a soldier through and through.

590
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:02,180
Great on the battlefield,

591
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:04,180
but poor at political maneuvering.

592
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:09,830
The matter of handing over military power

593
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:11,030
should not be rushed.

594
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,710
You know well, Father-in-law,

595
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:13,750
soldiers follow

596
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:15,330
their commanders,

597
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:17,250
not cold tokens of authority.

598
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:19,150
Even the Emperor

599
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:21,040
would need to deliberate before restoring

600
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,840
control over Yangxi Prefecture

601
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:25,980
for the sake of the bigger picture.

602
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:27,800
As for Tan,

603
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:30,990
[Utmost Loyalty and Noble Integrity]

604
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:30,710
please rest assured, both of you.

605
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:32,190
As long as I live,

606
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:33,510
I'll do everything in my power

607
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:34,430
to protect her.

608
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:36,350
Much obliged, Xu.

609
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:44,270
It was only after speaking with Uncle

610
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:45,070
that I learned

611
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:47,080
what happened on your wedding day.

612
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:49,330
Everything was chaos that day.

613
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:50,830
I didn't even get to ask you.

614
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:52,760
I wanted to visit you
at the Prince of Dingbei's Mansion,

615
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,000
but Mother said

616
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:56,220
the homecoming rules couldn't be broken.

617
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:59,190
Otherwise, the Prince's household
would laugh at us.

618
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:00,670
Luckily, no harm was done.

619
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:03,310
You worried for nothing these past few days.

620
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:04,110
So,

621
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:06,110
do you know who was behind it?

622
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:11,310
I do have a strong suspicion.

623
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:14,910
But there's no solid proof.

624
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:17,750
Is it your godfather?

625
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:21,500
When I arrived,

626
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,990
I overheard Father and Mother discussing

627
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:23,790
that the one most opposed

628
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:24,630
to this marriage

629
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:25,760
was your godfather.

630
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:27,250
Tan,

631
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:29,150
your status has changed greatly.

632
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:31,480
You must be extra cautious going forward.

633
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:32,740
I know.

634
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:34,930
Now that I'm the Princess of Dingbei,

635
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:36,390
everything I say and do

636
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:40,120
reflects both the Ming family
and the Prince of Dingbei's Mansion.

637
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:42,440
Peace between our families

638
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:44,270
is all I wish for.

639
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:47,910
As for my godfather...

640
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:51,390
If he still holds onto our past bond,

641
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:54,200
I won't push things to the breaking point.

642
00:29:58,270 --> 00:29:59,070
Tan,

643
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:01,190
I heard on the wedding day,

644
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:02,620
your husband

645
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,390
carried you out of the palace the whole way.

646
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:05,390
Is it true?

647
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:08,520
Even you've heard that?

648
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:09,430
Then I suppose

649
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:10,950
the entire capital knows.

650
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:13,400
So the rumor's true.

651
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:14,270
Your husband

652
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:16,800
really is both considerate and domineering.

653
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:20,990
What's wrong?

654
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:22,720
Is your husband not good to you?

655
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:28,680
I can't quite say what's wrong.

656
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:33,050
But I can't say what's right, either…

657
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:38,070
Have you two consummated the marriage yet?

658
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:39,950
Minmin.

659
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:41,670
You're an unmarried girl.

660
00:30:41,670 --> 00:30:42,970
How can you talk about such things?

661
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:43,950
What's wrong with that?

662
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:45,090
Is there something to be shy about?

663
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:45,910
The door's closed anyway.

664
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:47,370
No one can hear us.

665
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:49,780
From what I see, your husband

666
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:50,540
is handsome and strong.

667
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:51,510
He must be quite capable.

668
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:53,370
In those storybooks,

669
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,050
on the wedding night...

670
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:02,660
Minmin.

671
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:05,530
I feel like

672
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:09,590
His Highness doesn't like me.

673
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:11,080
What?

674
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:12,290
Tan,

675
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:14,010
you're beautiful

676
00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:15,430
and talented.

677
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:16,760
If he doesn't fancy you,

678
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,070
then his standards must be in the heavens.

679
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:19,470
If even you can't catch his eye,

680
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:20,430
what kind of

681
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:21,710
woman could?

682
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:24,050
Maybe he has… a problem

683
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:26,160
in that regard.

684
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:46,450
[Graceful as Orchid, Pure as Angelica]

685
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:50,760
Thank you.

686
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:55,910
Please, Father-in-law,

687
00:31:55,910 --> 00:31:57,400
have a cup of wine from me.

688
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:00,510
Xu,

689
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:03,190
you're thoughtful.

690
00:32:04,430 --> 00:32:06,640
It would be rude of me to refuse.

691
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:19,440
Everyone, let's eat.

692
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:20,970
Why all the formality?

693
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,240
We're all family.

694
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:24,710
No need for such ceremony.

695
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:26,350
Xu.

696
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:27,050
Here.

697
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:28,600
Thank you, Father-in-law.

698
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:31,090
Tan, eat more.

699
00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:37,040
Since Tan married,

700
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:40,580
our mansion hasn't been this lively.

701
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:42,830
It's only been a few days,

702
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:43,950
but you're already

703
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:45,370
being sentimental.

704
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,650
Yes, yes, yes.

705
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:49,240
Come on.

706
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:51,110
Try this.

707
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:53,540
It's venison I hunted myself.

708
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:54,830
Xu.

709
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:57,000
You must have some.

710
00:32:57,270 --> 00:32:58,790
This is good.

711
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:00,210
It's a great tonic.

712
00:33:00,390 --> 00:33:01,750
It can strengthen the spleen

713
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:02,390
and the kidneys, and builds vitality....

714
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:03,390
Brother-in-law.

715
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:05,290
Do you really need to say that?

716
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:06,870
With the ladies present?

717
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:08,550
Your Highness.

718
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:09,910
Please have more venison.

719
00:33:09,910 --> 00:33:11,400
Why can't I say it?

720
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:13,960
I guess she always speaks her mind,

721
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:15,800
no matter who's listening.

722
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:17,470
Tan.

723
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:20,090
You must eat more of this Korean ginseng.

724
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:21,660
It replenishes your energy,

725
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:22,930
good for girls.

726
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:23,630
I've had a box

727
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:24,670
prepared for you.

728
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:26,630
Take it with you later.

729
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:28,910
I truly hope

730
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:30,630
to hold a grandchild soon

731
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:33,390
and enjoy the joys of family.

732
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:39,300
Children

733
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:41,000
are heaven's will.

734
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:42,830
True, but while heaven may set the course,

735
00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:44,380
we must make it happen.

736
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:45,590
I will not

737
00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:47,630
disappoint you, Father-in-law.

738
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:48,160
Exactly.

739
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:50,650
You both make good points.

740
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:52,510
Come, let's drink.

741
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:53,670
Cheers.

742
00:33:58,590 --> 00:33:59,120
Sir.

743
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:07,000
Sir.

744
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:09,630
News from the Court of Judicial Review,

745
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:12,190
the cause of Gu Jinzhong's
death is confirmed.

746
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:13,989
It was the Gu family's cook,
harboring a grudge,

747
00:34:13,989 --> 00:34:15,469
who seized an opportunity for revenge.

748
00:34:15,469 --> 00:34:17,030
Gu Jiurou is now cleared of suspicion

749
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:18,290
and has returned home.

750
00:34:18,469 --> 00:34:20,530
His Majesty summons you to the palace

751
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:22,989
to discuss Marquis of Cheng'en's charges.

752
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:26,000
Father-in-law,

753
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:28,280
the Emperor's summons came suddenly.

754
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:31,760
A royal order cannot be defied.

755
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:34,310
Go quickly, Xu.

756
00:34:34,429 --> 00:34:35,870
It's just a family meal.

757
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:38,639
There will be plenty
of chances in the future.

758
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:49,630
Today is the homecoming.

759
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:51,989
You should be
spending time with your father.

760
00:34:51,989 --> 00:34:54,350
I hope my departure
doesn't spoil the mood.

761
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:55,550
Once I'm done at the palace,

762
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:57,010
I'll return to pick you up.

763
00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:04,200
Thank you, Your Highness,
for your thoughtfulness.

764
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:08,890
Tan.

765
00:35:09,790 --> 00:35:12,330
With your husband treating you so well,

766
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,250
I can be at ease.

767
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:17,310
Everyone, please sit.

768
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:18,710
Let's continue the meal.

769
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:23,750
[Graceful as Orchid, Pure as Angelica]

770
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:38,990
From what I see, your husband

771
00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:40,390
is full of youthful vigor.

772
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:42,850
Doesn't seem like someone with any… issues.

773
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:44,830
Are you overthinking it?

774
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:50,010
He's simply not interested in me.

775
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:56,970
Your Highness,

776
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:58,270
Miss Gu's maid

777
00:35:58,270 --> 00:35:59,430
seeks an urgent audience with you.

778
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:01,290
She says it concerns her mistress

779
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:02,690
and begs for your help.

780
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:04,350
Bring her in quickly.

781
00:36:04,350 --> 00:36:05,810
Her Highness will see you.

782
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:09,950
Greetings, Your Highness.

783
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:10,750
Your Highness,

784
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:11,770
my lady had just returned home

785
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:12,940
from the Court of Judicial Review.

786
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:14,390
But now she's disappeared again.

787
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:15,750
Madam is terribly worried,

788
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:17,070
beside herself with fear.

789
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:18,870
She knows my lady is close with you,

790
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:19,790
so she sent me here

791
00:36:19,790 --> 00:36:21,070
to ask for your help.

792
00:36:21,590 --> 00:36:23,990
Have you checked
the places she often visits?

793
00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:24,970
We've searched them all.

794
00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:26,050
No sign of her.

795
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:27,430
After returning home,

796
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:29,000
my lady was visibly uneasy.

797
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:29,910
Soon after,

798
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:31,420
she left the house alone.

799
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:32,910
She never goes out

800
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:34,310
without a maid.

801
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:37,510
No one knows why she did so today.

802
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:42,120
Did Madam Gu say anything else?

803
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:42,990
No.

804
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:44,470
But I vaguely heard my lady say

805
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:46,150
to Madam

806
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:48,440
that if the matter succeeds,

807
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:50,060
both of them will be safe.

808
00:36:57,470 --> 00:36:58,270
Your Majesty,

809
00:36:58,910 --> 00:37:00,070
the cook from
Marquis of Cheng'en's Mansion,

810
00:37:00,070 --> 00:37:01,330
Zhu Da, has confessed.

811
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:02,510
Years ago,

812
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:04,410
Gu Wenyan insulted his daughter.

813
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:06,070
To protect his son,

814
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:07,510
Marquis of Cheng'en broke Zhu Da's leg

815
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:08,750
when he tried to report the crime.

816
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:11,270
Zhu Da held a deep grudge

817
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:12,790
and waited years to strike.

818
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:14,310
Out of fear for his family,

819
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:16,040
he stayed silent all this time.

820
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:18,390
Now that Marquis of Cheng'en
has fallen from grace,

821
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:19,350
and Zhu Da learned

822
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:20,950
that Gu Jiurou
would be visiting the prison,

823
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:22,470
he felt the time had come.

824
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:23,350
He poisoned

825
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:24,790
the food and wine prepared

826
00:37:24,790 --> 00:37:25,700
for that day.

827
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:30,510
Your Majesty,

828
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:32,270
before Marquis of Cheng'en died,

829
00:37:32,270 --> 00:37:33,670
he confessed to nothing.

830
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:35,950
Not a word about his embezzlement.

831
00:37:36,350 --> 00:37:38,510
I could only examine
the accounts in his household

832
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:40,440
and verify the following amounts.

833
00:37:40,830 --> 00:37:42,760
Please review them, Your Majesty.

834
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:55,150
Truly a bottomless greed.

835
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:56,550
Insatiable like a tiger.

836
00:37:57,510 --> 00:37:58,310
Your Majesty,

837
00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:00,830
besides embezzlement,

838
00:38:01,350 --> 00:38:03,070
there are over a dozen

839
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:04,190
other crimes, great and small.

840
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:06,120
Please review them, Your Majesty.

841
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:13,230
Your Majesty,

842
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:15,030
the evidence is conclusive.

843
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:17,270
This case should be closed without delay.

844
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:18,000
It would also

845
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:20,750
serve as a clear message
to the Prince of Dingbei.

846
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:21,580
Your Majesty,

847
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,910
think of how many scholars
Marquis of Cheng'en ruined,

848
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:25,070
their careers destroyed.

849
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:26,390
If not severely punished,

850
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:27,950
it will be hard to comfort

851
00:38:27,950 --> 00:38:30,180
those who unfairly failed their exams.

852
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:35,640
Chancellor Shu, what do you think?

853
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:37,930
Your Majesty.

854
00:38:38,270 --> 00:38:39,670
Since the case is clear,

855
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:41,670
further delay serves no purpose.

856
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:42,670
I believe

857
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:44,030
that if the position
of Governor of the Capital Prefecture

858
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,310
remains vacant for too long,

859
00:38:45,310 --> 00:38:46,210
it may

860
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,700
jeopardize the entire capital's security.

861
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:50,870
Have the Hanlin Academy draft an edict:

862
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:51,990
Gu Jinzhong

863
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:55,110
is guilty of embezzling military funds,
cheating in imperial exams,

864
00:38:55,110 --> 00:38:57,750
indulging his son's crimes,
and taking lives recklessly.

865
00:38:57,750 --> 00:38:58,990
Though he is dead,

866
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:02,160
his crimes must not go unpunished.

867
00:39:02,270 --> 00:39:03,200
I hereby command

868
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:06,870
that the marquis title
of the Gu family be revoked.

869
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:09,270
Seal off the Marquis
of Cheng'en's Mansion.

870
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:12,270
Confiscate all private property
and turn it over to the state.

871
00:39:12,270 --> 00:39:12,950
All members of the Gu family

872
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:14,810
aged 15 and above shall be exiled.

873
00:39:14,870 --> 00:39:15,730
Minors shall be

874
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:17,710
sold into servitude.

875
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:19,470
I receive the decree.

876
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:20,960
Minister Zhang.

877
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:23,000
At your service.

878
00:39:23,350 --> 00:39:24,750
Once the edict is sealed,

879
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:26,230
carry it out at once

880
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:28,680
at the Marquis of Cheng'en's Mansion.

881
00:39:28,790 --> 00:39:30,310
Yes, Your Majesty.

882
00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:35,870
What a clean move,
cutting off the tail to save the body.

883
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:36,830
The mastermind behind it all

884
00:39:36,830 --> 00:39:38,030
got away without

885
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:39,710
lifting a finger.

886
00:39:41,390 --> 00:39:43,450
So long as the connection is severed,

887
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:44,990
sacrificing one Marquis of Cheng'en

888
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:45,850
means nothing.

889
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:47,730
I had thought

890
00:39:47,870 --> 00:39:48,890
we finally had something

891
00:39:48,890 --> 00:39:49,910
on Marquis of Cheng'en

892
00:39:49,910 --> 00:39:50,630
that we could use this

893
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:51,890
to crack the case open.

894
00:39:52,910 --> 00:39:54,110
But in the end,

895
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:55,830
all was in vain.

896
00:39:59,070 --> 00:39:59,630
Sir.

897
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:01,030
Miss Gu has left the city.

898
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:11,310
Your Highness,

899
00:40:11,310 --> 00:40:12,790
the gatekeeper's servant inquired.

900
00:40:12,790 --> 00:40:14,510
He said there was only one young lady

901
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:15,530
who hired a carriage
to leave the city today.

902
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:16,950
From the coachman's description,

903
00:40:16,950 --> 00:40:18,410
it matches Miss Gu Jiurou.

904
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:21,070
Did the coach house say where she went?

905
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:22,750
Reportedly to Willow Village,

906
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:24,190
6 miles south of the capital.

907
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:26,110
The coachmen even asked

908
00:40:26,110 --> 00:40:27,030
why a young lady

909
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:28,630
would go alone to such a remote place,

910
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:30,090
so it stuck in their minds.

911
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:32,560
Was His Highness informed of this?

912
00:40:34,110 --> 00:40:36,230
The palace guards said

913
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:37,430
His Highness has already left,

914
00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:38,960
likely on urgent business.

915
00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:41,630
The Marquis of Cheng'en only ever cared

916
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:42,750
about his precious son.

917
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:44,510
He barely acknowledged Jiurou.

918
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:45,910
When he was imprisoned

919
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:47,030
and named her specifically,

920
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:48,430
I knew something was off.

921
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:49,870
No one knows what they said

922
00:40:49,870 --> 00:40:51,530
when father and daughter met.

923
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:52,830
Jiurou is timid by nature,

924
00:40:52,830 --> 00:40:54,160
always avoids trouble.

925
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:57,210
Why would she suddenly leave the city alone?

926
00:41:01,590 --> 00:41:03,320
Where is Your Highness headed?

927
00:41:03,470 --> 00:41:04,390
I'm worried about Jiurou.

928
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:05,390
I must go find her.

929
00:41:05,550 --> 00:41:06,260
Tan.

930
00:41:06,790 --> 00:41:07,720
I'll go with you.

931
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:08,580
Just in case.

932
00:41:08,950 --> 00:41:09,810
Your Highness.

933
00:41:10,310 --> 00:41:11,300
Should we

934
00:41:11,330 --> 00:41:12,710
inform the Marquis?

935
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:16,790
The Ming family

936
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:19,110
is already under intense scrutiny.

937
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:19,910
Better

938
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:21,070
not involve

939
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:21,870
my father.

940
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:23,830
If Gu Jiurou's trip

941
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:25,510
is related to the Marquis of Cheng'en,

942
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:26,710
then she is in danger.

943
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:27,630
We could

944
00:41:27,790 --> 00:41:29,190
let Zhang Huaiyu know

945
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:31,520
and have him inform the Prince of Dingbei.

946
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:44,480
As long as...

947
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:46,530
As long as you release my brother,

948
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:47,110
I…

949
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:48,870
I'll return all the evidence

950
00:41:48,870 --> 00:41:50,190
Father left behind.

951
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:54,170
What kind of evidence could he have left?

952
00:41:57,790 --> 00:41:59,450
There's a hidden compartment

953
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:00,710
under the potted plant in my study.

954
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:02,070
Inside is a ledger.

955
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:03,200
Take it,

956
00:42:03,310 --> 00:42:05,310
signal according to the instructions,

957
00:42:05,310 --> 00:42:07,840
and someone will surely show up.

958
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:10,620
You must save your brother.

959
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:11,830
With that ledger,

960
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:14,530
they won't dare harm you.

961
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:16,990
That evidence

962
00:42:16,990 --> 00:42:18,120
means nothing to me.

963
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:20,510
If you promise our safety,

964
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:22,590
I will destroy it

965
00:42:22,590 --> 00:42:24,190
and rid you of any loose ends.

966
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:26,510
His Majesty has already decreed

967
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:28,310
the Marquis of Cheng'en's Mansion
be confiscated.

968
00:42:28,310 --> 00:42:30,410
You should know

969
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:31,900
what fate awaits Madam Gu.

970
00:42:32,990 --> 00:42:34,320
Hand over the evidence,

971
00:42:34,870 --> 00:42:36,670
and I can ensure

972
00:42:38,310 --> 00:42:40,510
you and your mother aren't implicated.

973
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:43,270
But if you gain the evidence,

974
00:42:43,270 --> 00:42:44,870
you'll kill us to silence us.

975
00:42:45,270 --> 00:42:46,390
How can I trust you?

976
00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:54,020
Brother!

977
00:42:57,270 --> 00:42:59,070
Once you two are dead,

978
00:43:00,190 --> 00:43:02,730
who else would know about the evidence?

979
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:12,830
Zhuiying.

980
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:20,240
Go.

981
00:43:38,430 --> 00:43:40,080
Help! Help!

982
00:43:41,230 --> 00:43:41,910
Ming Tan!

983
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:42,730
Jiurou!

984
00:43:44,150 --> 00:43:44,710
Tan!

985
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:45,870
Ming Tan!

986
00:43:45,890 --> 00:43:46,350
Are you alright?

987
00:43:46,350 --> 00:43:46,950
I'm fine.

988
00:44:04,030 --> 00:44:04,810
It was him...
