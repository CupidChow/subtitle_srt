You and I are the same.

We have no control over our own bodies

or fates.

different.

I'm here today

You're the backbone of the nation.

12

I cannot bear to see you

13

deceived and used by others,

14
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:13,560
only to sacrifice your life
for them so willingly.

I'll give you two days.

If you change your mind,

17
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:19,600
there might be a chance

18
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,860
to turn things around.

19

Wait, Your Majesty,

20
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,160
this is a token given to me by Su Wenchun

21
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,160
when he took me in.

22
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:34,340
Please have someone fetch brush and ink.

23

I, Liu Mo,

24
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,560
am willing to confess and testify that
Chancellor Su

25
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,020
is not only my true master
behind the scenes,

26
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,000
but also the mastermind
behind the Su family case.

27
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,440
I, Liu Mo,

28
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,560
know full well that my crimes
are unforgivable,

29
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,000
and I do not regret dying.

30
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,980
I only beg Your Majesty

31
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,530
to thoroughly investigate the
case from years past,

32
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:04,110
and return my father's innocence.

33
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,320
The crimes of Su Wenchun

34
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:09,190
are too numerous to record,

35
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,240
and the souls wronged under his hand

36
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,490
are far more than just your father.

37
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:17,970
This time,

38
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,980
I shall speak out and deliver justice

39
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,210
on behalf of all who were
wrongfully silenced.

40

Bring brush, ink, paper, and inkstone.

41
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:25,680
Yes.

42
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:37,329
You still betrayed him.

43
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,280
If not for the hatred of
my father's murder,

44
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,840
I would have gladly gone to my death.

45
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:49,590
Only then did you ask me

46
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,560
why I suddenly vanished
all those years ago.

47
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,020
Because the Chancellor knew that

48
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,840
even the most loyal soldier

49
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,320
may one day grow out of control.

50
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:03,210
And your betrayal

51
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:06,270
can prove that.

Chu nearly committed a grave mistake.

119
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:00,460
She truly needs to reflect deeply,

120

so she can sincerely repent and reform.

he'd never act without orders!

178
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,200

Father,

200
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:37,640
Nanlyu must have learned

201
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,940
Yangxi Prefecture's defenses are weakened.

202
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:40,120
So they're launching a surprise attack.

203
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,660
I'll go to the City Defense Office
immediately to organize defenses.

204
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,720
I won't let Nanlyu's scheme succeed!

205
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:49,310
Are you worried that

206
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,330

defend the city?

207

The Nanlyu army is attacking.

208

At least they have ten thousand troops.

209
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:59,960
With Yangxi Prefecture's forces
mobilized northward,

210
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,840
Lingzhou stands isolated

211
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,220
and vulnerable.

212
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,280
We likely won't hold out for long.

213

Even if Guo Bingmao has rebelled,

214
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,850
Yangxi Prefecture still has
garrison troops.

215
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:11,610
But

216
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,360
without a commander present,

217
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,480
no one would dare authorize
reinforcements,

218
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,320
even if we requested
them.

219
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:20,610
If we report this to the court now

220
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:22,080
and wait for an imperial decree,

221

it'll be far too late by the
time it arrives!

Who says Yangxi Prefecture
lacks a commander?

who can resolve this crisis.

225

Ever since learning of
Guo Bingmao's rebellion,

226

dark premonitions.

228
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:50,420
Nanlyu has coveted Lingzhou for years.

229

remains unclear.

they will never fight against me.

244
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:39,040
The Yangxi Prefecture's sacred duty

245
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,300
is to repel Nanlyu invaders
and guard our borders.

When he took Tan

as his adopted daughter,

500
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,520

All that kindness and righteousness

503
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,180
were all fake.

504

In my opinion,

505
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,160
such an evil

I just...

514
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:36,760
Help!

515
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:39,870
I can't hold...

516
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:41,730
Yu!

517
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,720
Zhang Huaiyu.

518
00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:44,140
Zhang Huaiyu.

519
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,440
Are you okay?

520
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,840
I-I can't take it anymore.

521
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,680
I'm going to hell soon.

522
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,110
Hurry, help him in.

523
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:51,800
Okay.

524
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:53,320
Be careful.

525
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:55,100
Be careful. Don't touch the wounds.

526
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,020
Let's move.

527
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,000
Slow down.

528
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,320
You're not good at martial arts.

529
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,000
You should've stayed back.

530
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:01,840
Why tried to play the hero?

531
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:02,240
I...

532
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,600
Yu!

533
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,160
Why are you covered in blood?

534
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,520
Where exactly are you hurt?

535
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,160
My left arm

536
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,500
got slashed with a sword.

537
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:10,380
Here, here.

538
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:11,730
My right arm

539
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:12,830
was stabbed.

540
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:13,930
And the back.

541
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:14,820
My back and waist.

542
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:15,890
I'm wounded all over.

543
00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:17,580
It hurts. I can't take it anymore.

544
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:19,200
I'm badly hurt.

545
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,600
I-It hurts so much.

546
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:23,930
It hurts.

547
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:33,990
Minmin.

548
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:35,620
I was just kidding.

549
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,840
I-I was just trying to scare you.

550
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:37,560
I'm fine.

551
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:38,720
I just got a minor injury.

552
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,980
It's nothing serious.

553
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:44,320
Alright, alright.

554
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,480
Don't cry.

555
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,120
Minmin, I'm really fine.

556
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:51,760
Look.

557
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,160
Are you really okay?

558
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,360
Really. Look.

559
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:55,750
I'm fine.

560
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:56,680
I'm fine.

561
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,130
I'm really fine.

562
00:30:58,740 --> 00:30:59,850
It hurts.

563
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,920
Even a minor wound is a wound.

564
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:06,700
Don't make it worse.

565
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:07,930
How dare you lie to me!

566
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,120
I'm fine.

567
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:42,970
These are the rarest spices

568
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:44,750
in the world.

569
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:47,590
Especially this ambergris.

570
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,800
Comes from the deep sea
of Nanyang.

571
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:52,360
The annual gain is only half a catty.

572
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:08,540
Fourth Miss, would you like to
take a look?

573
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:13,760
You're someone

574
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:16,640
who loves, understands,
and cherishes fragrance.

575
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,360
The book written by the Taoist Ruoxu,

576
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:22,090
Yunxiao's Fragrance-Making,

577
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,120
may suit your tastes.

578
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,500
Last time

579
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,580
I bid on the sachet Taoist Ruoxu used.

580
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,560
It was meant as a gift for you.

581
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,360
Unfortunately,
things didn't go as planned.

582
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,980
So let this fragrance-making ancient book

583
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:39,180
as my late gift.

584
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:43,080
You truly are remarkably capable.

585
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:46,000
This ancient book
has been lost for a long time.

586
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,200
It's hard to find it.

587
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,840
Yet you found it

588
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:51,920
in a short time.

589
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,000
As long as you accept it,

590
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:56,080
everything I've done

591
00:32:56,330 --> 00:32:57,770
is worth it.

592
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,870
I have no interest in smuggled goods.

593
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,760
What I care about

594
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:04,880
is how you plan

595
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,840
to handle the Feng family.

596
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,420
That depends on whether

597
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:17,180
they are willing to surrender.

598
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:21,430
The Feng family

599
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:23,450
are the morale of the Lingzhou army.

600
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,260
If they surrender,

601
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:26,690
the people of Lingzhou

602
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:28,870
will be loyal to the Nanlyu.

603
00:33:29,130 --> 00:33:30,530
If they don't surrender,

604
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:35,870
I'll have no choice but to kill them

605
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:37,450
to warn others.

606
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:47,850
If you'd

607
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,480
accompany me today,

608
00:33:49,930 --> 00:33:51,450
I may consider

609
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,240
sparing their lives.

610
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:08,239
[Shengyi Inn]

611
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:04,410
I'll

612
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:05,790
go with you.

613
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:09,050
But aside from the Feng family,

614
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,320
you must not harm

615
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,760
anyone by my side.

616
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,600
I really envy

617
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,239
the people around you.

618
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:18,480
They can be protected by you.

619
00:34:19,429 --> 00:34:21,389
I can set them free.

620
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,320
As long as

621
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,320
you return with me

622
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,639
to Nanlyu.

623
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:34,199
But if the rest of my life

624
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:36,080
is to be like a caged bird,

someone's selfish desires,

630
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,800
why would I live in the world?

631
00:34:47,130 --> 00:34:48,800
and suffer such humiliation?

632
00:34:55,969 --> 00:34:58,740
In Nanlyu, the world is vast.

633
00:34:58,770 --> 00:35:00,970
Would I ever keep you from being free?

634
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,780
It's not what I want.

635
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,160
How can I be free?

636
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:07,080
If you've come

637
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:07,880
just to

Fourth Miss, please get on the carriage.

641
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:18,620
Our Xian people value reputation.

We strictly observe gender segregation.

I am the Princess of Dingbei.

It's been a whole day.

647
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,520
I wonder how Her Highness is now.

648
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:51,090
Why did you both go quiet?

649
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:53,230
We need to find a way to get out of here.

650
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:54,780
I've been thinking about it all day.

651
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:55,900
If you have a way,

652
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,650
why are you still trapped here?

653
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,950
After a full day of observation,

654
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:00,850
I've concluded these knots

655
00:36:00,850 --> 00:36:02,200
can only be cut with something sharp.

656
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,640
If you keep struggling,

657
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:07,040
it will only get tighter.

658
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:10,120
And where are we supposed
to find something sharp?

659
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,120
Have you Jinyun Guards ever

660
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,840
trained for this kind of

661
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,760
self-rescue when trapped?

662
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,160
Jinyun Guards are human too.

663
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,040
Do you expect us to

664
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,060
be capable of everything?

665
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:24,200
You make it sound like

666
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,680
we are trapped here

667
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,090
because we don't want to leave.

668

Second Young Master Shu is not
from the Jinyun Guards.

And he doesn't practice martial arts.

670
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:30,900
He's just curious.

671
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:32,590
Why take your anger out on him?

672
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:33,800
If he doesn't understand martial arts,

673
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,200
then why ask so many questions?

674
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,080
I don't understand poetry,

675
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,360
yet I don't go around asking about it.

676
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,680
That's like playing the lute to a cow.

00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:54,920
hadn't held me back today,

686
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,520
I'd have taken Wen Zong down.

687
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,880
If I had taken him down,

688
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:58,600
we wouldn't have

689
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,720
ended up like this.

690
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:00,860
Say something, Zhuifeng.

691
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:01,740
-I...
-Shut up!

692
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:04,570
If we had actually fought today,

693
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:06,240
General Feng would have died for sure.

694
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,280
Besides, Her Highness gave orders.

695
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,480
How could we disobey?

696
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:09,940
If we had acted,

697
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,120
she'd be in even greater danger.

698
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:13,680
Before Sir left, he told us

699
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,040
to protect Her Highness.

700
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,160
If she is in danger,

701
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,620
it will be our negligence.

702
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:18,640
Wait.

703
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:21,320
You are Her Highness's personal guard.

704
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,560
You failed your duty.

705
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,760
Why did you drag us into this?

706
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:24,840
You are not?

707
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:25,600
These days,

708
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,160
you've been with Her Highness these days.

709
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,200
Following her is one thing.

710
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,280
Guarding her is another.

711
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,480
Do you think following her around

712
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,870
is just for fun?

713
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:32,480
I...

714
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,440
Zhuiyu.

715
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:35,720
A man should be broad-minded

716
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:36,640
and generous.

717
00:37:36,690 --> 00:37:37,920
How could you

718
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,440
fight over every little thing?

719
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,240
Besides,

720
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:41,840
making things difficult for a lady

721
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,700
is not what a gentleman should do.

722
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:45,000
Shut up!

723
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:46,130
You shut up!

724
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,240
You too.

725
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:49,890
Shut up!

726
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:08,120
Why did you bring me here?

727
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:09,890
This is Lingzhou.

728
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,160
It will always be.

729
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:13,870
Whether it belongs to Xian

730
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,160
or Nanlyu,

731
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:16,320
it will never change

732
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,840
its original appearance.

733
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,880
In fact,

734
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,600
you are the mastermind

735
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:26,220
in Lingzhou smuggling case.

736
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:29,160
The one behind Mr. Luo.

737
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:32,160
Mr. Luo tried to take the blame

738
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,830
and said that he colluded with

739
00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:34,950
Su Errong.

740
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,410
In fact, he was covering for you

741
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,530
and trying to pin
everything on the Su family.

742
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,600
He would rather die

743
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,000
to protect you.

744
00:38:48,570 --> 00:38:50,100
Everyone in their position

745
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:52,060
has their own burdens

746
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:53,050
and purposes.

747
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:56,120
Mr. Luo did it for Nanlyu.

748
00:38:56,290 --> 00:38:58,530
Su Errong did it for his family.

749
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:01,200
From their different perspectives,

750
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,200
how do we judge right from wrong?

751
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:06,820
What about you?

752
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,360
Why are you doing this?

753
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:12,720
Money?

754
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:14,800
Interests?

755
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,760
Or selfish desires?

756
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,000
Look.

757
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:26,600
They say if you make a sincere wish

758
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,320
when you see a sky lantern,

759
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:29,740
it'll come true.

760
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:31,990
Do you have a wish, Fourth Miss?

761
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,370
No matter what you want,

762
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,950
I will find it for you

763
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:41,200
even if it's in mountains, rivers,
distant lands or the ends of the earth.

764
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,440
A few days ago,

765
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,160
Lingzhou City was
the most prosperous place

766
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,520
in Xian.

767
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,920
People in Lingzhou City
are good at business

768
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:51,880
and hospitable.

769
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,440
Even at night,

770
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,760
the city remained lively
as if it were daytime.

771
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,360
But ever since Nanlyu invaded,

772
00:39:59,390 --> 00:40:01,020
the people have shut themselves indoors.

773
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:02,700
Trade has come to a halt.

774
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,840
All I want

775
00:40:06,890 --> 00:40:09,040
is to withdraw your army from Xian

776
00:40:09,930 --> 00:40:12,690
and return Lingzhou to
its former vitality.

777
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,960
Can you grant me this wish?

778
00:40:23,010 --> 00:40:23,850
I promise.

779
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:25,540
After tonight,

780
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:27,200
Lingzhou will be more prosperous

781
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,320
than ever.

782
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:30,160
I will never

783
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,760
hurt the people in Lingzhou.

784
00:40:42,390 --> 00:40:43,540
No condition?

785
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:47,760
I want you to come back to Nanlyu with me.

786
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:50,410
When we return to the Nanlyu Royal Family,

787
00:40:50,410 --> 00:40:52,400
you will still be the Princess Consort,

788
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,160
with even greater honor,

789
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:55,740
status, and power.

790
00:40:58,030 --> 00:40:59,470
I am a Princess Consort.

791
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:02,790
And I have

792
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,280
only one husband.

793
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:08,520
The God of War of Xian.

794
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:10,190
Prince of Dingbei, Jiang Xu.

795
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:18,600
I know.

796
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:20,670
It's asking too much

797
00:41:20,690 --> 00:41:22,890
to expect you to change

798
00:41:22,970 --> 00:41:24,980
and accept all this overnight.

799
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:28,970
But I can wait.

800
00:41:34,210 --> 00:41:35,010
Bah!

801
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:36,460
What kind of woman is Yun Yi?

802
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:37,570
In the battle with Jinyun Guards,

803
00:41:37,570 --> 00:41:38,370
she beat Zhuifeng so badly,

804
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:39,550
the Prince almost couldn't recognize him.

805
00:41:39,550 --> 00:41:41,080
She's tougher than any man.

806
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:44,040
That's because Zhuifeng is
not as good as others.

807
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:45,020
What does it have to do with Miss Yun?

808
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:46,620
Why are you bringing this up?

809
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:48,400
Just tell me if you want to embarrass me.

810
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,080
I haven't even mentioned

811
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:50,020
that when you joined the Jinyun Guards,

812
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:50,970
you have hidden in your quilt

813
00:41:50,970 --> 00:41:51,590
and cried like a girl

814
00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:52,520
for half a month.

815
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:53,900
Like a girl?

816
00:41:53,930 --> 00:41:55,210
You men never cried in your lives?

817
00:41:55,210 --> 00:41:56,550
You've been smiling since you were born?

818
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:57,180
You're right.

819
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:57,600
I've been smiling since I was young.

820
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:58,640
I've been smiling since I was born.

821
00:41:58,640 --> 00:41:59,360
What? I said so.

822
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,160
I laughed when I slept.

823
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:00,760
I've been smiling since I was a kid.

824
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:01,440
You're being unreasonable.

825
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,520
I was laughing when I went to the toilet.

826
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,000
Fine, hit me.

827
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:03,440
I'll laugh.

828
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,240
Hit me. Hit me.

829
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:04,760
Hit me!

830
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:05,360
Stop arguing!

831
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:07,090
Shut up or I'll chop you all off!

832
00:42:15,890 --> 00:42:16,650
It's you.

833
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:20,250
It's not me. I don't know martial arts.

834
00:42:31,790 --> 00:42:32,270
Go!

835
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:08,480
Impossible.

836
00:43:13,790 --> 00:43:15,570
Greetings, General.

837
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:22,850
Open the city gate.
