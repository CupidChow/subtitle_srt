1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,120
Danilians of the Great Wall look only at the world.

2
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,220
Even the Buddha is in deep pain!

3
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:35,040
This information is adviseable by Academy of Science and Technology.

4
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,340
The objects disappeared when I visited them.

5
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:37,700
Right after Steven said you have no apologise to him.

6
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:43,340
I guess it's all right.

7
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,480
Zhiceng.

8
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,720
You are right.

9
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,300
I'm sorry to offend you.

10
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,460
I couldn't get to the bottom of the case.

11
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:51,200
However, the citizens make us feel safe.

12
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:56,140
You may write the news affected by the Treaty of !

13
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:57,260
Check the tie!

14
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:59,100
And don't stay in your room

15
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:14,820
Master Lin is just a citizen in charge of KaNun

16
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,260
If you're highly reformed

17
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,740
If you are forced out of KaNun

18
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:22,820
You won't be smooth

19
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:28,820
But if you don't know, you'll be covered in the dark.

20
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:39,820
In less than three days, these symptoms will appear in the jade case.

21
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:47,820
You're right.

22
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:48,820
But you're kind.

23
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:51,820
Otherwise, what are you doing here today?

24
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:58,820
Lord Yin, the prince wants to give you a chance to make a contribution.

25
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:02,820
He says the person who is the head of the palace is the eldest.

26
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:05,820
The few of you have the chance to be promoted to the government.

27
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,820
Do you still want to take care of others?

28
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:10,820
It's urgent. We must not rush.

29
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:13,820
Why don't we have a meal first?

30
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,820
Come on, let's have a meal.

31
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,820
Let's eat.

32
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:49,820
The guests are very generous.

33
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:52,820
They are all very talented.

34
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,820
You are all old guests.

35
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:57,820
Let's start the show right away.

36
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,820
Great!

37
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,820
The first title is the best-selling product.

38
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:06,820
It's a pure gold treasure.

39
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:11,820
This treasure is used by the rich and the rich,

40
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,820
to protect the Buddha's law.

41
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:18,820
After the treasure is returned, it will be used as a token.

42
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,820
The treasure has been missing for hundreds of years.

43
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:23,820
It has recently been re-opened.

44
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:27,820
The price is 100 taels.

45
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:30,820
The treasure is so expensive.

46
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,820
It's only half the price.

47
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:37,820
The price of the house is so expensive.

48
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,820
It's okay to wear it.

49
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:42,820
It's mainly for the benefit of the people.

50
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:45,820
I have entered the world half a year ago

51
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,820
and I have been blessed with the Buddha's law.

52
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:48,820
Only 50 taels.

53
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,820
But after three months,

54
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:53,820
I have been able to earn 3,000 taels.

55
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,820
The treasure must be worth a lot.

56
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,820
One hundred and twenty taels.

57
00:04:58,820 --> 00:04:59,820
One hundred and twenty taels.

58
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:00,820
One hundred and fifty taels.

59
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:01,820
Two hundred and twenty taels.

60
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,820
Two hundred and twenty taels.

61
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,820
Four hundred and twenty taels.

62
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:08,820
Four hundred and twenty taels.

63
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:12,820
The Buddha?

64
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:15,820
He has been in the house for a long time.

65
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:18,820
How did he come here?

66
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,820
Congratulations, Mrs. Feng.

67
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,820
The second brand is

68
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:28,820
the one with the golden flower and bird's nest.

69
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:32,820
This nest is used by the former government of Ruoxu.

70
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:36,820
It is made by the government of Ruoxu.

71
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:40,820
The price is 600 taels.

72
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:45,820
Lingzhou is really a blessing.

73
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:48,820
Every brand is worth a lot.

74
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:49,820
It's so expensive.

75
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:53,820
No wonder the invitation of the auction is so hard to get.

76
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,820
It's so hard to get.

77
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,820
These people are hard-working.

78
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,820
They are hard-working and hard-working.

79
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:04,820
But the lady knows how to make things happen.

80
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:07,820
I just want to talk to you.

81
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,820
Mr. Wen is here again.

82
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:13,820
I just want to be useful to my daughter.

83
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,820
I am so happy.

84
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:17,820
How many taels are there?

85
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:20,820
One hundred and twenty taels.

86
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,820
How many are there?

87
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,820
I don't know.

88
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:27,820
The number of taels is eight hundred and two hundred.

89
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,820
Eight hundred and twenty taels.

90
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:31,820
Eight hundred and fifty taels.

91
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:33,820
Eight hundred and fifty taels.

92
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,820
Nine hundred taels.

93
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,820
Nine hundred taels.

94
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:40,820
One thousand taels.

95
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,020
1500 taels.

96
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:45,340
1500 taels.

97
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,500
1500 taels for one song.

98
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:50,100
1500 taels for two songs.

99
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,540
1500 taels for three songs.

100
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:59,820
Congratulations, Mr. Wen.

101
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:01,340
Mr. Wen.

102
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:10,740
Liu Jin, Hua Niun, Wen Xiang Nang.

103
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,180
Please have a look.

104
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:20,500
Miss Xia, please have a look.

105
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:27,540
This thing is not for walking.

106
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:31,460
The one I was singing was the real one.

107
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,700
I didn't expect it to be so.

108
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:36,340
Did I think it wrong?

109
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:40,700
It's a coincidence.

110
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:42,820
It's a big deal.

111
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:45,460
It's worth it.

112
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:48,380
This is really a coincidence.

113
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,180
But I'm not sure

114
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:52,780
Mr. Wen is interested in the incense.

115
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,340
It's not important what it is.

116
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:59,560
This is important with the blacksmith's odour,

117
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:03,420
Miss Xia is right.

118
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:06,740
Yes, it's a good smell.

119
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:09,500
The incense can be smelly protection.

120
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:12,340
It's all well-ughters out there.

121
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:16,940
Theарss would have their losing so badly if it's fucking by you.

122
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:25,860
The incense stove is too big for unconscious ones.

123
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,580
Since when I don't come here?

124
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:32,660
Since I have a Application of moonlight

125
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:34,700
but it is few seconds late.

126
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:37,980
So I really can't deny this by JBL.

127
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:46,140
I believe in power-pinning of battle dancing.

128
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:48,300
Pick a tower,

129
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,460
look at her-

130
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:52,140
show yourself in it.

131
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:54,180
The exact place doesn't seem to be occupied.

132
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:56,180
and why was someone 와 and 쟀NONXING in it?

133
00:08:56,180 --> 00:09:00,180
The thing that comes from the dead is the real purpose of this auction.

134
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:02,180
It's better to make it out of the dark.

135
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:08,180
The thing that comes from the dead is higher than the real body that is supposed to be sold.

136
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:10,180
No wonder the price is so high.

137
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:28,180
OK.

138
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:52,180
I beg you.

139
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:57,180
I found out about the tax and wanted to discuss the next issue with you.

140
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:00,180
One of my friends, the musician named Qiu Yue, found me.

141
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:05,180
He also told me that Zhou Baoping left a list of the officials of the Su family.

142
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:08,180
But that night, we two were assassinated.

143
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:11,180
And I kept going here.

144
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:13,180
Where is Minglu?

145
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:15,180
He hasn't arrived yet.

146
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:17,180
How do you contact him?

147
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:19,180
I don't know.

148
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:24,180
I remember that he was forced to go after the Su family.

149
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:26,180
He wouldn't be able to escape easily.

150
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:29,180
But no one knows that you came to Linzhou City.

151
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:32,180
He will definitely try to get close to you.

152
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,180
I beg you.

153
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:43,180
I beg you.

154
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:46,180
Hurry up.

155
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:49,180
Yes.

156
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:51,180
Yes.

157
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:15,180
Miss Qiu Yue.

158
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:17,180
I'm not...

159
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:45,180
Sir.

160
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:50,180
I moved to the best my style

161
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:54,180
to take appropriate care of my case.

162
00:11:54,180 --> 00:12:04,980
The Su family went to

163
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:11,860
take every step insurance.

164
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:36,780
I've made Earthling's exclusive

165
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:39,220
and sérograin.

166
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:40,980
He has some news,

167
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:42,580
and some darkness.

168
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:44,580
I'll take all the accounts of the injured

169
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:47,580
who were recorded in the Palace of the Lord.

170
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:48,580
Be careful.

171
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:49,580
Don't be careless.

172
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:51,580
Yes, sir.

173
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:58,580
Lord Yin.

174
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:02,580
Qingyu should respect you in advance.

175
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:05,580
Is it, Lord Shi?

176
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:07,580
I'm a good wife.

177
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:09,580
I'm a strong wife.

178
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:12,580
I can't blame you for being a good wife.

179
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:17,580
You're a good wife.

180
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:19,580
But don't forget

181
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:22,580
Qingyu's present-day celebration.

182
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:30,580
How can I repay you,

183
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:33,580
Miss Qingyu?

184
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:40,580
Your Highness.

185
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:57,580
Lord, don't be anxious.

186
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:59,580
Lord can take a good look at you.

187
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:01,580
It must be boring in the future.

188
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:05,580
But Qingyu is worried about you.

189
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:06,780
Come here.

190
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:09,060
Do you want to see how...

191
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:11,260
What I see in your eyes!

192
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:15,340
I didn't have to cheat you!

193
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:17,900
I don't want to see what people want…

194
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:19,100
Shut up.

195
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,500
You know that you don't潜尽,

196
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:23,300
you're afraid.

197
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:26,220
When he crian you.

198
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,940
This sn!]g is India's pride.

199
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,780
Countryอกار

200
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,380
He has much friendship with him

201
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:41,740
If that were the case, green carp is much greener

202
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:47,580
Still an egg-upper

203
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,420
Today I would like to thank you

204
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:53,260
To guide me there

205
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:31,460
night can not

206
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:34,480
you returned the

207
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:45,360
Pan Lord

208
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,380
Pan wish

209
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:50,120
you to travel

210
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,460
But not

211
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:54,660
I'll go first.

212
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,700
Mr. Wen and Miss He, please be patient.

213
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:58,900
I'll go first.

214
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:00,900
Boss Su, you may go.

215
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:03,220
He is back home.

216
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:19,900
No!

217
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:23,380
What are you doing?

218
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:28,180
He went out trying to go to the millennium!

219
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:29,860
I found nothing but this big emperor.

220
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:33,860
I found out that Qiu Yue was the musician who had a good relationship with Zhou Baoping.

221
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:39,860
Zhou Baoping was hiding behind the evidence that he stole from Qiu Yue.

222
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:42,860
He appeared here.

223
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:49,860
Could it be that the evidence was in Zhang Huai's hand?

224
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:53,860
He must have been in danger today. He must have been in front of the world.

225
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:57,860
I've taken him away. I'll keep him away from Ye Chang.

226
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,860
I'll keep him away from you.

227
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:53,860
I wonder what happened to Prince Dingbei.

228
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:55,860
What's wrong?

229
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:59,860
I don't know.

230
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:04,860
Lord Yan Ci Shi died because of Uncle Shi's death.

231
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:07,860
This woman is just a stranger. She's not alive.

232
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:09,860
This woman is Qing Yu from the meeting room.

233
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:13,860
She came here to find me before the banquet. She said Prince Dingbei...

234
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:20,860
She said that Prince Dingbei had a plan to break the rules of the State of Yin.

235
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:23,860
He wanted to frame Uncle Shi and make him pay for his crimes.

236
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:29,860
She also said that Prince Dingbei was angry and angry.

237
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:35,860
She was afraid that if the State of Yin was to be killed, she would come to me.

238
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:40,860
She said that Prince Dingbei was angry and angry.

239
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:43,860
She didn't come to me to tell me anything.

240
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:46,860
I didn't expect something really happened.

241
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:52,860
I heard that Prince Dingbei had been against the Su family after the Lin State.

242
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:56,860
But he didn't find any evidence against the Su family.

243
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:58,860
Evidence against the Su family?

244
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:01,860
Does Lord Yan Ci Shi have any evidence?

245
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:03,860
Prince Dingbei is the emperor's relative.

246
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:07,860
He's not so happy that the Su family is willing to do anything.

247
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:12,860
Prince, what do you want and do in the past few days in the Lin State?

248
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:15,860
The Su family is all different.

249
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:20,860
You are so impudent. You dare not to do anything.

250
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:25,860
Although you broke the State of Yin's plan to frame the Su family,

251
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:29,860
you are not willing to do anything.

252
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:34,860
So you are willing to kill and kill the Su family.

253
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:38,860
Prince, is that so?

254
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:43,860
You are so impudent.

255
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:48,860
Lord Ci Shi, the disaster is now over.

256
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:52,860
Prince Dingbei killed the court and the court is now in the hands of the truth.

257
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:55,860
Please, Lord Ci Shi, hurry and report to the capital.

258
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,860
And tell Prince Dingbei that he is guilty.

259
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:07,860
Prince, what is the matter with you?

260
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:13,860
Prince, what are you doing?

261
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:17,860
Prince, are you all right?

262
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:20,860
You are all right.

263
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:22,860
Prince, you are all right.

264
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:24,860
Prince, I'm all right.

265
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:28,860
Prince, I'm all right.

266
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:31,860
Prince, I'm all right.

267
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:34,300
I need to ask someone to check it out.

268
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:40,340
It's so hot and humid in the Chamber of Commerce.

269
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:41,700
It's so interesting.

270
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:44,660
Mr. Luo is indeed a talent.

271
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:49,380
I wonder if he is Mr. Wen

272
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,580
or Mr. Su?

273
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:59,300
Why do you ask so much?

274
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:02,620
What's wrong with Ms. Wu's templeeps?

275
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:05,060
Mr. Wen only represents it.

276
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:07,300
I asked Ms. Wu.

277
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:11,420
He said his feelings are deeps in his heart.

278
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:21,340
Lingzhou can make things workable

279
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:23,140
withoks.

280
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:28,220
But how can priests do no sleep well?

281
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:30,820
To start, it will be double bid for

282
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,940
the security officials to sell

283
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,020
my频 laissez.

284
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,440
Well, please take care of

285
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:41,160
my大丈夫.

286
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:44,620
It hurts the sweat and deixarge and

287
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:46,340
Heartthrob.

288
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,480
Thanks, Senior Li.

289
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:53,140
You made a mistake in my negligence.

290
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:56,500
I am here to bring big basin.

291
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,700
I'm not sure.

292
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,460
How can you say that?

293
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:01,940
I've been thinking about it.

294
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:05,060
Mr. Wen doesn't have a shop

295
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,540
and has no time to buy and sell.

296
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:08,580
What's the use of it?

297
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:10,580
It's limited to the market

298
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:12,500
in the capital.

299
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:15,540
Mr. Wen was at the golden building that day.

300
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:17,540
I think it's not just business.

301
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:21,260
If the owner of the shop

302
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:22,940
is Mr. Wen,

303
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:26,180
it would be interesting to see him selling.

304
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:27,500
Mr. WenNang

305
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:29,060
is one of the smiles found

306
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:30,500
at the revolution andbacks.

307
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:34,060
He's already carning my Apps

308
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:35,260
and runs another design .

309
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:38,900
Both stories are so like that,

310
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:40,260
so it's the pocket money.

311
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:44,940
She's Wenmou who has owned

312
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:47,460
the most paid bazaar and military transport.

313
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:49,420
I'm just scared

314
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,780
that she doesn't know what to say.

315
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:55,780
I'm afraid that I'll be disliked by you.

316
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:00,780
You're a civil servant, you're not a servant.

317
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:03,780
I'm a weak woman.

318
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:05,780
How can I be your opponent?

319
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:08,780
But if you're my opponent,

320
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:10,780
I'll be the king of the north.

321
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:23,780
Who are you?

322
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:35,780
Stop!

323
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:37,780
Who are you? Why are you calling me?

324
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:40,780
I'm General Xuanwei, the third...

325
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:41,780
I'm the emperor's son.

326
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:43,780
I'm the emperor's son.

327
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:46,780
I'll be the king of the north.

328
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:48,780
I'll be the king of the north.

329
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:52,780
I'll be the king of the north.

330
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:00,780
My lord, the goods in the back hall are all illegal.

331
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:02,780
They need to be brought up in the same way.

332
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:05,780
You two go to the back hall to check the information.

333
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:06,780
Make a record and make a plan.

334
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:07,780
Don't make any mistakes.

335
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:08,780
Yes, sir.

336
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:12,780
I'll be the general's order.

337
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:15,780
I'll take this place as the temporary office.

338
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:18,780
If the person who is in charge of this case is not allowed to leave,

339
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:20,780
if he is not respected,

340
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:22,780
I'll take the first state to take charge.

341
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:25,780
The Zhu Lian family will be killed.

342
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:30,780
Mingtang! Mingtang!

343
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:31,780
Mingtang!

344
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:32,780
Mingtang!

345
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:33,780
Fourth sister, it's me.

346
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:35,780
I'm your third sister, Ming Chu.

347
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:36,780
Shut up!

348
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:37,780
Mingtang!

349
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:39,780
Fourth sister, the prince is gone.

350
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:41,780
I'm your only love in the world.

351
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:43,780
You can't leave me alone, Mingtang.

352
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:45,780
If you don't shut up, you can't take charge.

353
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:47,780
Mingtang!

354
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:53,780
Mingtang?

355
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:56,780
You're the princess of Dingbei?

356
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:09,780
We've known each other for a few days,

357
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:10,780
but every day,

358
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:13,780
you seem to be giving me different surprises.

359
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:15,780
But today's surprise

360
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:18,780
is that you're making me lose my mind.

361
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:21,780
How many private shops are there in Dingbei's mansion?

362
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:25,780
I've been in charge of all the shops

363
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:27,780
and I know some business.

364
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:32,780
I'm not a businessman, am I?

365
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:37,780
I'm confused.

366
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:41,780
What's your identity?

367
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:43,780
What's your identity?

368
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:48,780
How many lives are there behind you?

369
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:52,780
Your Highness, this is a question mark.

370
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:54,780
It's a question mark.

371
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:58,780
It's responsible for the location and the military.

372
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:01,780
I wonder if Mr. Wen is able to

373
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:03,780
keep their hands on the weak.

374
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:06,780
The location and the case

375
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:08,780
are definitely in line with each other.

376
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:09,780
There's nothing to hide.

377
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:13,780
It's just that this shop is owned by the Su family.

378
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:16,780
The products are also owned by the Su family.

379
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:18,780
I'm a mute.

380
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:20,780
I've never been involved.

381
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:22,780
No matter how much I try,

382
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:24,780
I won't be able to take a look at it

383
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:27,780
and force it to work.

384
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:33,780
Stay in the hall.

385
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:35,780
Don't move.

386
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:36,780
Don't talk.

387
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:40,780
That's all.

388
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:43,780
Your Highness,

389
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:45,780
look at the pictures.

390
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:08,780
What's your identity?

391
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:10,780
I'm afraid you can't do it alone.

392
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:12,780
I won't let you go.

393
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:14,780
He will take care of you.

394
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:16,780
Don't worry.

395
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:18,780
Why are you getting so anxious?

396
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:24,780
Your Highness,

397
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:26,780
the court is in a critical situation.

398
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:28,780
The case is serious.

399
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:30,780
I have to take action.

400
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:34,780
Please come with me.

401
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,880
Help, Please!

402
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:54,380
There is a suspicious case happening on this area.

403
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:59,420
He wants to go.

404
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:01,980
He is to be checked.

405
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:03,980
If you don't do that,

406
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:07,480
you won't get evidence for makingira federal police appeared.

407
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,480
I won't bother you with this.

408
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:13,480
After you leave, I will send someone to investigate.

409
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,480
But I don't trust you.

410
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,480
Since you have made a clear statement,

411
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,480
I'll stay here.

412
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:24,480
Please ask the Governor to ask for a quick question.

413
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:28,480
I'll listen to your advice.

414
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,480
I'll go.

415
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,480
Dingbei, you don't have to delay the investigation.

416
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,480
You can go now.

417
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,480
If I want to leave,

418
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:46,480
I'll wait for someone to come.

419
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,480
Guards, take Dingbei away!

420
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,480
What are you waiting for?

421
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,480
Hurry up and get someone!

422
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,480
Your Majesty, listen to me.

423
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,480
Governor Zhongshu and Governor Tan are here!

424
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,480
The war is over.

425
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,480
No one can leave.

426
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,480
Yes!

427
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:28,480
Governor, I've found out that

428
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,480
the Governor of the Central Academy,

429
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,480
Governor Zhongshu,

430
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,480
has secretly gone to Lingzhou

431
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,480
after the death of Prince Dingbei.

432
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,480
How is it that he has gone?

433
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:44,480
He has been trying to hide the truth.

434
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:48,480
Prince Dingbei can't leave Lingzhou alive.

435
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:53,480
I'm sure he has been left behind.

436
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,480
Governor Zhang Daoyuan of Lingzhou,

437
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,480
I've seen Governor Tan.

438
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,480
I've been looking for Lingzhou.

439
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:06,480
The secret is the same.

440
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,480
I've got the case.

441
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,480
I'll be in charge of the investigation.

442
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:14,480
I'm afraid that it's too late to do so.

443
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,480
Why don't you rest for a while?

444
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,480
I'll stay here for a while.

445
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,480
But I'll start the investigation tomorrow.

446
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,480
As for Prince Dingbei,

447
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,480
I'll be at a serious level.

448
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,480
I won't let him have any chance to escape.

449
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,480
I'm a good person.

450
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,480
I have my own way.

451
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,480
No need for others' guidance.

452
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,480
Your Excellency,

453
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,480
this case is a bit too serious.

454
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,480
The evidence is very early.

455
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,480
Why not give it to the subordinates?

456
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:46,480
It'll be better to avoid your endless efforts.

457
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:52,480
Do you know what the punishment is?

458
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,480
The punishment is to be punished by the court.

459
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:00,480
The Emperor ordered to wake up the people of Zhuzhou.

460
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:03,480
The court is to be punished by the officials.

461
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,480
The punishment is to be punished.

462
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,480
You're clear about the case.

463
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:11,480
This case is not a small case.

464
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,480
If there's any difference,

465
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,480
I'm afraid that the position of the imperial guard

466
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,480
will be unbearable.

467
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,480
First,

468
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,480
you're the one who should be punished.

469
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,480
If you have your own power,

470
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,480
you'll be punished.

471
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,480
I'll be at a serious level.

472
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,480
Your Highness,

473
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:44,480
the Changmai people are indeed hiding things.

474
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,480
But those merchants are not aware of the content.

475
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:50,480
They are just like the treasure in the Changmai.

476
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,480
This is not the first time in the Changmai Society.

477
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,480
They must have already predicted this.

478
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,480
They were mistaken.

479
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,480
According to what I found,

480
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,480
the Chief Sui has been in the capital for ten days.

481
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,480
This case will be a crime.

482
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:05,480
As for whether there's any other reason behind it,

483
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:07,480
we'll have to investigate it.

484
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,480
Today,

485
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,480
the Changmai people

486
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,480
must be interrogated,

487
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,480
investigate the mansion,

488
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,480
the family members,

489
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,480
and the daily life.

490
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,480
No one should be involved in any social matters.

491
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:24,700
The

492
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:26,700
people in the hall are interrogated.

493
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:28,700
One of them is a member of the Cultural Center.

494
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:30,700
I hope that you can interrogate him personally.

495
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:32,700
I suspected that the Cultural Center

496
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,700
was related to the Chief Sui.

497
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:36,700
There's another reason.

498
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:38,700
But the Cultural Center is not well-maintained.

499
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:40,700
It's very cautious.

500
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:42,700
It seems that it's good for everyone.

501
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:44,700
It's not a big deal.

502
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:46,700
I hope that you can investigate it.

503
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:48,700
You can't be too reckless.

504
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:50,700
You can't be too reckless.

505
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,700
Okay. I'll go now.

506
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:54,700
Wait a minute.

507
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:59,700
Please,

508
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,700
go to General Xuanwei's mansion.

509
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:03,700
Please come to see the general.

510
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:05,700
Yes.

511
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:10,700
Go.

512
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:17,700
I'm Feng Xulin.

513
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,700
I'm here to see the Princess Consort.

514
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,700
Bring her out.

515
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:29,700
I'm the Chief of the Cultural Center.

516
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:31,700
She's been looking everywhere.

517
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:33,700
She's been making trouble.

518
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:35,700
I know very well

519
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:37,700
what you're doing.

520
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:39,700
My father and my father were

521
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:41,700
loyal to the Feng family.

522
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:43,700
They were very strict.

523
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:45,700
They didn't want her to be a stranger.

524
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:47,700
My sister has been selfish since childhood.

525
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:49,700
She's been used to it.

526
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:51,700
She can't be used to it.

527
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,700
She can't be a Feng family.

528
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,700
She can't be a general.

529
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,700
Sanlang!

530
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:03,700
Who are you to be my sister?

531
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:05,700
Ming Chu.

532
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:07,700
I was the first to speak the language of the gods.

533
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:09,700
He was not only a stranger,

534
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:11,700
but also an official.

535
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:13,700
He also accepted that I was a stranger.

536
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:15,700
When I was in Shangjing,

537
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:17,700
he was always in the same situation with me.

538
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:19,700
Now I'm in the same situation with him.

539
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:21,700
He still wants to talk to me?

540
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:23,700
You want me to stand in the court

541
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:25,700
and clean the house in Lingzhou?

542
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:27,700
Enough!

543
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:29,700
Sanlang! She's the one who's going to put me in first!

544
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:31,220
If you listen to me,

545
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:33,060
take a risk and treat the governmentديothe.

546
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:35,500
How could I implement such circumstances?

547
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:40,060
As the general suspected,

548
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:42,720
Third Sister left the instinct to sell treasures

549
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:45,940
and practically encountered exchanging keys by himself today.

550
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:50,780

00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:05,140
I won't fall in love with anyone.

557
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:07,860
I've never seen my home.

558
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:10,820
I've no idea what there's to do with it.

559
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:14,580
Please let me answer with sincerity.

560
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:17,960
Premier Z guessed right.

564
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:32,980
Now that they've fell in love with you,

565
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:34,660
if you forget your mission to succeed,

566
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:37,220
it's your Hurricane number.

567
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:38,300
Congratulations, Princess.

568
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:39,820
Everybody knows

569
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:42,020
it was very Musical.

570
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:44,220
With you there,

571
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:46,460
we'll have 100set.

572
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:51,140
You're very clueless!

If I fall in love, I won't take it!

574
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:54,900
But if you help me,

575
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:56,420
and took this matter to the Feng family

576
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:57,780
to send the imperial guards to search the mansion.

577
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,860
Mingtan, what are you doing?

578
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:00,980
Shut up!

579
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:01,740
Mingchu,

580
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:04,180
you still don't know what happened.

581
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:05,740
You're a man of your word.

582
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:06,940
You're a man of your word.

583
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:09,940
The people of Changmai will be arrested today.

584
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:12,180
They'll wait for the imperial guards to be sent to prison.

585
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:16,260
Your Highness, you're doing this for the Feng family.

586
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:18,220
You're also doing this to make your sister

587
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:19,940
at least guilty and at least guilty.

588
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:21,540
You're the only one who can get out of here.

589
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:23,540
You're only sending two imperial guards to search the mansion.

590
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:28,140
Thank you, Princess.

591
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:31,500
Go back with me.

592
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:51,940
Your Excellency.

593
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:56,900
Your Excellency,

594
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:57,900
he's gone.

595
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:11,900
Your Excellency,

596
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:13,020
the witness is awake.

597
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:15,460
I'm sure the king will kill him in private.

598
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:16,620
You may ask him.

599
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:23,020
The witness is back.

600
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:25,800
He's rou худigry.

601
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:27,100
Straight to theari.

602
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:29,540
I worry

603
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:31,740
that perhaps~~~

604
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:40,380
Young lady Qingyun

605
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:41,940
met you.

606
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:43,140
Qingyun.

607
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:44,300
Do you

608
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:48,020
see the trade with Wang Xie by touch?

609
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:50,280
She has discovered you.

610
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:52,980
I will take your leave.

611
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:54,980
I am guilty of the Su family.

612
00:37:57,980 --> 00:38:00,980
I am guilty, Your Excellency.

613
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:02,980
How did you break the law?

614
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:04,980
I will explain it in detail.

615
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:09,980
Prince of Dingbei has been trying to kill Lord Yin.

616
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:12,980
He has been trying to kill the Su family.

617
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:15,980
His Highness has said that if he can eat food,

618
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:18,980
he can protect Lord Yin and keep his health.

619
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:23,980
Anyway, it's hard to get a good life.

620
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:28,980
Have you seen Prince of Dingbei killing people?

621
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:32,980
Why did you faint in the room?

622
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:35,980
Did anyone insult you?

623
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:44,980
How did the God of War do?

624
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:48,980
How dare you do the same to the Su family?

625
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:53,980
You misunderstood.

626
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:57,980
Qingyu never said that Lord Yin was the one who killed Prince of Dingbei.

627
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:02,980
Qingyu never insulted anyone.

628
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:06,980
I have no choice but to be angry in front of you.

629
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:08,980
I will explain it in detail.

630
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:13,980
Lord Yin, there are three officials in Dingbei's banquet.

631
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:16,980
Although Prince of Dingbei is in a hurry,

632
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:19,980
they are trying to pull them out.

633
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:23,980
They are not trying to make them stay in the Su family.

634
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:26,980
Today's matter is a fact.

635
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:31,980
It's all the Su family's plan.

636
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:36,980
Princess.

637
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:40,980
Princess.

638
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:42,980
Stop talking nonsense!

639
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:45,980
A lazy woman, with many swords and swords,

640
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:48,980
she is so shameless. How can she be so clear-minded?

641
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:51,980
Lord Bing, I dare not talk nonsense.

642
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:55,980
Lord Yin and Prince of Dingbei were taken to the banquet in advance.

643
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:57,980
Lady Su asked me to bring Lord Yin here.

644
00:39:57,980 --> 00:39:59,980
She took the wedding dress and killed him.

645
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:01,980
She has already framed Prince of Dingbei.

646
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:03,980
Father.

647
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:08,980
Today, I would like to thank you for pointing out my path.

648
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:19,980
As you said, Prince of Dingbei is indeed innocent.

649
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:23,980
Qingyu, why did you do this for the Su family?

650
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:39,980
Lord Bing, Qingyu is a woman who is a woman who is a woman of the sword.

651
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:42,980
She is very dangerous in the world.

652
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:45,980
If she doesn't obey the order of the people,

653
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:48,980
and is punished by the people,

654
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:51,980
she will be punished for her life.

655
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:56,980
Lord Tan, this woman must have got the benefit of Prince of Dingbei

656
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:59,980
and had a relationship with her and was in a dangerous situation.

657
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:01,980
I didn't ask you!

658
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:11,980
Qingyu, do you know that Su Erlong has evidence?

659
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:18,980
Of course, I have evidence.

660
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:21,980
Bring him here.

661
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:36,980
Over here.

662
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:45,220
There is a letter now.

663
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:50,980
To why are you here?

664
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:55,600
This letter was written in the Culture Presentation.

665
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,980
Sending words to Lord Liang,

666
00:41:57,980 --> 00:42:00,980
an ordinary person would be too shocking?

667
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:02,980
Nonsense!

668
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:04,380
Why are you here?

669
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:11,100
You mean that girl?

670
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:13,660
No. What do I do?

671
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,000
Nothing.

672
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:36,100
Governor of SARS told about kul idi.

673
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:39,220
The counterfeit cases determine the future.

674
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:43,060
Those who are guilty of these charges

675
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:44,540
shall continue to exist here.

676
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:49,380
Then とは算はいつもオ柜一カ點ふさい我们

677
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:51,740

679
00:42:59,340 --> 00:42:59,980
This hour

680
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:04,980
I've met Mr. Zhou and I have been together for a long time.

681
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:15,980
A year ago, Mr. Zhou gave me a clear way to leave Linzhou.

682
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:20,980
He said he found the clear way to the official of the Su family.

683
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:26,980
And he found out that the Su family was in the south.

684
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:29,980
I've been on the road with Mr. Zhou's help.

685
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:31,980
I've been away for a long time.

686
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:34,980
But the Su family has been prepared.

687
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:36,980
I've been in charge of the investigation.

688
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:38,980
I'm not guilty.

689
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:43,980
But I heard that the Su family was in the house of the Su family

690
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:45,980
because of the evil plan.

691
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:47,980
He didn't want to leave the Su family.

692
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:50,980
He killed the person and destroyed the family.

693
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:55,980
I hope you can help Mr. Zhou.

694
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:58,980
You only know that Mr. Zhou has been in the Su family.

695
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:00,980
Do you have any evidence?

696
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:28,980
The Su family is in the house of the Su family.

697
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:31,980
