your father's opinion

00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,420
is that we should cut our losses

88

The maritime tax levy cannot
be delayed any longer.

If the Maritime Trade Bureau
continues to stall,

Once that happens,

much higher than this.

because you were saving it
specifically for our deal?

145

The threads in this batch are
too loosely woven.

Once washed and dried,

147
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,610
the fabric will warp

So, Mr. Wu, think it over.

00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,410
catches her eye.

514
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,800
Why should some no-name girl

515
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,060
from who-knows-where

516
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:23,640
compete with her?

517
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:25,720
I'm taking

518
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:34,680
the hairpin.

519
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:37,650
And who do you think you are?

520
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:38,650
Talking like

521
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,710
you own the place.

522
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:40,620
How dare you!

523
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:44,300
Where's the item?

524
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:44,980
It's here.

525
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,720
What's the price?

526
00:23:58,420 --> 00:23:59,880
It is this hairpin's honor

527
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,850
to be favored by Your Highness.

528
00:24:01,930 --> 00:24:04,290
Consider it a gift.

529
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:07,290
Go back and tell Ming Chu

530
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:11,190
if she still refuses to know her place,

531
00:24:11,610 --> 00:24:12,910
I shall personally teach her

532
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:13,950
how to behave.

533
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,910
Deliver the message.

534
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,200
Yes.

535
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,480
Nothing hits harder than
when the real deal steps in.

536
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,600
That was glorious.

537
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:35,170
With gold pinned at your temple

538
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,160
and coral reflecting your fair beauty,

539
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,920
this hairpin suits

540
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,360
your celestial grace perfectly.

541
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:42,240
Why not let it be my gift to you?

542
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:54,050
Thank you, sir.

543
00:24:57,270 --> 00:24:59,520
Though the gift wasn't mine to begin with,

544
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,890
the gesture is sincere.

545
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:02,390
I did underestimate

546
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,930
his flair for performance.

547
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,900
Just now I heard Ms. Su

548
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,200
address you as "Your Highness".

549
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:12,120
May I ask,

550
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:15,720
are you the illustrious

551
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:18,110
Prince of Dingbei, the great war god

552
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:19,520
whose victories echo across
the northern borders?

553
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,510
Yes.

554
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,480
It's my blessing

555
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,520
to meet Your Highness.

556
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:30,000
I have heard that at the mere
age of hair-tying,

557
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,600
you led 3,000 elite soldiers

558
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,700
to crush an enemy force of 30,000.

559
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:36,440
Since then, the northern tribes

560
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,270
have not dared to stir,

561
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:39,950
and peace has reigned throughout Xian.

562
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:41,390
The people live in safety and contentment.

563
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:44,070
Your Highness truly has great merit.

564
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:46,430
Old stories are not worth mentioning.

565
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,790
Yet you, though of gentle
birth and delicate bearing,

566
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:51,990
seem to know every detail of my deeds.

567
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,360
That is quite the pleasant surprise.

568
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,560
You're getting carried away
with a little praise.

569
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,620
Just don't fumble your performance.

570
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,210
May I ask your honored surname

571
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:01,250
and given name?

572
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,120
My surname is He,

573
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,820
and my given name is but a
single character—Kou.

574
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,920
Songs of the wild, maidens in bloom—
such sights stir sorrow in the North.

575
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,900
I have stood guard at the frontier
for many years.

576
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:14,360
And each time I see the
cardamom begin to bud,

577
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,940
I know that spring is near,
and the wild geese will soon return.

578
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,920
If it brings Your Highness
even a moment's comfort

579
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,380
and hope amidst hardship,

580
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,760
then this is truly my blessing.

581
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,600
Yet what I cherish even more

582
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,590
is the thought of still waters under a clear moon,

583
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:36,050
and spring stirring upon the
branches where cardamoms bloom.

584
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,520
Sir has ever been a man of few words.

585
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,440
When did he become so eloquent?

586
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:53,670
With your kind words,

587
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:55,370
I also begin to hope that

588
00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:57,100
one day I may find a worthy companion

589
00:26:57,100 --> 00:27:00,630
and share a bond as steadfast
as that of a pair of mandarin ducks.

590
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:05,790
To have neglected Miss He today

591
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:07,570
weighs heavily on my conscience.

592
00:27:07,570 --> 00:27:09,490
Since His Highness and Miss He

593
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,800
found such immediate rapport,

594
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,200
I shall presume to

595
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:14,660
invite her to join our banquet.

596
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,440
Excellent.

597
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:17,450
Miss He, you must not decline.

598
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:23,190
With Your Highness and Ms. Su's
generous hospitality,

599
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:25,350
I dare not refuse.

[Fu Lu Gold Store]

601
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:31,650
Miss He, please.

602
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:37,990
Thank you, Your Highness.

[Fu Lu Gold Store]

Inform Mr. Wen

605
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:50,700
that I'm hosting

606
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,400
two distinguished guests today.

607
00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:55,550
Have him assess them—

608
00:27:56,490 --> 00:27:58,080
particularly whether this "Patroness of Fortune"

609
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,220
truly possesses substantial means. If so,

610
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,260
the Su family

611
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:03,540
must extend every courtesy.

612
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:05,380
Understood.

613
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,860
As my princess consort,

614
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:24,380
am I not even permitted to hold your hand?

615
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:26,080
Here, I am no Princess Consort.

616
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,220
Honey, behave.

617
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,570
Remember your station.

618
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,660
You've grown so accustomed to

619
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:32,860
playing the merchant's daughter

620
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:34,040
that you've forgotten your true role,

621
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:34,760
have you?

622
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,240
Nonsense!

623
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,760
Being Princess Consort

624
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,200
is far more carefree.

625
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:40,340
After all,

626
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,570
who would dare

627
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,260
slight the Princess Consort?

628
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,240
Honey,

629
00:28:46,670 --> 00:28:48,400
could you issue an edict for me?

630
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:54,510
Are you looking to discipline Ming Chu?

631
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,120
Your prestige and military merits

632
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,540
were earned blade by blade

633

on the battlefield.

634
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:05,870
How can I tolerate her

635
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:07,190
exploiting

636
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:08,540
the prince's household name

637
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:09,660
to bully others

638
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:10,820
indiscriminately?

639
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,680
I don't really mind.

640
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:20,990
That won't do either.

641
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:23,630
Not that I've had the chance
to exploit it yet.

642
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:27,630
How exactly do you plan to exploit it?

643
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:33,150
I'll have to give it some serious thought.

644
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:35,190
After all, the prince's household is vast.

645
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,320
Truly exploiting it

646
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,380
would take considerable effort.

647

What Master does

684
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:19,470
is none of your business.

685

In Ms. Su's eyes,

I'll go and give the innkeeper
some instructions.

Thank you for your trouble, Ms. Su.

Miss He, is this your first
time in Lingzhou?

Yes.

701
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:26,670
I had not expected

702
00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:28,470
to have the fortune of
meeting Your Highness

703
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:30,230
on my very first visit.

704
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:32,240
A match made by heaven—

705
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:33,540
timely and destined.

706

Your Highness, please don't jest.

707
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:46,300
Su Errong's cunning

708
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:48,000
runs deeper than her pleasant facade.

709
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,130
You must be careful.

710
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:50,920
Also,

have you found anything at
the Fu Lu Gold Storer?

712

Mr. Luo of the store

713
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,040
is likely

714
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:59,540
the main supplier of
smuggled goods from the capital.

715

the chance to probe further.

717
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,550
Patience brings clarity,

718
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:05,680
and a calm mind ensures safety.

719
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,740
Do not act in haste.

At such a critical moment,

and currying favor,

735
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,350
why would Yu Bozhong
choose to leave the city?

736

Greed knows no bounds.

737

the taxes Lingzhou owes,

on this painting?

Your Highness, you flatter me.

I'm afraid I have little talent
in painting and calligraphy.

Your Highness, Miss He,

758
00:34:51,139 --> 00:34:52,330
sorry to keep you waiting.

Thank you for your hospitality, Ms. Su.

763

Miss He, if I may offer some advice,

when looking for a husband,

780
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,520
it's best to find someone well-matched

in background and temperament.

782

you and His Highness

Your Highness, please forgive my boldness.

786
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:56,680
I've been in business for many years,

certain resemblance to Princess Consort.

we always say it's all about the feeling.

Whether a deal goes through

799

often comes down to the feeling.

quite a bit of affinity

it might be better to say it's fate.

If fate brings you to the wrong person,

would be better.

Gold-essence stones are native to Nanlyu,

853
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:25,000
but without close inspection,

854
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:27,220
they're easily mistaken for celestite.

855
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:28,560
Since celestite fetches a far higher price,

856
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,880
passing gold-essence stone off as such

857
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,940
is indeed a lucrative deception.

858
00:39:35,130 --> 00:39:37,280
These are truly rare and precious pieces.

859
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,610
Each is worth a fortune.

860
00:39:38,970 --> 00:39:40,930
Fourth Miss, what do you think of

861
00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:42,670
this blue glazed hairpin?

862
00:39:47,850 --> 00:39:49,290
Its hue is pure and clear,

863
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,120
with barely a trace of impurity.

864
00:39:51,730 --> 00:39:53,060
If it shines

865
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:54,410
this brightly indoors,

866
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,600
I imagine it must gleam

867
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:58,920
even more brilliantly under the sun.

868
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:03,890
Such a keen eye!

869
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:06,250
Fourth Miss, why not venture a guess?

870
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:08,280
If these items were put up for sale,

871
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,110
what price do you think they
might fetch at auction?

872
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:12,240
You're putting me in a difficult spot.

873
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,880
It's a serious taboo

874
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,360
to name prices on items

875
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:18,840
that haven't yet entered the auction hall.

876
00:40:19,830 --> 00:40:21,090
A taboo it may be,

877
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,960
but so long as you don't speak it aloud,

878
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:23,880
who's to know?

879
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:27,730
Then if I get it wrong,

880
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:29,810
I hope Ms. Su won't hold it against me.

881
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:41,360
Well?

882
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:42,580
I told you,

883
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,360
Miss He has a discerning eye.

884
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:10,120
This agate cup is actually
made of chalcedony.

885
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:12,650
Once filled with wine, it
enhances the aroma.

886
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,480
Since Your Highness is fond of wine,

887
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,000
I daresay this agate cup

888
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,430
would suit you perfectly.

889
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:19,830
This cup alone is worth a year
of my stipend.

890
00:41:19,930 --> 00:41:21,010
Ms. Su,

891
00:41:21,130 --> 00:41:23,130
are you not worried that such a gift
might bring scandal upon your house

892
00:41:23,130 --> 00:41:25,660
or worse, accusations of
bribery against me?

893
00:41:30,310 --> 00:41:31,710
I'm but a man of the sword,

894
00:41:31,890 --> 00:41:33,750
not as refined in taste as Mr. Wen.

895
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:36,160
Better let him have it.

896
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:45,760
Is it wine we're drinking, or vinegar?

897
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:50,750
With Your Highness' upright name,

898
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:52,350
who would dare cast slander?

899
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:54,160
But wouldn't it be a pity

900
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,720
for such kind intentions from Ms. Su

901
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:57,240
to go unacknowledged?

902
00:41:58,130 --> 00:42:00,060
If I may offer a humble suggestion—

903
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:01,080
why not

904
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:02,740
convert the value of this agate cup

905
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:05,260
into a monetary donation

906
00:42:05,530 --> 00:42:07,590
for the supplies of the Dingbei Army?

907
00:42:08,750 --> 00:42:10,010
What do you both think?

908
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:11,680
In doing so,

909
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:13,740
Ms. Su honors her own goodwill,

910
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,060
and both His Highness and the Dingbei Army

911
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:16,920
will be grateful to the Su family.

912
00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:19,110
It would be a noble gesture.

913
00:42:20,350 --> 00:42:21,690
If word were to reach His Majesty,

914
00:42:21,690 --> 00:42:23,210
he might even commend you.

915
00:42:23,990 --> 00:42:25,270
Very

916
00:42:29,370 --> 00:42:30,410
good.

917
00:42:31,210 --> 00:42:33,470
It is a perfect resolution for all sides.

918
00:42:46,290 --> 00:42:50,980
[Feng's Mansion]

919
00:42:52,330 --> 00:42:54,120
You can't even handle trivial matters.

920
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:55,420
What use are you?

921
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:59,240
Your Grace, please spare me.

922
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:02,030
That woman has powerful backing.

923
00:43:03,170 --> 00:43:04,230
In Lingzhou,

924
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:06,180
who dares oppose the Feng family?

925
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:07,070
Especially considering I'm the
elder sister

926
00:43:07,070 --> 00:43:08,670
of the Princess of Dingbei,

927
00:43:09,810 --> 00:43:11,320
who dares to cross me?

928
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,660
Is she looking to get herself killed?

929
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:15,200
I heard Ms. Su

930
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,610
call that man

931
00:43:16,910 --> 00:43:17,910
"Your Highness."

932
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:20,780
Your Highness?

933
00:43:24,590 --> 00:43:25,800
What about Your Highness?

934
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:28,730
Even the Prince must respect
first come, first served.

935
00:43:28,730 --> 00:43:30,090
Young Madam, bad news!

936
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:33,640
The Prince of Dingbei has
sent an order of reprimand.

937
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:35,360
His Lord is furious.

938
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:49,260
Kneel down!

939
00:43:52,390 --> 00:43:53,320
Father-in-law,

940
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:55,460
what's going on?
