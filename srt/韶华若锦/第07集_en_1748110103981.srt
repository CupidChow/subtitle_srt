1
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,360
Swine!

2
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:29,000
I just want to ask you for a death sentence.

3
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,560
If I remember correctly,

4
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,760
the second brother of the Marquis is a member of the Meiyan clan.

5
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,520
Meiyan has many followers in the Buddhist temple.

6
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,280
It's a good place to practice Buddhism.

7
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,560
Meiyan?

8
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,520
He is a noble man.

9
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,720
He is a high ranking man.

10
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,280
He killed my wife.

11
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:51,960
If I don't punish him,

12
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,160
I will be very upset.

13
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,160
Good.

14
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,400
Good. Meiyan is very good.

15
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,000
Meiyan is very good.

16
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,800
Thank you for your consideration.

17
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:07,520
I should thank you for your consideration.

18
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,080
Father-in-law.

19
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,840
It's not good.

20
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,840
No, no, no.

21
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,840
It's not good.

22
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,840
It's not good.

23
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,840
It's not good.

24
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,840
It's not good.

25
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,520
It's not good.

26
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,960
My lady.

27
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,200
After the death of the King of Dingbei,

28
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,720
the Marquis has done three things.

29
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,160
Which three?

30
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,640
The first one is the marriage of the third lady.

31
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,240
The third lady committed a grave mistake.

32
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,040
She wanted to marry the husband within a short time.

33
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,120
But the King of Dingbei suggested a man.

34
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,200
It immediately solved the Marquis' problem.

35
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,520
Who suggested it?

36
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,320
It's Feng Sanlang from the General's mansion of Lingzhou.

37
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,880
That's great.

38
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,640
It's not a small favor, my lady.

39
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,760
It's not great.

40
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,640
The third lady has been spoiled since childhood.

41
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,320
That's why she is so stubborn.

42
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,440
But I heard that the Feng family is very well-educated.

43
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:15,040
The former general Feng is a righteous and righteous man.

44
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,880
The third lady married into the Feng family.

45
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,480
She might be able to take in the new family.

46
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,440
And the former general Feng is born to be a good man.

47
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,400
But he is a good man.

48
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,280
He is also a righteous and righteous man.

49
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,880
To the third lady,

50
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,400
it's not a bad thing.

51
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,160
What about the second one?

52
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,880
The second one is to punish Aunt Liu.

53
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,360
The Marquis wants to send her to Meiyan Court.

54
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,360
She will be blessed with a good life.

55
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,960
It's not a personal matter.

56
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,680
It's what?

57
00:04:52,280 --> 00:05:04,560
arrival here to meandering the

58
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,400
The victimift of Liu could have been a girl.

59
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,480
Why would she do it?

60
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:18,760
Was she the one who got into a與 concur of REMINISCE de Lune?

61
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,960
and marry me to the Dingbei family.

62
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,960
Why did you hide the truth from them?

63
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:26,960
They committed such a big crime.

64
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,960
Shouldn't they be punished in a proper manner?

65
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:35,960
How can I be promoted in the name of the family?

66
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,960
Besides, Liu is our own family.

67
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,960
If someone wants to make a big deal about it,

68
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,960
and says that our family is colluding with bandits,

69
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:46,960
it will be a big trouble.

70
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:50,960
But in my opinion,

71
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,960
Father might not think it through.

72
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,960
It must be the King of Dingbei who is trying to make a big deal about it.

73
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:01,960
It seems that he is really thinking about the Ming family.

74
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:04,960
If he marries me,

75
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,960
the Ming family might be able to be in a good position.

76
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,960
The third thing is that

77
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,960
your wedding date is not far away.

78
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:22,960
It's not far.

79
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,960
The reward is 1000 taels of gold,

80
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,960
10,000 taels of silver,

81
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,960
100,000 taels of silver,

82
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:50,960
90,000 taels of silver,

83
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:52,960
6,500 taels of silver.

84
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,560
50,000 taels of silver,

85
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,760
I will remember you.

86
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,960
The day you left the temple

87
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:01,960
and met her behind

88
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,960
she told you that

89
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,960
your wife was alive 2 years ago,

90
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:08,960
who replaced her wife to him.

91
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,760
My wife's name is

92
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:13,960
Morena.

93
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,960
You came here for information.

94
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,800
Thank you,

95
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,800
I...

96
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:54,240
Oui renewable

97
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,440
Okay

98
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:06,520
count it

99
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,520
2

100
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,580
1

101
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,560
It's too bad

102
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,960
It's delicious

103
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,800
Father or not?

104
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,800
Hold him!

105
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,800
How dare you hit that young master?

106
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,800
Who is it?

107
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,800
Who is it?

108
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,800
How dare you hit me?

109
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,800
You are the son of the heaven.

110
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,800
How can you be so cruel?

111
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,800
I am the god of this place.

112
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,800
Do you know who my father is?

113
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,800
If you don't let go, I will send you to the police station.

114
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,800
Take him away.

115
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,800
Let me go!

116
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,800
Go and tell my father!

117
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,800
Let him save me!

118
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,800
Where are you taking me?

119
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,800
What are you doing?

120
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,800
I am the son of the lord.

121
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,800
How dare you hit me?

122
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,800
You...

123
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,800
I...

124
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,800
I want to see my father.

125
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,800
My father is a goldsmith.

126
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,800
Your family can't handle your business.

127
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,800
How did you get into the palace?

128
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,800
You even got the fourth rank.

129
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:24,800
I got the rank of the best in the world.

130
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,800
How did you get the gold and ink?

131
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,800
I drank too much.

132
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,800
I have a headache.

133
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,800
I can't remember anything.

134
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,800
Why did you get the rank?

135
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,800
I can't remember anything.

136
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,800
I didn't write anything.

137
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,800
How did you get into the palace?

138
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:03,800
My father said he had done everything for me.

139
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:08,800
I will be the best in the palace in three days.

140
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,800
I don't know anything else.

141
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,800
You can ask my father.

142
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,800
Do you know how your father got into the palace?

143
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,800
I don't know anything else.

144
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,800
I really don't know anything.

145
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:25,800
I only know that my father went to the palace to see Lord Zhu.

146
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,800
That's all.

147
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,800
Your Majesty, I have something to tell you.

148
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,800
The son of Lord Cheng'en, Gu Wen Yan,

149
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,800
was beaten up by the court on the street.

150
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:43,800
He has been accused of abusing Lord Cheng'en.

151
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:47,800
The court has sent the prosecutor, Hu Chang Mao,

152
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,800
back to the court.

153
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,800
He has been sentenced to six months.

154
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,800
Your Majesty,

155
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:59,800
Hu Chang Mao admitted to the bribery of Lord Cheng'en.

156
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,800
He added Gu Wen Yan's name to the list.

157
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,800
He replaced Gu Wen Yan's name with other people's names.

158
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,800
He helped him to be released.

159
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,800
I have sent someone to search the palace.

160
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,800
Hu Chang Mao has received the bribe.

161
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,800
It's very suspicious.

162
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,800
Lord Cheng'en, are you guilty?

163
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,800
Your Majesty, you are wise.

164
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,800
I am innocent.

165
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:27,800
Your Majesty, Lord Cheng'en is not guilty only because of this.

166
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,800
After I got the bribe,

167
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,800
I collected the prints of the prints.

168
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,800
I found that it was two years ago.

169
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,800
The court gave the military funds to the Northern Army.

170
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,800
What?

171
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,800
What is this?

172
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:44,800
Your Majesty, I am innocent.

173
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,800
Your Majesty, the Northern Army is trying to bribe us.

174
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,800
I beg you to let me investigate this case.

175
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,800
I agree.

176
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,800
Your Majesty, I am innocent.

177
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,800
Thank you, Your Majesty.

178
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,800
Guards, take Lord Cheng'en back to the camp.

179
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,800
I am innocent.

180
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,800
Your Majesty, Your Majesty.

181
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,800
I am innocent.

182
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:14,800
Your Majesty, I am innocent.

183
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,800
Lord Cheng'en,

184
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,800
The Court ordered me to search the palace.

185
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,800
I found that there were 20,000 taels of stolen silver.

186
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,800
The mother of the deceased is Gu Wenyan's biological mother.

187
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,800
Lord Cheng'en may not know about this.

188
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,800
You are so stupid.

189
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,800
Did Lord Dingbei do anything?

190
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:52,800
Not yet.

191
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,800
Lord Cheng'en is always loyal to you.

192
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,800
I think he won't reveal anything.

193
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,800
Lord Dingbei wants to get rid of Gu Jinzhong.

194
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:10,800
He is the one who is responsible for the death of the deceased.

195
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,800
Gu Jinzhong may not survive.

196
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:19,800
He may be able to live again.

197
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:25,800
Gu Jinzhong may not live.

198
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,800
But he is the one who is responsible for the death of the deceased.

199
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:32,800
Yes.

200
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,800
What about the Ming family?

201
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,800
I know Tan'er's character.

202
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,800
If she doesn't want to, no one can force her.

203
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:47,800
Lord Dingbei is not her family.

204
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,800
There are changes in the marriage.

205
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:55,800
No matter what, the marriage will not succeed.

206
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,800
The draw public has been announced.

207
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,800
The winner will win the show business.

208
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,800
だから

209
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,800
All statements are equal.

210
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:36,780
Su them

211
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:44,100
evil

212
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:47,540
well

213
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:52,720
I'll your current

214
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,720
I heard that the villa is very lively tonight.

215
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,720
Let's go and have fun.

216
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,720
Are you crazy?

217
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,720
What is the villa?

218
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,720
How can a girl go and have fun?

219
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,720
Actually, the villa is just a dance hall.

220
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:13,720
I heard from my second brother that there are many beautiful girls in the villa.

221
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:16,720
Most of them are men who meet and have a dance.

222
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,720
Even if there are beautiful girls,

223
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,720
they are not very attractive.

224
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,720
But I always feel that...

225
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,720
girls in the villa are not very attractive.

226
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,720
Tan, I'm thinking for you.

227
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,720
My second brother said that

228
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,720
Miss Shuiying was a beautiful girl in the villa.

229
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,720
She can sing and dance well.

230
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,720
You mean...

231
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,720
she is a beautiful girl?

232
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,720
Yes.

233
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,720
You mean...

234
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:52,720
I should go and learn from Miss Shuiying...

235
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:56,720
how to seduce my husband?

236
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,720
No.

237
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,720
I mean...

238
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:02,720
you can be friends and make love.

239
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:06,720
We are tired from the long journey.

240
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,720
It's time to go out and relax.

241
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:12,720
It's good to go out and have a rest.

242
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,720
If Miss Shuiying is really kind,

243
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,720
it's worth it for me to go.

244
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:20,720
Actually, many of the ladies in the villa...

245
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,720
have been to the villa to have fun.

246
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,720
So many people have been there.

247
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,720
Let's go and see what's going on.

248
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,720
Besides, we just want to see Miss Shuiying's beauty.

249
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:32,720
No one will recognize us if we are in the villa.

250
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,720
Besides, you are going to get married.

251
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:38,720
You won't have time to go out and relax.

252
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,720
That makes sense.

253
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,720
But I have seen Miss Shuiying once.

254
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:50,720
She is really beautiful and charming.

255
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,720
Really?

256
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,720
Hmm?

257
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:14,720
Shuiying!

258
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,720
Come here.

259
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,720
Have some tea.

260
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,720
Mimi,

261
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,720
you are not going to deal with the villa, are you?

262
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,720
Aren't you afraid of meeting someone familiar?

263
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:48,720
You are so strict with me.

264
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,720
You are so rude.

265
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:54,720
Who else can recognize my strictness?

266
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,720
Mr. Bai.

267
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,720
Miss Shuiying.

268
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,720
This is my cousin and my cousin.

269
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:09,720
They are here to see you.

270
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,720
You are young and naive.

271
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:19,720
I would like to offer you some tea.

272
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,720
Thank you for your kindness.

273
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
If you are free, you can come to my room.

274
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,720
I will make some tea.

275
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,720
Miss, please.

276
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:56,720
You came here today not just to see me, right?

277
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,720
I want to ask you for some music.

278
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,720
I have a new music book.

279
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,720
Please wait.

280
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:12,720
I will go and get the music for you.

281
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,720
Please wait.

282
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,720
Mr. Bai,

283
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,720
you are here.

284
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,720
Mr. Zhang,

285
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,720
it's been a long time.

286
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,720
Please sit.

287
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,720
Miss Bai.

288
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,720
It's not your first time here.

289
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,720
Why are you so surprised?

290
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,720
Do you know each other?

291
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,720
Yes.

292
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,720
The villa is famous.

293
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,720
My cousin wants to see you.

294
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:12,720
The villa is always open for you.

295
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,720
I will wait for you.

296
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,720
Please wait.

297
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,720
Why are you so polite today?

298
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,720
Er Bao.

299
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,720
Er Bao.

300
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,720
Boss.

301
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,720
Boss.

302
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:32,720
Bring the wine I have been saving.

303
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,720
And tell the kitchen to prepare a table of good dishes.

304
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:38,720
Boss, please tell me which dishes you want to order.

305
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,720
What is the most important thing?

306
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,720
Tell the kitchen to prepare the best dishes.

307
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,720
Yes.

308
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,720
I understand.

309
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,720
Miss Bai,

310
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,720
this wine is called grape wine.

311
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,720
It's from the west.

312
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:12,720
Every year, it is made into five bottles.

313
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,720
When the west was attacked,

314
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,720
there were only two bottles of wine.

315
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,720
The other bottle was given to the emperor.

316
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,720
It's my cousin.

317
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,720
This wine is unique.

318
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,720
No one else can drink it.

319
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,720
It's sweet and sweet.

320
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,720
It's very rich in flavor.

321
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:32,720
It's a very delicious wine.

322
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,720
Here.

323
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:39,720
How can you bring such a good wine to the guest?

324
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,720
You deserve it.

325
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,720
Miss Bai, please have a drink.

326
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:50,720
Brother,

327
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,720
wine is good for the family.

328
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,720
If we drink it,

329
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:56,720
it will be a good wine.

330
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:58,720
Brother,

331
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,720
drink it all.

332
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,720
How is it?

333
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:06,720
It's very rich in flavor.

334
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,720
It's very delicious.

335
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,720
It's a very delicious wine.

336
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,720
If you like it,

337
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,720
I'll give you a discount every year.

338
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,720
What is he doing?

339
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,720
Here.

340
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,720
You've lost weight.

341
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,720
Try this.

342
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,720
You don't like it?

343
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,720
Miss Bai,

344
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,720
tell me what you want to eat.

345
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,720
I'll prepare it for you.

346
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,720
No, no.

347
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,720
What's wrong with you today?

348
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,720
Did you get a bad omen?

349
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:02,720
I...

350
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:06,720
I know something.

351
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,720
I know everything.

352
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,720
You and I know everything.

353
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,720
I know.

354
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,720
Do you know?

355
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:24,720
Should I know?

356
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,720
Is it because of that card?

357
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:30,720
It's not funny.

358
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,720
It's really useful.

359
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,720
No, I have to try it.

360
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,720
Zhang Hua Yu,

361
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,720
you are so kind today.

362
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,720
Are you asking me for something?

363
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,720
I don't want anything.

364
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,720
I just want you to come.

365
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,720
Are you trying to use my words

366
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,720
to make a business out of the text of the text?

367
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,720
Miss Bai,

368
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,720
business is not important to me.

369
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,720
I know you like to read.

370
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,720
I can open a whole building

371
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,720
and a whole Wentao Pavilion

372
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,720
for you.

373
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,720
Is Mr. Zhang interested in you?

374
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,720
He is.

375
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,720
It's good that we don't have to shout at him.

376
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:18,720
Then...

377
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,720
Not for money?

378
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,720
But for people?

379
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:23,720
For people?

380
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,720
No, I don't agree.

381
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,720
You are too much.

382
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,720
You have seen Nan Zhi so many times.

383
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,720
Why are you so interested in her?

384
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:34,720
Nan Zhi grew up with me.

385
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,720
We are like sisters.

386
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,720
I have to be a good person for her.

387
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,720
I can help you in your business.

388
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,720
It's not you. It's Nan Zhi.

389
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,720
No, what does Nan Zhi mean?

390
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,720
Stop pretending.

391
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,720
I don't know who you are.

392
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,720
Everything can be traded for profit.

393
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,720
You can't be a good person.

394
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,720
If you are a gentleman,

395
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,720
you can be straightforward.

396
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,720
Don't be a girl.

397
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:02,720
No, I am a girl.

398
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:06,720
We are not friends.

399
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,720
Why do you say that?

400
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:11,720
I just want you and me to be together.

401
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:12,720
We should be together.

402
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,720
Is it that difficult?

403
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,720
I am afraid of what Mr. Zhang is going to say.

404
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,720
I don't understand.

405
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:18,720
You don't understand?

406
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,720
Good.

407
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:30,720
I don't understand what Miss Bai means.

408
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:35,720
Please help me to get rid of the bad guys.

409
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,720
Thank you.

410
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,720
Did she find out?

411
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,720
I don't know.

412
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:44,720
Thank you.

413
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,720
Did she find out?

414
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:52,720
Mr. Zhang, what do you mean?

415
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,720
Why do you ask me?

416
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,720
What do you mean?

417
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,720
Yes, that's what I mean.

418
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,720
What's wrong?

419
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,720
I just want to be at peace.

420
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,720
Why do you treat me like this?

421
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:06,720
You are so annoying.

422
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,720
Brother, let's go.

423
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:08,720
Go?

424
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,720
Min Min, you don't want to wait for her?

425
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,720
Min Min.

426
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:14,720
Min Min.

427
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:17,720
You are so annoying.

428
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:18,720
You are so annoying.

429
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,720
Tan.

430
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,720
Miss Ming is here too.

431
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:30,720
Say it again.

432
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,720
I just asked Shuiying.

433
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,720
She said that Miss Ming is in her room.

434
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,720
Miss Ming?

435
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,720
Why did she come to the hotel?

436
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,720
Why did she come to the hotel?

437
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,720
She came to see Shuiying.

438
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,720
What can she do?

439
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,720
The wedding is coming.

440
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,720
The wedding is coming.

441
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,720
Don't let her see you.

442
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,720
Shuiying.

443
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,720
Don't let her see me.

444
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,720
You.

445
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:20,720
You said no to me.

446
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,720
Why is the prince here?

447
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,720
Give it back to me.

448
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:30,720
Give it back to me.

449
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:32,720
Give it back to me.

450
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:34,720
Give it back to me.

451
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,720
Give it back to me.

452
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,720
Give it back to me.

453
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:38,720
Give it back to me.

454
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,720
Give it back to me.

455
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,720
I...

456
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,720
I...

457
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:12,720
I came here today.

458
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,720
I didn't do as you wanted.

459
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:15,720
No matter what happened,

460
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,720
the hotel is not the place for you to come.

461
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,720
The wedding is coming.

462
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,720
Many people are watching.

463
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,720
They can't help but find the wrong place

464
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,720
to stop this wedding.

465
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,720
You should be very careful.

466
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,720
I will be very careful.

467
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,720
I will be very careful.

468
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,720
I will be very careful.

469
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,720
I will be very careful.

470
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,720
I will be very careful.

471
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,720
You should be very careful.

472
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,720
I will send you back.

473
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,720
Thank you, Your Highness.

474
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,720
I can go back by myself.

475
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,720
If not,

476
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,720
I will ask the Duke of Jing'an to send you back.

477
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,720
I will do as you say.

478
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,720
I will do as you say.

479
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,720
He is the Duke of Dingbei.

480
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,720
He sent someone to leave.

481
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,720
He doesn't even have a horse carriage.

482
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,720
He doesn't even have a horse.

483
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,720
He is really a fool.

484
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:32,720
What did you say?

485
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,720
I will go back.

486
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:44,720
Thank you for sending me back.

487
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,720
Since you have sent me back,

488
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,720
I will leave now.

489
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:53,720
Your Highness.

490
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,720
Since we are going to get married,

491
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,720
I think it's better to make it clear.

492
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,720
It's okay if you say it.

493
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:12,720
Why do you care about the villa so much?

494
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,720
You didn't even knock on the door just now.

495
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,720
And you came into Miss Shuiying's room.

496
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:23,720
Are you a guest of the villa?

497
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:29,720
You have a close relationship with Miss Shuiying.

498
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,720
I don't want to interfere in your personal affairs.

499
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,720
I just feel that since we are going to get married,

500
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:40,720
it's better to know about it as soon as possible.

501
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,720
I am the one who is responsible for the villa.

502
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,720
Shuiying is the one responsible for it.

503
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:50,720
Is that so?

504
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,720
Since we are going to the mansion,

505
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,720
why don't we go in and have a small chat?

506
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,720
We can have some tea before leaving.

507
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:04,720
It's getting late.

508
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,720
I don't want to talk about it.

509
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:08,720
You misunderstood me.

510
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:12,720
I was thinking that since we have discussed about the marriage contract,

511
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:16,720
why don't we sign the contract before the wedding?

512
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:38,720
I have thought about it carefully since I came back from the mansion.

513
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,720
I have made a decision about the contract.

514
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,720
Please have a look.

515
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:50,720
If there is any disagreement, we can discuss it again.

516
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:55,720
After the wedding, we need to keep the name of the couple.

517
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,720
So, we have three rules.

518
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,720
First, no matter where we are,

519
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,720
you need to protect our family.

520
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:08,720
Second, you need to take care of my reputation.

521
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,720
No matter how we get along,

522
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,720
or if there is any disagreement,

523
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,720
as long as there are outsiders,

524
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,720
we need to love each other.

525
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,720
Before we got married, you were always...

526
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:24,720
a nightmare.

527
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:28,720
I don't know how many people are waiting to see my joke.

528
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:32,720
But I want them to be very happy and be very happy.

529
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:40,720
Third, respect each other and be friendly.

530
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:41,720
Especially...

531
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:47,720
Especially, you need to be polite in the wedding.

532
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,720
Fourth, money and wealth are separate.

533
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:54,720
The above is all I can think of.

534
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:56,720
Does it make sense?

535
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,720
If you agree, please sign the contract.

536
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:11,720
If there is any disagreement, please discuss it.

537
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:25,720
Just sign the contract.

538
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:29,720
You don't need to live like this.

539
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:32,720
You are so detailed.

540
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,720
You care about the contract.

541
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:37,720
If I don't sign the contract,

542
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:39,720
I will not respect your spirit.

543
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:00,720
I am sorry.

544
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,720
I can do it myself.

545
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:30,720
I can do it.

546
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:31,720
I can do it.

547
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:32,720
I can do it.

548
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:57,720
Miss,

549
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:00,720
the wedding dress has been changed.

550
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:01,720
Please have a look.

551
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,720
Tomorrow is the wedding.

552
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,720
Even if there is a disagreement,

553
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,720
it will be too late to change it.

554
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:11,720
Who dares to wear the wedding dress of Princess Dingbei?

555
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:13,720
Someone will be waiting for her.

556
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:25,720
This time, it suits my taste.

557
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:30,720
I can't believe I am going to get married.

558
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:34,720
Everything is like a dream.

559
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:37,720
What you did must be a dream.

560
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:41,720
You will be the one who will be the heir of the royal family.

561
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:48,720
After I get married,

562
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:52,720
will I be alone in this huge mansion?

563
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,720
Miss, you are not a distant relative.

564
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,720
Why do you need to be sad?

565
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:00,720
The Dingbei mansion is just a few streets away from our mansion.

566
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,720
If you miss the Marquis,

567
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,720
you can come back anytime.

568
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,720
You are so thoughtful.

569
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:13,720
Miss, it's time to put on the makeup.

570
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:15,720
The wedding dress you ordered from the Lancui Palace

571
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,720
has been delivered to the door.

572
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:19,720
Please have a look.

573
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,720
The marigold you ordered from the Lancui Palace

574
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,720
has been delivered to the door.

575
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,720
Okay, please try it on.

576
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:26,720
Yes.

577
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:29,720
The color of the marigold should match the wedding dress.

578
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,720
Yes.

579
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:33,720
By the way,

580
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:38,720
is there a headdress made of the wedding dress of the Dingbei mansion?

581
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,720
Yes.

582
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:45,720
Then, the princess should wear the headdress.

583
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:48,720
Please try that headdress.

584
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,720
Yes.

585
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,720
Mother,

586
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,720
Mother said that

587
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:15,720
the most favorite jewelry in your life

588
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:17,720
is this water-bath.

589
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:23,720
Mother just said me to carry you here.

590
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:33,720
I will be getting married tomorrow.

591
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,720
I will wear it

592
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:40,720
so that you would be able to see

593
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:45,720
all theahan's beauty.

594
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:49,720
Who is it?

595
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,720
My lord has searched the mansion for a long time.

596
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:55,720
But no news of my lady.

597
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:57,720
Did you send someone to the mansion?

598
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:58,720
My lord knows it's a serious matter.

599
00:38:58,720 --> 00:38:59,720
I dare not to make any statement.

600
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:01,720
I'm here to report it.

601
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:03,720
Please go and discuss the plan.

602
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:06,720
Has there been any problem in the mansion?

603
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:09,720
I'm stupid.

604
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:11,720
I didn't notice.

605
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:12,720
Search the mansion.

606
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,720
Especially the gate.

607
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:15,720
Yes.

608
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:16,720
Go.

609
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,720
There are some rouge in the room.

610
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,720
Everything else is normal.

611
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,720
But my lady is missing.

612
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,720
My lady is missing?

613
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,720
My lady is missing?

614
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,720
My lady is missing?

615
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:44,720
Tan'er is a good man.

616
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,720
He never offended anyone.

617
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,720
After I die,

618
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,720
he will come to marry me.

619
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:55,720
He doesn't want to see the happy event tomorrow.

620
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:58,720
Although my mansion is not a strong wall,

621
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,720
I can protect the position of my lord for 12 hours.

622
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:01,720
I never cut off the wall.

623
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:03,720
How can a man like Tan'er

624
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:05,720
disappear without a word?

625
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:08,720
My lord.

626
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:09,720
My lord.

627
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,720
The people of Haiyou Gate

628
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,720
fought with the soldiers at the gate.

629
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:15,720
They made a lot of noise.

630
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,720
I chased them all the way.

631
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:19,720
I found their horses were chasing the soldiers.

632
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:20,720
They went to the west.

633
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,720
Haiyou Gate?

634
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:26,720
The one that kills people?

635
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:29,720
One more thing.

636
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:31,720
I found a carriage with a cross-stitching mark

637
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,720
going east.

638
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:36,720
I don't know if it was a coincidence.

639
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,720
They were on different sides.

640
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:44,720
You are still not enough to win the court.

641
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,720
You even want to get my daughter involved.

642
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:49,720
I will go to the west now.

643
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:50,720
I will take their revenge.

644
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,720
My lord, please wait.

645
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,720
Haiyou Gate was deliberately at the gate.

646
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,720
They wanted to leave a clue

647
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:01,720
and lure me there.

648
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:03,720
Their target is me.

649
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,720
Mingxiao is the hostage.

650
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:07,720
I won't be killed.

651
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,720
I will take care of this.

652
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:13,720
Please stay in the mansion and take care of the situation.

653
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:14,720
There must be no more changes

654
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,720
in the wedding tomorrow.

655
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:19,720
You mean

656
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,720
the wedding is still tomorrow?

657
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:23,720
Of course.

658
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:25,720
The missing of Miss Ming

659
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:27,720
must not be spread.

660
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:28,720
Before I go back,

661
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:31,720
please be safe.

662
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:33,720
Okay.

663
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,720
I will do as you say.

664
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:43,720
If I don't return in time,

665
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:46,720
I will follow the rules of the Ministry of Rites tomorrow.

666
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:49,720
Please go to the mansion and meet me.

667
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:50,720
Don't worry.

668
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:03,720
Go.

669
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:23,720
Arrest Dingbei.

670
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,720
Jin Yunwei, listen to my order.

671
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:32,720
Go.

672
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:43,720
Arrest the bandits of Haiyou Gate.

673
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:46,720
If there are any rebels, kill them.

674
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:02,720
Arrest them.

675
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:23,720
You are a good man.

676
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:25,720
You have a good reputation.

677
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:27,720
Why did you arrest me?

678
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:29,720
You are a good man.

679
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:31,720
If you release me,

680
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:33,720
I will not expose you.

681
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:34,720
I will not report you.

682
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:36,720
I can even revenge you.

683
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:38,720
I will help you to live a peaceful life.

684
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:55,720
I will kill you

685
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:56,720
I have been thinking about it.

686
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,720
You took me away before the wedding.

687
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:01,720
I don't want to be a part of the family.

688
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:04,720
Jiang Xu, Jiang Xu.

689
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,720
If I had known that you are in danger,

690
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,720
I would have left the family.

691
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:26,720
I will kill you.

692
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:27,720
I will kill you.

693
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:28,720
I will kill you.

694
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:29,720
I will kill you.

695
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:30,720
I will kill you.

696
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:31,720
I will kill you.

697
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:32,720
I will kill you.

698
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:33,720
I will kill you.

699
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:34,720
I will kill you.

700
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:35,720
I will kill you.

701
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:36,720
I will kill you.

702
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:37,720
I will kill you.

703
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:38,720
I will kill you.

704
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:39,720
I will kill you.

705
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:40,720
I will kill you.

706
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:41,720
I will kill you.

707
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:42,720
I will kill you.

708
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:43,720
I will kill you.

709
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:44,720
I will kill you.

710
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:45,720
I will kill you.

711
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:46,720
I will kill you.

712
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:47,720
I will kill you.

713
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:48,720
I will kill you.

714
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:49,720
I will kill you.

715
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:50,720
I will kill you.

716
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:51,720
I will kill you.

717
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:52,720
I will kill you.

718
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:53,720
I will kill you.

719
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:54,720
I will kill you.

720
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:55,720
I will kill you.

721
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:56,720
I will kill you.

722
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:57,720
I will kill you.

723
00:45:57,720 --> 00:45:58,720
I will kill you.

724
00:45:58,720 --> 00:45:59,720
I will kill you.

725
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:00,720
I will kill you.

726
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:01,720
I will kill you.

727
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:02,720
I will kill you.

728
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:03,720
I will kill you.

729
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:04,720
I will kill you.

730
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:05,720
I will kill you.

731
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:06,720
I will kill you.

732
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:07,720
I will kill you.

733
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:08,720
I will kill you.

734
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:09,720
I will kill you.

735
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:10,720
I will kill you.

736
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:11,720
I will kill you.

737
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:12,720
I will kill you.

738
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:13,720
I will kill you.

739
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:14,720
I will kill you.

740
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:15,720
I will kill you.

741
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:16,720
I will kill you.

742
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:17,720
I will kill you.

743
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:18,720
I will kill you.

744
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:19,720
I will kill you.

745
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:20,720
I will kill you.

746
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:21,720
