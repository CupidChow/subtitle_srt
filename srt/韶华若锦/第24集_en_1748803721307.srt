1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The End

2
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 1

3
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
The End

4
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I guessed it.

5
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I wonder how many gold coins Mr. Wen has hidden.

6
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I hope no one will be disappointed.

7
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Today, these are just appetizers.

8
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I will be the real master of the restaurant.

9
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
The singing party in Lingzhou City is held by the Su family.

10
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
You can enjoy the food without having to open your mouth.

11
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You can't get too many things to sing.

12
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
You can't get enough money.

13
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
If you want to reward me,

14
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I will keep the best position for you.

15
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I will keep you safe.

16
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I am not so confident.

17
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I have been thinking that Lingzhou City is the right place.

18
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Please.

19
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
My lord, according to the news of the fire in Lingzhou,

20
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
only Prince Ding and the two Shuhanlin people in Lingzhou were found.

21
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Princess Consort has returned to the mansion before she entered the city.

22
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
But these days, the detective is in the opposite direction.

23
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
He has been looking for Princess Consort's whereabouts.

24
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Prince Ding has reached the destination.

25
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
If they still want to stay here,

26
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
the Su family will have to do it one way or another.

27
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
And they will not be ashamed.

28
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
But if the Su family does it in person,

29
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I am afraid that they will be tired of the blind.

30
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I have a plan.

31
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Is there a way to get off the jade?

32
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I haven't found it yet.

33
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Since the man who was injured was killed,

34
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
he has been living a life of danger.

35
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I will send someone to catch him.

36
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I didn't expect that he is the leader of the Haiyou Sect.

37
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
The one who saw the late master

38
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
chose him as the Su family's heir.

39
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I didn't expect that he would be so tolerant

40
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
and be able to repay the grudges and revenge for his family.

41
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Good job! Good job!

42
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Master.

43
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
The new batch of goods has arrived.

44
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I have informed the Su family that they will be here.

45
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I will go to the singing party.

46
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
The goods will be sent to the top.

47
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Yes.

48
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Master, I want to ask you to investigate the situation.

49
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I want to ask the government to investigate it.

50
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I want to investigate the situation with Su Yuan.

51
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
But Miss He is not coming.

52
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I don't know what she is doing.

53
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Miss He is not easy.

54
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
She can see the problem with her foot.

55
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
She can also find the way to the golden building with the hairpin.

56
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
She came to Lingzhou for the sake of eating and drinking.

57
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
She is not a official.

58
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
She can see the mystery of the situation.

59
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Besides, the current king Dingbei is in Lingzhou.

60
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Dingbei came here because of Su Qia.

61
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
If he can find the clue of the Su family,

62
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
he will investigate it and never leave them alone.

63
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
He has been planning for years in Lingzhou.

64
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Now, he is at the end of the collection.

65
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I think you are a fake and unconfident person.

66
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
You are a disciple of the Su family.

67
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
You said it was good to talk with me.

68
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
You said you would cook chicken wings for me next time.

69
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I said I would cook.

70
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
But I can't help Miss Yun to cook.

71
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
If I didn't cook, I would be starving.

72
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Tell me.

73
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Did you see me cooking chicken wings?

74
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I didn't even see the chicken.

75
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I think you are a fake.

76
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
That's because Miss Yun is injured.

77
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
She can't be treated like this.

78
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Do you really think you cook chicken wings?

79
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
You cook chicken wings, meat, tea, food, chicken hair, and even pork.

80
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Miss Yun didn't say that before.

81
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
What did I say?

82
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I cook chicken wings.

83
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I said it in a word.

84
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
It's not good.

85
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Why did you eat half of the chicken?

86
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
People will be angry if they are hungry.

87
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
It's not good to eat chicken wings.

88
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Why did you ask me to teach you how to cook chicken wings?

89
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I...

90
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Look at this.

91
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Look at this.

92
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
What are you doing?

93
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
You... You...

94
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
You...

95
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Look at this.

96
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Look at this.

97
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I'll wash the clothes.

98
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I don't eat clothes.

99
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I wash the dishes.

100
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Let's go to eat.

101
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Miss Yun, the food is ready.

102
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
It's the best.

103
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Yes.

104
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
And...

105
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
order some dishes from the kitchen.

106
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Don't need to be so busy.

107
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
You can just serve the food.

108
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Yes.

109
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Miss Yun,

110
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I have to go to the kitchen.

111
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I have to go to the kitchen.

112
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I have to go to the kitchen.

113
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I have to go to the kitchen.

114
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Yes.

115
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
You can all go now.

116
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Yes.

117
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
The dream is gentle and fragrant.

118
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Who can stop the soul?

119
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Who can stop?

120
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Who can break on your heart?

121
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Someone else can,

122
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
but someone else does.

123
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
She can场 a fire pit.

124
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Don't waste her time.

125
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I will see about it.

126
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Wait for me.

127
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Wait.

128
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Wait.

129
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Wait for me.

130
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:52,720
Wait for me.

131
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,960
Wait for me.

132
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Yes.

133
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Miss.

134
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Ding Shao sent a message.

135
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
There is a scene in the woods.

136
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Zhang Huaiyu is not in Shangjing.

137
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
He said he was going back to Beijing to live in the East.

138
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
He is not a light of the city.

139
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Although he took the supplement,

140
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
he may still have the back.

141
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Send someone to watch over him.

142
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Zhang Huaiyu can't let others take the things.

143
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Yes.

144
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
What ashow!

145
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
So strong!

146
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Where is he?

147
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Go!

148
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Where is he?

149
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Go!

150
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
He is in level 3.

151
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
He is not in level 3.

152
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Go!

153
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Why are you here?

154
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
You are here too.

155
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
He is fishing here.

156
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I am watching him.

157
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Why are you driving around?

158
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Why are you driving around?

159
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Stop talking.

160
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Stop talking.

161
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Go!

162
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Why did you eat so much?

163
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
You opened a few dishes for me last night.

164
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
What do you want to eat tonight?

165
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
You didn't eat the last time.

166
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Why don't you try it today?

167
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
The fish we caught today is definitely delicious.

168
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
But the roast chicken is also good.

169
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
What do you think?

170
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Didn't Miss Yun think that

171
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
the roast chicken I made

172
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
wouldn't even eat the pig?

173
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Pig is such a good man.

174
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
So you were acting in the inn just now?

175
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
You are talking nonsense.

176
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Mr. Shu,

177
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
aren't you acting more like a play?

178
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I...

179
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
But I think you don't have to act anymore.

180
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Those two are far from the root.

181
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
They can't hear you.

182
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Grandpa, you are so clever.

183
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
You can make a fuss over a fight

184
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
and make people mad.

185
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Interesting.

186
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Why is it the prince?

187
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Didn't Mr. Su say that he wanted me to go?

188
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
It seems that Miss Su

189
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
misunderstood me for Miss He.

190
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
So I was wrong.

191
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Mr. Su misunderstood you for me.

192
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
So you mean

193
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
you are actually mean to me?

194
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I...

195
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I didn't mean that.

196
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Then what?

197
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
What do you mean?

198
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
That's right.

199
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
The prince is so mean to me.

200
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
After all,

201
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I can only be with Miss Qing Yu

202
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
and make a good friend.

203
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Where is Miss Qing Yu?

204
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
The prince didn't bring her back.

205
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Maybe he will find a good day

206
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
and go back to the building to pick her up.

207
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Miss He really wants me to bring her back.

208
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Why do you want to say that I want to?

209
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Do you have any feelings for me?

210
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I can't even promise to be a good girl.

211
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
What are you trying to do again?

212
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I'm just pretending.

213
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I heard that the Prince's Mansion is lonely.

214
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
If you are a sister,

215
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
it's good to be a good girl.

216
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
But unfortunately,

217
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I'm not good enough for a girl.

218
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I won't serve you well.

219
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I'm the one who is good enough for the Prince's Mansion.

220
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Good.

221
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I'll ask someone to bring her back.

222
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Why did you hit me?

223
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I haven't asked Miss He

224
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
to marry the Mochua and to build a temple.

225
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
You've learned to be a villain.

226
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
When did I ask her to marry the Mochua?

227
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I don't know.

228
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Your Highness, this is in the Mansion of Su.

229
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
It's in the Mansion of Su

230
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
that I'm more like a villain.

231
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
It's far away from here.

232
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Is it not suitable?

233
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I thought that

234
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
there would be no key.

235
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Yu is waiting for me.

236
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I'll go on.

237
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I'll have to trouble you

238
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
to finish this play.

239
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
How can I finish this play by myself?

240
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I know.

241
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Keep watching.

242
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
The gentle scent of the yellow road.

243
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
The two words of wealth

244
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
always have a way to ruin your life.

245
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I'll go on.

246
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Granny!

247
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
No!

248
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
What's wrong?

249
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
What if they're in trouble?

250
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
What are you doing?

251
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I... I can't do it in the mansion.

252
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I'm here.

253
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I'm not coming either.

254
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Where are they?

255
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
You're here.

256
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Why don't you come tomorrow?

257
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
You two are so shy.

258
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
You've got a good record.

259
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Almost all of us are in the city.

260
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
It's good that we're here.

261
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Yes.

262
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Master Ren is in there.

263
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Yes.

264
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
The letter

265
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
has been around for a whole day.

266
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I think it's all around.

267
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
It's a secret account.

268
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I think they're just here

269
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
to steal the money.

270
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Guys, the Big Miss has ordered

271
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
to find Zhang Huoyu's whereabouts.

272
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
If you don't go back,

273
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
you can't go back to the city.

274
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Go!

275
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
No way.

276
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
If you can steal the money,

277
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
can you still be a beggar?

278
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
How do I feel?

279
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
We're fooled.

280
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Uncle, please wait.

281
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
So much stuff.

282
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Come over withoutيف.

283
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
We should mutt on its own.

284
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,960
These movies are just our thanks

285
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
for all the help and needles that have been given to us.

286
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Always keeping a safe head.

287
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Don't be too lurid.

288
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Okay, good.

289
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Here...

290
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Here...

291
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Why are you all so stubborn?

292
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Hurry to a murdering scene.

293
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I think we'll find a murder case.

294
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,440
Look a little greedy.

295
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,320
He has my steps!

296
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:19,160
Look, his owner.

297
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,880
A hunter?

298
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:21,920
Behind my back here.

299
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,840
I have no vinegar.

300
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:26,380
My healing effect…

301
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,820
Three seconds.

302
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:30,840
That scared me!

303
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:33,100
I guess I will punish her.

304
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:35,360
Unlike you,

305
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:37,240
I can' t have any.

306
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,040
Shut up,

307
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,040
Where's Vaan?

308
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,440
You two东白养着在现场两共有几腿的地震

309
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:56,620
Ready!

310
00:20:58,380 --> 00:20:59,880
Ready!

311
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,880
Everyone, come undertheme on your feet,

312
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:02,880
when will they turn?

313
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:04,040
I'm looking for you here,

314
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:06,040
among expanding seeking the evil할,

315
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,040
will you take us その人有私的Vai?

316
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,980
...

317
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:12,540
I'm here to give you my best wishes.

318
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:14,420
You two are here from the faraway world.

319
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:15,820
You're not familiar with this place.

320
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:19,300
I'm here to offer my best wishes to you.

321
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,860
To protect you two.

322
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:21,820
Yes, yes, yes.

323
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:24,140
Thank you, Miss Su.

324
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:25,020
Of course.

325
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:26,140
No, no, no.

326
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:27,060
I should.

327
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:28,100
I should.

328
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:30,620
You're stupid.

329
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:32,500
You're like everyone else.

330
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:37,860
Wait, wait.

331
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:40,260
What's going on?

332
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:41,620
Nothing is right, you're stupid.

333
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:43,540
You said that you were Quarrel Around the World.

334
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:44,820
What am I to you?

335
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:46,620
I know that.

336
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:50,020
I'm watching…

337
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:51,020
อก-about Alina.

338
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:55,060
Are we conversation or they're several?

339
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:04,700
What is wrong with you?

340
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:07,100
What is wrong with you two?

341
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:08,300
Fools.

342
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:09,180
I'm coming.

343
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:16,700
What's the time now?

344
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:18,700
1 p.m.

345
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:20,900
Yes.

346
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:26,380
Will you give the letter to me?

347
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,620
You'll know how many times I've told you.

348
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:31,860
I'm worried that someone will worry about me.

349
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:35,340
But the letter is not for the public.

350
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:36,220
What are you afraid of?

351
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:37,940
You've been with AXu for a long time.

352
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,500
And you want to kill him?

353
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:42,900
Lord Zhang can speak ill of you.

354
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:45,660
It seems that you need to stay here for a few days.

355
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:46,660
Don't worry.

356
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:49,660
AXu.

357
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:52,740
Why are you here?

358
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:02,460
Miss Yun, you're not well.

359
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:05,180
Did you hurt your hand?

360
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:09,140
But I'm fine.

361
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:12,340
Lord Shu'er.

362
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:16,500
No matter what situation you encounter,

363
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:18,140
you can't risk it.

364
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:19,820
But I'm a man.

365
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:21,860
I'll protect you.

366
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:23,460
I'm a good man.

367
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:25,140
I'll protect you.

368
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:33,900
Miss Yun, do you think

369
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,300
I'm a man?

370
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:39,340
You saved me and protected me

371
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:42,620
when I was in the capital.

372
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,500
I can't help you.

373
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:46,900
I'm a man.

374
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:49,660
No.

375
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:51,500
People are different.

376
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,620
Lord Shu'er is kind.

377
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:55,580
He's not bad.

378
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:58,740
He's a good man.

379
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,900
We need to go to Changbun.

380
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:08,380
I'm a good man.

381
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:13,700
You're a man.

382
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:17,460
I'm a man.

383
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,500
Lord Shu'er can't be a man.

384
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:22,860
He's a good man.

385
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,740
I'm a good man.

386
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:29,660
I know the way to the Black Death Pavilion.

387
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:33,380
I know where it is.

388
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:35,020
Well, it doesn't matter.

389
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,060
Open you mouth,

390
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:36,980
it's not like you will be fooled.

391
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,380
It was true that

392
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:40,920
even the Puppy's

393
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,940
gossips its beauty and appearance.

394
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:46,340
We beauties,

395
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,320
MAN themselves special

396
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,960
dress of gold tiles,

397
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:51,320
won't be able

398
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:53,420
to be相-화.

399
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:54,220
Wha –

400
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:55,020
Goddess of estou傳

401
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,180
will to our Zhigong

402
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,080
a beauty for all

403
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:00,140
its breadth of beauty is quarrel Woven,

404
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:02,900
Sekyo than the Guibao's mushroomSHi,

405
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,900
Sorry. Sorry.

406
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:08,900
Be careful!

407
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,900
The car is broken.

408
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:25,900
I'm sure it's safe.

409
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:27,900
If it falls,

410
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,900
I'm afraid it will hurt.

411
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,900
I'm afraid it will hurt.

412
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,900
We are like a thousand mountains and thousands of rivers.

413
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:45,900
We are like a army.

414
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:49,900
We are like a sea of clouds.

415
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:53,900
Second Young Master,

416
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:55,900
you are not talking to me.

417
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:58,900
I'm sorry.

418
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:00,900
It's okay.

419
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:01,900
I don't understand.

420
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,900
But I've heard a lot of words from Wenzhou.

421
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:06,900
It's interesting.

422
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:09,900
I hope

423
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:12,900
this road can be forever.

424
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:14,900
Then what?

425
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:16,900
We are not tired.

426
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:17,900
We should be tired too.

427
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:18,900
Go.

428
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:29,900
Be careful, my dear.

429
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:31,900
Be careful.

430
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:33,900
We are not tired.

431
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:37,900
We are not tired.

432
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:39,900
We are not tired.

433
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:49,900
Miss.

434
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:50,900
Come in.

435
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:01,900
Miss.

436
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:05,900
I didn't find the news of Prince Zhang in the study.

437
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,900
They just went out to steal it.

438
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:09,900
But

439
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:10,900
our men were taken.

440
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:12,900
I didn't do anything wrong.

441
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:13,900
It's your fault.

442
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:14,900
I didn't do anything wrong.

443
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:16,900
I didn't want to see the public

444
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,900
not being allowed to stay in the Su family.

445
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:19,900
Yes.

446
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:21,900
But I think it's strange.

447
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,900
Even if Shuhan Lian found someone was burning,

448
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:26,900
I don't know why they are all so big.

449
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:28,900
We are suspicious.

450
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:30,900
No.

451
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,900
Is it because of the East?

452
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:45,900
It's been an hour.

453
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:47,900
Why is she still not back?

454
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:53,900
Miss.

455
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:55,900
Are you still in there?

456
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:56,900
Miss.

457
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:58,900
I've been here all the time.

458
00:27:58,900 --> 00:27:59,900
I didn't see them go out for a while.

459
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,900
Is there any movement inside?

460
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:03,900
Are they

461
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,900
I heard a lot of sounds.

462
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:13,900
Prince.

463
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:15,900
Miss He.

464
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:17,900
Prince.

465
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:19,900
What's wrong?

466
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:21,900
I'm sorry.

467
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:23,900
I'm sorry.

468
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:25,900
I'm sorry.

469
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:27,900
I'm sorry.

470
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:29,900
I'm sorry.

471
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:31,900
I'm sorry.

472
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:32,900
Prince.

473
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:39,900
Prince.

474
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:45,900
Prince.

475
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:03,900
Prince, I'm sorry.

476
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:07,900
I didn't see the girl just now.

477
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:09,900
You're worried that Prince will be safe.

478
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:11,900
That's why you're here.

479
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:17,900
Miss He.

480
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:19,900
What's wrong?

481
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:28,900
This is a problem.

482
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,900
Boss Su should ask himself.

483
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:34,900
I've been waiting for you.

484
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:36,900
Boss Su.

485
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:40,900
Why are you here?

486
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:49,900
Last time, I invited you to the Fairy Palace.

487
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:51,900
But I have something to do.

488
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,900
I haven't come to the Emperor's Mansion.

489
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,900
I'm thinking that I can introduce you to the Emperor

490
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:57,900
in the mansion.

491
00:29:58,900 --> 00:29:59,900
I'm sorry.

492
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:01,900
Who would have thought that

493
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,900
I would be here now

494
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:05,900
if I made a mistake.

495
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:11,900
Miss He.

496
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:12,900
I didn't know that

497
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,900
you and the Emperor had a misunderstanding.

498
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,900
It's better that we don't have a misunderstanding.

499
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:30,900
Thank you, Prince.

500
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:33,900
I just want that

501
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,900
we can live together forever.

502
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:37,900
Prince is pregnant with the queen.

503
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:40,900
He can't give me a single soul.

504
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:46,900
We can only be friends.

505
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:48,900
I hope you'll forgive me.

506
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:50,900
Miss He.

507
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:52,900
Miss He, you're so lucky.

508
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:56,900
I respect your decision.

509
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:58,900
I'm leaving.

510
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:01,900
I'm leaving.

511
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:03,900
I'll be home soon.

512
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:06,900
Boss Su, please forgive me tonight.

513
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:10,900
I'll be waiting at the door again.

514
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:21,900
Miss Su.

515
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:23,900
Anything else?

516
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:25,900
No.

517
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:27,900
Please rest well, Prince.

518
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:31,980
Red Aleksandr Mehko?

519
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:49,500
Mr. Birdman Marriott,

520
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:53,220
welcome.

521
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:00,900
I'll do it.

522
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:11,900
How is it?

523
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:12,900
Did you see the master?

524
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:14,900
I've checked your background.

525
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,900
Whether it's the search for the Su family or the Zou Si family,

526
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:20,900
we must find out the truth.

527
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:22,900
With the Su family's methods,

528
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:24,900
if we find out your true identity,

529
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:26,900
we'll kill you.

530
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:33,900
Now, there are business and business partners.

531
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:36,900
It's not right to blame the master for the misdeeds.

532
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:39,900
But I think he's just trying to find the truth.

533
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:42,900
The master behind the truth is suspicious.

534
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:45,900
The Su family will hold a auction tomorrow.

535
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:48,900
I haven't found out the truth yet.

536
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:50,900
After I find out the truth,

537
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:53,900
I'll find out the truth and kill you.

538
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:01,900
I'll find out the truth.

539
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:07,900
Ah Tan,

540
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:11,900
I've never thought that I'd be so sad.

541
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:15,900
I really want to meet you and protect you.

542
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:19,900
I'm worried that you'll be in danger if you keep looking.

543
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:20,900
Actually, you don't know.

544
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,900
I have my own way to investigate this case.

545
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:26,900
I'll find out the truth and kill you.

546
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:31,900
The Su family has been arrested for a long time.

547
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:33,900
But why hasn't the husband left?

548
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:37,900
The husband stays in Linzhou City.

549
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:38,900
The Su family will be in danger.

550
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:41,900
But the husband is in the court.

551
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:43,900
He's not going to leave.

552
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:45,900
He's not going to leave.

553
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:47,900
He's not going to leave.

554
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,900
But why hasn't the husband left

555
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:54,900
for the imperial court and the Ming family?

556
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:58,900
I don't want you to suffer this.

557
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:01,900
I'm here.

558
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:03,900
Maybe you'll be in danger.

559
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:13,900
We're husband and wife.

560
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:15,900
We should be together.

561
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:18,900
Isn't that right?

562
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:31,900
No matter how shit it is,

563
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:33,900
I will walk with you.

564
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:46,900
My Prince.

565
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:49,500
Thank God!

566
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:52,800
You Bun!

567
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:55,460
My family's government can't make that sound!

568
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,880
What does a couldn't be in our house?

569
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:06,000
The jail, seela heMac Upward?

570
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:13,920
Yes, I was so disappointed because of the driving jam,

571
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:17,520
that he knew how to fire a brake,

572
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,940
This is the place for both of you.

573
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:20,680
For you...

574
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,480
what is true?

575
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:25,440
I suppose you're facing the issue.

576
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,120
I would like to turn you into...

577
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,280
my own wedded ;)

578
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:34,160
She doesn't even know where by gift.

579
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,800
It's a relief that you won't be given away anyway.

580
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:42,280
here's some food for girls.

581
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:47,420
There was something wrong with Su.

582
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,320
I'm ordered to protect Prince Shu's safety.

583
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,120
I think they did something wrong

584
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,880
to upset Prince Shu.

585
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,720
You can't protect yourself

586
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:58,920
without such a skill.

587
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,440
How can you protect others?

588
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,640
The Su family should protect the Su family.

589
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,160
Prince Shu and Prince Shu

590
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,560
are self-sufficient.

591
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:07,760
Thank you for your concern.

592
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:11,200
Goodbye.

593
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,000
Go on.

594
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:20,520
Go on.

595
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,400
Have a seat.

596
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,880
Aren't you doing the work?

597
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:28,560
Miss Yi'er,

598
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,000
here's your instruction.

599
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:42,280
Your Highness Dingbei is now in Lingzhou City.

600
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:45,560
If we don't כ page,

601
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:46,940
It's because of a man in the army

602
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:48,700
Yeentarue stepped in

603
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:51,840
Theperots對不起 for the other

604
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:54,440
The meters are long

605
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:57,280
Miss Zhang might be with someone

606
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:00,160
Last night his game was bearing

607
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:03,060
So we deleted the message

608
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:05,860
I'm sure Zhang Huayu is still alive.

609
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:08,060
He still has the evidence.

610
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:12,660
I'll send someone to investigate the case in the city of Lingzhu.

611
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:18,380
It seems Jiang Xu won't be able to handle it.

612
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:24,180
He has decided to investigate the case.

613
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:26,780
He wants us to stay in the same place.

614
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:29,700
We have to find Zhang Huayu.

615
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:33,900
I can't keep this man in the mansion.

616
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:35,620
Yes.

617
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:38,820
But how should we do it?

618
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:40,660
Please, Miss.

619
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:46,180
Although I've sent an assistant,

620
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:50,380
if I can pay the money with one move,

621
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:52,780
why bother to interfere?

622
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:56,740
Go to the meeting room and find Qingyuan.

623
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:58,460
She knows what to do.

624
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:00,260
Yes.

625
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:26,980
Your Highness, please.

626
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:28,980
Greetings, Your Highness.

627
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:31,580
Zina?

628
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:33,300
Zina?

629
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:33,900
Zina?

630
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:45,900
Noble Lady Wang, you're here.

631
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:47,020
This way, please.

632
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:49,180
Li Yuwen,

633
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:50,380
this way, please.

634
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:52,640
Boss Ross,

635
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:53,540
I've issued anther~~

636
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:55,780
olence 얼마

637
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:01,540
Good. It's rare to come here.

638
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:02,940
You must return safely.

639
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:03,740
Good.

640
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:04,340
Old position.

641
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:04,940
Good.

642
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:08,380
Mrs. Li.

643
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:09,940
Mr. Su.

644
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:14,420
How was your blood test last time?

645
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:15,580
Not bad.

646
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:17,740
If it's not enough, go to my house and get it.

647
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:20,540
Mr. Su, you're so thoughtful.

648
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:26,860
Mrs. Feng.

649
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:28,100
Mr. Su.

650
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:32,340
I'm sorry for the dirty work.

651
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:35,020
I'm sorry for the special present for you.

652
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:36,140
I arranged it in advance.

653
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:38,980
It's none of your business.

654
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:40,260
I know it.

655
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:41,860
Thank you, Mr. Su.

656
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:43,500
You always remember me.

657
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:45,220
You made me open my eyes.

658
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:46,820
You even gave me money.

659
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:48,140
I've got a lot of money.

660
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:50,020
I wish you

661
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:52,140
a happy life today.

662
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:53,580
Thank you, Mr. Su.

663
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:00,620
Come on.

664
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:01,660
Come and see.

665
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:02,460
Miss.

666
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:03,180
Yes.

667
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:04,700
How is Qingyu?

668
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:05,780
Don't worry, Miss.

669
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:07,380
I've arranged everything.

670
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:08,900
I'll take Yu'er to the palace.

671
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:13,820
You go there and watch.

672
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:16,220
You must get it today.

673
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:17,980
Don't make any mistakes.

674
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:19,140
Yes.

675
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:24,700
Look at Qingyu.

676
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:26,020
She must have a baby.

677
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:26,620
Yes.

678
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,300
She looks like a baby.

679
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:31,460
But it's not for the parent Martha.

680
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:32,260
It's not her.

681
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:38,500
You made me leave.

682
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:42,300
You weren't my child,

683
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:43,380
you wanted to spread it.

684
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:45,220
You know how I am.

685
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:47,660
I know no one in the world

686
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:49,180
hears my voice,

687
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:51,620
only I know distances.

688
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:54,980
In recoveringے I woke up in an storing place.

689
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:57,100
I was a bit up there,

690
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:59,420
and added a little trick from before.

691
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:00,860
I'm sorry, Miss Xiao.

692
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:03,700
I'll be back in a minute.

693
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:05,700
If Miss Xiao is interested,

694
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:07,700
I'll sing for you.

695
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:10,700
It's a serious matter.

696
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:14,700
I'll tell Boss Su about it.

697
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:15,700
I'll let him know.

698
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:16,700
It's not a problem.

699
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:19,700
Thank you for your kindness.

700
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:22,700
If you really like him,

701
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:24,700
I'll be happy to help you.

702
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:26,700
I'll be happy to help you.

703
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:27,700
I'll be happy to help you.

704
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:29,700
If you really like him,

705
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:31,700
I'll be happy to help you.

706
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:33,700
But,

707
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:35,700
singing is not easy.

708
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:38,700
It's not easy for a man to be a man.

709
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:40,700
It's easy for a man to be a man.

710
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:42,700
It's easy for a man to be a man.

711
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:45,700
Miss Xiao is really different from others.

712
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:51,700
This is Mr. Nen Wen's special work.

713
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:55,700
I heard that he's going to give a special friend a home-court.

714
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:57,700
I'm curious to see.

715
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:59,700
I don't want to see Miss He.

716
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:06,700
Your Highness,

717
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:08,700
I'm a woman of honor.

718
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:10,700
I'm a woman of honor.

719
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:11,700
I'm sorry!

720
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:36,700
Master Yin has always wanted to have a time-lapse

721
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:37,700
and have a treat with you.

722
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:39,700
I've been thinking about it for a long time.

723
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:41,700
I've met the prince today.

724
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:43,700
I'm going to try to make it quick.

725
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:52,700
Uncle Shi has been in a hurry for years.

726
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:55,700
He's been in a hurry for a long time.

727
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:57,700
I may have a gun,

728
00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:00,700
but I'm still in a hurry.

729
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:02,700
I'm going to try to make it quick.

730
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:04,700
I'm going to try to make it quick.

731
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:06,700
Although I've been in a hurry,

732
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:10,700
I still have to make it quick.

733
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:13,700
I hope you can take the time to make it quick.

734
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:16,700
I hope you can take the time to make it quick.

735
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:18,700
I hope you can take the time to make it quick.

736
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:20,700
Yes.

737
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:32,700
Uncle Shi has been in a hurry for a long time.

738
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:34,700
As long as you can make it quick,

739
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:36,700
I'll do my best to cooperate with you.

740
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:38,700
I'll do my best to make it quick.

741
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:42,700
I'll do my best to make it quick.

742
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:05,700
Prince, what's the meaning of this?

743
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:09,700
This is the punishment for fighting and waiting for the crime.

744
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:12,700
It's true that you're the emperor.

745
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:15,700
If you want to punish the Su family

746
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:18,700
and show your loyalty to the court,

747
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:22,700
you can leave Uncle Shi alone.

748
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:40,700
The weight of the house is in your hands.

749
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:44,700
The secret is in your hands.

750
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:48,700
I'm willing to be safe in the night.

751
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:56,700
The path is free from the past.

752
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:06,700
I'm left behind in the painting.

753
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:11,700
The face of the light will shine.

754
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:19,700
The hope in my heart is in your hands.

755
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:23,700
The light is the light of my future.

756
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:27,700
I'll come to you with my life.

757
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:29,700
The night is long.

758
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:35,700
Who is with me?

759
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:43,700
Is it too much or you?

760
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:54,700
Don't be afraid that I'll follow you.

761
00:46:57,700 --> 00:47:06,700
The End
