[Episode 9]

3
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,440
Last night,

4
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:38,360
some Haiyuo Sect members

5
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,039
tried to capture Tan.

6
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:50,380
What was that about?

7
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:53,170
Luckily, Prince of Dingbei saved her.

8
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:55,350
She was just a bit frightened.

9
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:57,120
So many twists

10
00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:00,770
and turns in her wedding day.

11
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,200
During the ceremony,

12
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,840
why did your wife

13
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:08,770
lift Tan's outer skirt?

14
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:14,740
Hey, you.

15
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:16,940
What are you suspicious of?

16
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:21,310
Donâ€™t you know how we treat

17
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:22,660
Tan?

18
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:24,460
We just hated the idea

19
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,120
of Tan marrying

20
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,750
Prince of Dingbei.

21
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,860
I treasure Tan as well.

22
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:35,240
How could I see her marry the wrong man?

23
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,400
Prince of Dingbei is overbearing.

24
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:39,360
He has

25
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,280
antagonized many officials.

26
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,600
Tan got in danger this time

27
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,320
also because of him!

28
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:49,160
If you had discussed with me

29
00:02:49,579 --> 00:02:51,380
about Tan's marriage,

30
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,220
things would've been different.

31
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:01,200
The root cause of the incident

32
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,880
is that some people are upset about

33
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,010
this marriage decided by the royalty.

34
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:09,160
They should've directed

35
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,600
their anger at me!

36
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,680
Tan is just a young girl.

37
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:16,440
What could she possibly do?

38
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:20,200
She is completely innocent!

39
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,410
I can't drink anymore.

40
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:51,160

41
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:08,960
Sir.

42

Gu Wenyan was kidnapped.

43
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:13,200
Now,

44
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:14,430
he is missing.

45
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,440
Suxin!

46
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,520

-Your Highness.
-Your Highness.

00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,690
Where is the prince?

49
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,000
Your Highnesses are supposed to

50
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,400
go to the palace to thank the royalty today.

51
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,480
The prince already left at dawn.

52
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:14,560
So early?

53
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:16,800
Yeah.

54
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:18,720
Urgent though military affairs might be,

55
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,780
His Highness shouldn't have left you

56
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:23,320
alone on your wedding night.

57
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,000
If word gets out,

58
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,200
My Lady, you will

59
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,320
be humiliated.

60
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:29,560
We should call

61
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,650
the princess "Your Highness" now.

62
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:38,960
I know you two think this is unfair to me.

63
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,440
But the prince manages an important army.

64
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,970
He is certainly busy with all sorts of issues.

65
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,090
Now that I'm married to him,

66
00:05:47,159 --> 00:05:49,960
I should show some understanding.

67
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,480

At this point,

75
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,860
do you still not know what is going on?

76
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,900

has been found in Wang's Village.

the money there?

It's a good thing
that there isn't any female.

the servants male?

93

Mr. Fu, forgo the formalities.

The prince has finally got married.

just let me know.

103
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,680
I'm wondering

104
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,220
why everyone

105
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:51,650
in the mansion is male.

106
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:53,550
Is it the prince's order?

107
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:54,500
Your Highness,

108
00:07:54,909 --> 00:07:56,180
we used to hire

109
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,800
male servants only.

110
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,480
But since Your Highness lives here now,

111
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,640
His Highness has

112
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,440
told me to recruit a number of

113
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,480
women servants.

114
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,500
I have indeed selected some.

115
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:07,850
Your Highness will

116
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:09,150
see them soon.

117
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:12,940
Come up here. Meet Her Highness!

00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:25,100
-Greetings, Your Highness.
-Greetings, Your Highness.

119
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:28,320
As the prince said,

120
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,620
servants must be diligent, considerate

121
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:31,700
and meticulous.

122
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:33,059
These people I chose are

His Highness's instructions.

130
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,920
His Highness cares about everything

concerning Your Highness.

132
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:53,720
Certainly, I need to

133
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,660
make proper arrangements for Your Highness,

134
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,860
so as to set His Highness at ease, right?

135
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,020
Your Highness,

136
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,480
you're a noble lady whose father

137
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,720
is Marquis of Qing'an.

138

[Qi'an Hall]

142

to bring comfort to Your Highness's life.

00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,780
I'm grateful for that.

144
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,600
Well,

145
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,900
when will the prince come back today?

146
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,290
I can't go without him to the palace

147
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,800
to thank the royalty, right?

148
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,560
Don't worry, Your Highness.

149
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:24,680
His Highness has sent

150
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,600
a message to the palace,

151
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,120
asking to postpone the meeting

152
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,640
to tomorrow.

153
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,900
His Highness said

154
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:33,130
Your Highness could do whatever

155
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,280
you'd like here.

156
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,210
If you are to go out,

157
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:36,570
bring the guards along.

158
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,920
When does the prince usually come home?

159
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,200
Well, I can't give an exact answer.

160
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,640
When the prince gets busy,

161
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,300
the time of his return varies.

162
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,740
The prince used to be alone.

163
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,520
He barely cared for himself.

164
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,890
But don't worry, Mr. Fu.

165
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,720
Things are different now.

166
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,200
I will take good care of the prince.

167
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,920
His Highness is so blessed

168
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,840
to have you as his wife.

169
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,800
Mr. Fu, didn't you say

170
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,960
there had been no female in the mansion before?

171
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,080
Why is there a swing here?

172
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,920
Is it because the prince acts like a child

173
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:23,070
in private, though he appears tough?

174
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:25,080
His Highness is always stern and strict

175
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:25,930
with himself.

176
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:27,750
Why would he play this?

177
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:29,400
His Highness particularly built

178
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,320
this swing for Your Highness.

179
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:33,960
The prince personally installed

180
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,280
each joint

181
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,360
and bamboo nail on it.

182
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:38,780
His Highness thought

183
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:41,420
this swing could bring

184
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:42,930
Your Highness more fun

185
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:44,750
in the mansion.

186
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,480
His Highness is usually busy,

187
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,560
but he still spent time

188
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,760
building this swing.

189
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:50,790
Your Highness, would you like a try?

190
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:56,620
Careful, Your Highness.

191
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,460
Your Highness,

192
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,320
these two shops are owned

193
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,320
by the prince,

194
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,560
along with two farmsteads

195
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,560
and three villas.

196
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,520
I have sorted out

197
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,480
the ledgers.

198
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:18,160
[Ledgers of Jinxiu Workshop]

199
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,450
Please take a look, Your Highness.

200
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,680
You've done a good job

201
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,200
managing the mansion.

202
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,580
It is more appropriate

203
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,320
for you

204
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,790
to continue keeping

205
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:25,860
the books.

206
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,400
If you need my help,

207
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,080
just let me know.

208
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,520
I'm so ashamed.

209
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,920
Cuojin Pavilion and Jinxiu Workshop

210
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,050
haven't made any progress

211
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:36,490
in the past two years.

212
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:38,450
After paying for each month's expenses,

213
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:39,990
only a thin margin of profit is left.

214
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:41,120
The less important shops

215
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,590
in the capital

216
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,000
are actually doing better.

217
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,360
I'm such an inept

218
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:47,110
business operator.

219
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,840
I'm at the end of my wits.

220
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,040
I used to often shop in

221
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,880
Cuojin Pavilion and Jinxiu Workshop.

222
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,240
They sell high-quality

223
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,280
jewelry

224
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,880
and garments.

225
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,600
But due to steep costs,

226
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,650
their products are highly priced.

227
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,680
So, they don't have a solid customer base.

228
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:17,010
We need to come up with a special solution.

229
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,960
I've realized from my experience

230
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,360
that many customers prefer
niche and exquisite products

231
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,360
whose high prices match their value.

232
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,720
Therefore, we can

233
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,130
sell one-of-a-kind items

234
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:27,690
and premium products.

235
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,240
I believe

236
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,920
the noble ladies in the capital

237
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,190
will gladly pay for

238
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,820
unique products.

239
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,510
What a brilliant idea!

240
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:38,270
I racked my brains but still

241
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,460
couldn't figure it out.

242
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:40,920
Your Highness immediately

243
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:41,600
pointed out

244
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,920
the problems of these shops.

245
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,560
His Highness is so lucky

246
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,440
to be married to Your Highness!

247
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:47,370
The business

248
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:48,820
will surely grow enormously

249
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:50,900
with you operating the shops!

250
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:57,920
Oh, right, Mr. Fu.

251
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:58,960
What are

252
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,580
the prince's preferences

253
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:02,310
and taboos?

254
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:04,500
I'd like to know more about him.

255
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,800
Your Highness,

256
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:07,720
this is His Highness's

257
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,640
personal servant,

258
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,640
named Chai Gui.

259
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,960
Greetings, Your Highness.

260
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:12,550
[A servant in Prince of Dingbei's Mansion]
[Chai Gui]

261
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,960
Until the prince went to the north,

262
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,880
he used to be taken care of by Gui.

263
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,280
Gui even knows more about

264
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,940
the prince's habits than I do.

265
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,180
Your Highness,

266
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,920
the prince dislikes noises,

267
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:22,920
so there aren't many servants in the mansion.

268
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,280
He strictly disciplines us,

269
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,320
and has no tolerance for misconduct.

270
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,150
During the long time he spent in the north,

271
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:29,530
the prince enjoyed the barbecued lamb

272
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:30,720
and sour rose cheese there.

273
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,080
He's been missing those since he came back.

274
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,250
However, the sour rose cheese

275
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:35,640
is exclusive to the north.

276
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,720
The prince finds none of the sour cheese

277
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,180
we've bought satisfying,

278
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,360
except for

279
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,750
a certain shop's cheese

280
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,400
in Changping Market.

281
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,520
Whether your son will live or die

282
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,440
depends on the content

283
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:53,920
and timing

284
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,760
of your confession.

285
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,640
Seize your time.

286
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:04,210
I can't guarantee what will happen to him.

287
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:33,940
I want to see my daughter.

288
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,810
After that,

289
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:46,320
I'll tell you everything I know.

290
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,070
I finally have some

291
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:00,610
free time to shop around.

292
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,360
I wonder what snacks

293
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,040
are popular now.

294
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,140
I know.

295
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,150
Sanliu Restaurant launched a new dessert.

296
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,360
Xihe Candied Fruits

297
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,760
is promoting crystal-like candied apricots.

298
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,160
Plus, the tea house Your Highness frequent

299
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,160
has a hit product now.

300
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,050
It is said to be

301
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:19,920
quite different from the roasted tea

302
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,080
that the nobles usually like.

303
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:21,960
Take a look!

304
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,160
Buy them all then.

305
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:24,820
Yes.

306
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:26,560
All?

307
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:27,960
Hold on.

308
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:30,240
In Changping Market,

309
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:31,830
there is an old cheese shop.

310
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,930
You go there to buy some fresh cheese.

311
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:36,590
Chai Gui said the prince likes the cheese there.

312
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,440
Got it.

313
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,920
Sugary hawthorn berries on a stick!

314
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,320
Are the snacks

315
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,180
all for His Highness?

316
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,360
I'll take this.

317
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:51,470
One copper coin.

318
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:52,690
Here you are.

319
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:56,920
He has saved my life several times,

320
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:59,110
yet I haven't expressed my gratitude.

321
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,600
It's only polite to thank him.

322
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:05,960
Though our marriage is based on a contract,

323
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,800
we're husband and wife now.

324
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,430
He's always busy.

325
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,780
He has helped me and the Ming family a lot.

326
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,160
I should fulfill my duty as his wife.

327
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:17,680
What contract?

328
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:18,800
Your Highness is obviously

329
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,260
in love with His Highness.

330
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:24,000
The prince has been in the army for years.

331
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,860
He's probably not a romantic man.

332
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:29,370
Sometimes, it doesn't hurt for women to

333
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:31,330
take the initiative.

334
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:33,480
That's right.

335
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,420
Your Highness!

336
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:36,710
Jiurou?

337
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,530
Greetings, Your Highness.

338
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,850
What are you doing here?

339
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:43,400
[Marquis of Cheng'en's daughter]
[Gu Jiurou]

340
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,400
I came here to meet Your Highness.

341
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,440
Please forgive me

342
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,140
for bothering you.

343
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,880
No need for formalities.

344
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:53,110
How is your family now?

345
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:55,500
Are you and your mother okay?

346
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:57,070
Thank you for asking.

347
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,000
Since my father was arrested,

348
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,400
only Your Highness have

349
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,000
sent us a visitor

350
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,220
and given us money.

351
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,230
Now, my mother and I are fine.

352
00:17:06,849 --> 00:17:07,920
However...

353
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,520
My father asked me to meet him

354
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,560
in the prison.

355
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,960
Your Highness, you know

356
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,200
I'm not his favorite child.

357
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,480
I'm dreaded

358
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:20,140
by the idea of going there alone.

359
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:24,829
Would you do me a favor and accompany

360
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,640
me to the prison?

361
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,560
We are friends.

362
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,100
Of course I'll keep you company.

363
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,760
Many thanks, Your Highness.

364
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,820
You're welcome.

365
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,250
What is going on?

366
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,300
General Shen, you finally came.

367
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:57,480
The princess is paying us a visit.

368
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,480
She has brought food for us.

369
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,120
Get in the line now.

370
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,780
Or no food will be left for you.

371
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:02,280
It's our turn!

372
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:02,820
Move, move, move!

373
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:03,590
Let's go.

374
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,290
Thanks, Your Highness.

375
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,130
Here you are.

376
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,200
A bun for you.

377
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:09,880
Thanks, Your Highness.

378
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,540
-It's a cheese bun.
-Thank you for your service.

379
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,250
Thanks, Your Highness.

380
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,400
Come on, here you are.

381
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,730
Thanks, Your Highness.

382
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,450
Thank you for your service.

383
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:21,640
Take this.

384
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,100
Thanks.

385
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:22,800
Alright.

386
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,130
Thanks, Your Highness.

387
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:24,810
Here you are.

388
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:25,360
Thanks, Your Highness.

389
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:25,920
Hello, General Shen.

390
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:26,400
This is yours.

391
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:26,960
Oh,

392
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,120
aren't you the princess's cousin?

393
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,360
I was wondering who the plate

394
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,240
full of desserts

395
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,200
at the far end was for.

396
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,760
I bet the princess brought it

397
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:33,890
especially for you.

398
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,120
Thanks, Your Highness.

399
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,450
Thanks, Your Highness.

400
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,600
I've been feeling a bit flatulent lately.

401
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,850
I'd better not eat snacks.

402
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:55,000
But I do appreciate Your Highness's kind offer.

403
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:55,640
Goodbye.

404
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,600
Are you really here for snacks?

405
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,100
Your Highness,

406
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,960
all preparation work is done for

407
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,560
tomorrow's military drill.

408
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:10,870
I see.

409
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,160
You may leave now.

410
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:12,840
Yes.

411
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:25,610
General Shen!

412
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:27,280
That's all I have.

413
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,680
Go get your own potion.

414
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,240
It's just a snack.

415
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,420
Don't be so stingy.

416
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:33,620
Have you cleaned the stable yet?

417
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,480
General Shen, tell me.

418
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,160
How did you offend His Highness?

419
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:41,880
When can you

420
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,680
stop cleaning the stable?

421
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,800
Even you've noticed it.

422
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,920
His Highness is

423
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,120
a fair superior.

424
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,040
Tell me.

425
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,700
What on earth did you do wrong?

426
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,720
Tan, you'd better

427
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,220
stay away from this place.

428
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,520
I had to pay a visit today,

429
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,650
or people would have

430
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,160
ridiculous guesses

431
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,120
about us.

432
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:32,340
Yesterday was our wedding day.

433
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,680
Busy though you were,

434
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,440
you shouldn't have left me

435
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,480
alone.

436
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,920
If word gets out,

437
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,840
people will spread rumors about us.

438
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,510
Your reputation hasn't been good

439
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:50,520
in the capital.

440
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,040
Now that we're married,

441
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,170
we've become a team.

442
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,760
Everything I do should be

443
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,570
in your and our family's best interest.

444
00:20:57,570 --> 00:20:59,370
I must salvage your reputation.

445
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,640
The most important thing is

446
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,120
to keep the household harmonious

447
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,180
and our bond tight.

448
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,080
Report!

449
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,360
Come in.

450
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:24,780
Your Highness,

451
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,610
here's news from the north.

452
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,620
We're a loving couple.

453
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:42,920
From now on, I will have

454
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:45,240
breakfast with you every morning.

455
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:51,680
Try the sour cheese.

456
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,520
There's honey in it.

457
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,680
It tastes delicious.

458
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,280
Give me the report.

459
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,320
We're alone here.

460
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,420
You can stop this little show now.

461
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,120
This is not a show.

462
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,640
Then you must be

463
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,160
a natural actress.

464
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,530
How impressive.

465
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,560
-I...
-Don't worry.

466
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,360
I've signed the contract.

467
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,360
I'll do as it says.

468
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,120
I had to leave for an emergency last night.

469
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,030
But from now on,

470
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:32,840
I'll always remember

471
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,970
to protect your pride and reputation,

472
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,560
and to play my role well

473
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:38,020
as a loving husband.

474
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:42,500
I'm talking about romance,

475
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:45,060
but he's rambling on about the contract.

476
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:46,530
Ineffective communication.

477
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:47,660
What a waste of time.

478
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:53,370
Actually, I came here

479
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:54,550
for one more reason.

480
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,920
Marquis of Cheng'en's daughter Gu Jiurou

481
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,250
is a good friend of mine.

482
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,800
She's a timid girl.

483
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,210
Just now, she came and asked me

484
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,920
to accompany her to meet

485
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,200
with her father.

486
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,800
I know her father is in the Capital Garrison.

487
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,560
I thought I should

488
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,020
inform you of my decision.

489
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,120
I assure you

490
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:14,410
I won't interfere with anything.

491
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,680
I'll simply pay a visit with Jiurou.

492
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:17,840
Besides...

493
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,320
I don't know the gravity

494
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,040
of the marquis's crimes.

495
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:24,770
Would you tell me

496
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,070
what will happen to

497
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,560
his family members?

498
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:33,680
Will Jiurou be implicated?

499
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,760
It is not decided yet.

500
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,680
When the marquis is officially convicted,

501
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:41,480
his family will be dealt with
according to the law.

502
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,040
I think you should

503
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,520
go home now.

504
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,920
I will go home too after I finish

505
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,840
my work here.

506
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,640
Well, don't forget to

507
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,210
eat your breakfast in time.

508
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,320
Better fill your stomach

509
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:59,120
before your health gets harmed.

510
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,200
Won't you

511
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,560
walk me out?

512
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:13,620
[Qi'an Hall]

513
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,320
"Go home now.'

514
00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:23,550
"Go home now."

515
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,040
Doesn't it sound

516
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,760
natural and intimate to you?

517
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,520
Initimate?

518
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:34,360
It sounds ordinary.

519
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:36,310
What's special about it?

520
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,600
"Go home now." Where to?

521
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,360
Here, the mansion, of course.

522
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,560
But what does it mean?

523
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:45,000
This mansion is home to the prince and me.

524
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:48,170
What the prince suggested

525
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:51,400
was that I should wait for him at home.

526
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:56,200
He said that to me

527
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,760
as my husband.

528
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:01,270
Is that so?

529
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:02,800
It must be.

530
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,000
An arranged

531
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,520
marriage though this is,

532
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,280
the prince and the princess

533
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:09,050
are truly in love.

534
00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:17,320
But now,

535
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:19,040
I am trapped.

536
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:22,000
That contract is standing in my way.

537
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:23,560
What should I do

538
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,280
to let him know my feelings?

539
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,770
I'm nice to him

540
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:28,950
not because of that contract,

541
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:29,920
but the fact

542
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,880
that he is my husband.

543
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,220
I don't know much

544
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,870
about marriage.

545
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:45,580
You don't know it.

546
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:46,980
Neither do I.

547
00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:48,910
All I know is how to manage a household

548
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:49,900
and servants.

549
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,520
I've never been taught

550
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,480
how to maintain a marriage.

551
00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:02,430
Your Highness.

552
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:07,510
Oh, it's you, Suxin.

553
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:09,380
His Highness has returned.

554
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:10,940
But...

555
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:12,950
He immediately went to the study.

556
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:26,190
Xu.

557
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,730
Greetings, Your Highness.

558
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:34,760
You may rise.

559
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:37,310
What's up?

560
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:46,300
You came home so late.

561
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:47,570
I guess you're hungry.

562
00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:49,690
I've prepared some food for you.

563
00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:55,840
I had this porridge

564
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,120
cooked for you.

565
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:01,350
You made it in person?

566
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,540
Yes.

567
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,360
I instructed the kitchen

568
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:05,040
on the ingredients

569
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,020
and the heat of the stove.

570
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:07,940
I said every detail clearly.

571
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,870
I also went twice to the kitchen

572
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:11,200
to supervise the staff.

573
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:14,680
That means you didn't make it

574
00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:16,230
with your hands, right?

575
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:17,300
Right.

576
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:19,390
Was I supposed to hand-pick

577
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:20,850
the ingredients on my own?

578
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:27,520
You asked me if I did it "in person",

579
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:28,680
not "with my hands."

580
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,080
How is it, Xu?

581
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:36,670
How does it taste?

582
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,480
Silky texture.

583
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,570
Very tasty.

584
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:41,710
Your instructions and supervision

585
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:42,590
have paid off.

586
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,130
It is very late now.

587
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:53,050
After you finish the porridge,

588
00:30:54,050 --> 00:30:55,890
please sleep in Qi'an Hall.

589
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,120
I still have work to do.

590
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:00,940
To avoid disturbing you,

591
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:04,510
I should sleep in the study tonight.

592
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,710
Earlier today, you promised to

593
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:12,920
protect my pride.

594
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,180
Have you forgotten it?

595
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:17,820
This is the second day after our wedding.

596
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:20,290
What will the people here think of me

597
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:21,840
if you sleep

598
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:23,700
in the study tonight?

599
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,840
All my pride

600
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:25,920
and dignity will be

601
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,440
completely shattered.

602
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:33,330
Your work is important.

603
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:35,610
So is my pride.

604
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:37,870
You must come to Qi'an Hall.

605
00:31:58,390 --> 00:31:58,960
You used to

606
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,880
live alone in Qi'an Hall.

607
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:03,090
It seemed too plain to me.

[Wuzi's Art of War]

609
00:32:03,530 --> 00:32:05,330
So, I took the liberty

610
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:07,040
to redecorate this place.

611
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:08,730
Do you like it?

612
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,680
As long as you like it.

613
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,280
I have work to deal with.

614
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:30,480
You may go to bed now.

615
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,240
What a knucklehead.

616
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,440
How can I sleep with such

617
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,320
bright candle light?

618
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:44,830
You can let down

619
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:48,240
these thick curtains

620
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:50,730
to block the candle light.

621
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:02,460
If you are tired,

622
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:04,160
go to bed now.

623
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:12,310
I'm not tired.

I...

625
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,170
I can't fall asleep.

626
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,320
How about

627
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:28,639
I keep you company

628
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:29,840
and talk with you?

Wait...

632
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,500
Why is he sleeping there?

633
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:55,490
Is it because he

634
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:57,000
can't perform in bed?

635
00:38:58,330 --> 00:38:59,400

No, I can't.

638
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:05,040
As a prince and a military leader,

639
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:07,640
he must hate it when his secrets are let out,

640

he'd come back as soon as possible

to go with you to the palace.

00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,000
servants.

696
00:41:42,810 --> 00:41:43,940
Why is he so quiet?

697
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,400
Does he hate

698
00:41:46,450 --> 00:41:48,370
talking to me?

699
00:42:09,690 --> 00:42:10,730
Greetings.

700
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,370
Oh, you came here alone.

701
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,320
Seems about right.

702
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,120
Prince of Dingbei has

703
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:20,040
to go back to the north eventually.

704
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:21,840
It's high time you started

705
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:23,720
getting used to loneliness.

706
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,600
Your Highnesses, this way,

707
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:29,440
please.

708
00:42:35,890 --> 00:42:37,720
I've heard that Prince of Dingbei eat

709
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:39,400
and live with the soldiers in the north.

710
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:40,330
It must be rough.

711
00:42:40,870 --> 00:42:42,350
How lucky you are.

712
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,870
You'll be left alone in his huge mansion,

713
00:42:44,870 --> 00:42:46,350
free and untethered.

714
00:42:49,790 --> 00:42:53,310
[Blessings]

715
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,490
The Empress is here too.

716
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:56,630
Grandmother.

717
00:42:58,220 --> 00:42:59,940
Greetings, Your Majesty.

718
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:02,760
Nice to meet Your Majesty.

719
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:06,120
May Your Majesties

720
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:08,840
good health and the best of luck.

721
00:43:10,270 --> 00:43:11,070
Take a seat.

722
00:43:12,330 --> 00:43:13,650
Thanks, Your Majesty.

723
00:43:13,770 --> 00:43:17,700
[Blessings]

724
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:24,690
That was a close one.

725
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:26,160
The Empress Dowager must

726
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:27,820
have assumed that I didn't know the Empress,

727
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:28,960
so she instructed that servant

728
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:30,760
not to remind me of her presence.

729
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,330
The Empress Dowager got

730
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:33,840
a chance to arrange my marriage,

731
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:35,240
but she lost it in the end.

732
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:37,600
This must be upsetting her.

733
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:39,480
That's why she tried to trick me.

734
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:41,000
She wanted me to make a fool of myself

735
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,440
and to irritate the Empress.
