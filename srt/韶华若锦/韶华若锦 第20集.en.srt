What decent young man
would dare to marry you?

What family's daughter
would willingly marry you?

7
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,170
Someone as noble and dignified as I am,

wrongfully accused for no reason,

00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,400

Go ahead, report this to the authorities.

I'll wait for the officials
to get to the bottom of this.

12

And for you to offer an apology.

And what heart would that be?

21
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,680

clueless in love and blind to emotion.

23

What good is all my studying,

176
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:03,800

177

In the end, it's all empty.

178

If you won't go,

179
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,680
I will!

180
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:16,960
If something happens to you,

181
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,340
what will your parents do?

182
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:19,340
What about Yun Yi?

183
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,120
If something happens to her,

184
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,490
is there anyone in this world who'll care?

185
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,040
Every second we delay

186
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,400
puts her in more danger.

187
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,040
Jiang Qizhi,

188
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:31,340
we don't have time for long deliberations.

189
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:32,800
If you try to stop me again,

190
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:35,420
we are no longer brothers.

191
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,260
Yun Yi's abduction

192
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:51,160
has worried both me and Xu.

193
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,560
But her life is at stake,

194
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,960
we cannot act rashly,

195
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:57,680
or we may endanger her further.

196
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:58,680
If we

197
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,720
charge into the Su family to rescue her,

198
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,080
we'll only alert the enemy.

199
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,440
We have no proof

200
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,300
that Yun Yi is even in their hands.

201
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,520
They might also

202
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,800
kill her to silence her

203
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,180
and destroy the evidence.

204
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,700
I understand you're anxious to save her,

205
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,200
but the more urgent the situation,

206
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,660
the more we must stay calm.

207
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,440
What my husband said earlier
about a careful plan

208
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,440
was not abandoning Yun Yi,

209
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,720
but ensuring everything goes flawlessly.

210
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,320
Let's move.

211
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,450
We ride to Lingzhou overnight.

212
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:45,500
It's still a full night's journey away.

213
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:46,720
The road is rough.

214
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,740
Can your injuries bear the journey?

215
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:58,480
You and Second Young Master Shu
are close friends.

216
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,920
Why hold a grudge

217
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:01,480
over just a few harsh words?

218
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:05,920
Besides,

219
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,080
you're not someone

220
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,740
to be petty or narrow-minded.

221
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,060
After all these years of friendship,

222
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:19,320
he still doesn't understand my thoughts

223
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,530
and treats me like someone heartless.

224
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,530
Then I must have misjudged him.

225
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,680
Second Young Master Shu only
lashed out because he cares too much.

226
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,740
He spoke harshly in a moment of panic,

227
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:29,080
but deep down,

228
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,440
he just wants
to save Yun Yi as soon as possible.

229
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,560
If it were me who had been taken today,

230
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,200
you would be even more anxious

231
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,200
than he is.

232
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:47,440
What are you waiting for?

233
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,820
Aren't you always so capable?

234
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,720
Saving Yun Yi is urgent.

235
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,470
You should be racing there at full speed.

236
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:07,470
Taking a carriage just wastes time.

237
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:14,079
His Highness is saying one thing
and feeling another.

238
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:16,940
Second Young Master Shu,
don't take it personally.

239
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:44,880
Are your injuries serious?

240
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:49,290
What happened
to all that bravado just now?

241
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:56,250
To die nobly
or sacrifice myself for a cause,

243
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:59,370
on me making it to Lingzhou alive first.

244
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:00,760
So now you want to live?

you don't even
realize how childish you are.

00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,240
That's enough.

347
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,360
Let him go.

348
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:34,960
You'll all regret this!

349
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:41,720
Sir, do you have a private room?

350
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,990
I've handed all your belongings

351
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:47,560
to Zhuiying.

352
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:49,730
What do you mean, Tan?

353
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:51,750
Your top priority

354
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:53,040
is to visit the Su family

355
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,570
and find out where Yun Yi is.

356
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:56,870
If I go with you, I'll just be a burden.

357
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:57,930
Besides,

358
00:22:57,950 --> 00:23:00,230
the Su family will surely welcome you.

359
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:01,880
If I stay under their watch,

360
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:04,000
I won't be able to do anything.

361
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:06,240
So I won't go with you.

362
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:08,970
Let's handle things separately.

363
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:10,930
Tan, you plan to

364
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:13,390
investigate the smuggling case first?

365
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:17,240
What's your approach?

366
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,720
Many women in Lingzhou are in business.

367
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,340
So,

368
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,080
I'll pose as a merchant.

369
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:24,880
Understand the enemy,
then understand ourselves.

370
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,560
As for the Princess of Dingbei,

371
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,000
she's frail

372
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,970
and couldn't endure the long journey.

373
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:32,570
She was also frightened
by the attack at Shaxi.

374
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:34,280
So she returned to the capital early.

375
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,280
What do you think?

376
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:39,200
Your Highness have only
been out of the mansion for a few days,

377
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,000
yet you're already
become so wise and thoughtful.

378
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,480
You must rescue Yun Yi.

379
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,160
We will.

380
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,560
Don't worry, Xu.

381
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:54,040
I'll stay at the best inn

382
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,360
in Lingzhou.

383
00:23:57,410 --> 00:24:00,010
The Su family holds power
all across Lingzhou.

384
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,850
It looks peaceful and prosperous,

385
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:02,960
but there are plenty of people

386
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,020
like those we saw earlier
willing to act as their pawns.

387
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:08,690
I'm not at ease with you going alone.

388
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,900
I've already made arrangements.

389
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,020
Zhuiyu will go with me,

390
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:15,480
posing as my bodyguard. Perfectly fitting.

391
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:30,490
Think about it.

392
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:31,640
The Princess of Dingbei

393
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,240
has never been to Lingzhou.

394
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:35,030
Without that identity,

395
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:36,450
I'm actually safer.

396
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:38,290
I'll be careful.

397
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:45,420
Then take care, Your Highness.

398
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:49,080
I'll be waiting for good news from you.

399

What's wrong?

400
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,540
There's old tea mixed in this.

401
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:03,150
But I specifically ordered
a famous local blend.

402
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:04,900
This Yunxian restaurant is

403
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:06,600
one of the best around here.

404
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,930
How could they serve such inferior stuff?

405
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:16,250
Waiter,

406
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:18,530
where do you

407
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:20,150
source your tea?

408
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:21,830
My Lady, how can I help?

409
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,090
Personally, I think it tastes excellent.

410
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:26,520
I was thinking of
taking some home as a souvenir.

411
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:27,440
All our tea

412
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:28,990
comes from Dingsheng Teahouse.

413

Dingsheng is owned by the Su family.

414

They only sell top-tier tea.

415
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:35,270
The one you ordered,
Fangshan Sprout Dew is

416
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:36,550
the finest of them all.

That's a blatant miscarriage of justice

517
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:22,340
and a mockery of Xian's Law.

Ah, so you're the second son

Yet you already knew.

577
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:25,650
The Su family certainly seems

00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:27,780
to wield unchecked power in Lingzhou.

how could we not welcome you properly?

Yes, Your Highness.

to swindle and deceive others?

00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:23,960
I had no idea.

596
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:26,000
Did you ever use the Su family's influence

00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
to help him?

598
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:28,080
I never did.

I wouldn't dare.

A lowly maid,

603
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:35,600
yet you dare let your kin

604
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,200
flaunt the Su family's name,

605
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,660
not only tarnishing our reputation

606
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:40,460
but also offending His Highness?

607

Your Highness must be joking.

613
00:33:55,190 --> 00:33:56,520
This all stems

614
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:59,040
from the Su family's failure
to properly discipline its servants.

615
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:01,040
I thought we must punish her severely

616
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,360
to set an example for others

617
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:04,080
to appease Your Highness.

618
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:06,520
So what you mean is,

619
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,760
this is a family matter,

620
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,440
and I'm making a fuss

621
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:12,080
over nothing?

622
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,679
But the lax governance in Lingzhou,

623
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:18,199
and the offenses
that deserve no leniency,

624
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:20,040
are by no means limited
to the Su family's internal matters.

This man is a local guard of Lingzhou.

627

When His Highness entered the city,

628
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:28,719
he said Lingzhou

629
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:30,159
has its own rules.

630
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:32,969
If you don't pay,
you're breaking the rules.

631
00:34:32,969 --> 00:34:34,400
That's why you can't enter the city.

632
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,800
According to him,

633
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,810
he alone sets the rules at the gate.

634
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:41,170
My Lord, I...

635
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,650
I am guilty.

636
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:47,480
This man

637
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:49,440
throws his weight around

638
00:34:49,949 --> 00:34:52,870
simply by claiming ties to the Su family.

639
00:34:53,659 --> 00:34:56,120
He takes a government salary

640
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:58,400
yet extorts the people,

641
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:01,010
no different from a corrupt official.

642
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,620
I've only been in Lingzhou for half a day,

643

Does Lingzhou

645
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,460
no longer follow the laws of Xian?

646
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,240
Do the people here

647
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,760
know only the Su family
and not the empire?

648
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,560
Your Highness, that's not true.

all stemmed from the lies of these two.

652

The Su family has been wrongly implicated.

653

the damages to the restaurant.

it's usually money or women.

854
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:20,460
It's just that for now,

855
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:21,700
we don't yet know

856
00:43:21,730 --> 00:43:23,260
what his favors or detests.

857
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:25,520
We'll need to put in some effort.

858
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:27,440
Be attentive.

859
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:29,280
Tonight's banquet

860
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:30,840
must go perfectly.

861
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:31,770
Yes, My Lady.

862
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:52,600
The Su family of Lingzhou
truly lives up to its name.

863
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:54,040
Just this one guest room

864
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:55,920
is more luxurious

865
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,200
than my own residence in Qi'an Hall.

866
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,860
I only hope Your Highness
finds it comfortable.

867
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:02,500
Officer Yu, the less scheming you do,

868
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,440
the more at ease I'll be.

869
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:08,400
Forgive me, Your Highness,

870
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,560
I don't know what you're referring to.

871
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:13,850
Why was Young Lord Zhang

872
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:16,440
really killed?
