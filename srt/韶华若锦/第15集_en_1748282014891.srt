00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,440
We are ill inspirational...

5
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:02,480
and force my son to go to the guardhouse.

6
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,480
My son was carried away by the flood.

7
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:06,520
You haven't even found your bodies.

8
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:07,960
forgive my son.

9
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,600
What are you doing?

10
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:11,400
Don't be Dou moron.

11
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:12,060
Don't be a sissy.

12
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:12,800
Don't be a filial son.

13
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,680
Don't be a sectarian brother.

14
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,340
I fuck with you!

15
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:20,880
What are you they!

16
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:21,480
ounced?!

17
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,360
Sir.

18
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:23,240
What are you talking about?

19
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,280
&%$

20
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:29,040
How could he let a girl like this

21
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,640
How could he do this to you?

22
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,080
It's Duke Jing An's doing.

23
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,800
He made our family homeless.

24
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,360
He made my family die.

25
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,840
You're my son's fault.

26
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,000
Calm down.

27
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:38,800
Don't be mad.

28
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,040
You're my son's fault.

29
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:40,760
Calm down.

30
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,240
You're the one who did this.

31
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,360
Calm down.

32
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,040
Your Majesty.

33
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:04,000
The number of refugees in Shangjing has increased.

34
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,600
The King's Office has built a camp.

35
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,720
And set up a camp in the city.

36
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:12,520
But it's not a long-term solution to let the refugees go.

37
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,120
The root cause of the refugees' chaos is Lizhou.

38
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,040
If we don't find a way to bring them back,

39
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,280
the people will only be willing to come back.

40
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,120
It will be a great loss to the court.

41
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,960
Your Majesty.

42
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,600
The Ministry of Revenue has calculated the loss of land, food and livestock.

43
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,200
It's more than 930,000 taels.

44
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,840
But Duke Jing An's disaster relief plan...

45
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,280
has more than 100 people in Lizhou.

46
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,000
The loss is not measured by money.

47
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,800
Your Majesty.

48
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,440
Duke Jing An's disaster relief plan is not good.

49
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,880
It will cause the people to be destroyed and the flood will be even worse.

50
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,360
I think we should take Duke Jing An back to the capital immediately.

51
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,360
I will take Duke Jing An back to the capital.

52
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,040
I will give the people an explanation.

53
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,760
King of the North is here.

54
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,920
Your Majesty, I have ordered the deputy commander of the Revenue...

55
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,640
Shen Yu to come back to Lizhou with Zhang Qian...

56
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,240
and Duke Jing An to come back to the capital.

57
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,600
There is no way to suppress the situation.

58
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,120
Lizhou is in chaos right now.

59
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,920
I have ordered the people of the North to follow the plan.

60
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,560
We can ensure that no one is exposed.

61
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,280
What do you think?

62
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,000
If anything goes wrong, I will take full responsibility.

63
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:45,240
Your Majesty, we need to investigate the disaster relief plan.

64
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,360
But the main task of the court is to solve the flood.

65
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,120
Please send someone to solve the flood immediately.

66
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,120
I will take full responsibility.

67
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,280
You are right, Prime Minister.

68
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,280
Your Majesty, I beg you to send Yang Xilu's deputy commander...

69
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,080
Guo Bing Mao to lead the army to Lizhou immediately.

70
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,840
Yang Xilu's new commander is not yet decided.

71
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:11,680
If such a disaster occurs, I am afraid that the army will be in a panic.

72
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,840
Send Guo Bing Mao to Lizhou immediately.

73
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:16,760
He can help the people with the disaster relief plan.

74
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,720
The two can stabilize the morale of the army.

75
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,520
He will help the emperor to take the whole country.

76
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,520
I agree.

77
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,040
If Prime Minister Guo will not live up to the emperor's expectations...

78
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,800
and stop the disaster in Lizhou,

79
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:30,040
it will also be a serious problem.

80
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:36,920
I order Guo Bing Mao to come to Lizhou immediately.

81
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:40,640
When Lizhou is finished, I will return to the capital.

82
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,760
I'm afraid that you may be in danger on your way back.

83
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,760
The disaster in Lizhou is very strange.

84
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:58,760
I'm afraid that someone is trying to frame me.

85
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:05,760
If that's the case, I'll be glad to help you.

86
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,760
I'll be glad to help you.

87
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,760
Thank you.

88
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,760
I'll find a way to stop the disaster.

89
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,760
Let's go!

90
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,760
My lord!

91
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,760
My lord!

92
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,760
Who are you?

93
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,760
I'm here to save you on behalf of the lord.

94
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,760
Lord?

95
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,760
It's so dangerous in the palace.

96
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,760
If you go back, you'll be in danger.

97
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,760
You'll be killed.

98
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,760
You'll be dead.

99
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,760
You're really a man of the Lord.

100
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,760
I'll be brought here by the army.

101
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,760
You'll be watching me.

102
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,760
How can I sit down?

103
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:47,300
The King's smooth-bòg

104
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,260
I spring it, as you'll say,

105
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:00,760
so do not enter!

106
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:05,760
General Shen Xiao best onwards,

107
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,260
Germanists and выжив!",

108
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:09,260
You must save your life first.

109
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:11,260
Then you can have a future.

110
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:13,260
My Lord.

111
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,260
Where should I go?

112
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:34,260
Over there.

113
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,260
Where are you taking me?

114
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,260
I'm going to meet someone who is in the same camp.

115
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:43,260
Then I'll take you down the mountain.

116
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,260
Wait.

117
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:47,260
My Lord.

118
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:52,260
My Lord is always very determined.

119
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:55,260
He must have already figured out a way to get you down.

120
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:57,260
I'll leave without permission.

121
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:59,260
I'll be punished for my crime.

122
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:01,260
I'll be back.

123
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,260
I'll be back.

124
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:05,260
I'll be back.

125
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:07,060
There may be people

126
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:09,360
watching us on all sides.

127
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,360
I'll stop them again.

128
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,760
There are people

129
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,760
waiting for us to die.

130
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,800
Being shit Может not be allowed and

go ahead

134
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,920

135
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,920

136
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,000
how

137
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Don't worry.

138
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,480
It's not true that the refugees are angry.

139
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,120
Do you have any news, my husband?

140
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,920
I went to the capital and asked around.

141
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,440
They said that you didn't go there today.

142
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,000
But I was too worried.

143
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,320
So I went to the capital and asked around.

144
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,520
You already knew about this yesterday.

145
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,720
You even sent the young master of the Shen family to Lizhou...

146
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,240
to pick up the lord of the lord of the Shen family.

147
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,920
You thought carefully.

148
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,000
You knew that my father was in danger.

149
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,760
You must have taken the right decision.

150
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,400
Now that the Shen family is watching us,

151
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,160
my father will definitely come back safely.

152
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,080
Although my husband is very strict,

153
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,200
he always has a sense of propriety.

154
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,680
There must be some misunderstanding.

155
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:11,840
When my husband comes back to the capital,

156
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,360
he will ask for the truth.

157
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,600
I think it's just a false alarm.

158
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,720
He will be fine.

159
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,960
There must be some misunderstanding.

160
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,480
My father will be fine.

161
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,080
Princess.

162
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,480
Princess.

163
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,560
There are refugees outside the mansion of Marquis Jing'an.

164
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,520
They are arguing that Marquis Jing'an is going to be punished.

165
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,000
I'm on my way to meet the imperial guards when I return.

166
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,720
They said that they wanted to check the mansion of Marquis Jing'an.

167
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,080
Father hasn't made a decision yet.

168
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,760
How can they check the mansion of Marquis Jing'an?

169
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,920
What about the maidservant and the others in the mansion?

170
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:42,840
Is there anything wrong?

171
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,160
I didn't see anything.

172
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,400
No.

173
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,440
I have to go back to the mansion and talk to them.

174
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,240
Be quiet.

175
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,800
These refugees are not only going to be in danger,

176
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,040
but they will definitely make you angry.

177
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,560
Yesterday was a dangerous day.

178
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,960
I'm afraid it's going to be even more dangerous today.

179
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,360
It's better for you not to go out...

180
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,920
in case of any trouble.

181
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,800
There is no one in the mansion.

182
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,560
They will definitely make trouble.

183
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,760
I can't rest assured.

184
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,640
I have to go back.

185
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,760
Tan.

186
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,120
All the things that we need to check

187
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,680
must be transferred to the Dali Temple in Xishu.

188
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,080
Before the Dali Temple is taken over,

189
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,640
you must guard the whole city.

190
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,000
No one is allowed to come near.

191
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,120
Yes.

192
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,800
Commander Luo.

193
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,640
Greetings, Princess.

194
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,120
Thank you.

195
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,680
Commander Luo.

196
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:36,920
Don't worry.

197
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,880
I will not bother you with this matter.

198
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,600
It's the only thing we need to see.

199
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:43,920
That's why,

200
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,880
In case we mess anything up,

201
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,200
we will prevent any troubles.

202
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,120
Commander Luo.

203
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,760
You will be here for half day.

204
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,320
So, when the time comes,

205
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,920
we can have a party below.

206
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,720
I will manage everything.

207
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,920
Your Highness, we are ordered to do this.

208
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,920
No one is allowed to enter.

209
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,920
The imperial guards are ordered to do this.

210
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,920
It's difficult to follow the order.

211
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,920
I don't want to put you in a difficult position.

212
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,920
Can you please help me

213
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,920
to send a few words to the palace?

214
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,920
Please go ahead, Your Highness.

215
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,920
Please tell the maids in the palace

216
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,920
to say

217
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,920
that His Majesty is still a general.

218
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,920
They don't need to panic.

219
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,920
They just need to live their lives.

220
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,920
If in the future...

221
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,920
If in the future the Marquis family

222
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,920
is in trouble,

223
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,920
I will ask the maids to return the body

224
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,920
to the servants.

225
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,920
I will send two more months' salary

226
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,920
to the maids.

227
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,920
Don't let the Ming family take over.

228
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,920
Please rest assured, Your Highness.

229
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,920
I will definitely tell them.

230
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,920
Please give me some water.

231
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:09,920
itt

232
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,920
Let's all get out.

233
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,920
Hurry up!

234
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,920
Go!

235
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:27,920
Let's go.

236
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:29,920
Catch them.

237
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:33,920
What are you doing?

238
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:35,920
Stop fighting.

239
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:36,920
You three can't leave.

240
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,920
They say that King of Dingbei is a man of his own.

241
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:51,920
He kills and steals.

242
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:56,920
Are you trying to use us as a scapegoat?

243
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,920
You are making trouble in front of the Marquis.

244
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,920
Who are you talking about?

245
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,920
It's all because of the wrongful actions of Marquis Jing An.

246
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,920
It's all because of the wrongful actions of Marquis Jing An.

247
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,920
It's all because of the wrongful actions of Marquis Jing An.

248
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,920
Is there no justice in this world?

249
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,920
We are all witnesses.

250
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:14,920
That's right.

251
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:15,920
We are all witnesses.

252
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:16,920
What are you talking about?

253
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,920
King of Dingbei is the son of Marquis Jing An.

254
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,920
No one dares to offend him in the court.

255
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,920
They are just protecting each other.

256
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:23,920
That's right.

257
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:24,920
They are just protecting each other.

258
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:25,920
That's right.

259
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:26,920
They are just protecting each other.

260
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:27,920
They are just protecting each other.

261
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:29,920
What are you talking about?

262
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:30,920
They are all witnesses.

263
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,920
We are all the people of Lizhou.

264
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,920
We are all killed by Marquis Jing An.

265
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,920
Liuli is a noble family.

266
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:39,920
We are going to his mansion to make a statement.

267
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,920
The 31st defending method

268
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,920
awaits temporary victory over Marquis Jing An.

269
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:51,920
The 31st defending method WWE

270
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:57,920
awaits temporary victory over Marquis Jing An.

Why are you all here?

274
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,920
The government of the Qing and Zhao dynasties have settled the refugees.

275
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,920
They have all been registered as the national security.

276
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,920
The Dali Temple has been destroyed overnight.

277
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:20,920
Only three of you are registered as the national security.

278
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,920
We don't know who you are.

279
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,920
I will give you one last chance.

280
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,920
Who are you?

281
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,920
I don't know what you are talking about.

282
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,920
Are you going to beat me?

283
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,920
You need to have a chance to beat me.

284
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,920
Since you don't want to talk, then there is no need to talk.

285
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,920
I will ask you one last time.

286
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:06,920
Say it or not?

287
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:08,920
I will say it.

288
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:09,920
You can't say it.

289
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,920
You will betray me if you say it.

290
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:12,920
I will say it.

291
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:14,920
I will say it.

292
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,920
We are all members of the Haiyou Sect.

293
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,920
But we are just following orders.

294
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:23,920
We are all following orders from the sect leader.

295
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:27,920
As for who is in charge of this matter,

296
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:32,920
we really don't know.

297
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:39,920
General, I have heard from the general.

298
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:40,920
Everything is as expected.

299
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,920
Someone is trying to harm the marquis.

300
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:45,920
But...

301
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:47,920
Say it.

302
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,920
The one who did it is a soldier of the Northern Army.

Take him back to the camp and interrogate him!

310
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:29,840
Yes!

311
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,160
He wants to kill me!

312
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:48,160
Your Majesty, according to the Dali Temple report,

313
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,640
the source of the disaster in Lizhou is clear.

314
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:54,240
Marquis Jing'an is eager to control the disaster.

315
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,880
He has been fighting for the war.

316
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,760
He made a wrong move during the disaster.

317
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,080
The people have been killed.

318
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,480
He will be punished severely.

319
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,600
Please make a decision soon.

320
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,440
We will be at peace with the people.

321
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:13,800
Your Majesty, Marquis Jing'an is not a good commander.

322
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,480
He should be punished.

323
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,880
But he was defeated by Yang Xilu.

324
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,240
He has been defeated many times.

325
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,320
He has been in danger for more than ten years.

326
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,640
Please make a decision soon.

327
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:30,840
I beg you to punish him severely.

328
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:33,680
He will be punished severely.

329
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,680
You are right.

330
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,960
Marquis Jing'an is eager to control the disaster.

331
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,000
He is not lazy.

332
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,960
He is not a good commander.

333
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:52,600
What do you think about the punishment?

334
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,000
Your Majesty, Marquis Jing'an is not a good commander.

335
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
He should be punished severely.

336
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
But if he is defeated by the people,

337
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,240
he will be punished severely.

338
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:08,040
It will make the court feel bad.

339
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:10,600
It will make the soldiers of the border feel sad.

340
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,600
But he is not a good commander.

341
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,000
He will be punished severely.

342
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,560
He will be deported to the capital.

343
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:20,840
He will be deported to Lizhou.

344
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,240
It will make the people feel bad.

345
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:28,840
It will make the people feel bad.

346
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:31,640
I agree with you.

347
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:34,640
I agree with you.

348
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:41,160
I agree with you.

349
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,080
Marquis Jing'an is a bad commander.

350
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,760
He should be punished severely.

351
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:49,120
He should be punished severely.

352
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,200
I don't agree with you.

353
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:58,120
Your Majesty, Marquis Jing'an is a bad commander.

354
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,000
He should be punished severely.

355
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,520
He should be deported to the capital.

356
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,520
He should be punished severely.

357
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,120
I agree with you.

358
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:33,320
There are hundreds of people in Lizhou.

359
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,720
When can I arrive?

360
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,120
Princess, Nanny Zhuang is here.

361
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,920
Princess.

362
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:52,680
The commander of Marquis Jing'an cadested Yiren.

363
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:57,120
He was deported to courses of him .

364
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:01,120
The unity of marquis in the Marquis brothers is stifled.

365
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:11,720
I Olympics sailing between marquis family and servants.

366
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:14,520
It is true.

367
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:18,520
I have served the military Corp.

368
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:21,800
I have no place to go in the Marquis's mansion.

369
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,840
That's why I'm waiting for you.

370
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,360
Please get up, Mengbo.

371
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,080
We are family.

372
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,000
You can stay in the mansion.

373
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,360
Thank you, Your Highness.

374
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,760
People say that...

375
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:43,280
the Marquis died because of the disaster.

376
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,760
He can't admit it.

377
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,200
But I can't believe it.

378
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,000
How can I kill people...

379
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,360
because of the Marquis?

380
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,720
Have you been back to the mansion?

381
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,840
I haven't been back for three days.

382
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,520
Get the carriage ready.

383
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:08,800
Yes.

384
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:17,920
Your Majesty!

385
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,960
Your Majesty, I want to leave.

386
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,360
Lord Jing An Viewisís body was Task Force 5's exit.

387
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,760
He has no remaining contact with the Marquis.

388
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,200
Whether it isn't the Marquis,

389
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,360
his last wish is a fundamental duty for His Majesty.

390
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:50,880
Sab壞ö,

391
00:22:52,600 --> 00:23:13,320
the

392
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,780
Anyone here with evidence?

393
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:19,800
Police?

394
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,960
Anyone here with evidence?

395
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:26,280
You are the one who called them yesterday.

396
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:32,240
Right under my extremity Maskakman's mask,

397
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,760
I discovered some progress relating to peace.

398
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:37,120
We are not surprised because you do this alone.

399
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,820
Because protecting people...

400
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:41,460
because protect others,

401
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:44,260
you just can't even look at the peace that wraps around the body,

402
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:46,220
so do you get it?

403
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,320
But the truth was...

404
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:52,340
the tragedy of Marquis Jin's death already happened...

405
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:56,460
based on the father's segundo skip.

406
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:59,440
However, not all men during that day...

407
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:03,800
were willing to kill their own life before digging out the dead.

408
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:07,520
Therefore, our Minoan let those men...

409
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:08,760
die.

410
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:14,380
The same way, our Jin asset let the American recreate the Executive二溫總統.

411
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:15,740
Do not italian

412
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:16,700
No

413
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:18,380
Obey

414
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,060
Ok

415
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:20,940
Give me a look

416
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:23,180
Did you hear that?

417
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:32,340
Beside haeyou main gate

418
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:34,340
Mei has been raided

419
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:36,900
Luzhou was set a trap

420
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:40,380
They currency is found Hello

421
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:42,260
The fact is

422
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:43,780
But the sen свой

423
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:46,420
Were Jews following Princeın and staying here for years and years.

424
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:47,420
Hurry and check on them.

425
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,460
If there's no reaction, check immediately.

426
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:50,300
Yes sir.

427
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:51,140
Come with me.

428
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:14,300
Do sensei is here again.

429
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:17,720
As long as Su Baozi remains alive,

430
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:22,180
,

431
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:25,780
we won't be able to forego an evening flight again.

432
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:30,620
General Lu, we found something inside.

433
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:42,020
Father, I've found out

434
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:44,860
Don't get too near me.

435
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:02,660
Are you alright?

436
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:05,020
I need you to come with me.

437
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:07,220
Yes.

438
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:08,220
Ok, ok.

439
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:09,220
It's been a long time.

440
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:09,220
My dear.

441
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:17,220
My dear.

442
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:26,220
Do you know why father confessed?

443
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:34,220
It's just that he admitted that he made a mistake.

444
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:37,220
But it doesn't mean that the case of Lizhou is the fault of the moon.

445
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:41,220
Then why did the emperor make a mistake?

446
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:45,220
Why didn't father investigate the truth after returning to the capital?

447
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:51,220
The evidence of this case has been drowned in the flood.

448
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:55,220
And the people of Lizhou are witnesses.

449
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:59,220
If we continue to investigate, it will only cause a public complaint.

450
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:02,220
It's even more unfavorable for the moon.

451
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:06,220
But father is innocent.

452
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:09,220
He must have been framed.

453
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:11,220
The court should not be the master of father.

454
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:13,220
It's the truth.

455
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:31,220
Do you believe me?

456
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:37,220
I remember when I was with the princess.

457
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:45,220
As long as I am here, I will do my best to protect the Ming family.

458
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:06,220
The princess has been sleeping well these days.

459
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:11,220
Go to bed early.

460
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:13,220
It will be dawn in a few hours.

461
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:18,220
When the princess wakes up, we will go to see the moon.

462
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:24,220
Father will be in the capital tomorrow.

463
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:27,220
I will go to see the moon.

464
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:30,220
I will go to see the moon.

465
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:33,220
Father will be in the capital tomorrow.

466
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:43,220
If the moon sees the princess so haggard, she will be worried.

467
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:45,220
I prefer to sleep in peace

468
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:51,220
Don't take the plank, you're hurting yourself.

469
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:02,220
Don't go, mother.

470
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:09,220
Take a good rest these days in my husband's house.

471
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:24,520
Look thatŞ

00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:29,580

Father.

477
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,220
Father.

00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:50,220

00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:53,220
Mother is here to pick you up.

482
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:55,220
Go.

483
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:56,220
Guards.

484
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:57,220
Get the rope.

485
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:58,220
Father.

486
00:30:58,220 --> 00:30:59,220
Go.

487
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:00,220
Go.

488
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:01,220
Go.

489
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:02,220
Go.

490
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:03,220
Go.

491
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:04,220
Go.

492
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:05,220
Go.

493
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:06,220
Go.

494
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:07,220
Go.

495
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:08,220
Go.

496
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:09,220
Go.

497
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:10,220
Go.

498
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:11,220
Go.

499
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:12,220
Go.

500
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:14,220
Father.

501
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:18,220
Okay.

502
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:19,220
Father.

503
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:21,220
Father.

504
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:23,220
Mother.

505
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:25,220
Mother.

506
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:27,220
Mother.

507
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,220
Father.

508
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:31,220
Father.

509
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:32,220
Hurry.

510
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:34,220
Father.

511
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:36,220
Father.

512
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:37,220
Father.

513
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:38,220
Father.

514
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:39,220
Father.

515
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:40,220
Hurry.

516
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:41,220
Father, you have to help me.

517
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:42,220
Father, you have to take care of yourself.

518
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:44,220
This is not what you should see.

519
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:46,220
Go.

520
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:48,220
Father.

521
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:49,220
Go back.

522
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:50,220
Father.

523
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:51,220
Father.

524
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:52,220
Go.

525
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:53,220
Go.

526
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:55,220
Father.

527
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:56,220
Go.

528
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:57,220
Father.

529
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:58,220
Go.

530
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:01,220
Father.

531
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:05,220
Go back.

532
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:08,220
Mother.

533
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:09,220
Mother, look at me.

534
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:10,220
Father.

535
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,220
Mother.

536
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:13,220
Father.

537
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:14,220
Listen.

538
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:18,220
Animals live alone because they can't be redeemed but in bed because they can be saved.

539
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:22,220
If you let me meet you now, I pray that you can help me that I can live though I die.

540
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:28,220
Father, you are always right.

541
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:29,220
Father, what should I do now?

542
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:32,220
Father, don't begency anymore.

543
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:37,220
I will manage everything but you have to suffer in prison.

544
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:38,220
Father.

545
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:39,220
Father.

546
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:40,220
Go.

547
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:41,560
Take this with you.

548
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:11,220
I will go and get it.

549
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:14,220
Oh, right.

550
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:15,220
There is wine and snacks.

551
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:16,220
Go and prepare more.

552
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:17,220
Yes.

553
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:22,220
Zhuiying,

554
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:25,220
I will trouble you to give these to father.

555
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:27,220
If father needs anything,

556
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:28,220
tell him to tell me.

557
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:29,220
I will not cause any trouble.

558
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:31,220
Don't worry, my queen.

559
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:32,220
I will bring them to you.

560
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,220
Oh no, my queen.

561
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,220
My queen, my queen.

562
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:36,220
My queen, my queen.

563
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:37,220
My queen, my queen.

564
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:38,220
My queen, my queen.

565
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:39,220
My queen, my queen.

566
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:40,220
Oh no, my queen.

567
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:41,220
My queen, my queen.

568
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:42,220
Jing Zhao Yin brought people here.

569
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:43,220
He said he was going to send them away.

570
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:48,220
If you don't move,

571
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:49,220
I will punish you.

572
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:55,220
May I ask what did Jing Zhao Yin do?

573
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:57,220
He needs to be searched by the whole family.

574
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:02,220
Jing Zhao Yin is under orders.

575
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:04,220
Please cooperate.

576
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:06,220
My queen, don't worry.

577
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:09,220
The house of Prince Dingbei is safe for now.

578
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:12,220
It is just a search.

579
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:18,220
But we need to check if there is anything wrong.

580
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:20,220
Wait.

581
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:23,220
According to your words,

582
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:26,220
there is no one in the house.

583
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:28,220
And there is no suspicion.

584
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:31,220
Why should the house of Jing Zhao be searched?

585
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:32,220
Since it is a search,

586
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:34,220
what do you want to check?

587
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:35,220
I will order someone to bring it here.

588
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:38,220
I will cooperate.

589
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:42,220
My queen, you are going to fight against the court.

590
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:47,220
You don't have to talk to the court.

591
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:50,220
That post is not a search order.

592
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:53,220
Why should the house of Prince Dingbei not cooperate?

593
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:55,220
The court ordered a search.

594
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:58,220
Jing Zhao Yin will decide what to do.

595
00:34:58,220 --> 00:34:59,220
I said I would search the house.

596
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:01,220
So I have to search the house.

597
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:02,220
If you stop me,

598
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:04,220
you will defy the law and defy the court.

599
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:05,220
Search!

600
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:07,220
Stop!

601
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:16,220
Stop!

602
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:25,220
Jing Zhao's house is a search order.

603
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:27,220
It is reasonable.

604
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:30,220
But what my queen said is not reasonable.

605
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:32,220
I want to ask you.

606
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:35,220
Who is the one you are here to search the house?

607
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:37,220
It is the emperor's order.

608
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:39,220
The lord Jing An is sentenced to life imprisonment.

609
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:41,220
The money of the lord's mansion

610
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:43,220
must be confiscated and confiscated.

611
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:44,220
Last night,

612
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:47,220
the Jin army raided the house of Ming's ancestor.

613
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:49,220
His majesty was furious.

614
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:52,220
Jing Zhao's house is helping the Dali Temple to investigate.

615
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:55,220
The relationship between the lord and the princess

616
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:57,220
is a search order.

617
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:00,220
Li Zhou has been arrested.

618
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:03,220
There is no conclusion about father's crime.

619
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:06,220
And this case is about disaster relief measures.

620
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:08,220
Why do you say such things?

621
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:10,220
The evidence is like a mountain.

622
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:12,220
I am not talking nonsense.

623
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:14,220
I will go to the palace to meet the emperor.

624
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:15,220
I will ask for your help.

625
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:16,220
But

626
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:19,220
the lord's mansion can be searched by anyone.

627
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:28,220
If you go back today,

628
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:30,220
you can report it as truth.

629
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:33,220
I will take all the consequences.

630
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:37,220
Jueying.

631
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:38,220
Yes.

632
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:40,220
Send a message to Shen Yu.

633
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:43,220
Bring a group of men and horses to guard the lord's mansion.

634
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:45,220
If anyone dares to break in,

635
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:46,220
you don't need to report it.

636
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:48,220
Just do it.

637
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:49,220
Yes.

638
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:02,220
Go.

639
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:23,220
Is this case about father's crime?

640
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:25,220
I have sent people to investigate.

641
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:29,220
But there is no one who can prove it.

642
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:32,220
So, is the deputy of the Ministry of Revenue, Liu Mu,

643
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:35,220
a man of the family?

644
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:40,220
Why do you ask?

645
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:43,220
Do you remember

646
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:45,220
when I was in Nanyuhu Street that day,

647
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:47,220
I met deputy of the Ministry of Revenue.

648
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:50,220
The incense he used that day was the same as the one I used to use

649
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:54,220
when I was in Jueying.

650
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:57,220
And the mysterious man who took me to the capital

651
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:59,220
before the wedding.

652
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:02,220
So many coincidences.

653
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:06,220
I think it has something to do with it.

654
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:32,220
Tan'er, sit down.

655
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:34,220
Come and taste.

656
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:36,220
It's all your favorite.

657
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:38,220
Thank you, father.

658
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:41,220
But recently I have been feeling unwell.

659
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:43,220
I don't want to eat anything sweet again.

660
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:46,220
I see.

661
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:47,220
I see.

662
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:48,220
I see.

663
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:49,220
I see.

664
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:50,220
I see.

665
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:51,220
I see.

666
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:52,220
I see.

667
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:53,220
I see.

668
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:54,220
I see.

669
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:55,220
I see.

670
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:56,220
I see.

671
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:57,220
I see.

672
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:58,220
I see.

673
00:38:58,220 --> 00:39:01,220
Does the lemon taste better?

674
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:02,220
It's delicious.

675
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:03,220
It's delicious.

676
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:07,220
So I think I'll bring some cake for your meals on hard break.

677
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:08,760
My Lord.

678
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:13,220
You become thinner.

679
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:16,220
It's a bit harder for you to study hard.

680
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:18,220
This sweet cake will my Lord

681
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:21,220
make you feel better.

682
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:25,220
Father, I'm comfortable with it.

683
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:27,220
I never forget this feeling.

684
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:31,900
I came here because I wanted to save you.

685
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:36,220
I want you to save me from the fire.

686
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:42,940
I've been friends with you for decades.

687
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:45,180
I know you very well.

688
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:49,260
You won't do anything to harm the people or harm the society.

689
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:55,020
What are you doing? Get up.

690
00:39:58,380 --> 00:39:59,180
Don't...

691
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:09,140
Suspicion is an accident.

692
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:11,340
No one wants to see it's gonna happen.

693
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:14,380
THE ADM bepatord even stرك by saving the people.

694
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:16,500
But...

695
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:25,660
Dead possession of a war...

696
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:27,980
is the DN OP ending perexyl zapik.

697
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:29,940
...can't save your father.

698
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:36,540
What do you mean?

699
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:53,540
Duke Jing An.

700
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:56,540
There's no way he could be killed.

701
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:57,940
I don't believe it either.

702
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:00,740
But the evidence is certain.

703
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:03,300
I can't protect him.

704
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:05,420
These are just words of the South Lü family.

705
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:07,820
It can only prove that the South Lü family wants to meet Duke Jing An.

706
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:12,060
How can it prove that he has the right to kill his own father?

707
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:15,620
If it's just a few letters from the South Lü family,

708
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:18,060
it's not enough to prove it.

709
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:23,940
But the Jin Army has found a lot of treasures in the Ming family's ancestral house.

710
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:27,220
Those are all the evidence.

711
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:30,180
It's not the same.

712
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:33,140
The Jin Army has found the treasure.

713
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:34,660
The evidence is certain.

714
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:39,940
It's normal for a woman to be hard to accept.

715
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:42,460
It's impossible.

716
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:46,060
Father would never commit a crime against his father.

717
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:47,540
Father.

718
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:49,460
Father was young and kind.

719
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:50,900
He was full of passion.

720
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:54,020
He only wanted to protect the country and the people.

721
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:55,580
No matter what he did,

722
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:57,980
he never changed his mind.

723
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:02,620
So there is only one truth.

724
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:04,700
But who?

725
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:09,700
He was here in a month.

726
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:14,700
educational battlefield

727
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:23,260
He is fully up lined with the light of his god.

728
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:34,140
the

729
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:37,140
I will leave my father alive.

730
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:39,140
Nonsense!

731
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:42,140
Do you think this is fair?

732
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:48,140
Do you know that the one who really wants to harm your father is your husband, King Dingbei?

733
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:54,140
Your father returned to the capital because King Dingbei asked for you.

734
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:57,140
He sent the King of Dingbei to personally suppress the Lizhou.

735
00:42:57,140 --> 00:42:59,140
Do you know what happened on the way?

736
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:03,140
Yes, the King of Dingbei sent the King of Jing'an to the capital.

737
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:07,140
He was forced to surrender to King of Dingbei.

738
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:11,140
King of Dingbei did this to prove your father's innocence.

739
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:13,140
He wanted to expose himself.

740
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:15,140
This is impossible.

741
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:17,140
Your father's innocence was not proven.

742
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:20,140
King of Dingbei led the army to the mansion of the duke.

743
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:21,140
Why is this?

744
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:24,140
This is clearly a miscommunication.

745
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:28,140
Tan Er, think about it.

746
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:33,140
Since your father's death, what has he done for the Ming family?

747
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:44,140
Father, I don't care about the political struggle, the position and the conspiracy.

748
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:49,140
Power, status, wealth, all of these are not important.

750
00:43:58,140 --> 00:44:00,140
The King of Jing'an is in the court.

751
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:03,140
It is inevitable that he will be involved in this.

752
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:06,140
He chose King of Dingbei as his son-in-law.

753
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:09,140
Isn't it because King of Dingbei is a top candidate

754
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:12,140
that he can lead the Ming family to the top?

755
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:31,140
Father, I don't care about the political struggle.

756
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:33,140
