[Youthful Glory]

00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,880
[Episode 5]

3
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,759
It's you again.

4
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,300
What unfortunate timing.

5
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:46,240
More than unfortunate,

6
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:48,320
it's sworn enemies crossing paths.

7
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,400
Yet you two keep meeting unexpectedly.

8
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,759
There must be some

9
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,120
inexplicable bond.

10
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,280
As the proverb goes, "Stay near vermilion, turn red; stay near ink, turn black."

11
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,479
Shouldn't you fear this association

12
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:01,320
will drown you in scandal?

13
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,960
He's no saint—

14
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,280
he eavesdrops on private conversations

15
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,800
and forever flicks

16
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,000
that pretentious fan

17
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:07,800
about like

18
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,960
some strutting peacock.

19
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,690
You're always waving that fan.

20
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,280
How could I possibly eavesdrop?

21
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,560
You're practically shouting.

22
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,560
It's impossible not to hear you!

23
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,360
Honestly,

24
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,960
you needn't worry about what kind of wife

25
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,120
Second Young Master Shu will take.

26
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,000
It certainly won't be

27
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,720
a rude, unreasonable,

28
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,520
domineering shrew like you!

29
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:26,000
Who I am is beyond

30
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,120
the judgment of

31
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,680
a petty, frivolous dandy like you!

32
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,440
Besides,

33
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,680
I'm not

34
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,880
speaking for myself.

35
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,560
I'm thinking of our Tan

36
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,840
is gentle and refined, learned in classics and decorum,

37
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,600
with peerless grace and talent.

38
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,400
She and Second Young Master Shu would make a well-matched pair.

39
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,660
You're exaggerating.

40
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,329
Does Miss Ming fancy Second Young Master Shu?

41
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,720
Whether I fancy him or not

42
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,800
is none of your concern.

43
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,360
All I wish is that we never

44
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,760
cross paths again—no ties, no encounters.

45
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
They must be heading to

46
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,600
tour the Xian River now.

47
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,800
Aren't you going to take a look?

48
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,700
None of your business.

49
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,400
It's just an eyesore.

50
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,400
Better not to see, the less to vex the heart.

51
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:09,960
Miss,

52
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,840
you're turning a blind eye

53
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,370
and only fooling yourself.

54
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,560
Why waste words

55
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,620
on the irrelevant?

56
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,240
Let's go.

57
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,560
Greetings, Your Majesty.

58
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,040
I won't beat around the bush.

59
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,530
I summoned you today

60
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,260
for the marriage decree we discussed last time.

61
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,760
Your Majesty,

62
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,840
I...

63
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,560
Do you know that the Empress Dowager,

64
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,680
displeased with your repeated refusals,

65
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,810
has already issued an imperial edict?

66
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,120
Your Majesty,

67
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,720
Empress Dowager is unwilling

68
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,000
to bother with appearances.

69
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,200
She's forcing this marriage outright.

70
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,600
But I can give you

71
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,530
another choice.

72
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:06,840
Take a look at the match I've chosen for your daughter.

73
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,590
What do you think of him?

74
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,480
Marquis of Jing'an, please have a look.

75
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,740
Actually, a child's marriage

76
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,040
is not something that lies within your authority.

77
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,480
Don't worry too much.

78
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,600
No need to overthink—just judge the person.

79
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:25,480
Can what the Empress Dowager

80
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,920
picked for you even compare with

81
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,940
[The Ming family's fourth daughter, is refined, dignified, prudent, and wise.]

82
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,600
what I have chosen?

83
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,000
[She is now of marriageable age and is hereby specially granted in marriage
to Jiang Xu, the Prince of Dingbei, and officially titled the Princess of Dingbei.]

84
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:35,180
Your Majesty,

85
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:35,800
well...

86
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,400
Well...

87
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,000
Well...

88
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:39,720
Well...

89
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,020
Please allow me

90
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,840
some more time to consider.

91
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,040
The Empress Dowager's edict has been issued.

92
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,240
I went to great lengths

93
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,240
to have it temporarily suppressed.

94
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,100
But what can be held back for a time

95
00:04:51,159 --> 00:04:52,710
cannot be held back forever.

96
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:54,400
It may reach your manor

97
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:56,480
before you leave the palace.

98
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,360
An imperial edict from the Empress Dowager!

99
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:04,980
[Spring Blossoms and Autumn Fruits]

100
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,120
Ming Tan of Marquis of Jing'an's Mansion—receive the edict!

101
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:13,170
Eunuch,

102
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,600
Fourth Miss isn't home right now.

103
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:17,420
Send someone to look for her now.

104
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,280
Empress Dowager values protocol the most!

105
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,690
This edict announcement

106
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:23,570
must not be taken lightly.

107
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,280
Yes.

108
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,680
Go now!

109
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,560
Yes.

110
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,730
Marquis of Jing'an,

111
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,800
why are you hesitating?

112
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:33,159
Had he not asked me himself,

113
00:05:33,159 --> 00:05:34,260
I wouldn't have...

114
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:34,920
Marry...

115
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,830
I will marry my daughter to him.

116
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,460
Liu Yiding!

117
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,040
Here!

118
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,920
Deliver the edict to the Marquis of Jing'an's Mansion at once.

119
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,600
Yes.

120
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:54,360
Wait.

121
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,800
Tan isn't home today.

122
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,600
Second Young Master Shu.

123
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,480
Why did Second Young Master Shu

124
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,800
dismount and turn back?

125
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,330
Isn't everyone supposed to

126
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,800
head to the Xian River

127
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,920
after the parade?

128
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:13,480
Second Young Master Shu

129
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,010
seems to be coming this way.

130
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,080
Second Young Master Shu.

131
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:26,120
Miss Bai. Miss Ming.

132
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:30,620
Second Young Master Shu has placed third in the exams—

133
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:31,840
well deserved.

134
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,840
Congratulations!

135
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:35,600
Thank you, Miss Ming.

136
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:38,600
He talked to you.

137
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,600
He said thank you for your blessing!

138
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,240
I wondered who

139
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,310
was clinging to Second Young Master Shu.

140
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:46,480
It turns out it's Miss Ming,

141
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,140
the one who just got rejected.

142
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,600
You're still looking radiant;

143
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,960
seems the broken engagement

144
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,400
didn't affect you at all.

145
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,480
Thank you for your compliment.

146
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,360
Didn't you vow to pray at Hanyan Temple

147
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,160
for 49 days?

148
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,610
Why are you back in the capital so soon?

149
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,320
Second Young Master Shu.

150
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,710
[Yunzhou]

151
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,040
A rare guest!

152
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,800
Greetings, Princess of Fengzhao.

153
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,530
Young Master Zhang is here too?

154
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:23,960
[Yunzhou]

155
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,800
I'll wait for Second Young Master Shu here.

156
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,240
He's seasick

157
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,100
and can't swim across Xian River.

158
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,720
I knew early on that

159
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,360
Second Young Master Shu was not an ordinary person.

160
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,960
It's only a matter of time before he tops the exam and ranks third.

161
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,130
Thank you for your compliment.

162
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,360
Miss Ming is dressed so flamboyantly

163
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,620
for the street outing.

164
00:07:41,909 --> 00:07:44,560
Could it be that you just broke off the engagement

165
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,290
and are now eager to find a new match for yourself?

166
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,720
Enough! I've been very patient with you...

167
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,240
My elaborate makeup

168
00:07:51,409 --> 00:07:52,270
is simply because

169
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:54,330
I don't want to be burdened by my past.

170
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,480
As for marriage,

171
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,400
it has always been a matter decided by parents.

172
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,040
I have no say in it.

173
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,200
Looking at the whole of Xian,

174
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,360
there are few daughters

175
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,160
as fortunate as you—

176
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,160
who are favored by the Empress Dowager's grace and care,

177
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,600
and able to marry Prince of Dingbei,

178
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,160
such a rare and outstanding husband.

179
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,160
I've heard that his mansion has no other woman.

180
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,360
Once you marry in,

181
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,800
you'll be the sole favored lady of the household.

182
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,480
Even the mansion's garden,

183
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:22,240
famous in the capital for its unmatched peonies,

184
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,120
is said to be for your eyes alone.

185
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:26,560
Do you know

186
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,480
why the peonies in the Prince of Dingbei's garden

187
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,840
bloom so exceptionally beautifully?

188
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:34,960
I don't know.

189
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,840
I heard that

190
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,080
the Prince of Dingbei

191
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,650
brutally killed all concubines of the mansion

192
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:43,000
and buried them in the garden.

193
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,560
Then, with their blood and flesh,

194
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,430
he nourished that line of peonies.

195
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:47,480
My goodness.

196
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,480
Really?

197
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,520
Please forgive me.

198
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:00,600
These are just some rumors

200
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,760

201
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,960
idle gossip repeated without much thought.

202
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,440
A fierce and bloodthirsty man

203
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,000
like the Prince of Dingbei

204
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,130
is far beyond the reach of

205
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:11,360
ordinary folks like us.

206
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:13,640
Only someone

207
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:15,360
as noble and precious as you

208
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,500
could be a worthy match for him.

209
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,640
When the time comes for your wedding,

210
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,290
we will line the streets to send you off

211
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:20,620
and celebrate with you.

212
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:23,930
I just broke off the engagement.

213
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:26,360
I won't share a room with you,

214
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,720
lest my bad luck

215
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,240
rub off on you

216
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,640
and affect your

217
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,720
blessed marriage.

218
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,120
Here comes the imperial edict!

219

[Clear Waters and Bright Woods]

220
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:43,300
Ming Tan of the Ming family is to receive the decree!

[Ode to Prosperity and Peace]

222
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:02,480
The Ming family's fourth daughter, is refined, dignified,

223
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,000
prudent, and wise

224
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,600
and is now of marriageable age.

225
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,260
She is hereby specially granted in marriage

226
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:10,810
to Jiang Xu, the Prince of Dingbei,

227
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:12,760
and officially titled the Princess of Dingbei.

228
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,480
Relevant officials are to select an auspicious date for the ceremony.

229
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,720
Prepare the ceremonial gifts

230
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,840
and formalize the decree. Carry it out as written.

231
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:22,360
Who's being summoned?

232
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,120
You...

233
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,840
What am I being appointed as?

234
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,040
Princess of Dingbei.

235
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:31,380
That's what happens when you spit into the wind—

236
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,480
it hits you right back.

237

[Spring Blossoms and Autumn Fruits]

Slow down.

242
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,780
So this marriage arrangement

243
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:57,520
was agreed to by you?

244
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,720
Of course.

245
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,520
No, no.

246
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,200
You don't know that

247
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,240
today, the Empress Dowager

248
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,980
also issued an imperial marriage decree.

249
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:06,240
There is more than one.

250
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,360
The first

251
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,000
was intercepted by His Majesty,

252
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,120
but she can draft, persuade,

253
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,120
and affix seals.

254
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:12,200
When one decree failed,

255
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,730
she simply issued another.

256
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:15,730
Knowing His Majesty urgently

257
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,360
summoned me today

258
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,240
to discuss the marriage,

259
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,840
the Empress Dowager didn't even notify us

260
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,760
before delivering the second decree

261
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,360
directly to our mansion.

262
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:25,360
Then... What about the decree

263
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,240
at the Wentao Pavilion?

264
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,720
That was my quick thinking!

265
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,440
I knew you wouldn't be

266
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,640
at the mansion today,

267
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,600
and the Empress Dowager strictly observes protocol.

268
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,600
She'd never issue a decree

269
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,600
with only a concubine present at the mansion.

270
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,720
So I informed His Majesty

271
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,880
of your whereabouts

272
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,320
at the Wentao Pavilion.

273
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,720
With the decree proclaimed

274
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,120
before a crowd,

275
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,120
it became irreversible.

276
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,600
Admittedly circuitous,

277
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,370
but ultimately satisfactory for all.

278
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,100
What's wrong with you?

279
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,100
You must be tired from praying to Buddha.

280
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,520
Have a good rest.

281
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,960
I won't disturb you anymore.

282
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:15,880
Oh no.

283
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,480
I'm such a jinx.

Everything I said is coming true.

285
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:20,760
If the Prince of Dingbei

286
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,960
is really anything like the rumors say,

287
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:22,360
what are you

288
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,480
going to do then?

289
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,080
Father must think he's

290
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:25,880
pulled off

291
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,760
something brilliantly clever,

292
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,240
but this marriage

293
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,340
is even trickier than the one with the Liang family.

294
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,600
Truly, I underestimated Uncle—

295
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,840
that supposedly uncouth military man.

296
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,480
But why does it have to be the Prince of Dingbei?

297
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:42,760
Isn't he

298
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,760
just another rough, violent brute?

299

is known throughout the capital.

301
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,730
If he can be granted a marriage,

302
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,720

We haven't seen

311
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,640
him yet.

312
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,720
When we see him,

313
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,000
maybe he's not as bad

314
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,120
as the rumors say?

315
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,720
Did you not see

316
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,000
how wild and arrogant he was

317
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,260
at the Lantern Festival Palace banquet?

318
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,120

Not necessarily.

322
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,450
But the most important thing is

323
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,880
he's a brute!

324
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:32,480
He must also be ugly;

325
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,900
then he truly has nothing going for him.

326
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,340
No.

327
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,860
This marriage must be cancelled.

00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:23,360
Of course I feel uneasy.

347
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,200
I understand.

348
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,480
After all,

349
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,840
you'll be expected to be a proper match

350
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,300
for the Prince of Dingbei.

351
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,200
It's a good thing

352
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,200
to learn more about him beforehand.

353
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,060
Who wants to be a proper match for him?

354
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,060
I just want to know him well enough

355
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,640
to figure out how to break off this engagement.

356
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:46,000
Then, Father, do you know much about

357
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,380
the Prince of Dingbei?

358
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,760
Among the younger generation in Xian,

359
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,880
few can truly command troops.

360
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,170
But the Prince of Dingbei,

361
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:55,600
at a very young age,

362
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:57,640
led 3,000 elite soldiers

363
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:00,000
to hold off 30,000 northern barbarians.

364
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,000
That battle

365
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,840
was said to be a sea of blood,

366
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:06,860
with corpses stretching for miles.

367
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,000
When enemy spies

368
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,600
fall into his hands,

369
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,840
a bit of blood and gore is nothing.

370
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,600
They end up so mangled they're barely human,

371
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,320
and when their bodies are thrown back,

372
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,650
even their own army can't recognize them.

373
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,320
It was because of this

374
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,900
that things stayed quiet for half a year.

375
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,290
And in the third year of Chengkang,

376
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,840
the Prince of Dingbei

377
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,880
hung the body of the barbarian chieftain's son

378
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,240
on the city gate

379
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,480
for three days.

380
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,410
By the end, it had dried into a human jerky.

381
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,080
So, the Prince of Dingbei

382
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,360
is truly a remarkable talent.

383
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,720
Having such a perfect son-in-law

384
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,320
is truly a blessing for the Ming family.

385
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,120
And

386
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,480
though he is a general,

387
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,320
he is tall

388
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,840
and handsome,

389
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,200
not at all inferior to the top scholar

390
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,730
we saw parading yesterday.

391
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,290
Uncle, are you serious?

392
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,960
Well, compared to

393
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,240
when I was young,

394
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,580
I suppose I had a bit more charm and grace.

395
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,860
Are you clear about it?

396
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,500
If you're clear about it, then let's eat.

397
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:31,980
[Lilies of the River and Fragrant Angelicas of the Marsh]

398
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,250
Tan, have you really made up your mind?

399
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:35,000
Go see him once.

400
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,980
If he really is as terrible as the rumors say,

401
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:38,460
even the emperor's decree

402
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:39,520
won't stop me

403
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,340
from breaking off the marriage.

404
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:43,650
You can't just listen to Uncle.

405
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,840
Although he's a warrior,

406
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,240
he probably wasn't so bad

407
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,240
when he was young.

408
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,200
Besides,

409
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,170
didn't he say the Prince of Dingbei

410
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:55,470
was a little better?

411
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:58,680
Though he can't be called exceptionally handsome,

412
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,400
he still has presence.

413
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,920
Appearance matters,

414
00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:06,470
but character is even more important.

415
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,560
They say the face reflects the heart,

416
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,140
and one's words and actions reveal their true nature.

417
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:10,819
From what I've seen of him,

418
00:17:10,849 --> 00:17:11,829
you can get a sense of

419
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:12,829
his personality.

420
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,440
But the Capital Garrison's defenses are tight,

421
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,440
and the Prince of Dingbei is known for

422
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,680
being rough and overbearing.

423
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,880
I worry it might not be wise

424
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,540
for you to rush in unprepared.

425
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,200
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

426
00:17:25,369 --> 00:17:26,960
As long as I can see him

427
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,840
without revealing my identity,

428
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:31,030
there won't be any danger.

429
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,310
See him

430
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,760
without revealing who you are?

431
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:42,750
I have an idea.

432
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,720
Stop! Who are you?

433
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,280
We're from the Ming family,

434
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:08,710
[Marquis of Jing'an's Mansion]

435
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,040
sent by order of the Marquis of Jing'an

436
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,350
to deliver some refreshing treats

437
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:11,960
to Young General Shen.

438
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:14,400
Come in.

439
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:19,080
Come with me.

440
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:24,240
Later,

441
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,480
I'll take the food to Shen Yu.

442
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,520
You wait outside.

443
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,000
If he sees you,

444
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,330
the act will fall apart.

445
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,720
You follow this young officer

446
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,760
and bring the lotus leaf porridge

447
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,040
to the Prince's tent.

448
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:47,720
Yes.

449
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,050
Let's go.

450
00:18:56,290 --> 00:18:58,320
Just leave the porridge to me.

451
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:02,400
Sir, you may not know

452
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,920
that this lotus leaf porridge

453
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,280
has been kept chilled

454
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,320
in a specially

455
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,000
crafted ice container.

456
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,040
It's very delicate.

457
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,000
If you don't know the trick to it and spill it,

458
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,260
that wouldn't be good.

459
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,400
Then please leave quickly

460
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,720
once it's delivered.

461
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,180
Do not disturb the Prince during his duties.

462
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,640
Thank you for your understanding, sir.

463
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,680
What does build

464
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,000
have to do with being tall?

465
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,010
No need to reset the sand table.

466
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,000
I'll take a look first,

467
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:52,720
then we'll go over the strategy together.

468
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,240
Yes.

469
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:55,240
I shall take my leave.

470
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,090
It turns out to be a mistake.

471
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:00,280
Fortunately,

472
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:02,160
it's not him.

473
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:23,680
He's refined and upright,

474
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,560
tall and slender,

475
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:29,200
even seems a bit taller than Second Young Master Shu.

476
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:30,240
He's definitely not a

477
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,720
rough and burly brute.

478
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,380
Your Highness,

479
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:45,560
Young General Shen asked me

480
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,880
to bring you lotus leaf porridge.

481
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,240
He said it helps cool the heat.

482
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:52,040
Put it there.

483
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:18,480
It's best enjoyed

484
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:20,970
while still cool.

485
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,000
The flavor is at its peak now.

486
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:38,240
So he has new boots.

487
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,880
Yet he entered the palace to meet the Emperor

488
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:42,080
without the slightest regard for proper decorum.

489
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,880
It seems that even if he's not a brute,

490
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:46,080
he must be an arrogant and reckless man.

491
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:51,850
His palms are calloused, and his fingertips are rough,

492
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,700
yet the shape of his hands, with broad palms,

493
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:57,300
slender joints, and clearly defined bones,

494
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,520
is truly beautiful.

495
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,360
Sharp eyebrows and bright eyes,

496
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,020
a straight nose and thin lips—

497
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,880
his looks and presence are truly on par with

498
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,410
Second Young Master Shu's,

499
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:08,880
even carrying a

500
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,810
noble, cold elegance like polished jade.

501
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:13,960
Wait.

502
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:15,070
Where have I seen

503
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:17,240
him before?

504
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,440
Why are you here?

505
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:26,540
Have you seen enough?

506
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:27,880
Why are you here?

507
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:32,600
Your Highness, a message from the palace.

508
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:36,320
Your Highness?

509
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,000
Say it.

510
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,080
Regarding On Military Discipline and Morale you wrote,

511
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,000
the Emperor has ordered

512
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,280
the Hanlin Academy to copy it carefully

513
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,720
and compile it along with

514
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,960
several other military essays

515
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,720
you previously wrote into a volume.

516
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,520
What are your instructions?

517
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:50,010
Just follow His Majesty's order.

518
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:52,340
Yes, I shall take my leave.

519
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,240
He can write articles too?

520
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,100
Why Miss Ming hasn't come out yet?

521
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:03,940
Is the Prince of Dingbei giving her a hard time?

522
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:04,960
Will she...

523
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,800
Miss Minmin,

524
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,440
should we go in and check?

525
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:13,960
No,

526
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,480
Tan is always careful,

527
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,320
especially with important matters.

528
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,370
She wouldn't mess up.

529
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:19,000
Besides,

530
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,040
she's the Emperor's appointed

531
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,000
Princess of Dingbei.

532
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,250
No matter how domineering the Prince of Dingbei is,

533
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:23,520
he won't trouble her.

534
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,960
If she still

535
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,000
hasn't come out

536
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,080
after a cup of tea's time,

537
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,140
then we can rush in.

538
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:32,280
You...

539
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,180
Are you the Prince of Dingbei?

540
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,990
Could it be that I'm still just a bandit?

541
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,240
That day at the Duke of Ling's Mansion,

542
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,500
you weren't stealing?

543
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,210
Those official silver shipments

544
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:45,940
were military payrolls hijacked by Liang Qiwei.

545
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:49,930
And what about Hanyan Temple?

546
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:51,690
The Sheriff searching the temple

547
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:53,530
colluded with the Haiyou Sect.

548
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,440
They blocked my entry to the capital

549
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,840
precisely to obstruct my

550
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:59,210
investigation into the payroll case.

551
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,500
Is there any question?

552
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:05,000
Let me think about it.

553
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:07,720
Sit.

554
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,480
Wait, why would you want to marry me?

555
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:21,760
May Buddha grant me

556
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,560
a suitable husband.

557
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:25,040
His appearance must be handsome,

558
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,320
I'm good-looking.

559
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,200
only then would he be a match for me.

560
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,680
I'm over seven feet tall.

561
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,200
In stature,

562
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:32,410
may he stand over seven feet tall.

563
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:33,540
My parents are dead.

564
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:34,610
I also pray that my future mother-in-law

565
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:35,270
does not burden me with endless rules,

566
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:36,510
I don't have mother who set rules

567
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:37,080
and nitpicking.

568
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,560
and nitpick every day.

569
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:41,160
My family relationship is also simple.

570
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:41,720
Usually,

571
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:44,230
beyond a few close friends,

572
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,590
I maintain no unnecessary social ties.

573
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:48,720
-Above all, there must be no childhood sweethearts
-I have no childhood sweethearts.

574
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,680
or overly intimate cousin-sisters lingering about.

575
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,480
In that case,

576
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,980
do you have any questions?

577
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,440
No.

578
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,850
Regarding talent,

579
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,160
I ranked beyond the top imperial examinees.

580
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,860
Bird's nest porridge is always available.

581
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:04,320
He must at least provide me
with bird's nest porridge whenever I desire,

582
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,050
and afford seasonal wardrobes

583
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:08,080
from Brocade Splendor Workshop.

584
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:10,900
So, do you have any questions?

585
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:17,220
I'm strong and healthy

586
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:19,010
without crude bulk.

587
00:25:19,290 --> 00:25:20,490
If anything happens,

588
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,290
I can safeguard you unscathed should danger arise.

589
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:23,960
My weapon of choice is the sword,

590
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,520
wielded with appreciable grace.

591
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,040
-When he wields his blade,
-When you play the qin,

592
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,000
-I may accompany him with the qin, creating a scene of perfect harmony.
-I can wield my blade, creating a scene of perfect harmony.

593
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:29,960
Wait.

594
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,000
These words sound eerily familiar.

595
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:34,560
How could you know

596
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,760
my marital criteria?

597
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:37,480
If every item

598
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,080
matches your requirements,

599
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,570
why shouldn't I wed you?

600
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,080
Someone like the Prince of Dingbei,

601
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,760
who treads blades and drinks blood—

602
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:44,720
how could an ordinary woman like me

603
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,720
dare aspire to that?

604
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,200
They said you're a tyrannical

605
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,040
butcher...

606
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:50,800
They also said that

607
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,040
beneath my mansion's peonies

608
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:52,520
lie the mutilated

609
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,000
corpses of my concubines.

610
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:58,240
Then... Are those rumors

611
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,000
true or false?

612
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
I only kill those who deserve death.

613
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:18,440
Even if you meet all my criteria,

614
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:21,720
that doesn't mean I must marry you.

615
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:25,680
Don't you want to?

616
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,440
It's not about whether I want to or not.

617
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,480
The truth is, we share

618
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,960
no affection,

619
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,080
and our temperaments

620
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,410
clash far too severely.

621
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,800
Should we wed,

622
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,620
our household would descend into

623
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,240
ceaseless turmoil—

624
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,960
no peace for man or beast.

625
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,860
Who do you love in the capital?

626
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,120
Whom would you rather marry?

627
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,240
If I don't wed you,

628
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:51,860
His Majesty

629
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,160
will simply

630
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,420
decree another match.

631
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:01,970
Becoming the Princess of Dingbei

632
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,480
is the optimal choice

633
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:06,270
for both the Marquis of Jing'an and the Ming family.

634
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:07,800
Must I

635
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:11,050
state such obvious logic?

636
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:18,640
You imply

637
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,240
a marriage of

638
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,730
convenience between us, then.

639
00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:26,240
No expectation of conjugal affection,

640
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,080
merely

641
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,160
mutual benefit between our houses.

642
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,440
You may interpret it thus.

643
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:44,240
-Tan!
-My Lady!

644
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:45,680
You finally came out.

645
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,440
How are you?

646
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,640
Say something.

647
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:55,720
Did you see him?

648
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,520
What happened?

649
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,120
Why are you all dumbfounded?

650
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,760
He's undeniably formidable in presence.

651
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:08,240
How does he look?

652
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:09,570
Well...

653
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:12,920
Don't tell me he's worse-looking than Uncle!

654
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,440
What standards does Uncle have?

655
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,440
Even the finest warrior

656
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,440
can't compensate for boorishness!

657
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:19,800
Who said he was boorish?

658
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:20,760
Minmin,

659
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,480
have you ever heard of On Military Discipline and Morale?

660
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,040
What treatise?

661
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:24,920
On Military Discipline and Morale?

662
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,280
At last year's literary gathering,

663
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,160
I heard two young scholars

664
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,420
debate this very text.

665
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,720
I don't understand military tactics,

666
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,880
but just from his discussion,

667
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,720
I can tell his writing is logically tight,

668
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,720
concise, and sharp.

669
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,440
Later, when visiting your house,

670
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,680
Uncle praised it as

671
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:40,400
"groundbreaking in substance,

672
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,060
devoid of hollow sophistry."

673
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:44,880
Did he?

674
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:46,680
I don't recall.

675
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,720
What does this have to do with the Prince of Dingbei?

676
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,640
One thing he's right about—

677
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,500
with his abilities, strategies,

678
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:56,480
and influence,

679
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,490
he would indeed greatly benefit the Ming family.

680
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:04,160
Then will you call off the engagement or not?

681
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,650
Today has brought too many surprises.

682
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,280
Let me think about it.

683
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,030
Wait a moment.

684
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,900
[Prince of Dingbei's Mansion]

685
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,420
Your Highness,

686
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,240
the offerings for tomorrow's incense ceremony

687
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,440
at Hanyan Temple

688
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,680
await your approval.

689
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:46,720
Your Highness,

690
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,560
here are last month's accounts

691
00:29:46,970 --> 00:29:48,200
[Cuojin Pavilion Ledgers] [Jinxiu Workshop Ledgers]

692
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:51,160
from the Cuojin Pavilion and Jinxiu Workshop.

693
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,640
I'll take my leave then.

694
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,800
Your Highness, have some midnight refreshments.

695
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:07,680
Uncle Fu,

696
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,320
speak your mind.

697
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,040
I'll say it then.

698
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,720
I heard that His Majesty

699
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,920
has arranged your marriage with

700
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,800
the Fourth Miss of Ming family.

701
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:20,560
I think

702
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,040
the imperial match

703
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,040
is great.

704
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:24,360
Tell me.

705
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:25,870
What exactly is so good?

706
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:26,520
Your Highness,

707
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,440
you've been occupied with

708
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,240
battles and military affairs these past years,

709
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,200
so naturally you wouldn't pay much attention to

710
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,920
the noble young ladies in the capital.

711
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,240
But I know well.

712
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:34,720
This Fourth Miss of the Ming family

713
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,960
truly stands out

714
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,320
among all the noble girls in the capital.

715
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:39,520
Her looks and family background

716
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,560
speak for themselves,

717
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:42,040
and in terms of talent,

718
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,480
she is second to none—

719
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,040
skilled in music, chess, calligraphy, and painting.

720
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,640
It is especially her skill with the qin

721
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,800
that is unmatched in the capital,

722
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,530
leaving all others far behind.

723
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,720
The most important thing is that

724
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,000
the Fourth Miss from the Ming family is gentle, kind, and graceful

725
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,240
with a heart as pure as orchids.

726
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,440
She treats others with genuine warmth.

727
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:03,220
Your Highness, you...

728
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:05,460
She is

729
00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:07,270
kind?

730
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:08,920
Of course.

731
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,040
Two years ago, when the Cuojin Pavilion had just opened,

732
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,680
war broke out in the North.

733
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,560
That scoundrel in the Ministry of Revenue embezzled military funds

734
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:17,680
and deceived his superiors.

735
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,000
Your Highness sent word for

736
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,730
the princely manor to raise the funds in advance.

737
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:24,640
But across three separate occasions,

738
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,920
the total sum amounted to hundreds of thousands of taels of silver!

739
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:29,640
These estate businesses were already running deficits.

740
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,080
Where could we suddenly procure

741
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,520
so much silver?

742
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,560
Even selling shops or land

743
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:37,200
would require time to liquidate.

744
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:38,760
Fortunately,

745
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:40,760
Miss Ming began frequenting our establishments during that period,

746
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,880
spending considerable sums.

747
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:46,170
Though she never stated her purpose,

748
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:48,050
I recognized her true intent:

749
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:49,760
finding pretexts

750
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,440
to donate military funds.

751
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:54,340
After Miss Ming set the trend,

752
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:55,980
noblewomen from the capital

753
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,240
followed suit in emulation—

754
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,000
only then was

755
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,400
your urgent financial crisis alleviated.

756
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,290
By that measure,

757
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:06,330
her contribution to the Dongzhou victory was significant?

758
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:08,230
That's a great merit.

759
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,640
Anyway, this marriage decree is most fortuitous.

760
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,680
One might say the prince and princess

761
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,560
are a match made by heaven itself.

762
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:15,580
I've thought about it.

763
00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:17,610
I planned to present the princess

764
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:19,260
with a full headdress set from the Cuojin Pavilion.

765
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:20,390
Our future Princess

766
00:32:20,410 --> 00:32:21,800
must be the most splendid bride

767
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,640
in the capital.

768
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:32,900
Father.

769
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:40,300
Father, working late into the night

770
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:41,640
must be exhausting.

771
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:43,160
I've prepared

772
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,420
mung bean and lily soup

773
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,920
to relieve the summer heat and fatigue.

774
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:48,400
Sit.

775
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,640
Why are you still awake at this hour?

776
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:07,700
Thoughts of marriage

777
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,000
keep me restless.

778
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,520
I've never imagined

779
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:21,140
what life would be like outside the Marquis's mansion,

780
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,640
nor do I know

781
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,800
what awaits me

782
00:33:25,650 --> 00:33:27,240
in another household.

783
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:38,700
Tan,

784
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,500
though I may be careless at times,

785
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,520
I do know

786
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:46,320
you're feeling uneasy

787
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,050
about this arranged marriage.

788
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,480
Don't worry.

789
00:33:53,610 --> 00:33:56,000
The Prince of Dingbei is a good man.

790
00:33:59,410 --> 00:34:02,270
Is Father's judgment towards the Prince of Dingbei

791
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:04,220
just a "good man"?

792
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:11,679
You have no idea that

793
00:34:13,699 --> 00:34:15,040
during an autumn hunt

794
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,560
in the late emperor's reign,

795
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,600
His Majesty—who was then still the Crown Prince—

796
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,800
was ambushed in the forest

797
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,320
by assassins.

798
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,480
It was the Prince of Dingbei

799
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:25,590
who charged in alone, fought through the encirclement,

800
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:28,989
and protected His Majesty despite being seriously wounded.

801
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:34,360
No wonder His Majesty trusts him so deeply.

802
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,320
Yes.

803
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,560
It's said that the issue of the Dingbei Army's military funds

804
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,520
has been festering for years.

805
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:42,440
Two years ago,

806
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:44,480
the former Vice Minister of Revenue's

807
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,159
embezzlement disrupted the northern war effort.

808
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:48,639
After narrowly

809
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:50,199
surviving the battlefield,

810
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:52,120
the first thing the Prince of Dingbei did upon returning

811
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,760
was storm into the vice minister's residence

812
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,480
and take his head—

813
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:58,160
seeking justice

814
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,220
for the soldiers of the Dingbei Army.

815
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:06,120
He's certainly a man of fierce resolve.

816
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,760
Just last year, the battle in Dongzhou

817
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,280
left the land soaked in blood

818
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,810
and littered with corpses.

819
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:13,090
That's probably why he returned to

820
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,490
the capital to investigate the case personally.

821
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,040
But Father, I was originally

822
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,300
supposed to marry into the Liang family.

823
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,440
Now that you've

824
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,480
accepted His Majesty's decree,

825
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:33,320
doesn't that mean you've taken a stand?

826
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,320
Won't it be difficult

827
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,650
to explain things to my godfather?

828
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:39,170
Wait,

829
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,300
he picked a bad husband for you,

830
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:41,770
yet he never thought he owed anyone an explanation.

831
00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:42,430
Why should I need to

832
00:35:42,430 --> 00:35:43,870
explain anything to him?

833
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,250
Then do you truly think that the Prince of Dingbei

834
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:55,290
is someone worthy of entrusting

835
00:35:56,170 --> 00:35:59,030
both your daughter and the Ming family's future to?

836
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,080
Tan,

837
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,040
remember this—

838
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,380
the Ming family will always have my backing.

839
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,120
You don't have to sacrifice your whole life

840
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,600
just to please our family.

841
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,480
Whether it's you or Chu,

842
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,280
you only need to choose the man you truly like.

843
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:17,640
No need to worry about anything else.

844
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:19,740
Father.

845
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,640
As for your marriage,

846
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,650
even though it's arranged,

847
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:29,480
I have thought it through carefully.

848
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,880
Look around all of Xian;

849
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,360
aside from the Emperor himself,

850
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,440
if even the Prince of Dingbei can't protect you,

851
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,800
then no one else

852
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,280
has the ability to do so.

853
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:42,080
So I can rest assured that

854
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,960
this marriage will benefit you.

855
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:58,070
[Prince of Dingbei's Mansion]

856
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,840
I really don't understand

857
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,560
why His Majesty would arrange this marriage.

858
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,040
Marquis of Jing'an commands Yangxi Prefecture,

859
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,700
and you lead the Dingbei Army.

860
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,080
With such overwhelming military power,

861
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:17,760
wouldn't the Emperor

862
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,280
have some reservations?

863
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:20,760
Since when did you start worrying about

864
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,160
the Emperor's thoughts?

865
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,420
What about you?

866
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,280
Are you willing to

867
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:28,740
accept this marriage?

868
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,840
Didn't you say

869
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,530
it wouldn't be impossible for me to marry her?

870
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:34,960
Well...

871
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,600
That was just a joke.

872
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:39,600
I only meant that

873
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:41,360
if you're not sincere about marrying her,

874
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,200
you shouldn't waste

875
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,320
the girl's life.

876
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,760
If you're truly

877
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,820
deciding this on my account,

878
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:46,320
then...

879
00:37:49,330 --> 00:37:50,810
Wouldn't that be my fault?

880
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,430
If you don't want to marry her,

881
00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:53,470
nor me,

882
00:37:54,450 --> 00:37:55,730
then what do you think

883
00:37:55,850 --> 00:37:56,910
will become of her?

884
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:59,360
Well...

885
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:01,290
Nowadays, which noble family

886
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:02,300
in the capital

887
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:04,520
can truly match the prestige of the Ming family

888
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:06,450
without affecting court affairs?

889
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:10,450
These noble daughters are born into great families,

890
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:12,440
so their fate is never entirely their own.

891
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,680
Their honor and disgrace

892
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:16,410
are inevitably tied to their family's standing.

893
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:19,920
Whether my intentions are sincere

894
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,120
or merely practical,

895
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,880
since she is my princess,

896
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,500
I will accept her temperament

897
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:28,530
and protect her for life.

898
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:34,060
Mother,

899
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:38,000
I have some doubts.

900
00:38:38,770 --> 00:38:40,440
I was reluctant about this marriage

901
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:41,840
arranged by the Emperor.

902
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:45,880
I had thought those who fight on the battlefield

903
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,680
would be like Father—

904
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:49,920
brave and rough.

905
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:53,710
But after meeting him once,

906
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,320
I didn't expect him

907
00:38:57,090 --> 00:38:58,500
to be handsome

908
00:38:58,800 --> 00:38:59,920
and dignified,

909
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:02,660
nothing like the rumors said.

910
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,440
It seems that

911
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:12,840
the Prince of Dingbei, in terms of family background,

912
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,800
appearance, and talent,

913
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,880
meets all the criteria

914
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:19,020
I had

915
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:20,290
for a husband.

[Memorial Tablet of Bai Feiyuan of the Ming Family]

917
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:22,840
I originally thought,

918
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,840
because of his bad reputation,

919
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,440
that he must be a cold-blooded and cruel man

920
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,880
of poor character.

921
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,320
But just now,

922
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,480
Father's sincere words

923
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,800
have dispelled those doubts from my heart.

924
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,600
Father has certainly

925
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,860
given this careful thought on my behalf.

926
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,920
According to Father,

927
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:45,480
he is indeed a man

928
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,680
worthy of trust.

929
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:51,480
However,

930
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,440
I know very little about him

931
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,730
and don't know if, once we truly get to know each other,

932
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:02,880
he will be as loyal and honorable

933
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,800
as Father said.

934
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:11,040
So I still have

935
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,600
some doubts in my heart,

936
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,620
unsure whether I should marry or not.

937
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,080
If Mother hears

938
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,320
my honest thoughts,

939
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:23,000
could you please tell me

940
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:26,200
whether you

941
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:29,000
approve of this marriage?

942
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,560
Mother didn't say anything,

943
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,280
so I took it as your

944
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,080
silent approval

945
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,120
of this marriage.

946
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,040
After I receive the imperial marriage decree,

947
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:53,590
Chu's wedding

948
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,000
will also be arranged.

949
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:58,280
Once Chu and I have married,

950
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:00,680
there will be no one left

951
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:04,000
in this large Marquis's mansion

952
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,260
to keep Father company

953
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,240
and care for him closely.

954
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,570
Father's return to the capital

955
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:13,920
naturally fills my heart with joy.

956
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:17,480
I also wish to

957
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:20,040
grow closer to him.

958
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:22,520
But

959
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:28,000
perhaps because we haven't seen each other for many years,

960
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,120
I still feel

961
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,200
a bit of

962

awkwardness between us.

and the kitchen told me there was none.
