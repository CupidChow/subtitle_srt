1
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,580
put my hands in your hand

2
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,540
Clean your hands

3
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,660
I'll buy you the food

4
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,320
get the paella

5
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,560
I buy the brown sugar

6
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,260
I pay the living

7
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:59,520
water

8
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,520
Father, after the incident,

9
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,240
there have been people from Haiyou Gate secretly hiding outside the Prince of Dingbei's mansion.

10
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,360
After hearing this,

11
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,120
do we have to leave?

12
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:12,760
How many people?

13
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,560
Two.

14
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,360
Prime Minister Su is suspicious.

15
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,800
The more we look closely,

16
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,360
the more suspicious he will be.

17
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,680
The death of the father-in-law is not suspicious.

18
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,240
Let the wind and rain continue to cover up the princess.

19
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,280
Do not alert the people.

20
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:31,760
Yes.

21
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,880
The Prince can't bear to see the Princess sad.

22
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,480
He can only be patient and be quiet.

23
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,360
Since the incident has already passed,

24
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,280
why don't you tell the truth?

25
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,200
If I tell the truth now,

26
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,160
I may be able to relieve him of his pain.

27
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,600
But if I'm not careful,

28
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,880
all the events will come to an end.

29
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,480
Is it the only way for the Princess to be misunderstood about Prince yin?

30
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:03,920
The situation in Suxing is that ...

31
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:18,380
she is suspicious and can be

32
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,320
too 수도 도

33
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,460
I

34
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:36,800
At 밖에

35
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,880
Ay implementation of their

36
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:44,800
promise

37
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,680
he felt

38
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,240
quenched

39
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,820
oh

40
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:00,920
There was a big BTS Mamrie.

41
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:06,040
In the 방ór memori' paper where the Richtaths are...

42
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:11,280
...it was announced, thatPassengers of God Lucky will depart soon.

43
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:15,200
Young Master Bae was suddenly active in favor of King Daji.

44
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:21,160
King Daji seems to have been very eager to see King Daji from their hands.

45
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,480
What are you smells?

46
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,920
What is the tới Absolutely nothing.

47
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:29,920
Prince Dingbei, you set up a trap and invited me to your palace.

48
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,920
How could you not keep your hands on me?

49
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:36,920
Has there been any strange movement in Prince Dingbei's residence these days?

50
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:40,920
Since that night, the people of the Oman Sea have been watching over Prince Dingbei's residence.

51
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,920
They didn't find anything strange.

52
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,920
But this is also a place where I can't solve it.

53
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:49,920
With Prince Dingbei's means, he will never make a fool of the situation.

54
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:53,920
If he wants to frame me with such a vicious means,

55
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,920
wouldn't that be a waste of time?

56
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:05,920
You mean to say that Prince Dingbei didn't want to frame me with such a vicious means.

57
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,920
Then what is his purpose?

58
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:19,920
Steamed buns! They are fragrant and sweet!

59
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,920
Miss, come and try these two.

60
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,920
These are my old buns. They are very old and very good.

61
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,920
They are very good for selling.

62
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,920
They cost two cents each. Miss, don't leave!

63
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,920
Miss, two bowls of noodles.

64
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,920
The soup is thick and the noodles are chewy.

65
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,920
The chicken is also very tender.

66
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,920
Diatorio Three

67
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,920
Why are you following me, Master?

68
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:21,920
I'm sorry for being rude.

69
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,920
You almost fell into the water.

70
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,920
I saved you.

71
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,920
Why did you do that?

72
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,920
You're right.

73
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,920
Thank you for saving me.

74
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:38,920
Do you know why you followed me from the east street?

75
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:40,920
You misunderstood.

76
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,920
I met you by chance.

77
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,920
I thought we were acquaintances.

78
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:45,920
I wanted to say hello.

79
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,920
But I didn't find a suitable time to say hello.

80
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,920
So I followed you all the way.

81
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,920
How did you meet me?

82
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:53,920
At the orphanage.

83
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,920
You gave the kids the roast chicken.

84
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:57,920
I was there.

85
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,920
I also talked to you.

86
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,920
You finished your greeting.

87
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:04,920
You can go now.

88
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,920
Roast chicken.

89
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:16,920
Roast chicken.

90
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,920
What are you looking for?

91
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:25,920
I'm looking for something delicious.

92
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:27,920
What do you want?

93
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:28,920
Sweet or soft?

94
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:29,920
Light or heavy?

95
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,920
I can recommend one.

96
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:33,920
Princess doesn't like heavy food.

97
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,920
She prefers sweet or soft.

98
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,920
But she has a bad appetite.

99
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,920
It's better to eat something sweet.

100
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,920
Do you want to buy something for her?

101
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:45,920
She has been sad for three days.

102
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:49,920
Ming family is in a crisis.

103
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,920
It's so sad.

104
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,920
The lord was born in danger.

105
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,920
But he has to face this.

106
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,920
Do you have a way to help Ming family?

107
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,920
I'll find something to eat.

108
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,920
There is no way to cure your mood.

109
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,920
There are many things in the world.

110
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,920
They are all fun.

111
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,920
Everything is cute and hearty.

112
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,920
Everything is so beautiful.

113
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,920
That's what I mean.

114
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,920
Why are you looking at me?

115
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,920
You are so quiet.

116
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,920
I mean, food can help you.

117
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,920
But you can't eat anything.

118
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,920
I mean, food can help you.

119
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,920
Tell me.

120
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,920
What are the foods that can help you?

121
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,920
There is a baked pancake.

122
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:49,920
It's crispy and sweet.

123
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,920
There is a dumpling shop in the east of the bridge.

124
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:52,920
It's famous.

125
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,920
It has a lot of dumplings.

126
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,920
It's juicy.

127
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:57,920
Enough.

128
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,920
Please come in.

129
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,920
Okay.

130
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:07,920
Please come in.

131
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,920
Your highness.

132
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,920
Please eat something.

133
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,920
If you keep eating like this,

134
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,920
you won't be able to keep your body.

135
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:25,920
Yes.

136
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,920
Yunyi bought these for you in line.

137
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,920
She doesn't know what you like to eat.

138
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,920
So she bought everything she could.

139
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,920
I'm sorry for making you worry.

140
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,920
I'm fine.

141
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,920
I just have no appetite.

142
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,920
If you are so kind,

143
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,920
I don't want to see you like this.

144
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,920
If you are sad,

145
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,920
you can cry.

146
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,920
Or you can go anywhere and see anyone.

147
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,920
We will be there for you.

148
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,920
But you can't put all the pain in your heart.

149
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,920
You are a crybaby.

150
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,920
You don't even know my life.

151
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,920
You are a crybaby.

152
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,920
You don't even know my life.

153
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,920
You don't even know my life.

154
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:11,920
Your highness.

155
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,920
Please don't worry.

156
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:14,920
I'm fine.

157
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:15,920
I'm fine.

158
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:19,920
Come on.

159
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:20,920
Come on.

160
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:21,920
Please!

161
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:23,920
My lady.

162
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:24,920
Please come.

163
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:25,920
Your highness.

164
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:26,920
Please come.

165
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:27,920
Please.

166
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:28,920
Please.

167
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:29,920
Please.

168
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,920
I was wandering around the world.

169
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,920
I was wandering around the world.

170
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,920
I was wandering around the world.

171
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,920
The most memorable thing was

172
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,920
that there was no one to be with

173
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,920
when it was cold.

174
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,920
When I was hungry,

175
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,920
I was hungry.

176
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,920
At that time, I really thought

177
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,920
that the world

178
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,920
was really like this.

179
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,920
But after I entered the Golden Cloud,

180
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,920
I realized that

181
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,920
there is a reason.

182
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,920
There must be

183
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,920
warmth and light

184
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,920
in this world.

185
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,920
As long as there is still faith in your heart,

186
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,920
the difficulties and pain

187
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,920
will eventually pass.

188
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,920
We understand that

189
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,920
the light in your heart

190
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,920
is extinguished.

191
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,920
But we

192
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,920
will always be with you

193
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,920
until the light in your heart

194
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,920
is extinguished.

195
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,920
Until the light in your heart

196
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,920
is extinguished.

197
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,920
Yunyi is right.

198
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,920
Tan, I don't have anything else.

199
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,920
But I have a lot of warmth.

200
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,920
Tan, I will always

201
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,920
be with you

202
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,920
and protect you.

203
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,920
Thank you.

204
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,920
Thank you.

205
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,920
Thank you.

206
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,920
Thank you.

207
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,920
It's delicious.

208
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,920
It's delicious.

209
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,920
It's delicious.

210
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,920
It's delicious.

211
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,920
I don't have any other idea.

212
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,920
But I have prepared a plan.

213
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,920
Just think of it as a good idea.

214
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,920
Just choose a girl

215
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,920
you like.

216
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,920
Take her to see her.

217
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,920
You are the commander of the army.

218
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,920
You can win her heart.

219
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,920
I invited you two

220
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,920
to discuss business.

221
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,920
Business?

222
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,920
Your wife's business is business.

223
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:00,920
I am not a business

224
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,920
if I marry her.

225
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,920
I have an idea.

226
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,920
There are only three

227
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,920
important things.

228
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,920
First, wash your hands and make soup.

229
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,920
Second, take your heart

230
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,920
and take care of your child.

231
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,920
Well said.

232
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,920
But Ah Xu is not good at cooking.

233
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,920
He is not a good cook.

234
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,920
He has no children.

235
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,920
He can only do what he likes.

236
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,920
How can he do what he likes?

237
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,920
What he likes

238
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,920
is what you like.

239
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,920
You have to follow what you like.

240
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,920
You have to do what you want.

241
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,920
You have to do what you want.

242
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,920
You have to sacrifice your life to be with your husband.

243
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,920
You have to love your wife.

244
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,920
In short, you have to do everything

245
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,920
for your wife.

246
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,920
Yes.

247
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,920
I love you.

248
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,920
Let's eat.

249
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,920
It doesn't look like a fight.

250
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,920
There seems to be a cut.

251
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:54,920
I'm used to it.

252
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,920
I always do things in a wrong way.

253
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:07,920
I'm afraid I'm too used to it.

254
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,920
You also cut off the new tooth that you just pulled.

255
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,920
I'm a little bit afraid to kill you.

256
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:24,920
Come on.

257
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:32,920
How can a person who has a lot of cultivation be more cruel than a man who kills his enemies?

258
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:35,920
It's a waste to force yourself to do something that you can't do.

259
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,920
What a stupid idea!

260
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:51,920
What a stupid idea!

261
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,920
These are all for me.

262
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:58,920
I know my cousin.

263
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,920
I asked my wife to go shopping today.

264
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,920
My wife wants to eat and buy something.

265
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:06,920
Please take her.

266
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,920
Now only my cousin can make my wife laugh.

267
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,920
I have to trouble my cousin to take care of it.

268
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,920
Is this the Jiang Qizhi I know?

269
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:21,920
I'll make Tan happy today because of your cousin.

270
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,920
Don't let the princess know about this.

271
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:27,920
Let's go.

272
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,920
Don't worry, cousin.

273
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:37,920
Tan.

274
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,920
I'll do everything you want to eat and buy today.

275
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:44,920
I've only been the manager for a few days, and I'm so rich.

276
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,920
I think Wen Tao's business is very good.

277
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,920
Princess, I want to buy a roast chicken.

278
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:53,920
But can you buy it from the palace?

279
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,920
I've spent all my monthly salary.

280
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,920
I usually spend it in the mansion.

281
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,920
I didn't see you spend it.

282
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:02,920
Where did you spend the money?

283
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,920
I bought a roast chicken.

284
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,920
I bought you a osmanthus cake yesterday.

285
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,920
I bought it for you.

286
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,920
I bought you osmanthus cake yesterday.

287
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:18,920
Where is it?

288
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:22,920
I'm done.

289
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,920
If there is no osmanthus cake, I won't give it to you.

290
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:30,920
Today, I'll make you a osmanthus cake.

291
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:32,920
I'm kidding.

292
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,920
You can just make a fortune from the palace.

293
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:36,920
Thank you, princess.

294
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:37,920
What fortune?

295
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:38,920
Today is the day of the festival.

296
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:39,920
Take it.

297
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:41,920
Thank you, sister.

298
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:43,920
I'll leave first.

299
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:45,920
Thank you.

300
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,920
Sister Min Min is so generous.

301
00:20:58,920 --> 00:20:59,920
I'll give you the rest.

302
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:00,920
Let's go.

303
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,920
You are free today.

304
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,920
Come with me to the capital camp.

305
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,920
There are some military reports from the north.

306
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,920
You need to discuss it before the court.

307
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:15,920
I'll go.

308
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:26,920
It's not today.

309
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,920
I have something else to do today.

310
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:29,920
Another day.

311
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,920
No, Shu Er.

312
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:33,920
Shu Er.

313
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,920
Take it, take it.

314
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,920
Okay.

315
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:41,920
Take it.

316
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:43,920
Thank you.

317
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,920
Here, take it.

318
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:47,920
Mr. Wen Zhou Zhou.

319
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,920
Miss Chicken Leg, you finally remember me.

320
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,920
I'll come back tomorrow if I want to eat something.

321
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:56,920
Why didn't you come back?

322
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,920
Mr. Wen Zhou Zhou, do you like roasted chicken?

323
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:05,920
I just happened to be here.

324
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,920
But I have no connection with roasted chicken.

325
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:11,920
He is so strange.

326
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:12,920
Strange?

327
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,920
What is the connection with a roasted chicken?

328
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:28,920
Really?

329
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31,920
This is for the last time you took me to buy delicious food.

330
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:33,920
You can't have more.

331
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:34,920
I only have one.

332
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:37,920
Thank you, Miss Chicken Leg.

333
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:43,920
Hurry up.

334
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:46,920
Roasted chicken should be eaten while it's hot.

335
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:48,920
Okay.

336
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:53,920
It's tender and juicy.

337
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,920
It's not greasy.

338
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:55,920
It's worth a try.

339
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,920
This roasted chicken is really good.

340
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:03,920
But it's not as good as the one our lord made.

341
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:07,920
Lord?

342
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,920
Lord?

343
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:12,920
Ah Xu made roasted chicken for you?

344
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,920
I don't know what you call me.

345
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:21,920
I'm Yun Yi.

346
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:22,920
I'm the aunt of the mansion.

347
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:24,920
Aunt?

348
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:29,920
I have to buy osmanthus cake.

349
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:31,920
I'll go first.

350
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:33,920
Okay.

351
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,920
Roasted chicken is sold for 50 times a day.

352
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,920
If you want to eat it, you have to come early.

353
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:50,920
Ah Xu?

354
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,920
When did he get the aunt?

355
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:06,920
Mr. Tan, I found a few days ago that the jewelry sold by a merchant is very unique.

356
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:07,920
You must like it.

357
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:08,920
It's right there.

358
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,920
Look, do you have any interest in it?

359
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,920
The style of the hairpin is really different.

360
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:25,920
You want to add a bandage?

361
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:27,920
You two are very talented.

362
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:28,920
You have a great taste.

363
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:29,920
I really like it.

364
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:30,920
You have a great temperament.

365
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:31,920
You have a great taste.

366
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,920
This hairpin is a high-class goods.

367
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,920
The jewelry on top is very beautiful.

368
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,920
If you wear it, you will be like a fairy.

369
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,920
The pattern on top is also very unique.

370
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,920
It doesn't look like a big pearl.

371
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,920
May I ask you, where did you get this jewelry?

372
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:54,920
How can I tell you?

373
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:58,920
If everyone knows my source of goods, how can I win?

374
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,920
I think it's from the sea.

375
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:05,920
I see that there are obvious traces of the wind and stone on it.

376
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:07,920
It can't be sold at a high price.

377
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:12,920
To be honest, these goods are indeed from the sea.

378
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,920
The ancient ones are more extraordinary.

379
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,920
In the big sea, there is no gold and oil.

380
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,920
If you have any interest, please let me know.

381
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:20,920
I will buy it.

382
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,920
I will buy it.

383
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:24,920
I will buy it.

384
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:26,920
I will buy it.

385
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:28,920
I will buy it.

386
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:30,920
I won't make a lot of money.

387
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:31,920
I won't make any money.

388
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:32,920
I will buy it as a friend.

389
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:35,920
I will keep the goods in the future.

390
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:37,920
I want all of these.

391
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:38,920
Really?

392
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:41,920
If there is a new one in the future, please keep it for me.

393
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:43,920
You are so kind.

394
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,920
Boss Mingming, buy it.

395
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:52,920
It's really good to bring these jewelry out.

396
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:56,920
But this head of yours may not be here every day.

397
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,920
How can I give it to you later?

398
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,920
I live in Datong Inn, which is next to the street.

399
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:02,960
My last name is Zhu.

400
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,840
We'll talk here for the next few days.

401
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,320
Tan is a good man.

402
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,480
You wanted to live with him

403
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,120
when you found out about the merchant.

404
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,000
Such a thing

405
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,360
will be a hit soon.

406
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,800
And the business of Cuo Jing Pavilion will be better.

407
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,080
If so,

408
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,320
Cuo Jing Pavilion will be in a big trouble.

409
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,640
The mansion will be in trouble too.

410
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,200
Why?

411
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,680
The pattern on the top

412
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,480
and the style

413
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,200
are not for the big picture.

414
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,600
I'm suspicious of it.

415
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,680
So you were trying to find out where he lives

416
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:50,440
and found out that he lives in the inn.

417
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:51,960
You should have thought

418
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,720
you shouldn't have changed your mind after doing this business.

419
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,200
You can't see these things in the light.

420
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,200
I'm sorry.

421
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,200
Father's case

422
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,400
was involved in the theft.

423
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:06,360
So the court ruled that father was guilty of colluding with the enemy.

424
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,880
Since these things have been left in Shangjing,

425
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,960
it means it's not a temporary thing.

426
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:13,120
I suspect someone is plotting against them

427
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,920
and framed father for theft.

428
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,840
But even so,

429
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:23,040
it doesn't prove that it has nothing to do with uncle.

430
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:26,440
These things are all from the sea.

431
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,160
And I'm in danger.

432
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:29,960
I have only one way to save myself.

433
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,160
Lingzhou.

434
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:46,600
Your Highness,

435
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,760
two soldiers from Yangxi Road came to see you.

436
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,640
They claim to be the former subordinates of Jing An.

437
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,560
Bring them in.

438
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,240
Bring them in.

439
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,320
Greetings, Your Highness.

440
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,200
Stand up and speak.

441
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,320
Thank you, Your Highness.

442
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:09,720
Your Highness,

443
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,080
we are former subordinates of Jing An.

444
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,600
Guo Bing Mao was promoted to the new official.

445
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,600
He was killed in the name of training soldiers.

446
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,880
Those who disobeyed him

447
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,480
were killed.

448
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,720
We had to run away

449
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:22,960
from the city.

450
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,160
We came to see you

451
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,160
because we didn't want to see you die.

452
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,520
We also wanted you to investigate this case thoroughly.

453
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:30,880
Did you two

454
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,560
participate in the case?

455
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,240
Yes.

456
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,040
We have been pursuing the Marquis for a long time.

457
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,480
We know his character.

458
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,520
We tried to fight against the disaster in Lizhou.

459
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,240
We did it out of our own will.

460
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:43,680
But after it happened,

461
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,880
many people say

462
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,160
that they were forced by the soldiers from Yangxi Road.

463
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,320
We investigated them in secret.

464
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:50,880
But we found that

465
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,400
those soldiers who disobeyed him

466
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,160
were all friends of Guo Bing Mao.

467
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,920
There must be a secret.

468
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,240
It's a pity that

469
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:00,920
Guo Bing Mao was killed in Yangxi Road.

470
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,560
We really couldn't do anything

471
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,560
but come to you.

472
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:07,000
You two stay in the camp for now.

473
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,240
You can go first.

474
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,560
I will investigate

475
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,000
what you said.

476
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,000
Thank you, Your Highness.

477
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,240
I'll leave now.

478
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,840
Find out the source of these two.

479
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,480
If they are telling the truth,

480
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,080
Yangxi Road will be destroyed.

481
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,720
The army will be destroyed.

482
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:27,960
Yes.

483
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,080
Your Highness.

484
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Your Highness.

485
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,600
The emperor wants to see you.

486
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:40,000
We came to ask for you.

487
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,760
We have something to ask you.

488
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,160
Please tell us what you need.

489
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,480
We don't need to see you.

490
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,000
I want to ask you

491
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
to play a play for me.

492
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:58,880
Sir.

493
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,080
Have a look.

494
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,440
Do you like it?

495
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,080
It's good.

496
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,400
The top is very colorful.

497
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:07,560
Hit him.

498
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,440
This...

499
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,720
What are you doing?

500
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:12,760
Do you know

501
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,280
what is the crime of selling stolen goods?

502
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:17,920
I'm not doing a small business.

503
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,960
I don't know what is the crime of selling stolen goods.

504
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:20,880
Take it away.

505
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:21,920
Take it away.

506
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:22,840
Take it away.

507
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,440
Is there any law?

508
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:25,200
Let's go.

509
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,040
This...

510
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,120
This...

511
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,240
Tell me.

512
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,120
Where did these stolen goods come from?

513
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,560
It's a big misunderstanding.

514
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,240
What is this stolen goods?

515
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,480
I bought these goods with my own money.

516
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,880
You can't talk nonsense

517
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,080
when they are really valuable.

518
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,280
Sir.

519
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,080
What is your background?

520
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,400
If you want to be rich,

521
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,360
let me go.

522
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,440
I'll go to get the money for you.

523
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:49,880
I'm asking for money.

524
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,040
But I don't want a small one like you.

525
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:55,160
Tell me who stole your goods.

526
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,640
Then I can let you go.

527
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:57,720
Otherwise,

528
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,960
I'll chop you up right away.

529
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:11,640
It seems that you don't see the coffin and don't cry.

530
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,400
Chop his hands off.

531
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,000
Let's see how long he can hold on.

532
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,000
No.

533
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,080
No.

534
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,360
No.

535
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:20,800
I said

536
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,600
it was a jewelry shop in Lingzhou.

537
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:24,440
It's called Fulu Golden Bracelet.

538
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:25,240
It's the name of the shopkeeper.

539
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,960
He asked someone to empty the goods for me.

540
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,760
You should have told me earlier.

541
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,360
Take him away.

542
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,920
Ayu is missing.

543
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,320
The secret message came back from Lingzhou to Shangjing.

544
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,920
It will take at least half a month.

545
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:49,160
Ayu was missing at least half a month ago.

546
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,760
Now he is missing.

547
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,520
I don't dare to complain

548
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,160
that you want Ayu to share the burden of the court.

549
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,120
But Ayu has been spoiled since childhood.

550
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,120
How can she know the danger outside?

551
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,720
Now Fuli doesn't know this.

552
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,000
If she knows,

553
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,960
how can she hold on?

554
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:11,040
I told you not to make it public.

555
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,200
Your Majesty.

556
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,600
It's a big deal.

557
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:16,600
I can't hide it.

558
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,760
If Ayu knows the 남 conveniently,

559
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,920
she'll get it back from someone else.

560
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:41,100

00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,880
That's okay.

562
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:49,920
Your Majesty, Ayu is not yet married and has a child.

563
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:53,920
If something happens to her, how can I explain to my parents?

564
00:32:56,920 --> 00:33:00,920
Your Majesty, I was the one who sent Ayu to Lingzhou.

565
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:03,920
I can't let this matter go unpunished.

566
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:06,920
I have decided to go to Lingzhou personally.

567
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:09,920
I will definitely bring Ayu back, no matter what.

568
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,920
You are going to Lingzhou?

569
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:15,920
I have been investigating the matter of Lingzhou for a few months.

570
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:19,920
I suspect that someone in Yangxilu has a second child.

571
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:23,920
Do you remember who recommended Guo Bingmao to go to Lingzhou

572
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:26,920
to take over the disaster relief project?

573
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:29,920
The current situation in the court is not good.

574
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:32,920
Lingzhou is the only breakthrough.

575
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:36,920
Moreover, the case of Lingzhou involves the death of a private investor.

576
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:40,920
I'm afraid Lingzhou is not as simple as the problem of Fushun.

577
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:45,920
I will definitely go.

578
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:14,920
Your Highness, the food is getting cold.

579
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,920
Why don't you eat first?

580
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:19,920
I will send it to the princess when she comes back.

581
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:37,920
Your Highness, you are worried about the matter of Lingzhou.

582
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:40,920
Are you worried about the princess?

583
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:46,920
If I propose to take the princess to Lingzhou,

584
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:50,920
I will take her to the outside world.

585
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,920
Do you think she will agree?

586
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:56,920
Your Highness, you can ask her. Maybe she will agree.

587
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,920
It's better to go to Lingzhou.

588
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:03,920
I don't want her to be in danger.

589
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:15,920
I made the white fish soup that you like.

590
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:18,920
You are hungry after a day of shopping.

591
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:21,920
Why don't I take you to eat?

592
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,920
No need.

593
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:34,920
Something happened to Ayu in Lingzhou. I need to go there as soon as possible.

594
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:38,920
I'm not here. You need to take care of yourself.

595
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,920
Take care of yourself.

596
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:43,920
Take care of yourself.

597
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:47,920
Take care of yourself.

598
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:50,920
Take care of yourself.

599
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:53,920
How is the situation now?

600
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,920
I don't know.

601
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,920
I have sent the secret guards to investigate.

602
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:02,920
When the military affairs are arranged, I will go to Lingzhou.

603
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:07,920
Today, you can help me.

604
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,920
We can have lunch together.

605
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:16,920
I want to go to Lingzhou together.

606
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:21,920
Don't check up on me.

607
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,920
Princess Consort, everything has been done.

608
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:46,860
I'm sorry.

609
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:51,900
Your Highness has always been close with him.

610
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:53,660
So there isn't any solid news.

611
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:57,680
The most important thing for Your Highness to go to Lingzhou is to find out the truth.

612
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:00,100
He has sent the secret guards to go there first.

613
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:02,900
He'll let you know once he has any news.

614
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:03,900
Don't worry too much.

615
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:07,100
The news about the secret guards is that they were missing.

616
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:09,860
At least it means that the spy didn't fall into the hands of Zhang.

617
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:13,680
But you're obviously worried about the death of Zhang.

618
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:19,680
I'm just...

619
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:23,920
I'm just doing business with him.

620
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,420
I have to care about him.

621
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:30,920
Besides, I don't want to be the only one in Wen Tao's life.

622
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:34,920
I just hope that he'll come back soon.

623
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:36,980
I don't want to be the only one in Wen Tao's life.

624
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:39,980
I just hope that he'll come back soon.

625
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:41,980
I've already ordered the spy to move in advance.

626
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:44,980
Go to Lingzhou and contact the secret guards around Ayu.

627
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:47,980
The last place of the Qingyun Guards is the remote part of Lingzhou.

628
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:50,980
I think Ayu has already gotten rid of the Su family's pursuit.

629
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:54,980
I don't know if Ayu has escaped.

630
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:57,980
The Su family is really a man of the law.

631
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:59,980
They even ignored the danger and killed Ayu.

632
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,040
I'm sorry.

633
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:06,040
The Su family must be very worried about this.

634
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:10,040
Before we enter Lingzhou, we must be very low-key.

635
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:12,040
We must be very careful.

636
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:15,040
Tan, are you really going to Lingzhou with your lord?

637
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:19,040
You've never even been to the capital city.

638
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,040
Lingzhou is a long journey.

639
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,040
You must be tired.

640
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,040
Can you handle it?

641
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:26,040
I've already decided.

642
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:28,040
I'm not afraid of this.

643
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:31,100
I'll be in the capital city alone for a few months.

644
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:34,100
I can't stand it when I'm alone in the capital city.

645
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:36,100
You'll be back soon.

646
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:40,100
But it's been so long.

647
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:43,100
You still don't want to be in the front line with your lord.

648
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:46,100
You can just enjoy yourself.

649
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:48,100
It's better than staying in the mansion.

650
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:52,100
I heard that there are 180 hotels in Lingzhou.

651
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,100
You can see them all in one go.

652
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:55,100
There are also small hotels in the city.

653
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:57,160
There are also women who are very attractive.

654
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:59,160
They are very attractive.

655
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:01,160
It's good that you're with her.

656
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:03,160
So that your lord can bring back a girl.

657
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:06,160
Then you can really make a good impression on the mansion.

658
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,160
If she really enters the gentle country,

659
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:13,160
I will also find my own heaven and earth.

660
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:15,160
Then I can recover my poison body.

661
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:17,160
I can also consider it a kind of relief.

662
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:19,160
But it's not possible to separate.

663
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:21,160
I have to give her a divorce.

664
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:24,160
That's how I can be in my own right.

665
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:28,160
You wrote a divorce letter to your lord.

666
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,160
You are really a man of great wisdom.

667
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,160
If I really get there,

668
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,160
I'm prepared.

669
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,160
Just kidding.

670
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,160
You really think about it.

671
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:44,160
If you really get there,

672
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,160
what else do you need to prepare?

673
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:47,160
Of course I'm going to call someone to go to the temple.

674
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:49,160
I'll tear off the unprotected city.

675
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:51,160
No, no, no.

676
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,160
Your lordship,

677
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,160
have you packed up the carriage?

678
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,160
Should we load the carriage together?

679
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,160
Your lordship,

680
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,160
you always go out with light clothes.

681
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,160
How can you arrange it like this?

682
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:15,160
I've served the mansion for a long time.

683
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:19,160
I've seen a lot of scenes of the old princess traveling.

684
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:22,160
But this kind of battle is really unheard of.

685
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:26,160
Your lordship,

686
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,160
the new clothes are almost done.

687
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,160
Qizhi,

688
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:34,160
all the carriage is packed with luggage.

689
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:38,160
You have to prepare five carriage to go to the temple.

690
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,160
The journey to Lingzhou is long.

691
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:42,160
I have to prepare for you.

692
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:49,160
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

693
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:54,220
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

694
00:40:58,220 --> 00:41:00,220
Ten carriages are enough.

695
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:02,220
My cousin is really good at it.

696
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:04,220
Tan is really a good match.

697
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:12,220
This is the luggage that you personally arranged for the princess.

698
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:13,220
What do you need on the road?

699
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:15,220
Just need to put the number on the carriage.

700
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:17,220
It's easy to get things when you put them together.

701
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,280
Your highness, please order.

702
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:20,280
I'll go and get it.

703
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:33,280
I didn't know that Qizhi had a good family.

704
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:36,280
I wonder how he organized the luggage.

705
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:44,280
The first carriage is going to be done.

706
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:46,280
The journey to Lingzhou is long and it's a long journey.

707
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:47,340
You have to prepare for the journey.

708
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:49,340
So I prepared the sword.

709
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:52,340
I put the silk on the door and the bamboo curtain.

710
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:56,340
It's not hot in the car, but it's cool.

711
00:41:57,340 --> 00:41:58,340
There's a cabinet on the table.

712
00:41:58,340 --> 00:42:00,340
You can put things you want.

713
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:02,340
I put the softener on the step.

714
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:04,340
The last layer is made of silk.

715
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:06,340
It's not hot in the car.

716
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:08,340
Except for the last carriage,

717
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:10,340
the carriage is full of clothes, food and dry food.

718
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:12,340
The princess's clothes are luxurious and luxurious.

719
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:14,340
It's good for her to survive.

720
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,400
The prince told me that

721
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:19,400
the carriage with clothes needs to be covered with cowhide.

722
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:23,400
And the carriage with food needs to be covered with blood.

723
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:27,400
Put the 42 incense candles on the carriage.

724
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,400
Don't miss any of them.

725
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,400
Yes.

726
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:31,400
And put the softener on the carriage.

727
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:32,400
Yes.

728
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:38,400
It's a good thing that Tan can marry such a good husband.

729
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:41,400
I know you're going to Lingzhou.

730
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:43,400
The prince chose the carriage and the dress

731
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,400
for the princess.

732
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:47,400
He wanted to make the princess feel comfortable

733
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,400
even on the way.

734
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,400
Look at this.

735
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,400
The prince might think that

736
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:55,400
he's going to take care of the princess.

737
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:56,400
He's not coming back.

738
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,400
Just the dress.

739
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,400
Why do you bring an empty carriage?

740
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:05,400
The business is prosperous in Lingzhou.

741
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:07,400
We'll go to the big city and ride the needle.

742
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:08,400
With the empty carriage,

743
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,400
we'll go to the big city and ride the needle.

744
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:11,400
With the empty carriage,

745
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:13,400
the princess can buy the clothes.

746
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,400
She can use it or use it as a bracelet.

747
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:17,400
Don't worry about the wedding.

748
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:21,400
I admire your thoughtfulness.

749
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:24,400
No wonder you're the earliest one among us.

750
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:27,400
We used to be the best in the family.

751
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:29,400
Now we're the best in the family.

752
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:31,400
We're the best in the family.

753
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:34,400
I need to ask you a lot.

754
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:39,400
The journey is the most important thing.

755
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:41,400
It doesn't matter how the journey is.

756
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:45,400
But it's inconvenient to go to Lingzhou.

757
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:49,400
Please cut the carriage into two pieces.

758
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:51,400
One for Tan.

759
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:53,400
One for you.
