1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I am not a man.

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I am a woman.

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I am a man.

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I am a woman.

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I am a woman.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I am a woman.

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I am a woman.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I am a woman.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I am a woman.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I am a woman.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I am a woman.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I am a woman.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I am a woman.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I am a woman.

15
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
wife

16
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Money

17
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,840
colour

18
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
chatter

19
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
у

20
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
well

21
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,500
Men

22
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Come on.

23
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,640
It's him.

24
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,200
After him!

25
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,640
We won't be here today, right?

26
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,640
Look!

27
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,640
Help!

28
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,640
Help!

29
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,640
Help!

30
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,840
Help!

31
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Help!

32
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,520
Shizham, help!

33
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,520
Shizham, help!

34
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Shizham!

35
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
He might know us, it's him.

36
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,480
Is everything right, you two?

37
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,680
Yes.

38
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,680
Thank you very much.

39
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,800
Shizham, thank you.

40
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,400
It's okay. Thank you.

41
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,400
Get in!

42
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,000
Why didn't you knock?

43
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,400
You're not a royal daughter.

44
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,800
Why are you so rude?

45
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,400
What are you doing here?

46
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,400
You're hurt.

47
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,400
I'm here to apply medicine.

48
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,600
I can do it myself.

49
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I won't bother you anymore.

50
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,400
Zhang Huaiyue, are you shy?

51
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,000
No.

52
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,600
I'm a man.

53
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,800
Why should I be shy?

54
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,600
I'm a man of great danger.

55
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,200
I always pay attention to the people.

56
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,000
I respect men and women.

57
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,200
You and I are men and women.

58
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,400
It's not good to treat each other so sincerely.

59
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,800
I'm doing this for your innocence.

60
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,400
Of course.

61
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,600
If you insist on applying medicine for me,

62
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,600
it's not bad.

63
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,400
You're right.

64
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,400
I'm going to marry someone.

65
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,600
In that case, I'll do it myself.

66
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,800
You're here.

67
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,200
I've seen it.

68
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,400
I'm not very convenient.

69
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,800
Thank you, Miss Bai.

70
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,800
You don't respect men and women.

71
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,400
I'm a man.

72
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,600
You're so good at martial arts.

73
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,800
Why are you so arrogant?

74
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,400
I'm not good at martial arts.

75
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,600
If I'm not here today,

76
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,800
you'll all go home.

77
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,000
It hurts!

78
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,400
I'll try to be gentle.

79
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,600
It hurts!

80
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,400
I know!

81
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,200
It hurts!

82
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,000
I have blood on my hands.

83
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,000
Be gentle!

84
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,600
I'll try to be gentle!

85
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,400
You're the one who sent the princess here.

86
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,400
Forgive me, Your Highness.

87
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Jiu Rou, it's none of your business.

88
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,400
But His Highness

89
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,600
is trying to find out the truth.

90
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,400
Jiu Rou is in danger.

91
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,400
She's the murderer of the child.

92
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,600
If this situation is exposed,

93
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,200
who can ensure that everything is fine?

94
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,400
I...

95
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,000
I've planned it.

96
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
If it wasn't for the rescue of Lord Zhang,

97
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,400
we would have been in danger.

98
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,200
This is your plan.

99
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,600
Where is the right thing to do?

100
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,200
Whose fault is it?

101
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,400
No, I...

102
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,400
How can His Highness do such a thing?

103
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,600
Your Highness, you're mistaken.

104
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,000
His Highness has planned it.

105
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,600
He's been in a dangerous place.

106
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,400
Jiu Rou is in a mess.

107
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,600
She's in a bad situation.

108
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,800
Jiu Rou, you don't have to be sorry for her.

109
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,200
His Highness is very cautious.

110
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,200
He doesn't care about others' safety.

111
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,600
He doesn't care about the consequences.

112
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,200
I've discussed with him.

113
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,400
How can I not worry about the consequences?

114
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,400
I didn't follow the plan.

115
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,600
I don't blame you.

116
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,200
Jiu Rou, you're a woman of high rank.

117
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,200
You'll be scared and scared when you're in danger.

118
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,000
It's not right to mess things up.

119
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,400
If she wants to investigate, then do it.

120
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,400
Why are you being so rude?

121
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,800
Your Highness, what you're doing

122
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,600
is giving me a chance to make a contribution.

123
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,000
Fortunately, His Majesty and the officials

124
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,600
are pleading for my mother and me.

125
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,000
I won't be punished for this.

126
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,200
Your Highness, you're not clear about the truth.

127
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,000
I'm the one who should be blamed.

128
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,600
Do you know what the consequences are?

129
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:22,200
Jiu Rou, you were scared just now.

130
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,400
How about I take you to rest?

131
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,000
Your Highness, I'm fine.

132
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,800
You're fine.

133
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,200
You fell down just now.

134
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,600
Let's see if you're hurt.

135
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,200
Let me do it.

136
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,200
I...

137
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,200
Zhang Hanyu!

138
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,400
Min Min, why are you here?

139
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,000
It's dinner time. Do you want to join us?

140
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,200
I thought that chicken soup is the best.

141
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,800
So I brought a bowl for you.

142
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,400
But you have all the ingredients.

143
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,800
I don't think I need them.

144
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,000
I...

145
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,400
Min Min!

146
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:25,000
Min Min, you don't have chicken soup.

147
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,200
Shui Ying, take these away.

148
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,400
I want to drink chicken soup.

149
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,600
What a coincidence!

150
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:47,000
This soup is made by you?

151
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,800
Let me taste it.

152
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:58,000
The color and taste of the soup is very delicious.

153
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
It's very delicious.

154
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,600
Then eat it, Your Highness.

155
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,200
Thank you, Min Min.

156
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,600
You have Shui Ying, Yun Xue Ying and me.

157
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,000
I can't find any of them.

158
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,400
I'll go to get Shui Ying for you.

159
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,000
No, no, no.

160
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
No, no, no.

161
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,600
No, no, no.

162
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,400
I'll call her to ruin the atmosphere.

163
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:31,000
My hand is injured.

164
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,400
It's not convenient.

165
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,200
Really?

166
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,600
I remember that you hurt your back.

167
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,400
Why are you putting on makeup with your hand?

168
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,600
You...

169
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,600
The doctor said that you can't move your arm.

170
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,200
How is it?

171
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,600
Is it delicious?

172
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,400
This soup...

173
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,400
The heat is quite strong.

174
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,200
Actually, it's quite delicious.

175
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:16,400
But maybe it's because I added too much salt.

176
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:20,800
If you can put some pepper and sesame oil on the soup,

177
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,600
the taste will be...

178
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,600
Stop drinking.

179
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,600
No, no.

180
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,600
I...

181
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,300
My love, I love you very much.

182
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,000
King Dingbei sent letter to Zhang Qian about Gu Jin Zhong.

183
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,200
I discovered that

184
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:50,200
the letter was only with sick officers his mondo.

185
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,400
Nothing to do with Prime Minister.

186
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,640
I haven't seen her recently.

187
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,120
She may not be the great fortune teller.

188
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:00,320
But he definitely knows.

189
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:04,280
He opened his mind to the trend.

190
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,280
He thought it would be Hertari Beans.

191
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,600
The whole game is full of traps.

192
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:10,560
It's lucky Tr令n Sir did not succeed.

193
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,340
The incident is finally sections till now.

194
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,640
Prime minister,

195
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,480
Now most important happened hand to hand completely.

196
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,400
I'm afraid that he will be hard to take over in the future.

197
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,400
It doesn't matter if he is hard to take over.

198
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:33,400
There is one person who can control you.

199
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,400
Who is it?

200
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,400
The eldest son of Marquis Jiangyang.

201
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,400
He is the son of the late Emperor.

202
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,400
He is the son of the late Emperor.

203
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,400
He is the son of the late Emperor.

204
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,400
The eldest son of Marquis Jiangyang.

205
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,400
Gao Chen.

206
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,400
Gao Chen just died a year ago.

207
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,400
He is in a critical condition.

208
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,400
This is the biggest event of Marquis Jiangyang.

209
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,400
If the Prime Minister can get married,

210
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:06,400
the relationship will be very different.

211
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:33,900
Cousin

212
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,400
Let the likes accelerate.

213
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,400
Leave them to Cousin.

214
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,400
I won't bother.

215
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,400
It hurts.

216
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,400
Pops, so light.

217
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,400
Whatever the see, please agree.

218
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,840
I went to see Gu Jiu Rou.

219
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,400
I didn't expect it would be dangerous.

220
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Jiu Rou is my handkerchief.

221
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,520
She suddenly left the capital.

222
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,560
I was worried about her.

223
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,760
So I went to see her.

224
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,320
How did I know it would be so dangerous?

225
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,440
You are so kind.

226
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,000
I left the palace today.

227
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,120
I'm not in the city.

228
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,240
Why don't you care about me like this?

229
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,240
Then...

230
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,720
...

231
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,280
Your highness are out here every day.

232
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:24,480
And you never tell your連 antidote in your mansion.

233
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,280
If you don't go out a day,

234
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,680
your mansion will beсь pleasant and peaceful.

235
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:33,200
My consort is right.

236
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,080
What's wrong?

237
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,080
I...

238
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,080
I...

239
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,080
It hurts.

240
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,080
I'm sorry.

241
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,080
My hand is a little heavy.

242
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:14,080
I'm willing to draw your wings.

243
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:18,080
Time can laugh at our truth.

244
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,080
Is this really him?

245
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,080
Gentle and considerate.

246
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,080
He is fearless.

247
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,080
I'll do these little things myself.

248
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,080
I won't bother you.

249
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,080
Your wound is not water.

250
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,080
I'll clean it for you.

251
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,080
I...

252
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:45,080
Shui's Family

253
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,080
Prince, don't be so rude.

254
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:51,080
If anyone sees it, it's a bad thing.

255
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,080
What's not good?

256
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,080
Well...

257
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:03,080
Why do you think it's not good if anyone sees it?

258
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:07,080
If it's not good, then what about Shui?

259
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:14,720
Please tell me in detail.

260
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,480
I'm willing to hear your story.

261
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,480
It's late.

262
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,440
Please take a bath and rest early.

263
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,400
I'm a little tired today.

264
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,920
I want to rest early.

265
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,480
Okay.

266
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,280
Come on.

267
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,720
Take a bath.

268
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,080
Yes.

269
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:50,960
How many people are taking a bath?

270
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:54,600
One or two?

271
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,920
And the bucket?

272
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,640
One or two?

273
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,000
You're asking me?

274
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,680
It's a couple bath.

275
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,360
Why do you need two buckets?

276
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,200
What?

277
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,200
You didn't see that?

278
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,720
It's the prince's idea.

279
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,280
Yes.

280
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,280
I didn't expect that.

281
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,240
Please, Your Highness.

282
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,680
Me?

283
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,600
Su Xie.

284
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,840
You're so thoughtful.

285
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:41,040
You said that I can't drink water.

286
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,320
Then I'll drink it.

287
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,880
What are you doing?

288
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:55,000
You want me to take a bath first.

289
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:09,120
You want to see me take a bath?

290
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,880
What's so good about it?

291
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,440
I don't need it anyway.

292
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:38,160
I'm okay.

293
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,240
Then take me over.

294
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,200
Hello!

295
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,640
Hello!

296
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,360
Hello, Your Highness.

297
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,720
Seven fingers hidden.

298
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,200
Are you warm and cozy?

299
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,080
Yes, I am warm and cozy x2

300
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,360
How can this be?

301
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:10,600
Creamy

302
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:25,640
Sorry...

303
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,280
Her Highnesses, please watch my face

304
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,280
I'm sorry.

305
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,280
It's okay.

306
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:44,280
But I have something to tell you.

307
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:48,280
He just wants to be honest with me.

308
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,280
Don't be so anxious.

309
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,280
What I'm going to say next,

310
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,280
please listen to it yourself.

311
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,280
I'm sorry.

312
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,280
Please go ahead.

313
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,280
I'm healthy.

314
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,280
I have no problem.

315
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:17,280
I used to be a woman.

316
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,280
But I'm not a man.

317
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,280
I'm a man.

318
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,280
I'm healthy.

319
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,280
Healthy?

320
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,280
What healthy?

321
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,280
What did you say?

322
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,280
So,

323
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,280
my husband is healthy?

324
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,280
How healthy?

325
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,280
How healthy?

326
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,280
How do you know?

327
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,280
If you have any questions,

328
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,280
you can ask me directly.

329
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,280
I'm happy to answer and solve your questions.

330
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,280
After all, I'm not a man.

331
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,280
It's nonsense.

332
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,280
It can't solve your problem.

333
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,280
I'm sorry.

334
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,280
I'm sorry.

335
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:55,280
Immediately connect till you solve your problems.

336
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,280
The reasons that circle恩호 handled case

337
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:15,280
must be��

338
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,280
只有 bir Buck A Music

339
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:21,280
to save him from any trouble.

340
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:28,080
I have seen the candidates for the post of Jing Zhao Yin.

341
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:33,880
Do you have any suggestions?

342
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:38,040
Your Majesty, I think that among these candidates,

343
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,040
Marquis Jiangyang is the only one who is strong.

344
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:42,240
He has a high reputation in the old city.

345
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,240
He is the right candidate for Jing Zhao Yin.

346
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:50,520
Your Majesty, Marquis Jiangyang is polite and honest.

347
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,920
Although he has been in the capital for many years,

348
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,920
he still has a reputation in the capital.

349
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:58,320
I think he is the right candidate for Jing Zhao Yin.

350
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:01,320
Since you have a consensus,

351
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,320
it's settled then.

352
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:12,520
Your Majesty, I have another thing to report.

353
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:15,320
Marquis Jing An has been in charge of Yangxi Road for many years.

354
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,720
And Prince Dingbei is the commander of the Dingbei Army.

355
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:20,120
Both of them are the best in the army.

356
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,720
Now that they are married,

357
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,520
they should have something in common.

358
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,120
I ask Your Majesty to replace Yang Xilu,

359
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,120
the commander of the Yangxi Road,

360
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:30,120
with Marquis Jing An.

361
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:36,320
You have been talking about this in Changming Palace.

362
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,920
I think that the commander of the Yi Army

363
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:40,120
is as easy as a sword and a sword.

364
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:42,120
You can talk about it.

365
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:45,720
It's just a matter of time before you hand over the military uniform.

366
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,520
But if you ask the court,

367
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,320
who can take over the military uniform?

368
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,520
Who can keep the morale of the army

369
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:55,120
and keep the peace?

370
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,720
Your Majesty,

371
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,320
after my daughter and Prince Dingbei got married,

372
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:12,320
I have thought about it.

373
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,320
I have been in the heaven for many years.

374
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:17,120
I have been through a lot of pain.

375
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,520
I hope Your Majesty can forgive me

376
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,920
and allow me to rest in peace.

377
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:25,120
As for the position of commander of the Yangxi Road,

378
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,120
I dare not to be biased.

379
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,520
I also ask Your Majesty to choose another talented person

380
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,720
to be the leader.

381
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:36,720
The commander of the Yangxi Road has been in the heaven for many years.

382
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,720
It's indeed not appropriate to make a move so easily.

383
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,120
And choosing another commander

384
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:48,120
is not a matter of time before you hand over the military uniform.

385
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:52,320
In this case, let's leave it as it is.

386
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:55,120
After the new commander is chosen,

387
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:59,720
I will hand over the military uniform and take over the capital.

388
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:02,920
I obey your order.

389
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:06,920
Your Majesty, since you have made your decision,

390
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:11,520
you should make the decision of taking over the military uniform.

391
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:15,120
I think that Marquis Jing'an has been in the heaven for many years.

392
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,320
He has made a great effort.

393
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:21,120
This time, we shouldn't make a move too easily.

394
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,920
In order to avoid hurting the soldiers of the border.

395
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,520
Of course.

396
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,920
The southern room under the 12th room of the Academy of Secret Service

397
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:30,120
is still empty compared to the He Dong room.

398
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:33,520
Why don't we send Marquis Jing'an into the Academy of Secret Service

399
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:36,520
and take him as the deputy commander of the two rooms?

400
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:41,520
What is the meaning of this proposal?

401
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:47,720
I thank Your Majesty for your grace.

402
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:59,320
Your Highness, on the eve of your wedding,

403
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:02,920
Grand Preceptor Liu has left the city. He returned to his home on the same day.

404
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,980
I always wait until you send me to my house,

405
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,520
or until you see me here.

406
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:16,720
What if I send you away?

407
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:21,020
What if you each other stay for a few days?

408
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,520
There won't be enough work.

409
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,120
Arrange.

410
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,120
Your Highness.

411
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:32,340
There will be no assent soon.

412
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:34,980
Commandery Prince, please don't hesitate.

413
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,680
Keep investigating.

414
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:47,900
No one can truly know himself.

415
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:54,860
There are some elixirs in this.

416
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:57,860
Jiu Rou, there is no need for us to be like this.

417
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,880
If there is no Prince and Princess,

418
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:03,280
Jiu Rou and mother will not have a chance to live.

419
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,520
Please tell Prince for me.

420
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,740
Thank him.

421
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:12,180
Thank him for giving me and mother a chance to live again.

422
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:14,620
I will definitely tell him.

423
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:18,380
I just don't know...

424
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:24,200
...if we still have a chance to meet again.

425
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:26,460
Don't worry, Princess.

426
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:31,300
Mother and I will take good care of ourselves and live in peace.

427
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:35,200
If I have time, I will definitely send a letter to you.

428
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:39,580
Now, I don't have any valuable items.

429
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:45,540
I only gave this embroidered silk to you to express my feelings.

430
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,000
This silk...

431
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
...I will definitely keep it well.

432
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:01,060
Princess, it's getting late.

433
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:03,600
I will take my leave now.

434
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:06,420
Princess, take care.

435
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Grandmother, I don't want to marry!

436
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
I don't want to marry!

437
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
I will never marry!

438
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
I am doing this for your own good.

439
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,500
If Grandmother really wanted to do this for me,

440
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,500
how could she let me be a concubine?

441
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:40,000
Moreover, that Gao Chen is a good-looking woman who is used to giving flowers and flowers.

442
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,000
If I marry him, I will ruin my life.

443
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Shut up.

444
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,500
Greetings, Your Highness.

445
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,500
Greetings, Your Highness.

446
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:53,500
Greetings, Your Highness.

447
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:54,500
Princess.

448
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:55,500
My Lord.

449
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,500
Please help me.

450
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:01,500
Grandmother wants me to marry the son of the Marquis of Jiangyang.

451
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:05,500
How could I be humiliated by my daughter?

452
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:09,500
Moreover, that Gao Chen is not a good person.

453
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:13,500
Princess.

454
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:20,500
This marriage is the best plan for you and the Su family.

455
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,500
You two have already agreed.

456
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,500
I am the only one who is blind.

457
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:31,500
No matter how you cry and make a scene today,

458
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,500
you cannot be blamed for this.

459
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:50,500
His Majesty has decided that the Marquis of Jiangyang will be the son of the Marquis of Jiangyang.

460
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:53,500
The Marquis of Jiangyang will be the son of the Marquis of Jingzhao.

461
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:57,500
Your marriage with Gao Chen cannot be delayed.

462
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:02,500
I will arrange for this to be considered as a match for Gao Chen.

463
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:07,500
I will definitely make them get married.

464
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:16,500
Tan.

465
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:19,500
Why did you buy so many things for His Highness?

466
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,500
He is already like that.

467
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,500
Why don't you dislike him?

468
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:26,500
It's all a misunderstanding.

469
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:29,500
His Highness has already explained it to me.

470
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:32,500
He has no problem.

471
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:34,500
I told you.

472
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,500
It's a misunderstanding.

473
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:38,500
It's good that the clouds are open and the clouds are clear.

474
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:41,500
I don't have to worry about you being in a bad mood.

475
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:47,500
When I came to you last time, I heard from my uncle.

476
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:51,500
My uncle and aunt arranged for many young men to meet you.

477
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:55,500
They are free to choose their own people.

478
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,500
I'm not in a hurry to marry. I'm not going.

479
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,500
How can that be?

480
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:01,500
How can a marriage be a joke?

481
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:04,500
Besides, you have to be satisfied with yourself.

482
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:06,500
Only then can my uncle and aunt be at ease.

483
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:10,500
Unless you have something in your heart.

484
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:13,500
Then you are a different story.

485
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:15,500
I...

486
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,500
Who has something in their heart?

487
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,500
Don't talk nonsense.

488
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,500
Don't you have?

489
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:24,500
I don't have.

490
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:25,500
I'll go.

491
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,500
I can't go.

492
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:30,500
Then next time you can go with me.

493
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:32,500
Yes.

494
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:35,500
It's still early.

495
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,500
Let's go to the opera house.

496
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,500
What new songs have been released recently?

497
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:40,500
I don't know.

498
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:41,500
Zhang Huayu said that as long as I go,

499
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:43,500
I'll be the best seat in Wen Tao's house.

500
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,500
Look at you.

501
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:50,500
Why don't you look at the road?

502
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,500
I'm sorry.

503
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:54,500
This child hasn't eaten for days.

504
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,500
He's hungry and he's hungry.

505
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,500
He didn't mean it.

506
00:33:58,500 --> 00:33:59,500
I'm really sorry.

507
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:01,500
Su Xi, get some money.

508
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,500
Hurry up.

509
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:06,500
Kneel down.

510
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:08,500
Thank you, madam.

511
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:09,500
What is this?

512
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:10,500
Thank you, madam.

513
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:11,500
Get up.

514
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:13,500
Thank you, madam.

515
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,500
Madam, let's get up first.

516
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:18,500
Madam, please give us some money.

517
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:19,500
I have to pay the debt.

518
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,500
I haven't eaten for a long time.

519
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:23,500
We can't afford to eat.

520
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:25,500
We really don't want to starve to death.

521
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,500
Let's get up first.

522
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,500
Listen to me.

523
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,500
Get up first.

524
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:32,500
Su Xi, get some more money.

525
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,500
Madam, you're really kind.

526
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:35,500
Thank you.

527
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:36,500
Thank you, madam.

528
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:39,500
Madam, where did you come from?

529
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:42,500
We came from Lige.

530
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:43,500
Lige?

531
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:44,500
Adam.

532
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:06,500
When did you get so many refugees?

533
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:07,500
Yes.

534
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:11,500
I didn't notice it when I went to the street a few days ago.

535
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:13,500
Go and buy some food.

536
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:14,500
Let's go.

537
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:15,500
There's food.

538
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,500
Let's go.

539
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:23,500
Be careful.

540
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:26,500
Be careful.

541
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,500
Sir.

542
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:32,500
What are you doing?

543
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:36,500
Sir, the princess ordered us to pack up the goods.

544
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:39,500
She ordered us to pack up the goods that we don't need.

545
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:41,500
And send them to the refugees.

546
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:47,500
Be careful.

547
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:48,500
Be careful.

548
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:07,500
Be careful.

549
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,500
Thank you.

550
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,500
Here.

551
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,500
Have some water.

552
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:14,500
Here.

553
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:15,500
Thank you.

554
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:18,500
Here.

555
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:50,500
Madam, what are you doing here?

556
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:53,500
I heard that there are many refugees in Shangjing.

557
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:54,500
I heard that...

558
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:57,500
I heard that madam is here.

559
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:58,500
I came to see her.

560
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:01,500
They all came from Lige.

561
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:04,500
Lige is a place of prosperity.

562
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:05,500
It's not a big deal.

563
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:09,500
The local governor only wants to hide it from everyone.

564
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:14,500
They came to Shangjing to report it.

565
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:15,500
They want to escape.

566
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:18,500
Thank you madam.

567
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,500
Thank you madam.

568
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:22,500
Madam, our house is ruined.

569
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:23,500
Our house is ruined.

570
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,500
We have no food.

571
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:29,500
Those refugees are not only dead.

572
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,500
They blocked our way.

573
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:32,500
We fled.

574
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,500
We fled all the way.

575
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:37,500
We thought we could get justice.

576
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:40,500
But the government didn't care about us.

577
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:41,500
We are sorry.

578
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:44,500
When the rain fell,

579
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,500
the Ministry of Works reported about the flood in Lige.

580
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,500
The Ministry of Revenue also reported about the flood.

581
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:52,500
We thought the flood was over.

582
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:54,500
We didn't expect that today,

583
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:57,500
Lige would be in a state of chaos.

584
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:01,500
Is this official a minister?

585
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,500
Are you going to help us?

586
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:06,500
Today, the Lord is helping us.

587
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,500
We are so sorry.

588
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:12,500
We are so sorry.

589
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:20,500
The flood in Lige has been going on for years.

590
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:23,500
It's a serious disaster.

591
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:25,500
Are all the officials in Lige dead?

592
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,500
Are you all deaf?

593
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,500
Why is there no news from the court?

594
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:32,500
Your Majesty,

595
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:36,500
the Ministry of Revenue said that the flood relief has been sent to the right place.

596
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:38,500
It can solve the problem of the refugees in Lige.

597
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:40,500
But according to what I saw today,

598
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:43,500
the Ministry of Revenue is in a state of deception.

599
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:48,500
Your Majesty,

600
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:51,500
the Ministry of Revenue would never dare to deceive the people.

601
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:54,500
I only knew this when you told me.

602
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:56,500
I think the officials in Lige were trying to hide it.

603
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:59,500
But the Ministry of Revenue is unable to find out the truth.

604
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:01,500
Please punish me, Your Majesty.

605
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:05,500
Please calm down, Your Majesty.

606
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:09,500
I think the priority is to send people to the disaster relief in Lige

607
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:11,500
to save the people from the flood.

608
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:16,500
The officials in Lige are all hiding it.

609
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,500
There must be a secret.

610
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:22,500
If Your Majesty can trust me,

611
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:23,500
my second son...

612
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:24,500
No.

613
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:28,500
Even if we go to Lige by order,

614
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,500
we may be attacked by assassins or sneak attacks.

615
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:31,500
I don't know how to dance.

616
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:33,500
I can't risk going there.

617
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:37,500
Your Majesty,

618
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,500
if we send officials in the emergency,

619
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:42,500
it will be difficult for those who are not familiar with the situation to do it.

620
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,500
And there are many bandits in the disaster relief area.

621
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,500
If there is no army escorting them,

622
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:48,500
I'm afraid that something will happen halfway.

623
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,500
So I think there is one person

624
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:53,500
who is going to the disaster relief in Lige.

625
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:54,500
Who?

626
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,500
Duke Jing An.

627
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,500
Duke Jing An has returned to the capital to work.

628
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:02,500
He is taking a group of soldiers from Yangxi Road to the disaster relief area.

629
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,500
He was in charge of the disaster relief in Xizhou a few years ago.

630
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:06,500
He is quite experienced.

631
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:08,500
I believe that Duke Jing An

632
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:10,500
can transport the money to Lige

633
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:13,500
to help the people of Lige to rebuild the disaster relief area.

634
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,500
Although it is urgent,

635
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:17,500
the Ministry of Revenue will prepare the money and supplies overnight.

636
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:20,500
I hope Duke Jing An can leave as soon as possible.

637
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:22,500
That's all we can do.

638
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:24,500
Send my order.

639
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:25,500
Send the gold order.

640
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:28,500
Tell Duke Jing An to leave overnight.

641
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:29,500
Yes.

642
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:38,500
Tomorrow,

643
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:42,500
I will take all the food and supplies from the mansion.

644
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:44,500
I can help one person to help another.

645
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,500
But this is not a long-term solution.

646
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:51,500
Even if we empty the supply,

647
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:54,500
the people of the disaster relief area are still in a state of despair.

648
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:55,500
Unfortunately,

649
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:59,500
if we can raise the capital

650
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:01,500
and make some long-term livelihoods

651
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:02,500
and give them to the refugees,

652
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:04,500
they will be able to live on their own.

653
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:07,500
But how can we raise the capital?

654
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,500
The Nuer family is just selling some embroidery.

655
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:13,500
But I only write novels.

656
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:15,500
I don't know how to help the women.

657
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:19,500
Writing novels is an idea.

658
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:21,500
Think about it.

659
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:23,500
The films of Wen Tao Ge have been played for so many years.

660
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:24,500
But people still watch them every day.

661
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:26,500
If you can write something different,

662
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:29,500
you will be very rich.

663
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:32,500
That's a good idea.

664
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:34,500
But how can I write something different?

665
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,500
Since we are in a state of disaster relief,

666
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:41,500
it's best to do it this way.

667
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:45,500
But if there is no long-term livelihoods,

668
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:48,500
it will be hard to keep listening to it.

669
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:50,500
Long-term livelihoods?

670
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:51,500
Long-term livelihoods?

671
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:55,500
Tan, how about

672
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:59,500
I write a new story with your and your lord's advice?

673
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:06,500
I think this idea is good.

674
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:09,500
It can also change the lord's reputation.

675
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:10,500
I will write a story for you.

676
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:12,500
What do you think?

677
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:13,500
No problem.

678
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:27,500
I heard that you are going to write a novel with Miss Bai Jia.

679
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:31,500
How do you know?

680
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:33,500
I heard it from Fushu when I came back.

681
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:39,500
The business is suddenly in a state of crisis.

682
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:42,500
I don't know what's going on in Lizhou.

683
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:44,500
The ladies are collecting money.

684
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:47,500
Mimi and I should also do something.

685
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:49,500
I don't know what to do.

686
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,500
I don't know what to do.

687
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:54,500
I and Mimi should also do something.

688
00:42:54,500 --> 00:43:12,200
I want to get the profit of the

689
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:16,200
But before that, the princess needs to eat.

690
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:20,200
If she can't even take care of herself, how can she help others?

691
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:44,200
I...

692
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:00,200
His majesty has sent the moon sign to Lizhou.

693
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:02,200
He will leave tonight.

694
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:04,200
I am going to send the moon sign.

695
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:06,200
Do you want to go with me?

696
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:08,200
It's not far away from Lizhou.

697
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:10,200
I think father can return soon.

698
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:11,200
I won't go.

699
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:31,740
Su Xing, go get my

700
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:35,200
I have a serious water epidemic in Lizhou.

701
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:38,460
Okay.
