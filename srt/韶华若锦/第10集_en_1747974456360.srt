1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:28,940
UU

2
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,220
in addition to this land.

3
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:48,860
Gotta make up for the incident.

4
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
What about the case in Gujing?

5
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
How is the battle going?

6
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
The Marquis of Chen'en is in a daze.

7
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
He will tell me the details after meeting his daughter.

8
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
But...

9
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I'm afraid it's not easy to find out the truth.

10
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I know a few people.

11
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
They are very close to each other.

12
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
They don't know how to make things up.

13
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
But even if it's difficult,

14
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
we have to keep going.

15
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Only if we don't know how to make things up,

16
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
we can't get rid of the trouble.

17
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
The court will be in a daze.

18
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
No matter how he makes things up,

19
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
there will be a hundred secrets.

20
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I will bring it to you.

21
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
How will you deal with the Gu family?

22
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
In a matter of law,

23
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
the Nandin is in a daze.

24
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
The Nandin is in a daze.

25
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
The Nandin is a very good person.

26
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
His Majesty is very good at being a good person.

27
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I have found out that

28
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
the Marquis of Chen'en is very talented.

29
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
His wife and his wife

30
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
have never been in a daze.

31
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
You are right.

32
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Ah Xu,

33
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
why do you come here?

34
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
This is...

35
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
the fate of the Princess.

36
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
How do I think that

37
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
you two are not married like a phoenix?

38
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
You are in love with each other?

39
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
You are worried about each other?

40
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
How is it?

41
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
How is the marriage?

42
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Not so much.

43
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It's just a bit of a problem.

44
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I asked you if you are worried about the problem.

45
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
What do you want to ask?

46
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I'm afraid.

47
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
It's just a way that you think.

48
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
The whole family is worried about you.

49
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
You are the only one who can do it.

50
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I don't expect you to be a married man

51
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
and suddenly open up.

52
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
But you are the one

53
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
who got married to the Marquis of Chen'en.

54
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
You can't be a burden.

55
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Yes.

56
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Why did you leave?

57
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
You stayed with the Princess

58
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
and went to the palace for dinner?

59
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
No.

60
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I'm sorry.

61
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I can't eat the lunch.

62
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Speaking of which,

63
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
the Princess is also in the Palace of the Marquis of Chen'en.

64
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
You even said that you would come back to the Palace of the Marquis of Chen'en.

65
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
But the distance between the two of you

66
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
is not as good as the time.

67
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Today, the Princess of Dingbei

68
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
is indeed very polite and kind.

69
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
No wonder she got the Empress Dowager's love at first sight.

70
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
The Princess of Dingbei is a very kind and kind woman.

71
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
She is also a family member of the Marquis of Chen'en.

72
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
She is very kind.

73
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
She is also very good at the Marquis of Chen'en.

74
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I'm afraid that

75
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I can't be with the Empress Dowager.

76
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I'm also very kind

77
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
to be praised by the Empress Dowager.

78
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
These years, the embroidery in the gold is really

79
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
very interesting.

80
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
It's the same old painting.

81
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
The Princess is looking at it.

82
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
She doesn't even know about the killing of the battlefield.

83
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Do you have any conversation with the Princess of Dingbei?

84
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Maybe from the royal family...

85
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
The princess will start nicer.

86
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
The juice isrowed

87
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
With all those real He did not wear it.

88
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Even a proper handlem,

89
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
instead of being his own mother,

90
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
which even they made once.

91
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
In today's embroidery,

92
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
behind all is always the Empress Dowager's Empress.

93
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I think it's more important to be close to each other.

94
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
To be a wife, to be warm and to deliver soup.

95
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
To talk more and to make things more normal.

96
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Maybe I can make you feel more at ease.

97
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I married a woman who was all over the capital.

98
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I can't wait to see her.

99
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
What can I do for you?

100
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I think she's hiding in a place without anyone.

101
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Don't worry, Princess.

102
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I'm as beautiful as the king.

103
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,000
All the things about the king are just rumors and rumors.

104
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
It's not true.

105
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Don't be stubborn.

106
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
No one knows what kind of personality the king is.

107
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Now I think it's really a good idea to marry her.

108
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
You're not even talking about the king.

109
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Is the king of Dingbei really you?

110
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Who else is the king of Dingbei except the king of Dingbei?

111
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,000
The one who's as soft as you is the one who's as mad as a maid.

112
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I can't believe it.

113
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Why don't we act as a family?

114
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Is there anyone?

115
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I don't know.

116
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Princess,

117
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I don't know what I'm talking about.

118
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I don't know what I'm talking about.

119
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I don't know what I'm talking about.

120
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Princess,

121
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
you're so selfish.

122
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Thank you for your kindness.

123
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
It's a pity that you scared me.

124
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
That's right.

125
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Princess, you're so serious.

126
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I'm just trying to show you

127
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
that you and my father are in love.

128
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
It's not easy to be a prince in the seven months.

129
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
It's hard to say that you love your father.

130
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
It's really a joke.

131
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
You were so kind yesterday.

132
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I think you're the one who's so jealous.

133
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Your Highness,

134
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
the maid is coming to see you.

135
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
It's just...

136
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
What?

137
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
It's just a princess who's coming.

138
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I see.

139
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Why don't you go and see her?

140
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I'm going to see her.

141
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Ma Xiang,

142
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I'm going to the horse rescue team.

143
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Horse rescue?

144
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Are you happy?

145
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I'm sorry to bother you today.

146
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I'm leaving with Princess.

147
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I've known each other for many years.

148
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
You don't have to be so polite.

149
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Don't worry.

150
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I'll see you when I'm done.

151
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I'll be careful when I'm done.

152
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I know you're going to see me.

153
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I think you have something to say to me.

154
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I'm a stranger.

155
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I'm from Dingbei.

156
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I'm not suitable for this.

157
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I'll be with you at the door.

158
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I'll be waiting for you at the door.

159
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
If you need anything, just call me.

160
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Okay.

161
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Yan.

162
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Rourou.

163
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Rourou.

164
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I've seen you before.

165
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Rourou.

166
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Rourou.

167
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
It seems that you're going to hand over the backpacks to your daughter.

168
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
You mustn't tell others about this.

169
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Otherwise, you'll be in trouble.

170
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Remember that.

171
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
It's about Jin Yao.

172
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Please wait.

173
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Come on.

174
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
This is nothing else.

175
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I've been trained in cuneiformary care.

176
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Aya suddenly called me here

177
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
to tell me this.

178
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Is Pong De

179
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
If you can do it, you'll be the master of the Gu family.

180
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,400
Have you ever thought about my and my mother's good deeds?

181
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,400
Have you ever thought about how we will be in the future?

182
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,280
I'm so poor.

183
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,080
I have no way to live.

184
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,800
I can't make up for your mother and daughter.

185
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,920
But as long as you're a brother,

186
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,000
she won't be able to take care of you and your mother.

187
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,840
My brother

188
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,480
can't even care for me.

189
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,640
Now he's not in a hurry.

190
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,360
How can he care for me and my mother?

191
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,280
I can't do that.

192
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,000
Now you're a brother.

193
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,440
Master.

194
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:03,920
Master.

195
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,360
Master.

196
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,600
Master, what's wrong?

197
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,600
Master.

198
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,320
Master.

199
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,520
Master.

200
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:17,880
Master.

201
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,320
Master, what's wrong?

202
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,920
Master.

203
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,440
Master.

204
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,080
Master.

205
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,080
Why did you...

206
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,920
They were saying I'll be gone.

207
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,240
If it's really necessary to길

208
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,600
they'll take us away.

209
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,520
Do they want our nation?

210
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,680
Yes.

211
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,560
Was I too shy?

212
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,080
I'm afraid...

213
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,080
I'll ask you anything.

214
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,080
I'll tell you everything.

215
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,080
I don't know what to say.

216
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,080
Your Highness.

217
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,080
Your Highness.

218
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,080
Your Highness.

219
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,080
Your Highness.

220
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,080
Your Highness.

221
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,080
Your Highness.

222
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,080
Your Highness.

223
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,080
Your Highness.

224
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:30,480
The

225
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,080
Chinese Lava

226
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,080
will lead you to the right path.

227
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,080
The dishes that Lord Cheng En used today

228
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,080
were all brought by you.

229
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,080
Yes.

230
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,080
But I don't know which of these dishes...

231
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,080
Who did these dishes?

232
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,080
I...

233
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,080
Who did these dishes?

234
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,080
I really don't know.

235
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,080
It's really none of my business.

236
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,080
Take your time and think about the details.

237
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,080
From the dishes from the wine

238
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,080
to the poison from Lord Cheng En,

239
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,080
you have seen who said the words to whom.

240
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,080
What did he say?

241
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,080
Which of the people

242
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,080
touched the dishes?

243
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,080
The wine was in the wine.

244
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,080
I thought about it.

245
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,080
I had to hide it and tell it.

246
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,080
Your Highness.

247
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,080
I really don't know.

248
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,080
Come.

249
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,080
Today,

250
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,080
I went to the wine shop in the old house.

251
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:14,080
I saw the wine dishes from the kitchen.

252
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,080
Then I took the wine out of the door.

253
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,080
On this way,

254
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,080
I kept it in the carriage.

255
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,080
After that,

256
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:23,080
I took the wine to the old house.

257
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,080
This way, I took the hand of the other person.

258
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:28,080
The only time I poisoned was

259
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:31,080
when I was alone in the old house.

260
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,080
It's really as you said.

261
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:44,080
What did Lord Cheng En say to you?

262
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,080
I...

263
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,080
I...

264
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,080
I don't know.

265
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,080
Your Highness, you scared him.

266
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,080
Why did you kill the murderer

267
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,080
with the question?

268
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,080
I...

269
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,080
Don't be afraid.

270
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,080
I believe that the wine is innocent.

271
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,080
But I also understand that people are close to God.

272
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,080
You can't just believe me.

273
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,080
The wine is just a woman.

274
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,080
It's too much for me.

275
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,080
I can't avoid it.

276
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,080
I want to go to the Dali Temple.

277
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:10,080
I hope Your Highness can take care of it.

278
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,080
Don't let others be in trouble with it.

279
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,080
I don't want to be in trouble with it.

280
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,080
I don't want to be in trouble with it.

281
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,080
I don't want to be in trouble with it.

282
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,080
I don't want to be in trouble with it.

283
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,080
I don't want to be in trouble with it.

284
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,080
Okay.

285
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,080
It's not possible.

286
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,080
But if you take out the suspicion,

287
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,080
you can be safe.

288
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,080
If the prince takes care of it,

289
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,080
you won't be in trouble.

290
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,080
Miss Gu, please.

291
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,080
I just want to investigate.

292
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,080
I don't care about others' feelings.

293
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,080
I really don't know what to do.

294
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:01,080
Actually, the prince is thinking for Miss Gu.

295
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:03,080
If we can find out the suspect soon,

296
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:06,080
Miss Gu will be able to get rid of the suspicion soon.

297
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:20,080
Go on.

298
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:25,080
These dishes are all what you like.

299
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:27,080
Just now, after the order of the prince,

300
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,080
the kitchen is ready.

301
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,080
You will be happy to see me later.

302
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,080
I will be happy to see you later.

303
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,080
I have been in the house for so many years.

304
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,080
Now I finally see these families.

305
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,080
Uncle Wu, how do I look?

306
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,080
What do you think?

307
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,080
How do I look?

308
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,080
You are a good man.

309
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,080
What do you think of me?

310
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,080
What do you think of me?

311
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,080
What do you think of me?

312
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,080
You are so polite.

313
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,080
You are so gentle.

314
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,080
You are a gentleman.

315
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,080
I am a man of the gods.

316
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,080
I don't know how to speak.

317
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,080
I am not a man of the gods.

318
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,080
I don't know how to speak.

319
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,080
Your Highness,

320
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,080
why do you care about other women?

321
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:39,080
You are enough to be a man of the gods.

322
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:41,080
Today, you specially ordered

323
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,080
to prepare dinner with the prince.

324
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,080
You are so kind and considerate.

325
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:48,080
This is the best way to make a man of the gods.

326
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,080
Your Highness,

327
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,080
you are not in good health.

328
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,080
You can't come to the house for dinner.

329
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,080
You can still say that before you go back to your house.

330
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,080
Why do you suddenly feel sick?

331
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,080
But you are tired of being outside for a day.

332
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,080
Your Highness, she...

333
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,080
She...

334
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,080
Where is she?

335
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,080
Are you worried about your daughter?

336
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,080
You are not feeling well?

337
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,080
No matter what,

338
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,080
you can't have dinner with her.

339
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,080
You are sick.

340
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,080
You can't have dinner with her.

341
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,080
Your Highness, don't try to persuade me.

342
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:26,080
I am not a good person.

343
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,080
Why is your face so pale?

344
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,080
I can't even keep my hands.

345
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:43,080
I am always like this when I am sleeping.

346
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,080
I am used to it.

347
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,080
Bring some water to the princess.

348
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,080
You can go now.

349
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,080
Yes.

350
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:18,080
Princess, the water is ready.

351
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,080
Go.

352
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,080
Parent.

353
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,080
Your Scotland.

354
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:07,880
Did I misunderstand him in the past?

355
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:37,080
The most passionate flower

356
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:42,080
The heart in our hands

357
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:46,080
Will not protect the wind

358
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,080
Because of the wind of fate

359
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:53,080
You are the shadow in the end

360
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:57,080
I wish to draw your wings

361
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,080
The light smiles on our eyes

362
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,080
Ok, it's the right time to ask

363
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:07,080
He just wants to stay with me

364
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:16,080
My lord, the hot water is ready

365
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,080
Are you going to the summer camp now?

366
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,080
Tomorrow I will return to Ning

367
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,080
I will take a bath and have a good rest

368
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,080
Go

369
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,080
Princess, the moon is like this

370
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:54,080
My lord, the moon is getting weaker

371
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:57,080
The small body is weaker than the normal people

372
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:59,080
I have been keeping it for years

373
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:02,080
But I haven't been able to eat it

374
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,080
Give Princess some hot water

375
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,080
Don't soak for too long

376
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:13,080
The most effective way to cure the cold

377
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,080
Yes

378
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:25,080
Today I have given the servant the house I saw

379
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:28,080
I am very pleased to see you

380
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,080
I have been recommending you to stay at home

381
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,080
You are not willing to do it

382
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,080
You are a guard

383
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,080
You are in a small inn

384
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,080
Why do you ask?

385
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,080
I am a lonely person

386
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,080
I have no family

387
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:45,080
Why do you have to go to the bank to make a house?

388
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,080
Although I am dead

389
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:52,080
But I need to clean it up

390
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,080
Don't worry

391
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,080
If I die

392
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,080
I will not be able to get out of the inn

393
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,080
I will have to do it

394
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,080
I will have to do it

395
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,080
I will not be able to save you

396
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:07,080
You are not willing to die

397
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:09,080
But you are a guard

398
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:11,080
You are a guard

399
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:13,080
You can't be a guard

400
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,080
Do you have any idea?

401
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:20,080
How is the Prince of Jiangyang?

402
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:23,080
The Prince of Jiangyang is a great man

403
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:25,080
He is a great man

404
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,080
He is a great man

405
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:29,080
He is a great man

406
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:31,080
He is a man of the world

407
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,080
He is talented

408
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:35,080
I think

409
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:38,080
The Prince of Jiangyang is a great man

410
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,080
All the same

411
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,080
How are you?

412
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,080
I am at ease

413
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:56,080
I am glad to have had a nice day

414
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,080
All right

415
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,080
Yan

416
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:11,080
How are you?

417
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,280
After all you played a good trick

418
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,400
Are you crazy?

419
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,520
You're still calling me Miss?

420
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,200
Look at my memory.

421
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,120
Now I should call you Princess.

422
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:24,800
Auntie,

423
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,280
where is Mimi?

424
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,960
She's waiting for you at the water park.

425
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,040
I'll go see Mimi first.

426
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:30,800
You go.

427
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,480
Don't be afraid.

428
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:40,960
Go on,

429
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,240
let's talk.

430
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:43,800
Please.

431
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,120
I'm sorry.

432
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,680
I've seen you before.

433
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,080
I've seen my uncle.

434
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:55,400
Your Highness,

435
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,760
you're too kind.

436
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,160
Enough.

437
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,520
Don't talk too much.

438
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,160
Xianxue,

439
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,880
Tan'er is in trouble.

440
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:08,160
I told the Changguo Palace about this.

441
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,960
He's my uncle.

442
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,400
Li Ying's little wife.

443
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,400
And you said

444
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,440
you'd tell me

445
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,520
what happened to you

446
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,680
in such a big matter.

447
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,400
I can help you.

448
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,520
It's my fault.

449
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,360
People were so cruel

450
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,600
during the wedding.

451
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,720
If you don't know,

452
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,880
you'll be in danger.

453
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:26,880
Your Highness,

454
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,120
you're right.

455
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,920
I'm a man who's been away from my wife.

456
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:34,040
I'm a man of my word.

457
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,000
I can't be sure.

458
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,000
But the Chief of the Marquis's Mansion

459
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,320
is still in the heart of Yuezhang.

460
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,840
You two are married.

461
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:45,560
You're the allies of Yang Xilu and Dingbei Army.

462
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,040
You've made a great deal of it.

463
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,600
You must become the main source

464
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,280
to attract the people in the court.

465
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,600
Actually,

466
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,720
I've thought about it

467
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,480
before the wedding.

468
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,440
I'll exchange Yang Xilu with the court.

469
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,360
I've been ill for years.

470
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,560
The court should choose

471
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,760
a better person

472
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,800
to take care of this.

473
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,120
Brother-in-law,

474
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,240
you've been a horse for a lifetime.

475
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,360
You've paid a lot

476
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:12,280
for Yang Xilu.

477
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,800
I'm so happy to have you.

478
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:17,200
How can I be happy?

479
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,200
Only this way

480
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,560
can I make a good person.

481
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:23,000
You've thought it too simple.

482
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,280
Even if you retreat,

483
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,120
he won't be a good man.

484
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:28,200
His ambition is not that high.

485
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,480
But he won't

486
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,640
make Tang'er a traitor.

487
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,800
He can live a peaceful life

488
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,400
like a long-time emperor.

489
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,760
He's a man of his word.

490
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,120
You're a real warrior.

491
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,280
You're a great man.

492
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,160
You can't do it.

493
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,600
It wasn't a long time

494
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,040
since Emperor took everything.

495
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:46,600
My father was a general.

496
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:49,160
I knew him well.

497
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,040
Before he isSt rich and fit

498
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,480
I was believed too.

499
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,500
He's someone

500
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,960
who can Bitteen fame and wealth.

501
00:28:58,380 --> 00:28:59,600
The seal is my god.

502
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,460
It will limit our vast territory.

503
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Second Prince,

504
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,120
we've already told Seter

505
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:07,720
that he and Yuzhe

506
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,160
cannotances and Demon-Event

507
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,040
can't talk within the jade.

508
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,040
Thank you, Xian Xu.

509
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:23,040
I heard from my uncle that you were married and you had a marriage.

510
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:27,040
I couldn't even ask you about it.

511
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:29,040
I thought I'd go to the mansion to see you.

512
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:32,040
But my mother said that the rules of the mansion are not good.

513
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,040
She would make the mansion laugh.

514
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:37,040
I'm not in a hurry.

515
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:39,040
I've been worried about you for days.

516
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:42,040
So who did this?

517
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:47,040
I do have a doubt.

518
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:51,040
But I have no evidence.

519
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,040
But your father?

520
00:29:56,040 --> 00:30:02,040
I heard from my mother and father that you were the one who was most unhappy about this marriage.

521
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:05,040
Tan, you're not a married woman.

522
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:07,040
You should be careful.

523
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:10,040
I know that I'm a princess now.

524
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:12,040
I'll do whatever I want to do in the future.

525
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:15,040
I'll be the representative of the Ming family and the mansion.

526
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:20,040
I'll be the one to decide the future.

527
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:24,040
As for my father,

528
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:27,040
if he still thinks about love,

529
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:30,040
I won't be in a relationship with him.

530
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,040
Tan,

531
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:39,040
I heard that your husband was taking you out for work that day.

532
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:41,040
But...

533
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,040
You've heard it.

534
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:46,040
You even know the whole mansion.

535
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:48,040
So it's true.

536
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:51,040
Your husband is so considerate.

537
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,040
What's wrong?

538
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:57,040
Your husband is not good to you?

539
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:59,040
Your husband is not good to you?

540
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:05,040
I don't know where he is bad.

541
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:09,040
But I don't know where he is good.

542
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:14,040
Do you have a house?

543
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:18,040
Mingyu, you're the girl who didn't leave the house.

544
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,040
How could you talk about this?

545
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,040
What's wrong with you?

546
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,040
Why are you so shy?

547
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,040
It's none of your business.

548
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:24,040
No one can hear you anyway.

549
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:27,040
I see your husband is good at singing and dancing.

550
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,040
He's good at singing.

551
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:31,040
I see that on the script, if he's married...

552
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,040
Mingyu,

553
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:42,040
I think

554
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:46,040
you don't like me.

555
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,040
What?

556
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,040
Tan,

557
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:50,040
if you want to have a boyfriend,

558
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:52,040
you can have a boyfriend.

559
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,040
Look at you.

560
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,040
He's looking for Tian Ling.

561
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,040
You can't even look at him.

562
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:58,040
What kind of girl can you look at him?

563
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:02,040
He has a hidden camera.

564
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,040
Okay.

565
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:30,040
Please have a drink with me.

566
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,040
Xianxu,

567
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,040
you're so kind.

568
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:39,040
I know you're not good at singing.

569
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,040
Hurry up.

570
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:56,040
You're all family.

571
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:58,040
Don't mind those formalities.

572
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,040
Xianxu, come on.

573
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,040
Thank you, Yuezhao.

574
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:05,040
Okay, have more.

575
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:11,040
Since Tan's marriage,

576
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:14,040
my husband hasn't been so lively for a long time.

577
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,040
But the day is coming.

578
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,040
You're the father.

579
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:19,040
You're too much.

580
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,040
Yes, yes.

581
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,040
Come on.

582
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,040
Have a taste.

583
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,040
This is my own meat.

584
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,040
Xianxu,

585
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:33,040
you have to eat two pieces.

586
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:35,040
This is a good thing.

587
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,040
It's big.

588
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:38,040
It's firm and tender.

589
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,040
Xianfeng,

590
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:41,040
I'll tell you when I'm done.

591
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:43,040
The guests are all here.

592
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,040
My lord,

593
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:45,040
have more meat.

594
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:47,040
How can you say that?

595
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:50,040
He's so generous.

596
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:52,040
Who said that?

597
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,040
Tan,

598
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:55,040
you have to eat more.

599
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:58,040
The garden is full of vitality.

600
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:00,040
I've prepared a box for you.

601
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:02,040
Take it with you.

602
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:06,040
I hope you can have a grandson soon.

603
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:09,040
Enjoy the joy of the day.

604
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:16,040
The children are all destiny.

605
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:18,040
The garden is full of vitality.

606
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:20,040
The city is full of vitality.

607
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:23,040
I won't let you down.

608
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,040
Yes.

609
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,040
You're right.

610
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:28,040
Come on, have a drink.

611
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,040
Come on.

612
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,040
My lord.

613
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,040
My lord.

614
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,040
The Dali Temple sent a message.

615
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,040
The army is dead.

616
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,040
They're all dead.

617
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:50,040
The chef of the house is in the heart.

618
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,040
He's in a hurry to take revenge.

619
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,040
The wine is washed by Xianyi.

620
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,040
Xianyi is back to the house.

621
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:56,040
His majesty asked me to come in.

622
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:58,040
He's been treated by the court.

623
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,040
My lord,

624
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,040
His majesty has sent a message.

625
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:08,040
Life is not a danger.

626
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,040
Xianxu,

627
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,040
go now.

628
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:12,040
Just a family banquet.

629
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:14,040
There will be a chance.

630
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,040
Today is the day.

631
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,040
My lord,

632
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,040
you should be with me.

633
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:30,040
I'm a good person.

634
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,040
I'll come to you

635
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,040
when I'm free.

636
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,040
Thank you for your suggestion.

637
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,040
Tan'er.

638
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,040
Xianxu loves you so much.

639
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,040
I'm relieved.

640
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,040
Sit down.

641
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,040
I'll go to the kitchen.

642
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,040
I don't think

643
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:16,040
your lord is a good person.

644
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,040
You're thinking too much.

645
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,040
He's not interested in me.

646
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,040
My lord,

647
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,040
Miss Guo'er is waiting to see you.

648
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,040
She said she wants to see you.

649
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:39,040
She wants to help you.

650
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,040
Please.

651
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,040
My lord, please.

652
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,040
My lord.

653
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,040
My lord.

654
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,040
My lord,

655
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,040
my lady just came back from the palace.

656
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,040
She's gone.

657
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:52,040
She's worried about something.

658
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:54,040
She's thinking about you.

659
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,040
She wants to help me.

660
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,040
She wants to help me.

661
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,040
Please think of a way.

662
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,040
Do you have any other way?

663
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,040
No.

664
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,040
I've searched everywhere.

665
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,040
I haven't seen anyone.

666
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,040
After she came back,

667
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,040
she's been feeling unwell.

668
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,040
I've been out alone

669
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:07,040
for a long time.

670
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,040
She would bring me to the kitchen

671
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,040
all the time.

672
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,040
I don't know

673
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,040
what happened today.

674
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:18,040
Did Mrs. Gu say anything else?

675
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,040
No.

676
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,040
I heard from the Empress

677
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:22,040
that Miss Tong said

678
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,040
that if she's in the city,

679
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,040
she can protect

680
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:26,040
her mother and son.

681
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,040
My lord.

682
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:36,040
The master of the Chen's mansion, Zhu Danyi,

683
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,040
has been appointed.

684
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,040
Many years ago,

685
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:40,040
Gu Wenyan married his daughter.

686
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:42,040
Chen Enhou's son,

687
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,040
broke Zhu Danyi's leg

688
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,040
with a gun.

689
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,040
But Zhu Danyi

690
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,040
has been in a grudge

691
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,040
and has been trying to revenge.

692
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,040
He's been afraid

693
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,040
to have a family

694
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,040
and he's been in a grudge for many years.

695
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,040
Now,

696
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,040
Chen Enhou has lost his life.

697
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,040
Zhu Danyi knows

698
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,040
that after Gu Jiuro's visit,

699
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:58,040
he's been in a terrible state.

700
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,040
So he's poisoned

701
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,040
by the wine he's prepared.

702
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,040
Your majesty.

703
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:08,040
Chen Enhou has not been

704
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,040
charged with murder

705
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,040
before his death.

706
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,040
He's not guilty

707
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,040
of any crimes.

708
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,040
I can only

709
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,040
investigate the accounts of the mansion

710
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:16,040
and verify the number of the people.

711
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:18,040
Please, your majesty.

712
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,040
It's really hard to

713
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,040
get a good taste of the wine.

714
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,040
Your majesty.

715
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:36,040
Get rid of the corruption.

716
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,040
Chen Enhou

717
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,040
has also

718
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:40,040
committed a lot of crimes.

719
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:42,040
Please, your majesty.

720
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,040
Your majesty.

721
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,040
The evidence is clear.

722
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:53,040
The case should be solved soon.

723
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,040
It's better

724
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,040
to give a explanation to Prince Dingbei.

725
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,040
Your majesty.

726
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,040
Chen Enhou

727
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:00,040
has been trying to

728
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,040
kill many students.

729
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,040
If you don't take it seriously,

730
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:04,040
I'm afraid it's hard to

731
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,040
get rid of those

732
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,040
who are willing to die.

733
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:12,040
What do you think?

734
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,040
Your majesty.

735
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:15,040
It's no use

736
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,040
to investigate the case

737
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:18,040
and get rid of it.

738
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,040
I think

739
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,040
if the imperial edict

740
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,040
is too long,

741
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,040
it might affect

742
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,040
the whole economy.

743
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,040
I'm willing to give you an edict.

744
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,040
I'm going to

745
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:30,040
take the military exam

746
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:32,040
and get the reward.

747
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:34,040
I'll kill him.

748
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:36,040
He's dead.

749
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,040
But I'm sorry.

750
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,040
I'm going to

751
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:41,040
remove the official title

752
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,040
of the Gu family.

753
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,040
I'll serve the city

754
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,040
and the capital.

755
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,040
I'll give the credit to the

756
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,040
15-year-old Liu Fang

757
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,040
and the right-hand man.

758
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,040
I'll take the edict.

759
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:57,040
Zhang Qing.

760
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,040
I'm here.

761
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,040
The imperial edict is in place.

762
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,040
I'll send the edict

763
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,040
to the city.

764
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,040
Yes, your majesty.

765
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,040
What a nice move.

766
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,040
The capital is not

767
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,040
a waste of money.

768
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:16,040
So I'm going to take it.

769
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,040
If you can get rid of it,

770
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,040
why do you want to

771
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,040
take the city?

772
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,040
I thought

773
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,040
I could catch

774
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,040
the wrong man

775
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:28,040
and open a trap for it.

776
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,040
I didn't think about it.

777
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,040
I'm still a child.

778
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,040
Your highness, Miss Gu is out of the city.

779
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,040
Your majesty,

780
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,040
I've heard from the imperial guards

781
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,040
that the lady who rented the car

782
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,040
is the only one.

783
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:53,040
According to the edict,

784
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,040
she's the one.

785
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,040
Do you know where she went?

786
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,040
It's said that she went to Yangliu Village.

787
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,040
The village is 20 miles away.

788
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:02,040
The lady who rented the car

789
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:04,040
went to a remote place

790
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,040
by herself.

791
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,040
I have some impression.

792
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:09,040
Did you wait until your highness told you about it?

793
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,040
The imperial guards said

794
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,040
the prince had left the palace.

795
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:13,040
He should have brought medicine.

796
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:15,040
He left directly.

797
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:18,040
The son of the treasure

798
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,040
of the late Emperor of Chengeng

799
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,040
is not good at drinking.

800
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:22,040
I saw the late Emperor of Chengeng

801
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,040
and ordered to see the wine.

802
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,040
I felt something was wrong.

803
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:25,040
I didn't know

804
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,040
what they said to each other.

805
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,040
The wine is too small.

806
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,040
It's too late to drink.

807
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:32,040
How can I leave the city alone?

808
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,040
Where are you going?

809
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,040
I'm not worried about the wine.

810
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:41,040
I have to find it.

811
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,040
Da.

812
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,040
I'll go with you.

813
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,040
I have a favor to ask.

814
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:45,040
Your highness,

815
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:48,040
do you want to talk to the emperor about it?

816
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,040
The Ming family is now

817
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,040
in the prison.

818
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,040
Don't let him in.

819
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:59,040
If he is in the prison today,

820
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:01,040
if it's about the people of Chengen,

821
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,040
it's dangerous.

822
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,040
Why don't we ask Dr. Zhang Huaiyu

823
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,040
to tell him about it?

824
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:21,040
As long as you let me go,

825
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:24,040
I'll tell him

826
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:26,040
to give you the evidence that A Yan left.

827
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:30,040
What evidence can he leave?

828
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:35,040
Under the foundation of my study,

829
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:38,040
there is a secret code in the prison.

830
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:39,040
You take it,

831
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:41,040
and put it out according to the information.

832
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,040
The enemy will come to you.

833
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:46,040
You must give your brother and sister the evidence.

834
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,040
If there is a code,

835
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:50,040
they won't dare to make you brothers and sisters.

836
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:53,040
The evidence is useless to me.

837
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:56,040
If you don't take our brother and sister,

838
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:58,040
I'll destroy the evidence

839
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:00,040
and let you have no regrets.

840
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:03,040
His majesty has ordered to investigate Chengen's mansion.

841
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:06,040
Mrs. Gu will be in the next round.

842
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:07,040
You should know it.

843
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:09,040
Give out the evidence.

844
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:12,040
I can keep you two

845
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:15,040
from being taken by Mrs. Gu.

846
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,040
If you get the evidence,

847
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:20,040
you will kill us.

848
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:22,040
I will not believe you.

849
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:29,040
Chengen!

850
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:34,040
As long as you brothers and sisters die,

851
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:37,040
who will know the evidence?

852
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:49,040
Follow him.

853
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:57,040
Go.

854
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:16,040
Help! Help!

855
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:18,040
Mingten!

856
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:19,040
Jiuyuan!

857
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:21,040
Faten!

858
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:22,040
Mingten!

859
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:23,040
Are you okay?

860
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:24,040
I'm fine.

861
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:41,040
It's him.

862
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:17,040
I'm fine.

863
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:47,040
I'm fine.

864
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:47,040
I'm fine.

865
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:19,040
The End
