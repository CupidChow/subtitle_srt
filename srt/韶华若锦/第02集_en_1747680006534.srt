1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I am not a good person.

2
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I am not a good person.

3
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I am not a good person.

4
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I am not a good person.

5
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I am not a good person.

6
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I am not a good person.

7
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I am not a good person.

8
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I am not a good person.

9
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I am not a good person.

10
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I am not a good person.

11
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I am not a good person.

12
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I am not a good person.

13
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I am not a good person.

14
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I am not a good person.

15
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I am not a good person.

16
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I am not a good person.

17
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I am not a good person.

18
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I am not a good person.

19
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I am not a good person.

20
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I am not a good person.

21
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I am not a good person.

22
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I am not a good person.

23
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I am not a good person.

24
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I am not a good person.

25
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I am not a good person.

26
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I am not a good person.

27
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I am not a good person.

28
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I am not a good person.

29
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I am not a good person.

30
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I am not a good person.

31
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I am not a good person.

32
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I am not a good person.

33
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I am not a good person.

34
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I am not a good person.

35
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I am like myself.

36
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I am not a good person.

37
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I am not a good person.

38
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I am not a good person.

39
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Please

40
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,920
Please drink

41
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,560
Begging for your customer

42
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:19,580
I pour sake to celebrate the death of a Māyā

43
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
The King of Dingbei has been crowned.

44
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
And we have completed our task.

45
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
That is a good thing.

46
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Ru...

47
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Ru...

48
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Ru...

49
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Ru...

50
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Ru...

51
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Ru...

52
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Ru...

53
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Ru...

54
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Ru...

55
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Ru...

56
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Ru...

57
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Ru...

58
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Ru...

59
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Ru...

60
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Ru...

61
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Ru...

62
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I have heard that the King of Dingbei is brave and good at fighting.

63
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
He has made great achievements for the country.

64
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I, Liang Rong'er, am willing to present a song to you.

65
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I am not talented enough to present it.

66
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Since you are not talented enough, then don't present it.

67
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
If I were you, I would have to find a hole to hide.

68
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I would never come out to see you again.

69
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Come back quickly.

70
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
What you said is right.

71
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I have been rude and offended you.

72
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I will discipline you after I return.

73
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
This is not the only person who should be disciplined in the House of Duke of the State.

74
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Is King of Dingbei a pet of your own?

75
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I am a child.

76
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Your Majesty, Your Highness.

77
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
King of Dingbei grew up in the palace.

78
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
He is the emperor's half-brother.

79
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
He has never heard of any other names.

80
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Liang Rong'er's love is not a common thing.

81
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
But the love of the King is still there.

82
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Your Highness, why don't you listen to it?

83
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
The famous song of Duke of Jing'an,

84
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
the song of the King,

85
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
is the most popular song of the King.

86
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Why don't you let him play a song for you?

87
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
So that we can enjoy the happiness of the King.

88
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
That is a good idea.

89
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Then, please play a song for us.

90
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I will sing a song to celebrate.

91
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I also congratulate you on your victory.

92
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Thank you for your kindness, Your Highness.

93
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I have not played the song of the King.

94
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I am afraid that the song of the King will disturb the King's peace.

95
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
The palace is huge.

96
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I am afraid that I cannot find a good song.

97
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
If you don't like it,

98
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I will send someone to the Empress Dowager's palace

99
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
to play the song of the King.

100
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I am not here to listen to these mysterious songs.

101
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I know that I was wrong

102
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
to bring someone to the palace.

103
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I am sorry, Your Highness.

104
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
And now, instead of just singing,

105
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I am going to sing for someone on nut job.

106
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
The only thing I can do at the moment is to hold up my planet.

107
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Let's go.

108
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,400
Let's go.

109
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,360
Mimi.

110
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,120
What's wrong?

111
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,200
It's a corpse.

112
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,480
This...

113
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:27,600
It's said that King Dingbei is more violent than he is.

114
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,800
Not only that.

115
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,200
I heard that he is violent and cold-blooded.

116
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,000
If any daughter marries into King Dingbei's family,

117
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,920
I'm afraid that the entire family of the daughter of the noble family

118
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,920
will be angry at him.

119
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,880
King Dingbei, you...

120
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,280
What do you mean?

121
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,840
Your Majesty, I have something important to discuss with you.

122
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,440
I'll take my leave now.

123
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,720
King Dingbei is so arrogant.

124
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,360
He doesn't know how to behave.

125
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,440
They say that King Dingbei is a God of War.

126
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,240
I think he is a God of War.

127
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,480
Today, Liang Rong'er is also unlucky.

128
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,840
He was humiliated by the people.

129
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,480
Rong'er, don't cry.

130
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,080
King Dingbei is just trying to make a mess.

131
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,560
He is trying to make trouble.

132
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:39,760
Madam, why is King Dingbei trying to make trouble for the Liang family?

133
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,920
Did something happen to the Mansion of the Prime Minister?

134
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,840
No, nothing happened.

135
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,920
They say that King Dingbei has a strange temper.

136
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Rong'er just happened to bump into his knife.

137
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,720
He has a strange temper.

138
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,200
He also didn't want to embarrass King Dingbei.

139
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,480
Yes, just now, Miss Ming refused to marry him.

140
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,960
King Dingbei didn't say anything.

141
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,320
Why did he have to marry Liang Rong'er?

142
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,360
I think he is trying to make trouble for the Mansion of the Prime Minister.

143
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:14,680
Did he do anything wrong to King Dingbei?

144
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:18,440
If so, why didn't King Dingbei ask directly?

145
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,320
Let's go.

146
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,800
Mingtan, don't believe these rumors.

147
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,560
King Dingbei must have his own thoughts when he returns to the capital.

148
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:36,320
We can't make such a big deal out of this.

149
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,880
Don't worry, Madam.

150
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,000
If the Mansion of the Prime Minister is clean and clean,

151
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,240
we can make a clean cut.

152
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:43,760
Yes, Madam.

153
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:47,480
It's a bit too much to make such a big deal out of this.

154
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,880
Mother.

155
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,560
Mother.

156
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,360
Your Majesty, the battle in Dongzhou was a close one.

157
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,640
If King Dingbei's soldiers hadn't died,

158
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:21,920
the Northern He army would have been in danger.

159
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:28,160
In this battle, the court officials and the bandits of the North were secretly colluding.

160
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:31,120
They have taken the last batch of soldiers of King Dingbei.

161
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,480
I didn't investigate this matter thoroughly.

162
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:38,560
But I found that the guards of the capital were blocking me.

163
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:47,160
Even so, we should ask the Court of Justice.

164
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:50,360
Why did King Dingbei take his life?

165
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:56,960
When I took the guards of the capital, he was killed.

166
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,240
You should ask why the killer was killed.

167
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,360
Why did he kill the killer?

168
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,440
Why did he kill the killer?

169
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,240
Why did he kill the killer for his own sake?

170
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,320
It's because he didn't care about the safety of the soldiers of King Dingbei.

171
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,640
Duke Dingguo.

172
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,560
I'm here.

173
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,600
What is your reason?

174
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,120
Baroners are good ones.

175
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,760
Because they don't understand political changes.

176
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,600
You are an lowly son.

177
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:59,900
How can you be a

178
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,860
This is a serious matter.

179
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:05,140
We must not let the bandits get away with it.

180
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:06,540
Yes, Your Majesty.

181
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:09,740
King Dingbei's words are right.

182
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:12,420
The murderer who killed the Wu's army

183
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:14,700
is the one who stopped you from entering the capital.

184
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:17,820
He is also the chief of the army.

185
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,340
Your Majesty, please give me your opinion.

186
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:25,500
I was on my way back to the capital.

187
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:27,460
I met a murderer from Haiyou.

188
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:30,140
I asked the little

189
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:32,220
Jingqi county guard how he could collude with Haiyou.

190
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:34,540
Moreover, King Dingbei's army

191
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,180
has been in a state of deficit for many years.

192
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:38,540
It is not something that can be done alone.

193
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:40,380
I wanted to investigate it.

194
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:43,220
That's why I made the decision to return to Shangjing.

195
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,900
I have been in the border for a long time.

196
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:51,180
I am used to it.

197
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:52,660
I have spoiled your mood.

198
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,980
You are all good officials who serve the country and the people.

199
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:59,460
I think you will understand.

200
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,300
After I finish this,

201
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,940
I will ask the chief to confess to you.

202
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:09,980
He will also kill the king of the Dongzhou army.

203
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:16,620
Ah Xu!

204
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:18,900
Hurry up!

205
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,300
When did you come back?

206
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,580
Why didn't you inform us?

207
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:26,060
Yes, you wanted to attack us.

208
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:27,820
You didn't have to hide it from us.

209
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:29,340
Ah Xu,

210
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,340
what is your plan to return to the capital?

211
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:32,140
How long will you stay in the capital?

212
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,020
King Dingbei is a leader of the army.

213
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:35,260
I can't stay long.

214
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:36,380
But,

215
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:38,940
what is the military supply?

216
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:42,420
The military supply is in need of transportation.

217
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:43,620
It is very important.

218
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:44,580
Ah Xu,

219
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,340
you are not going to the capital.

220
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:49,180
I am afraid that it is not a matter of time.

221
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:50,420
Ah Lu,

222
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:54,460
you are the commander of the capital.

223
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,060
You are in the north.

224
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,460
I am glad to hear that.

225
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:58,420
Do you have to work tonight?

226
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,540
No, I don't.

227
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:01,020
How many years have you been back?

228
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,940
We must gather together today.

229
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,260
Let's drink.

230
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:05,460
You are right.

231
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:06,500
I will go to Ah Yu right now.

232
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,940
I will make him drink and eat.

233
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:09,780
Of course, we will.

234
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:12,500
But, you should also lend me some people.

235
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,620
You are the king of the Donglin?

236
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:22,300
Why are you panicking?

237
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:23,740
You are so smart.

238
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:25,820
No one can see you.

239
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:27,620
I...

240
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:29,180
You are a thief.

241
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:32,420
As long as Jiang Xu has no money,

242
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,060
he can't do anything to you.

243
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:37,100
Even if you have no money,

244
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,140
you can't do anything.

245
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:43,220
But, the money

246
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:46,860
has been given to King Dingbei.

247
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:49,740
True love

248
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:58,540
fruit

249
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:00,060
What are you saying?

250
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:20,740
Haxian, we already have that money in our hands.

251
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,660
The question sheet is too long.

252
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,320
That's what it is really in that bank.

253
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,960
You should have brought it earlier.

254
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,120
Before this conversation happens

255
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,500
try not to PlayStation Manipulus again.

256
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,800
It is your manual topic now.

257
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,300
It will bring our cause to seeing daybreak,

258
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:37,300
and to bringing additional disaster at the start.

259
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:40,600
But the wind horses and its dynamic芋不 astrolog成我的

260
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:45,420
You must strike a head long to stop this crisis.

261
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,800
Sign it now,

262
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:51,800
You and Chengen Hou are the only ones who could find out from Wu Xianwei.

263
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,800
I'll protect you two.

264
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,800
The war has just begun.

265
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,800
Just wait for the opportunity.

266
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,800
If you kill them, you'll be killed.

267
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,800
Those old foxes will definitely come back.

268
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,800
Please be careful.

269
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,800
It's not convenient to have too many people.

270
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,800
Just tell me if you need anything.

271
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,800
Master, I'm always loyal to you.

272
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,800
You can't abandon me.

273
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,800
I don't care about the family.

274
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,800
If I want to abandon you,

275
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,800
how could I leave the life-saving mansion of Duke Jing'an to you?

276
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,800
Even if you want to kill me,

277
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,800
you have to understand the family's situation.

278
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,800
If you don't have a marriage with the family,

279
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,800
I can't protect you today.

280
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,800
Thank you for taking care of the family.

281
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,800
If you have a marriage with Mingtan,

282
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,800
you'll have to ask for blessings.

283
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,800
Okay, I'll do it.

284
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,800
Madam Su Xiang.

285
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,800
Master.

286
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,800
The wedding ceremony is ready.

287
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,800
There must be no problem in the wedding ceremony.

288
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,800
Don't worry, master.

289
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,800
We've made a great effort this time.

290
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,800
Madam Su Xiang saw the wedding ceremony.

291
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,800
There must be no problem.

292
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,800
That's good.

293
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,800
No matter what,

294
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,800
the girl in Mingtan must be a member of our family.

295
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,800
Master,

296
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,800
on the wedding banquet today,

297
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,800
King Dingbei deliberately targeted us.

298
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,800
Anyone can see it.

299
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,800
Mingtan will be suspicious.

300
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,800
What if he finds out about Zhu'er?

301
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,800
It's always a problem for Zhu'er to stay in the Liang family.

302
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,800
We have to find a way to get rid of this problem.

303
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,800
Master,

304
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:06,800
it's strange.

305
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:10,800
King Dingbei took the money from our secret room.

306
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,800
Why didn't he tell us about it in person?

307
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:19,800
He was afraid that we would be involved in a marriage.

308
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,800
He was just worried for the time being.

309
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,800
If the marriage between Mingtan and Xuan'er is settled,

310
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,800
we'll have more support from the Ming family.

311
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,800
King Dingbei will be more cautious.

312
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,800
He won't be in a dilemma.

313
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:34,800
That's right.

314
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:35,800
That's right.

315
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,800
To avoid a long night,

316
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,800
Mingtan must be married as soon as possible.

317
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,800
Master,

318
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,800
I want to drink tea.

319
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,800
I want to order food.

320
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,800
I didn't expect the Liang family to be so narrow-minded.

321
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,800
The Liang family will find out that I did it on purpose.

322
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,800
I did it on purpose.

323
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,800
What are you afraid of?

324
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,800
I hate the fake faces of the Li family.

325
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:44,800
They pretend to be weak and hide Zhu'er.

326
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,800
The Liang family is so good at acting.

327
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,800
They are all good actors.

328
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,800
Luckily, I saw through them.

329
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,800
They are both good actors.

330
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:56,800
Tan,

331
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,800
what did you find out in the Liang family?

332
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,800
Did you get anything?

333
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,800
I found...

334
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,800
What happened?

335
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,800
What happened?

336
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,800
The Liang family is involved in corruption.

337
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,800
They are hiding money.

338
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:26,800
Hiding money?

339
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,800
Be quiet.

340
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,800
Be quiet.

341
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,800
They dare to hide money?

342
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,800
I saw it with my own eyes.

343
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,800
How could it be fake?

344
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:42,800
But I don't know where the money went.

345
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:46,800
I didn't get any evidence of Zhu'er or money.

346
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,800
But I'm sure that the Liang family is in such a hurry to cheat.

347
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,800
It's because of the Lamy family.

348
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,800
They want to get rid of the father.

349
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,800
The old fox is so cunning.

350
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,800
It's a bad omen.

351
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,800
It won't be delayed.

352
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,800
It's useless to be anxious.

353
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,800
It's useless.

354
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,800
The marriage can't be postponed.

355
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:04,800
Sit down.

356
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,800
As long as Zhu'er is still in Shangjing,

357
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,800
there is still hope.

358
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,800
In the court,

359
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,800
King Dingbei is targeting the Liang family.

360
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,800
Did he find out anything?

361
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,800
If we can use King Dingbei's power,

362
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,800
it's possible.

363
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,800
But King Dingbei is so evil.

364
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:31,800
It's not easy to beg him.

365
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,800
It's not easy.

366
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:34,800
It's not easy.

367
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,800
It's not easy to cancel the marriage.

368
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,800
It's not easy to cancel the marriage.

369
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,800
It's not easy.

370
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,800
But if we can cancel the marriage,

371
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:50,800
I will be able to prove my innocence.

372
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,800
I remember that when Miss Li Jiawu was canceled,

373
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,800
she went to the Fu family to cut her hair.

374
00:21:55,800 --> 00:22:00,800
Miss Fang is a good match for Bai Ling.

375
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,800
She doesn't need to be so fierce.

376
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,800
She is...

377
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,800
Which family is she from?

378
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:12,800
She is from the family of Duke Changguo and Duke Jing'an.

379
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:16,800
Marriage is a matter of interest.

380
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,800
She is very clear.

381
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,800
Ah Xu, is the culprit of the case of the corruption of Guanyin

382
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,800
really Duke Ling?

383
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,800
Duke Ling is a corrupt person.

384
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,800
But he is not the mastermind.

385
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:30,800
Ah Xu used him to make a fool of himself.

386
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:34,800
But you never thought that it would affect the Ming family.

387
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,800
So you didn't move Duke Ling.

388
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,800
It's really a matter of interest.

389
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,800
So what?

390
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,800
But once the marriage is cancelled,

391
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:44,800
even if it's a real marriage,

392
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,800
it has a lot to do with the marriage.

393
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:49,800
You think this marriage is just a matter of interest.

394
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,800
There are many things involved.

395
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,800
If you don't tell me,

396
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,800
it will affect the reputation of the girl.

397
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,800
How can I live with this?

398
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,800
It's not difficult.

399
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:03,800
There are three people who can help you.

400
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,800
Let's see who can help you.

401
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,800
Ah Xu, when did you learn to joke?

402
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:18,800
Yes, I am a joke.

403
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,800
This world is really unfair.

404
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:21,800
It's a man's fault.

405
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,800
But why is it that Mingyu is affected by a woman?

406
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,800
Exactly.

407
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:29,800
Tan, even if you can cancel the marriage of the Liang family today,

408
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,800
your adoptive father will arrange another marriage for you.

409
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,800
It's not the power of this family,

410
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,800
but the power of that family.

411
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:37,800
You can't escape.

412
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:41,800
Who knows what will happen to the next one compared to Liang Zixuan?

413
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:42,800
Don't worry.

414
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,800
After this,

415
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,800
I will not let anyone else talk about my marriage.

416
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,800
Instead of being in a hurry to get married,

417
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,800
why don't you personally tell me about it?

418
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,800
That's a good idea.

419
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:57,800
Actually, there are many people who can match you.

420
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,800
For example, the second son of the Youxiang family.

421
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:03,800
He is handsome, talented, and has a high standard.

422
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:04,800
He has a bright future.

423
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,800
I heard that based on his talent,

424
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:09,800
he is not a good candidate for the Golden Thread Embroidery.

425
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,800
It's not true.

426
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:15,800
I will think about it myself.

427
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:16,800
I will help you.

428
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,800
I don't need to tell you about my family.

429
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,800
I need to have a good family background.

430
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,800
I must not be a coward.

431
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,800
That's the lowest requirement.

432
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,800
I must be honest and honest.

433
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,800
I must be a good person.

434
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,800
I must not be a loser.

435
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,800
I must not be a coward.

436
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,800
That's a must.

437
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,800
He must not be afraid of power.

438
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:37,800
He must be honest.

439
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,800
If I or the Ming family face any difficulties,

440
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,800
I will not leave him.

441
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,800
I will be with him.

442
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,800
I think that the whole Shangjing...

443
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:49,800
No, the whole Daxian...

444
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,800
I think only one person can match you.

445
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:52,800
Who?

446
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:53,800
Ding...

447
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:54,800
Bei...

448
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:55,800
Wang.

449
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:57,800
Him?

450
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,800
Impossible.

451
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,800
That's true.

452
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,800
Impossible.

453
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:03,800
But look at him.

454
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:04,800
He is a good person.

455
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,800
He has a bright future.

456
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,800
He has a bright future.

457
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:07,800
He has a bright future.

458
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:08,800
He is a good person.

459
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,800
He is a good person.

460
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,800
He is a good person.

461
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,800
He is a good person.

462
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:12,800
He is a good person.

463
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,800
I don't need to say anything.

464
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:14,800
It's all up to you.

465
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,800
His family is a good person.

466
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,800
How can you be so sure?

467
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,800
He was supposed to enter the palace to meet the king.

468
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,800
But he didn't even change his shoes.

469
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,800
He went into the hall with a long dress.

470
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,800
If King Dingbei is not a rough person,

471
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,800
he must be a family man.

472
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:33,800
And his behavior is too violent and arrogant.

473
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,800
You can't ask others to be like you.

474
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,800
You must be exquisite and beautiful.

475
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,800
But his character is indeed strange.

476
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:44,800
If he really has a grudge against the king,

477
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,800
why did he put his face in public

478
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,800
when he was trying to save innocent people?

479
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,800
He is a good person.

480
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,800
I think you are also a good person.

481
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,800
Of course, I am a good person.

482
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,800
That's right.

483
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:02,800
King Dingbei is angry for you.

484
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,800
If you think about it,

485
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:07,800
the daughter of Duke Jing'an and my great god,

486
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,800
King Dingbei,

487
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,800
are not impossible.

488
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:15,800
But this proves that he is a rough person.

489
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,800
He is not a good person.

490
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,800
I don't want to be like Liang Rong'er.

491
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,800
I don't want to be humiliated.

492
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,800
But if one day he gets angry,

493
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,800
he will lose his life.

494
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,800
He will die.

495
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,800
He will be in a very bad state.

496
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,800
You are not so scary.

497
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,800
Anyway, he is not my son.

498
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,800
You are too much.

499
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,800
Why is my mother so arrogant?

500
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,800
She is not her son-in-law.

501
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,800
I should talk to her.

502
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:47,800
I...

503
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:48,800
She...

504
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:58,800
It is my pleasure to be not her.

505
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:04,800
I am blind if I marry this woman.

506
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,800
It seems that the train journey is about to start.

507
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,800
Let's go and have a look.

508
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,800
Let's go.

509
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:12,800
I will go and look for her.

510
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:13,800
Go.

511
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:35,800
Madam,

512
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,800
the young lady and the lady from Changguo Palace

513
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,800
have gone to Nanyu River Street.

514
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,800
I have asked the servants of Ming Palace.

515
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,800
They said that the two ladies have arranged

516
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,800
to go to the street and turn off the lights.

517
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,800
Go to the street and turn off the lights?

518
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,800
I didn't know that.

519
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:54,800
You may leave.

520
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:55,800
Yes.

521
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:09,800
If the Ming family has no room to turn back,

522
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:13,800
then this marriage will be settled.

523
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,800
Ata, look.

524
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,800
It is so beautiful.

525
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,800
Where is the young lady?

526
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:02,800
She is not here.

527
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:04,800
Where is the young lady?

528
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:12,800
AXUN, why don't you use the imperial guards?

529
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,800
I have returned them to you.

530
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,800
I have been taking care of you for so many years.

531
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,800
I feel a little burdened.

532
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,800
I am useless.

533
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,800
You have brought back many people.

534
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:26,800
You have left them all to me.

535
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,800
Even the building has become a imperial guard's base.

536
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:30,800
It is fine if you leave them to me.

537
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,800
But you can't leave them without paying them.

538
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,800
Now, the money earned by the building and Brother Wen Tao

539
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:36,800
are not enough to pay them.

540
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,800
How can I remember that

541
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,800
you accepted me willingly.

542
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,800
I have not seen you being so picky these years.

543
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,800
I am willing to do anything.

544
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,800
I am a man of my word.

545
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:51,800
Ata.

546
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,800
Look, they are here.

547
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:58,800
Ata,

548
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,800
let's go and light the lanterns.

549
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,800
Sister Tan.

550
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:12,800
It is really you.

551
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:18,800
This must be your sister.

552
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:19,800
Who is your sister?

553
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,800
How did you recognize me?

554
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:25,800
A while ago,

555
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:26,800
the paintings that no one sent me

556
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:29,800
made Sister Tan look like a statue.

557
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:30,800
Moreover,

558
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,800
Sister Tan is a precious pearl.

559
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,800
Even if she is covered with a veil,

560
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,800
she is still beautiful.

561
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,800
How can I not recognize her?

562
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,800
We should not be in a hurry.

563
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,800
Please forgive us, Mr. Liang.

564
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:56,800
Ata.

565
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,800
Why is Zhang Ji in the house?

566
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:08,800
Catch them.

567
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,800
Don't run.

568
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:10,800
Stop.

569
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:11,800
Don't run.

570
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:12,800
Stop.

571
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:13,800
Did you arrange all this?

572
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:14,800
No.

573
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:17,800
Don't run.

574
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:18,800
Catch them.

575
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,800
You caught the wrong person.

576
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:24,800
You caught the wrong person.

577
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:25,800
You caught the wrong person.

578
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:27,800
You caught the wrong person.

579
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:28,800
I am innocent.

580
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,800
You caught the wrong person.

581
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:31,800
Don't run.

582
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,800
Move aside.

583
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,800
Move aside.

584
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:35,800
Move aside.

585
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,800
It is so difficult to catch someone.

586
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,800
I have eaten nothing.

587
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,800
Zhang Ji is the new servant of the Duke of Ling.

588
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:47,800
He is not a good person.

589
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:48,800
If we light the lanterns tonight,

590
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:49,800
we will be in trouble.

591
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,800
It is not easy to catch someone.

592
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,800
I am innocent.

593
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:54,800
Drink some more.

594
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:06,800
Ata.

595
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:07,800
Mimi.

596
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:18,800
Tanmei, I am here to save you.

597
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:19,800
Let me go.

598
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:20,800
Go.

599
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:21,800
Go.

600
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:30,800
Excuse me.

601
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:31,800
Excuse me.

602
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:32,800
Miss Liao.

603
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:33,800
Su Xing, you are finally here.

604
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,800
Let all who can swim go into the water.

605
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,800
And find two guards to pull the lanterns.

606
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:39,800
Don't let them get close to Ata.

607
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,800
Find more people to block the people behind.

608
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,800
Don't let them know that Ata is the one who fell into the water.

609
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:51,800
Who are you?

610
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:56,800
Take him away.

611
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:57,800
And search.

612
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:58,800
Yes.

613
00:32:58,800 --> 00:32:59,800
Let me go.

614
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:01,800
Let me go.

615
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,800
Help.

616
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:05,800
Help.

617
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:21,800
Help.

618
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:35,800
It is you again.

619
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:42,800
If we can save a girl,

620
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,800
our family will be prosperous.

621
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,800
Don't let them get close to us.

622
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,800
What should we do now?

623
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:51,800
Ata,

624
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,800
you must be safe.

625
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:06,800
Ah Xu,

626
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,800
I heard that you brought a girl back.

627
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,800
You are really a man of your word.

628
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,800
If you can be so happy in public,

629
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,800
the Duke will not be so sad.

630
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,800
I don't need the public.

631
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,800
Even if I am a high ranking man,

632
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,800
I can't make a lot of money.

633
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,800
Sir,

634
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,800
the girl fell into the water and got cold.

635
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,800
I will go prepare a cup of ginger tea.

636
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,800
Fell into the water?

637
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,800
Could it be the daughter of a famous family?

638
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,800
I heard that someone fell into the water at the dock.

639
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,800
I rushed to see what was happening.

640
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,800
I found out that the daughter of the Changguo family

641
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:41,800
was in a hurry to save her.

642
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,800
So I guessed that the daughter of a famous family fell into the water.

643
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:44,800
Oh, right.

644
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:45,800
Liang Zixuan is also there.

645
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,800
He didn't care about the people and went to save her.

646
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:48,800
Look at his attitude.

647
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,800
He knew that he was going to save her.

648
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,800
He thought that he had a plan.

649
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,800
A girl fell into the water and got cold.

650
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,800
She was saved by a man in public.

651
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,800
How can he be so innocent?

652
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:02,800
Do you think that Liang Zixuan did it on purpose?

653
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,800
The two families of the famous and the two families of the two families have a marriage agreement.

654
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,800
He did it to make the Ming family lose their way.

655
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,800
The two families have already made up their minds.

656
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,800
But this marriage,

657
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,800
they don't want to get married.

658
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,800
Send this hairpin to the Ming family.

659
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,800
And take her back to the house.

660
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,800
Let her go to the dock and get this hairpin.

661
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,800
My lady!

662
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,800
My lady!

663
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,800
My lady!

664
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:37,800
Lv'e!

665
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,800
My lady!

666
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:39,800
My lady!

667
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,800
Why are you still here?

668
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,800
My lady made a garden.

669
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,800
She is waiting for you to taste it.

670
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:49,800
What did she say?

671
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,800
My lady is waiting for you at home.

672
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,800
Let's go back.

673
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:01,800
The prince of the Lin family fell into the water.

674
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,800
Yes, the prince of Liang family fell into the water.

675
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,800
I happened to pass by and ran into him.

676
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,800
I was afraid that someone would save me.

677
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,800
What are you afraid of?

678
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,800
Shut up!

679
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,800
This is the place.

680
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:32,800
Let's go.

681
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:38,800
Brother.

682
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:42,800
Brother.

683
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,800
Miss Ming is awake.

684
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,800
Who are you?

685
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,800
Miss Ming, don't panic.

686
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,800
I am Zhang Huaiyu.

687
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,800
You saved me?

688
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,800
I am not that capable.

689
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:02,800
Come.

690
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,800
The one who saved you is him.

691
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,800
It's you again.

692
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,800
You two know each other?

693
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:12,800
No.

694
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,800
No.

695
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,800
Miss Ming, you were in danger.

696
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,800
If we didn't save you,

697
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:27,800
you would be in danger.

698
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,800
Thank you.

699
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:35,800
Miss Ming.

700
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:38,800
Why are you in a hurry to leave?

701
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:39,800
Why are you in a hurry to leave?

702
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:40,800
Why don't you rest for a while?

703
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,800
No matter what you did today,

704
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:47,800
I hope that you won't mention it again.

705
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:53,800
I didn't mention it to anyone yesterday.

706
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:57,800
I hope that you won't hurt the innocent again.

707
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:58,800
You are my friend.

708
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,800
We are even now.

709
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,800
We don't need to meet again.

710
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,800
Miss Xia Huai is drowning.

711
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,800
You should find a place where there is no one.

712
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,800
Then you won't meet anyone again.

713
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:14,800
What happened between you two yesterday?

714
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,800
I think this gentleman is very kind.

715
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,800
He kindly reminded me that

716
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,800
everything should be separated from the illegal person.

717
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,800
It should be cut off in time.

718
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,800
So that you won't suffer.

719
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,800
What is this place?

720
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,800
Miss Ming, I forgot to introduce you.

721
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,800
This is the most prosperous place in Shangjing.

722
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:48,800
It is the most luxurious place that everyone is talking about.

723
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:49,800
It is a very special building.

724
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,800
If you have time in the future,

725
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,800
you are welcome to come here.

726
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:57,800
Xue Ying,

727
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,800
I have a question.

728
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:00,800
I have a question.

729
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:01,800
I have a question.

730
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:02,800
I have a question.

731
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:03,800
I have a question.

732
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,800
Xue Ying,

733
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,800
this is Miss Xue Ying from our villa.

734
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,800
She was the one who took care of you.

735
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,800
Thank you.

736
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:16,800
Miss Ming,

737
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,800
you were unconscious just now.

738
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,800
You can rest now.

739
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:21,800
If you need anything,

740
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,800
you can tell Miss Xue Ying at any time.

741
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:28,800
Miss Ming,

742
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,800
please drink the ginger soup.

743
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:34,800
Yi,

744
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:35,800
there is a problem in Liang's mansion.

745
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,800
Liang's mansion?

746
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:54,800
Good.

747
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,800
Why is Tan in this kind of place?

748
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:58,800
Don't listen to him.

749
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,800
He came to our mansion with Miss's photo.

750
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,800
Zhao Shui came to our mansion to tell us this.

751
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,800
I didn't believe it.

752
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:08,800
I found out this after taking her to Nan Yu He Street.

753
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:09,800
It's not fake.

754
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:16,800
Let's find Tan first.

755
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:18,800
Yes.

756
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,800
Miss,

757
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,800
can I help you?

758
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:22,800
No need. I will find someone.

759
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:24,800
Miss,

760
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:25,800
who are you looking for?

761
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:26,800
I can help you.

762
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:27,800
No need.

763
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,800
Miss,

764
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:29,800
I...

765
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,800
I told you not to bother me.

766
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:32,800
And,

767
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:33,800
it's cold.

768
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:34,800
Why are you using the fan?

769
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:35,800
Sit down.

770
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:36,800
Miss.

771
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:37,800
Get up.

772
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:39,800
Stop.

773
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:46,800
What are you doing?

774
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,800
You want to use the fan to chop me?

775
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:52,800
Aren't you looking for someone?

776
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:53,800
I know.

777
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:55,800
If you want to know where he is,

778
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,800
apologize to me first.

779
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:01,800
Apologize?

780
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:05,800
No.

781
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:06,800
There is another one.

782
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,800
Come on.

783
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,800
Tan.

784
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:19,800
Tan.

785
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:22,800
Where is he?

786
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:23,800
Tan.

787
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:29,800
Strange.

788
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:30,800
Just now,

789
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:31,800
he...

790
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:33,800
He...

791
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:34,800
He...

792
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:37,800
Where...

793
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,800
Where did he go?

794
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:40,800
Sir,

795
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:41,800
according to the official statement,

796
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:42,800
the case of Lin Guogong's corruption

797
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,800
is related to Zhu'er's father.

798
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:45,800
But,

799
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:46,800
Lin Guogong's wife

800
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:47,800
sent Zhu'er to Shangjing

801
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:48,800
with the intention of killing her.

802
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,800
She is on her way to Nan.

803
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:53,800
Wait.

804
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:54,800
Why are you investigating Zhu'er?

805
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,800
Why are you investigating Lin Guogong's family?

806
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:57,800
Who are you?

807
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:58,800
What are your intentions?

808
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:01,800
If you don't want to die,

809
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,800
don't make any more trouble.

810
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,800
Don't ask what you shouldn't ask.

811
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,800
Don't bother what you shouldn't.

812
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:08,800
The matter of Liang's family,

813
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,800
if I really don't bother it,

814
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:11,800
I won't survive for a few days.

815
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:13,800
I just want to feed my wife Zixuan,

816
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,800
and live in peace with Zhu'er.

817
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:16,800
I don't want to be alone.

818
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,800
But I want to be with you.

819
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:19,800
Is that all?

820
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:21,800
Is that all?

821
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,800
I can't get married if I don't investigate this case.

822
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,800
I... I think...

823
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,800
You don't look like a poor and evil person.

824
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,800
Otherwise, you wouldn't have saved me.

825
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:38,800
I don't care why you are investigating the Lingguo Mansion.

826
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,800
But the enemy's enemy is a ally.

827
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:43,800
We are also on the same boat.

828
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,800
You can't bear to see me die.

829
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,800
I'm not a person who can't bear to see you die.

830
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,800
I'm an innocent person.

831
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:59,800
I'm not lucky enough to be involved in the Liang family.

832
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,800
You are very considerate.

833
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,800
But I'm just a horse.

834
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:14,800
It's not convenient for a man and a woman to be together.

835
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:23,800
I'm afraid.

836
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,800
What did you say?

837
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:33,800
I told you to settle this marriage.

838
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:35,800
I didn't let you do anything wrong.

839
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:37,800
The original plan was successful.

840
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:39,800
We could have the marriage in advance.

841
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:43,800
I didn't expect that Mingtan would be so generous.

842
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:47,800
You still dare to argue.

843
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:49,800
It's okay if you are lucky.

844
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:51,800
Stop it.

845
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:52,800
I will kill you!

846
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:53,800
Don't be angry, sir.

847
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,800
It's all my fault.

848
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:56,800
I was too hasty.

849
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:57,800
I made a mistake.

850
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:00,800
I made a mistake by making a fool of you.

851
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:03,800
It's only a few days since you got the job.

852
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:05,800
Why are you still in the hospital?

853
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:08,800
And you are still using Tan'er's name as a drug?

854
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:11,800
What are you worried about?

855
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:13,800
It's...

856
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:18,800
It's Xuan'er and her daughter.

857
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:19,800
She is pregnant.

858
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:22,800
Sir, I don't know anything about this.

859
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,800
But I have sent her away.

860
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:26,800
The situation is getting worse.

861
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:27,800
But you are still in the hospital.

862
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:28,800
You are the son of a minister.

863
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,800
You are not qualified enough to be a minister.

864
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,800
Or do you think Tan'er betrayed your family

865
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:35,800
and she wants to marry your useless son?

866
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:36,800
Sir, please don't be angry.

867
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:42,800
She has already married Zhu'er to a manager of a farm in Lizhou.

868
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:45,800
She will not appear in Shangjing again.

869
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:49,800
How can you promise that she will not appear in the future?

870
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:51,800
She will not appear again.

871
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:58,800
Let her disappear.

872
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:16,800
Let her disappear.

873
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:46,800
Let her disappear.

874
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:16,800
Let her disappear.

875
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:17,800
Let her disappear.

876
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:18,800
Let her disappear.

877
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:19,800
Let her disappear.

878
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:20,800
Let her disappear.

879
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:21,800
Let her disappear.

880
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:22,800
Let her disappear.

881
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:23,800
Let her disappear.

882
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:24,800
Let her disappear.

883
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:25,800
Let her disappear.

884
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:26,800
Let her disappear.

885
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:27,800
Let her disappear.

886
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:28,800
Let her disappear.

887
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:29,800
Let her disappear.

888
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:30,800
Let her disappear.

889
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:31,800
Let her disappear.

890
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:32,800
Let her disappear.

891
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:33,800
Let her disappear.

892
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:34,800
Let her disappear.

893
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:35,800
Let her disappear.

894
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:36,800
Let her disappear.

895
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:37,800
Let her disappear.

896
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:38,800
Let her disappear.

897
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:39,800
Let her disappear.

898
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:40,800
Let her disappear.

899
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:41,800
Let her disappear.

900
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:42,800
Let her disappear.

901
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:43,800
Let her disappear.

902
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:44,800
Let her disappear.

903
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:45,800
Let her disappear.

904
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:46,800
Let her disappear.

905
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:47,800
Let her disappear.

906
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:48,800
Let her disappear.

907
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:49,800
Let her disappear.

908
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:50,800
Let her disappear.

909
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:51,800
Let her disappear.

910
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:52,800
Let her disappear.

911
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:53,800
Let her disappear.

912
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:54,800
Let her disappear.

913
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:55,800
Let her disappear.

914
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:56,800
Let her disappear.

915
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:57,800
Let her disappear.

916
00:46:57,800 --> 00:46:58,800
Let her disappear.

917
00:46:58,800 --> 00:46:59,800
Let her disappear.

918
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:00,800
Let her disappear.

919
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:01,800
Let her disappear.

920
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:02,800
Let her disappear.

921

Let her disappear.

922
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:04,800
Let her disappear.

923
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:05,800
Let her disappear.

924
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:06,800
Let her disappear.

925
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:07,800
Let her disappear.

Let her disappear.

927
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:09,800
