[Youthful Glory]

2
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,940
[Episode 17]

3
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,600
These are all your favorite dishes.

4
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,080
This wine,

5
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:41,410
a fine vintage I've kept for twenty years.

6
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,820
On the night of Tan's wedding,

7
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,400
we finally drank to our hearts' content.

8
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,110
I didn't expect that the next time

9
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:50,710
we'd meet, things would look like this.

10
00:01:52,289 --> 00:01:54,220
What's there for you to sigh about?

11
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:56,250
Isn't this exactly

12
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,610
the outcome you wanted?

13
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,190
Ming, you are mistaken.

14
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,680
This result was not my desire,

15
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,600
but the will of the Su family.

16
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:14,310
For over 20 years,

17
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,560
I've carried the burden

18
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:19,079
of the entire Su household alone.

19
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,320
I couldn't just stand by

20
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,079
and watch it fall into decline.

21
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,520
All I could do was scheme

22
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,170
and struggle to save it.

23
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:33,079
No, wait.

24
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,600
You or the Su family,

25
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,920
what difference does it make?

26
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,760
All these years,

27
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,000
even if you never once

28
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,600
supported me at court,

29
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,880
I always

30
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,960
treated you as a brother.

31
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:00,000
I truly saw Ming Tan as my own daughter.

32
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,190
If there had been another way,

33
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:06,160
I wouldn't have come to this.

34
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,760
You, oh you,

35
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,000
but what of it?

36
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,780
Brotherhood? Adopted daughter?

37
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,720
How can that compare

38
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,640
to the future of the Su family?

39
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:20,240
It can't.

40
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,980
I, Ming Tingyuan, have always

41
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:30,360
lived by two words, my conscience.

42
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,760
Even now, fallen as I am,

43
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,960
I still believe:

44
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,440
black is black, and white is white.

45
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,160
No matter how you twist the truth,

46
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,440
you may deceive for a time,

47
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:48,000
but never forever.

48
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:05,680
Sir, the fish has bitten the hook.

49
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:11,240
Seeing is believing.

50
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,000
With him,

51
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:15,920
the real drama can begin.

52
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,160
Is everything ready?

53
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,680
All is in place.

54
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,520
But...

55
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:30,540
Wait, stop.

56
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,200
In a moment,
we'll go in through that door.

57
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,380
Someone will meet us there.

58
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:35,460
You must remember.

59
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:37,090
You'll only have 15 minutes.

60
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:45,000
Your Highness?

61
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:50,730
Your Highness.

62
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:52,510
Duke, if you truly care for Tan,

63
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,860
please see her safely back to the mansion.

64
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:55,890
Your Highness promised

65
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:56,720
you would find a way

66
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,690
for me to see Father again.

67
00:04:57,690 --> 00:04:58,270
Since I'm here,

68
00:04:58,270 --> 00:04:59,520
why won't you let me in?

69
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,000
Tan, go back to the mansion.

70
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,450
Even if a crime has been committed,

71
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:07,230
there is no law in Xian

72
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,050
forbidding a close relative
from saying a final farewell.

73
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:09,840
All I want

74
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,140
is to see my father one last time.

75
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:13,470
Why must Your Highness be so unrelenting?

76
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:15,080
Tan may not enter.

77
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,960
Then I must insist

78
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,400
on seeing my father one last time today.

79
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,650
If Your Highness blocks my way,

80
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:23,630
I will force my way in.

81
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:24,320
Tan.

82
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:38,720
When a man is near death,

83
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,720
his words hold truth.

84
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,440
If you'll heed me this once,

85
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,680
let go of your obsession,

86
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,680
let go of worldly attachments,

87
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,700
perhaps then the Su family

88
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:00,800
will endure even longer.

89
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,600
Do you

90
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,600
have any last wishes?

91
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,320
I have spent a lifetime in war,

92
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,820
defending the nation and its people.

93
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,920
Now,

94
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:28,130
there is only one person in this world

95
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,720
I cannot let go of.

96
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:35,800
Tan is protected by the Prince of Dingbei.

97
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:37,720
She will be safe for life.

98
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,720
Wasn't that

99
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,680
why you chose him to be her husband?

100
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:45,720
Yes.

101
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:48,770
With His Highness by her side,

102
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:50,040
why would I

103
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,000
worry about her?

104
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,840
The only thing I cannot
let go of, even in death,

105
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,970
are those treacherous officials

106
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:04,610
who harm the court

107
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,370
and treat the people like dirt.

108
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,080
My one regret

109
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,880
is not ridding the court of evil

110
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:15,550
and serving justice to the people of Xian.

111
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,320
Quick, report to the superiors.

112
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,120
There's a death!

113
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:38,960
-Yes.
-Yes.

114
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,159
Sir.

115
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,040
What happened?

116
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:53,670
Your Highness, please return.

117
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,660
About half an hour ago,

118
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:01,850
Chancellor Su came alone,

119
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:03,310
saying he wished to bid farewell
to the Marquis of Jing'an.

120
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:04,420
We inspected the food box

121
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:05,540
and let him in.

122
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:06,660
A moment ago, hearing a commotion,

123
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:08,100
we rushed over,

124
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,950
only to find
the Marquis collapsed on the floor.

125
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:12,160
There was wine still left in his cup.

126
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:14,120
It seems he suddenly vomited blood

127
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,120
while drinking.

128
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:16,240
His lips were purple,

129
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,760
and there were blood spots under his eyes,

130
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,920
signs of poisoning.

131
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:19,960
Poisoned?

132
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:40,170
Brother-in-law!

133
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:41,840
Tan!

134
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,800
Brother-in-law, Brother-in-law!

135
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:47,490
You should head back now.

136
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:49,050
Tan! Tan!

137
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,960
Brother-in-law!

138
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:14,570
Tan!

139
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:17,980
Father!

140
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:23,750
Father!

141
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,080
Father!

142
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:37,800
Father!

143
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:41,940
I'm late.

144
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:48,290
I'm late.

145
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:51,040
What happened?

146
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:53,920
What on earth is going on?

147
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:56,540
Wasn't everything fine just moments ago?

148
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,040
Tan.

149
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,960
My father had no way out.

150
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:40,450
Why did Chancellor Su
have to be so ruthless?

151
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,280
Why did he have to go to such extremes?

152
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,960
Tan, Tan!

153
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,400
Lord Zhang.

154
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:56,880
The Marquis of Jing'an has been murdered.

155
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,280
An autopsy must be conducted immediately.

156
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,240
Duke of Changguo.

157
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,480
Escort Tan back to the mansion.

158
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,900
-Jiang Qizhi!
-Tan.

159
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:05,760
Tan.

160
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:09,720
Hurry!

161
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:11,970
Tan, let's go.

162
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:28,180
Carry him to the morgue.

163
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,890
Summon the coroner at once.

164
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,840
-Yes.
-Yes.

165
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,180
The only ones in the cell
were my father-in-law

166
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:40,560
and you, Chancellor.

167
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,580
You cannot escape suspicion.

168
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:46,160
Guards, seize Chancellor Su.

169
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,720
Place him under strict watch.

170
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,480
-Yes.
-Yes.

171
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,900
Who dares lay a hand on me?

172
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,840
Without concrete evidence,

173
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,640
you dare imprison the Chancellor?

174
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:04,380
Are you all tired of living?

175
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,840
Calm yourself, Chancellor.

176
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:13,170
His Highness never said
you were the murderer.

177
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:15,320
But as the cause of death remains unclear,

178
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,120
and you are involved,

179
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:19,190
the law forbids you from leaving.

180
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:20,160
You are required to remain here

181
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,860
and cooperate with the Court
of Judicial Review's investigation.

182
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:23,590
We ask for your understanding.

183
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:24,920
Guards.

184
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,240
Prepare a clean room

185
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,200
in the yamen

186
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,120
for the Chancellor to rest in.

187
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,440
-Yes.
-Yes.

188
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:03,670
Your Highness, Lord Zhang.

189
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,940
Upon examination,

190
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,740
the deceased indeed died from poisoning.

191
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:08,420
Complete the report quickly

192
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:09,880
and submit it to the clerk for filing.

193
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:10,680
Understood.

194
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:21,160
Lord Zhang.

195
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:25,140
Though the Marquis of Jing'an
was a convicted criminal,

196
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:26,870
he was still my father-in-law.

197
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,880
Even if he cannot be
honored with a formal burial,

198
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,680
the Princess Consort and I
should fulfill our duty

199
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:33,370
and send him off one last time.

200
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,020
Your Highness,

201
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:39,780
you know the severity of his crimes.

202
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:40,980
According to the law,

203
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:42,510
not only is burial forbidden,

204
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:43,680
even the body

205
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,180
may not be returned to the family.

206
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:47,960
This is not something I can decide.

207
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,200
I understand that you act
with fairness and integrity,

208
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,130
and I have no wish
to make things difficult.

209
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:53,150
I've already sent word

210
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:54,410
to inform His Majesty.

211
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:03,040
The Marquis of Jing'an
served the state faithfully.

212
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,240
He doesn't deserve

213
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,010
to lie cold and alone in this place.

214
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,320
Your Highness's filial piety moves me.

215
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:14,000
However...

216
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,680
I will remain here

217
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:17,360
until the imperial decree arrives.

218
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,440
What concerns remain, Lord Zhang?

219
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,530
Since Your Highness vouches for this,

220
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:27,160
I too hope

221
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,000
the Marquis may find peace

222
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,460
sooner rather than later.

223
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,000
Guards.

224
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,600
Move the Marquis's body

225
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,160
to the carriage outside.

226
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,160
Be careful. Handle it gently.

227
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:37,980
-Yes.
-Yes.

228
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:51,670
Though my father-in-law was condemned,

229
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,850
he must not die unjustly in prison.

230
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:57,430
I ask the Court of Judicial Review
to investigate thoroughly

231
00:15:57,430 --> 00:16:00,480
and return justice
to the Marquis of Jing'an.

232
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,310
You have my word, Your Highness.

233
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:07,680
I will conduct a full investigation.

234
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:11,440
However, if the suspect continues
to insist on their innocence,

235
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:13,720
we may find little evidence

236
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,080
to work with.

237
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,360
So please,

238
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,160
do not rush the trial.

239
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,630
As long as we find the truth,

240
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:25,560
I am willing to wait.

241
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:29,440
Rest assured, Your Highness.

242
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,600
I will examine every detail,

243
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,460
and proceed with utmost caution.

244
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:38,480
By order of His Majesty:

245
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:42,190
The body of Ming Tingyuan
is to be returned to his family.

246
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:43,910
The Prince of Dingbei
shall escort it home for burial.

247
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:44,900
The Court of Judicial Review

248
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,600
is to investigate the poisoning thoroughly,

249
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:49,000
neither letting the guilty go free,
nor wronging the innocent.

250
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,200
-I obey the imperial decree.
-I obey the imperial decree.

251
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:04,800
Miss Minmin,

252
00:17:08,089 --> 00:17:09,690
come inside and rest a while.

253
00:17:11,869 --> 00:17:12,760
No need.

254
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:14,220
Tan hasn't woken up yet.

255
00:17:14,369 --> 00:17:16,690
She hasn't rested properly
these past few days.

256
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:18,180
With grief overwhelming her,

257
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:19,500
her body couldn't take it anymore.

258
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,880
Let her sleep well for once.

259
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,609
I won't go in.

260
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:25,390
This is for you, Miss Minmin.

261
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:27,079
You've been worrying and running about

262
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:28,620
for Her Highness these past days,

263
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,530
and haven't had a proper rest either.

264
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:32,290
I had the kitchen prepare some soup.

265
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:33,720
Please have some.

266
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:48,010
And don't be too sorrowful, Miss Minmin.

267
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,020
If Her Highness sees you like this,

268
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:51,880
she'll be even more heartbroken.

269
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,560
Tan waited so long

270
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:57,480
to be reunited with Uncle.

271
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,280
But they had barely

272
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,880
reunited for a few days

273
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:03,080
before death tore them apart.

274
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:06,560
The pain of losing a parent

275
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,760
cuts like a knife.

276
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:11,030
How could she possibly bear it?

277
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:17,680
You...

278
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,720
Weren't you just the one comforting me?

279
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:20,520
Now look at you,

280
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,520
crying yourself.

281
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:23,280
What Tan needs most right now

282
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,240
is us.

283
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:26,240
We must stay strong

284
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,560
to be her support.

285
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:35,610
What time is it now?

286
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:38,170
It's three quarters past midnight.

287
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:39,890
I'm heading to Lingzhou.

288
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,280
I'll leave tomorrow.

289
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,560
Then, Miss Bai,

290
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:45,670
will you come to see me off tomorrow?

291
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:49,840
Yun Yi.

292
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:52,880
Yun Yi.

293
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:53,960
Miss Minmin.

294
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:57,000
Yun Yi doesn't usually
sleep on the roof at night.

295
00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:00,290
Why are you calling me, Miss Minmin?

296
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:07,000
Could I ask you for a favor?

297
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:16,860
[Capital]

298
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,600
Although you're there to investigate

299
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,320
the Su family's tax transfers,

300
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,460
you must also learn from the former cases.

301
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:18,320
Don't be like

302
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,920
those other officials before you,

303
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,400
openly investigating everything.

304
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,500
If you want to take down the Su family,

305
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,480
you need a different approach.

306
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:27,410
Only by making them believe

307
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,800
you're someone
who values gain over integrity

308
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,060
might they draw you in.

309
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,400
And once they let their guard down,

310
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,480
that's when you strike.

311
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:42,110
[Capital]

312
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,080
Yu, Yu!

313
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,400
Are you even listening to me?

314
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,120
No.

315
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,520
Alright, alright.

316
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,480
I hear you.

317
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,980
You're even naggier than me.

318
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:55,030
And to think I gave up sleep

319
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:55,930
just to see you off.

320
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:57,260
This is the thanks I get?

321
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,050
Young Lord Zhang,

322
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:00,760
if we don't leave now,

323
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,610
we won't reach the post station tonight.

324
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:03,940
Escort him out quickly.

325
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,360
Go on.

326
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:27,370
Greetings, Young Lord Zhang.

327
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,100
Miss Minmin is
at the Prince of Dingbei's Mansion

328
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,480
and cannot leave the Princess.

329
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,350
She asked me to come

330
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:32,880
and see you off in her place.

331
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:36,280
Did she leave me any words?

332
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,000
Zhang Huaiyu,

333
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,080
come back early.

334
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,200
I don't want to manage

335
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,200
that rundown shop of yours for long.

336
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,140
Anything else?

337
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,720
There's one more thing.

338
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:50,050
But Miss Minmin had a strange expression.

339
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,880
I couldn't quite copy it.

340
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:53,680
She said,

341
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,440
"Keep your guard up.

342
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,170
Make sure you come back alive."

343
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,290
Thank you, Miss Yun.

344

Minmin,

565
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:39,440
I've always wanted to ask Father

566
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:43,370
when he took up his post years ago,

567
00:37:45,790 --> 00:37:48,400
why did he take
only Ming Chu and her mother

568
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:55,720
and leave me behind
in this mansion?

569
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,360
All these years,

570
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:02,160
I've carefully managed the household,

571
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:06,080
building a name
and reputation for us in the capital.

572
00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:09,600
In the end,

573
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:13,680
it was all to win Father's approval,

574
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:19,640
to be closer to him.

575
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,520
For five long years,

576
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:26,140
I wished every day for his return.

577
00:38:27,490 --> 00:38:30,880
But when I finally saw him again,

578
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,200
though my heart was full of words,

579
00:38:36,330 --> 00:38:38,640
I didn't know where to begin.

580
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:44,400
I thought we still had time,

581
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,520
plenty of time

582
00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:50,360
for me to be a filial daughter,

583
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:53,720
to make up for the distance

584
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,600
and regret

585
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,200
between us.

586
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,840
But how could I have known

587
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,560
that in the span of a single day,

588
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,720
death would separate us forever?

589
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:34,840
Your Highness,

590
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:38,680
though I never met the Marquis,

591
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,440
I believe that when he brought

592
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,160
your sister along,

593
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,240
it wasn't out of favoritism.

594
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:51,840
Yun Yi, how would you know that?

595
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:16,280
His Highness told me.

596
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,920
Before the Marquis left,

597
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,360
he met with His Highness.

598
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,400
He didn't wish to see you

599
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:24,080
because he feared it would

600
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:25,610
only bring you more sorrow.

601
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,360
He said

602
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:30,880
parting in life
is better than farewell in death.

603
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,840
He begged His Highness again and again

604
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:35,160
to protect you,

605
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,680
to help you let go of the pain

606
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:39,600
and recover soon.

607
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,960
What else did Father say?

608
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,960
The Marquis also said...

609
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,480
“When I set off for Yangxi Prefecture,

610
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,160
I feared I'd be gone for many years.

611
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:56,600
If I left Liu and her daughter behind,
they might make things hard for Tan.

612
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,440
And the southern frontier
was often at war,

613
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:00,170
the people living in hardship.

614
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,680
If I brought her,

615
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,200
she'd suffer too.

616
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:09,400
So after much thought,

617
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,400
I decided to take Liu and her daughter

618
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:14,840
with me.

619
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:18,940
Tan lost her mother at a young age.

620
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:22,640
I already owed her too much.

621
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:27,520
How could I let her suffer again
by taking her to the borderlands?

622
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,720
But ever since then,

623
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,600
whenever I left home,

624
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:36,240
Tan never came to see me off again.

625
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,240
She must

626
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,920
have felt hurt,

627
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,440
