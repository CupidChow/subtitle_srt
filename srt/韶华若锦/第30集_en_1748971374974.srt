1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm going to make a little bit of a

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
little bit of a little bit of a

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
little bit of a little bit of a

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
little bit of a little bit of a little

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
bit of a little bit of a little

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
bit of a little bit of a little

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
bit of a little bit of a little

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
bit of a little bit of a little

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
bit of a little bit of a little

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
bit of a little bit of a little bit

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
of a little bit of a little bit

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
of a little bit of a little bit

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
of a little bit of a little bit

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
of a little bit of a little bit

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
of a little bit of a little

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
bit of a little bit

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
of a little bit of a little

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
bit of a little bit of a little

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
bit of a little bit of a little

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
bit of a little bit of a little

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
bit of a little bit of a little

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
bit of a little bit of a little

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
bit of a little bit of a little

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
bit of a little bit of a little

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
bit of a little bit of a little

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
bit of a little bit of a little

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
bit of a little bit of a little

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
bit of a little bit of a little

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
bit of a little bit of

30
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000
little little little

31
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,780
It'slavered by rare styles.

32
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:00,100
How can matter with me?

33
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,180
You and I...

34
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:05,320
You're a ghost, I've made my name a shrine.

35
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,500
I'm just a ghost, save your words!

36
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,100
Everything you write is junitary,

37
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,280
it's all увed by tea.

38
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,660
Are you expecting death Milan Shaphras?

39
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,360
I'm a fragile person,

40
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,900
how can I have love

41
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,000
without a ghost?

42
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,200
I'm defeated already!

43
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,120
Why are you moving the Cannon?

44
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,040
Why are you moving the Cannon?

45
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,120
Are you currently thinking how to get out?

46
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,120
Leave now.

47
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,320
Why can't I travel out?

48
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,720
You'll probably have to balance me out.

49
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,040
Be careful.

50
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,600
Move, be careful.

51
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,320
Come on.

52
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,760
Creating an entity...

53
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,580
I'll consider you're in danger.

54
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:53,880
One...

55
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,960
You are a red-hearted couple.

56
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,960
You are no match for The Eight Great depictvers.

57
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,640
The queen of the court,

58
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,480
Elder Brother,

59
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,720
duly got engaged with me.

60
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,720
Through these7i,

61
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,000
you know how did the dark knight

62
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,800
not fit on the drive?

63
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,400
Where did it come from?

64
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,600
That way he left to Ut servants.

65
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,200
I seldom readbike Watch remake

66
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,760
and said I don't have to marry.

67
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,160
I realize

68
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,560
that he was particularly dealing with her.

69
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,560
I have Tan to help me.

70
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,560
I will have a baby.

71
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,560
What's the use of being husband?

72
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,560
Husband is a big help.

73
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,560
He doesn't have a child.

74
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,560
You like children so much.

75
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,560
We are also

76
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,560
late for work.

77
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,560
I like children.

78
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,560
But there are many good wolves in the world.

79
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,560
Who will be late for work?

80
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,560
Eat and dream.

81
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,560
Really?

82
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,560
You have to make it clear.

83
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,560
Why should I eat and dream?

84
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,560
Where is the good wolf?

85
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,560
Where?

86
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,560
I will find him.

87
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,560
I am lazy to talk nonsense with you.

88
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,560
Tan,

89
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,560
I will go to Tianzhou's house with my nephew.

90
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,560
I thank you for your understanding.

91
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,560
Brother Lv,

92
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,560
go.

93
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,560
Yes.

94
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,560
I think

95
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,560
for three years,

96
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,560
it's been three days

97
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,560
that you have changed your plan.

98
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,560
Go after him.

99
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,560
Don't chase him.

100
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,560
You are so lucky to have changed it.

101
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,560
Don't you want to be a man?

102
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,560
Have he ever had a man?

103
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,560
No.

104
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,560
This is cute.

105
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,560
Miss Bai,

106
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,560
Miss Bai,

107
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,560
you are so beautiful.

108
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,560
Why don't we

109
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,560
come to see you?

110
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,560
You are so nice.

111
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,560
What is your idea

112
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,560
to send me out?

113
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,560
As long as you say something,

114
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,560
I will do my best.

115
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,560
Why don't you

116
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,560
find a wooden house

117
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,560
and build a small bed?

118
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,560
But I have to

119
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,560
build a house

120
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,560
with a colorful flower.

121
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,560
I have to make it myself.

122
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,560
Good.

123
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,560
Who will marry you?

124
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,560
You are so smart.

125
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,560
Miss Bai

126
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,560
designed a small bed

127
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,560
and built it

128
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,560
to be worth a lot of money.

129
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,560
When I sleep outside,

130
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,560
I will feel

131
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,560
the love of my mother.

132
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,560
She is sweet and sweet.

133
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,560
Mi Mi,

134
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,560
you are thinking about the crown prince.

135
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,560
But you want to eat it yourself.

136
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,560
Good.

137
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,560
Then I will take Miss Bai

138
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,560
to the palace.

139
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,560
Do you think

140
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,560
the prince is too nervous?

141
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,560
He is like a bird

142
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,560
in the palace.

143
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,560
I have never seen

144
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,560
Ah Xu

145
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,560
so nervous about someone.

146
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,560
But you didn't find out

147
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,560
that the princess

148
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,560
is very useful to her.

149
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,560
She is very happy.

150
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,560
Really?

151
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,560
Is this

152
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,560
the peach blossom dress?

153
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,560
Of course.

154
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,560
Isn't it the peach blossom dress?

155
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,560
It is the peach blossom dress.

156
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,560
I heard that there are 108 girls

157
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,560
in Lingzhou.

158
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,560
Among them,

159
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,560
there are many girls

160
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,560
with a lot of girls.

161
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,560
They are all men

162
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,560
who are very gentle and gentle.

163
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,560
Have you ever seen them?

164
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,560
I have never seen them.

165
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,560
They are all beautiful.

166
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,560
What about

167
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,560
the girls in Shangjing City?

168
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,560
The girl in Shangjing City

169
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,560
is not very popular.

170
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,560
But if it is about the style,

171
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,560
the girls in Lingzhou

172
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,560
are more popular.

173
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,560
Why don't you bring

174
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,560
the girl

175
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,560
with the peach blossom dress back to Shangjing City?

176
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,560
What girl with the peach blossom dress?

177
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,560
The girl.

178
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,560
The girl.

179
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,560
What's wrong?

180
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,560
Where are you from?

181
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,560
You are a stranger.

182
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,560
Let me ask you.

183
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,560
Did you

184
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,560
treat her with love

185
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,560
and treat her with love?

186
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,560
Of course.

187
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,560
Not only that,

188
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,560
I also treat her with love

189
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,560
every day.

190
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,560
I am afraid that she will be ruined.

191
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,560
You are not supportive.

192
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,560
Then you should

193
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,560
be with the girl

194
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,560
with the peach blossom dress.

195
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,560
You should be together forever.

196
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,560
I am going to marry

197
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,560
the girl with the peach blossom dress.

198
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,560
What's the problem?

199
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,560
No problem.

200
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,560
Mimian,

201
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,560
isn't the dress

202
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,560
the one you went to

203
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,560
Han Yan Temple

204
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,560
to give me a gift?

205
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,560
Shouldn't I try it?

206
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,560
Me?

207
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,560
I have been here

208
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,560
for years.

209
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,560
How could I give you a gift?

210
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,560
I...

211
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,560
I...

212
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,560
I was just

213
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,560
talking about the little girl.

214
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,560
Actually,

215
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,560
I got it wrong

216
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,560
and I got it wrong.

217
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,560
What?

218
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,560
Mimian,

219
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,560
look.

220
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,560
I got it wrong

221
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,560
and it means

222
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,560
that we are destined to be together.

223
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,560
And

224
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,560
the peach blossom dress

225
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,560
is the one

226
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,560
you went to.

227
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,560
And

228
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,560
it's the peach blossom dress.

229
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,560
Wait a minute.

230
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,560
You said

231
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,560
you went to Han Yan Temple

232
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,560
to get a gift?

233
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,560
Okay.

234
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,560
How could I hear you

235
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,560
say

236
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,560
it's the little girl's dress?

237
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,560
You should have told me

238
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,560
clearly

239
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,560
what the little girl is.

240
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,560
I didn't say it.

241
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:34,560
You treat me as a little girl.

242
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,560
You should have told me

243
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,560
what the little girl is.

244
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,560
The six departments are in a state of disdain

245
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,560
but no one is on the top.

246
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,560
Especially in Lingzhou.

247
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,560
Although the Su family is on the top,

248
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,560
but there is still a lot of work left

249
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,560
to be done in the court.

250
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,560
Do you have any opinions?

251
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,560
No.

252
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:26,620
The

253
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:28,620
queen is not here.

254
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:29,620
She is not in the palace.

255
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:30,620
You are still here.

256
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:32,620
Do you still want to

257
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:33,620
stay in the capital

258
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:34,620
to be like her?

259
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:37,620
Yang Xilu is already the leader of the people.

260
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:39,620
Dingbei Army

261
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,620
can't stay here for a day.

262
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:47,620
Your Majesty, please be at ease.

263
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,620
There is a decree.

264
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:49,620
Dingbei Army

265
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:50,620
can't leave the capital.

266
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:52,620
The decree is in place.

267
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:54,620
He can't leave the capital.

268
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:55,620
You can't leave the capital.

269
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:56,620
Shen Yu has been practicing for years.

270
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:57,620
He has been experienced.

271
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:58,620
He can be the leader of the people.

272
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:00,620
As for Yang Xilu,

273
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:02,620
I do have a choice.

274
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:04,620
Let's see

275
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:05,620
if His Majesty agrees.

276
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:07,620
Who?

277
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:08,620
Lingzhou.

278
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:09,620
Feng Xuling.

279
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:13,620
Feng Xuling?

280
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:18,620
The decree is in place.

281
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:19,620
Can I

282
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:20,620
marry you for a while?

283
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,620
We will meet again.

284
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:23,620
Your Highness.

285
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:24,620
Jiang Xu.

286
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:25,620
Thank you, Your Majesty.

287
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:30,620
Your Majesty.

288
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:32,620
What's the matter?

289
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:33,620
Shujingran,

290
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:34,620
the editor of the Hanlin Academy,

291
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:36,620
asks to see you.

292
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:37,620
Shuer.

293
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:38,620
Xuan.

294
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:39,620
Yes.

295
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:42,620
Xuan.

296
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:43,620
Shujingran,

297
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:44,620
the editor of the Hanlin Academy,

298
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:45,620
asks to see you.

299
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:51,620
Your Majesty.

300
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:53,620
What's the matter?

301
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:54,620
The editor of the Hanlin Academy,

302
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:55,620
asks to see you.

303
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:56,620
What's the matter?

304
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:57,620
Your Majesty is

305
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:58,620
deciding

306
00:10:58,620 --> 00:10:59,620
who will be chosen by Lingzhou.

307
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:01,620
Lingzhou is a large-scale

308
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:02,620
and rich city.

309
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:04,620
It's a major

310
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,620
and important city.

311
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:09,620
I don't know

312
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:11,620
what to choose.

313
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:14,620
I'm sure that

314
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:15,620
Wang Rujing will be chosen

315
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:17,620
by seven officials.

316
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:19,620
Your Majesty.

317
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,620
I'm afraid that I'll be in trouble.

318
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:22,620
I'm willing to

319
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:23,620
share the burden for you.

320
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:33,620
It's not a matter of

321
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:34,620
the state of Zhao and Xi.

322
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:37,620
I can't

323
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:38,620
live for many years.

324
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:40,620
I know.

325
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:49,620
Do you know what's going on?

326
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:53,620
Your Majesty.

327
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:54,620
I've been in the Hanlin Academy

328
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:55,620
for many years.

329
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:56,620
I didn't just

330
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:57,620
have to live for a long time.

331
00:11:58,620 --> 00:11:59,620
I've thought about it.

332
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:01,620
I've thought about it.

333
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:02,620
I've thought about it.

334
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:03,620
I've thought about it.

335
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:04,620
I've thought about it.

336
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:05,620
I've thought about it.

337
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:06,620
I've thought about it.

338
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:15,620
Your Majesty, please.

339
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,620
I've beenokes

340
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:23,880
the desolated

341
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,880
eons of problems.

342
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:36,620
Your Majesty, please.

343
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:41,340
Prince of Yan

344
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:42,460
mache up enough

345
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:43,620
His Majesty's word.

346
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:44,620
If you can go,

347
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:46,940
I will be satisfied.

348
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,180
But I want to know

349
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:52,540
why you decided to do this.

350
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,500
I, Xin Yue Yi,

351
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,100
will be with her

352
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:05,380
until the end of the world.

353
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:07,660
I don't want to

354
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:09,740
bother you anymore.

355
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:11,940
I just want to be able to

356
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:13,340
make a move

357
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:14,980
and let her come.

358
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:23,860
Your Majesty.

359
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:27,340
Lu Yiding.

360
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:28,780
I am here.

361
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:32,220
You are allowed.

362
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:35,820
Thank you, Your Majesty.

363
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:44,000
It's tough to

364
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:45,820
despise you today.

365
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:48,940
I hope you

366
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,620
will join us in the night.

367
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:13,040
that we just started for May 29

368
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,120
Miss Yun

369
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,920
Come in here please

370
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:43,940
You love these?

371
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:46,940
And...

372
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:48,940
Look.

373
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:50,940
This is the last Shaoji I sold today.

374
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:51,940
Take it back.

375
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:52,940
I'm starving.

376
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:53,940
Eat slowly.

377
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:04,940
Second Young Master Shu

378
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:05,940
invited me here.

379
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,940
But I have something to say.

380
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:08,940
I'm sorry.

381
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:09,940
I'm sorry.

382
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:11,940
But I have something to say.

383
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:41,940
Miss Yun.

384
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:44,940
We've been together for so long.

385
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:47,940
I think you know what I'm thinking.

386
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,940
You've already noticed.

387
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,940
I've made a promise to Miss Yun

388
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:56,940
in the future

389
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:59,940
because I want to take care of you.

390
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:00,940
I...

391
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:02,940
Second Young Master Shu, don't say that.

392
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:06,940
I've read a book.

393
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:08,940
I don't know what it is.

394
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:10,940
But I know that

395
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:13,940
you're a good son.

396
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:16,940
Whether it's Qian Cheng or Yin Yuan,

397
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:19,940
I'll make a promise for you.

398
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:25,940
I...

399
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:29,940
Yun Yi can be with you.

400
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:31,940
We're together.

401
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:33,940
We're together.

402
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:35,940
I'm so lucky.

403
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:39,940
No matter what you think,

404
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:41,940
but in my heart,

405
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:44,940
I just want to make you my friend.

406
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:48,940
It's not about the fate.

407
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:50,940
I have feelings.

408
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:54,940
I'm sorry.

409
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:02,940
If I say that I'll lose this life,

410
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:04,940
I'll lose it.

411
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,940
I'm sorry.

412
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:06,940
I'm sorry I'm a little bit late.

413
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:10,940
iyi

414
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:19,940
They run away.

415
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,940
You've made a promise.

416
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:26,940
Please stay with me.

417
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:29,940
Don't say that.

418
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:31,940
I just want to make you my friend.

419
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,940
I'm a man.

420
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:38,940
I'm willing to spend my life for you.

421
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:42,940
The light can be our witness.

422
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:45,940
You and I are the same.

423
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:48,940
We are just like you.

424
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:51,940
You are the master of Second Young Master's family.

425
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:58,940
You are the best woman in the world.

426
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,940
You are the best in my mind.

427
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:05,940
I'm willing to spend my life for you.

428
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:10,940
I'm a wife of Master Lin.

429
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:13,940
After she passed away,

430
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:15,940
I'm just my self.

431
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:18,940
We are not even in a family.

432
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:23,940
You told me

433
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:25,940
that the best life

434
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:29,940
is the one we live in.

435
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:32,940
The most effective one?

436
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:34,940
I don't know.

437
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:38,940
But I think the best thing is the present.

438
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:48,940
The present is the best.

439
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,940
I want to hear the moment you stay.

440
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:33,940
Yunyi, do you want to go to the forest with me?

441
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:40,940
Since then, we have been together and gone our own way.

442
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:44,940
To the Jingying, to the future of us.

443
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:01,940
I want to see you.

444
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:12,940
Princess.

445
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:20,940
What's wrong?

446
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:26,940
I feel a little bit guilty.

447
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:29,940
You look so big.

448
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:31,940
Only you and Princess are good to me.

449
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:35,940
But now, you are so alone.

450
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:39,940
She also cares about me.

451
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:44,940
That feeling is like...

452
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:48,940
It's like...

453
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:52,940
I am always holding you in my hand.

454
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:54,940
In my heart.

455
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:59,940
What you said and what you want to do...

456
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:02,940
She will be more sad than you.

457
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:11,940
What did Young Master Shou say to you?

458
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:19,940
Princess, I mean him.

459
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:23,940
The person you lost to the Haoyou Sect was Lu.

460
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:28,940
Young Master Shou insisted on staying overnight to save you.

461
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:32,940
For that, he also gave birth to a baby.

462
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:37,940
He once asked for your leave for Yunwei.

463
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:47,940
But he never mentioned it to me.

464
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:54,940
That's because he knows that you two have a lot of love.

465
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:58,940
If you don't have the right to confess,

466
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:01,940
you will be hurt.

467
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:07,940
I don't know what he said to you.

468
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:10,940
But as long as he says it,

469
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:14,940
he will be ready to do everything he wants.

470
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:20,940
He wants to ask me if I want to be with him.

471
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:24,940
But I don't understand.

472
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:28,940
There are so many good girls in the capital.

473
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:30,940
Why do you think it's me?

474
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:33,940
There are so many beauties in the world.

475
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:36,940
Why do you love Shao Ji so much?

476
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:38,940
You like her, so you like her.

477
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:39,940
Why not?

478
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:42,940
You just need to ask yourself.

479
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:48,940
Do you feel happy when you are with Young Master Shou?

480
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:53,940
Does he have anything special to do with you?

481
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:06,940
Be careful.

482
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:16,940
Of course.

483
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:31,940
Since Miss Yun塗體會的淚倫在互人中,

484
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:36,940
I want you guys to wish each other this far in life.

485
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:37,940
Be careful.

486
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:55,940
But if you don't protect me,

487
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:00,940
I can't give myself an answer.

488
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:09,940
I will stay with you for several years.

489
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:13,940
In the long night, like a star,

490
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:19,940
I will be with you forever.

491
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:24,940
The story is dangerous.

492
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:32,940
The faraway flowers are full of light.

493
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:37,940
The light of the universe is shining.

494
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:42,940
The starry night is just passing by.

495
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:46,940
The light of the universe is just passing by.

496
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:50,940
The faraway flowers are full of light.

497
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:55,940
The night of the four years is like a garden.

498
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:58,940
The light of the universe is just passing by.

499
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:01,940
But I feel much better after this trip.

500
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:04,940
Life changes its plan.

501
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:06,940
Who can predict what will happen in the future?

502
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:08,940
What Miss Yun said is that

503
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:10,940
rather than rushing into the future,

504
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:12,940
we should cherish the present.

505
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:24,940
The fire of the night.

506
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:30,940
I will remember this life forever.

507
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:37,940
Your own feelings are the most real.

508
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:40,940
No need to say anything else.

509
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:41,940
You can also feel

510
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:43,940
that Mr. Shu'er's feelings for you

511
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:47,940
and your feelings for yourself.

512
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:52,940
I understand.

513
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:54,940
Then do you want to go to Lingzhou?

514
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:58,940
But...

515
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:02,940
But what if I go to Lingzhou?

516
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:03,940
What about you?

517
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:04,940
What about you?

518
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:05,940
You are silly.

519
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:08,940
Jin Yun Wei will always be your family.

520
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:11,940
You have to have your own rules and lives.

521
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:14,940
No matter where you want to go

522
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:16,940
and who you want to be with,

523
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:18,940
you don't need to worry about anything else.

524
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:20,940
You just need to ask yourself.

525
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:22,940
Do you want to be with the person you want to be with?

526
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:26,940
I don't want to be with you.

527
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:28,940
I don't want to be with you.

528
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:30,940
I don't want to be with you.

529
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:32,940
I don't want to be with you.

530
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:35,940
I don't want to be with you.

531
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:02,940
Where did this blood come from?

532
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:05,940
Your Highness, it was brought back by His Highness.

533
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:07,940
It's said that it's cold today.

534
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:09,940
I went to Jinxiu Fang's place to pick up the blood from the upper city

535
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:11,940
and made you a big dress.

536
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:14,940
Where is your husband?

537
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:19,940
His Highness must be in the study to deal with the matter.

538
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:25,940
This is a difficult situation.

539
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:27,940
We have to take the initiative to break the rule of war.

540
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:29,940
I will definitely pay for the risk.

541
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:32,940
But now, the Western Regions are in the hands of the army.

542
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:34,940
They are only trying to get the army to the top.

543
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:38,940
I'm afraid the army will have to fight with the south.

544
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:42,940
I've been in the army since the war in Dongzhou.

545
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:44,940
I've been in the army for a year.

546
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:48,940
Although my army is only fighting against the northern army,

547
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:50,940
but we are all the same.

548
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:52,940
We are the same.

549
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:54,940
We are the same.

550
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:56,940
We are the same.

551
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:00,940
It's not a big deal to fight with the northern army.

552
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:02,940
If you dare to break my rule,

553
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:04,940
you will have to fight him.

554
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:06,940
Yes, you have to fight him.

555
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:09,940
Husband.

556
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:21,940
Let's go.

557
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:28,940
You are so young.

558
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:30,940
Why don't you rest?

559
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:33,940
I will be back soon after I finish the work.

560
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:36,940
Husband.

561
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:38,940
It's good that Tan sent you to the academy.

562
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:40,940
It's also a good idea to use your heart to pick the right one.

563
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:44,940
But Tan still likes to wear the same clothes as you.

564
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:47,940
It's both good and bad.

565
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:58,940
Why don't you go back to Qiantang first?

566
00:29:58,940 --> 00:29:59,940
I will be back soon.

567
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:00,940
You are here again?

568
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:02,940
I...

569
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:03,940
Husband.

570
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:04,940
Tan is hungry.

571
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:08,940
Tan wants to eat the golden rice and the jade.

572
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:13,940
Tan also wants to feed Tan the golden rice and jade.

573
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:19,940
I will go to the study room now.

574
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:21,940
Tan will go back to his room first.

575
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:25,940
Why do you always want to drive me away?

576
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:27,940
Do you hide the golden rice and the jade?

577
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:29,940
Don't you want Tan to see you?

578
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:33,940
I hide it from you.

579
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:36,940
Fine.

580
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:39,940
As long as you kiss me, I will go.

581
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:40,940
Come.

582
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:57,940
You know, we should listen to something we shouldn't.

583
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:00,940
Prince won't let us stay in this room forever.

584
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:03,940
Stop it.

585
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:04,940
Go back to your room.

586
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:05,940
I won't.

587
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:08,940
The study room is not air-conditioned.

588
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:11,940
You should take me back to my room and feed Tan.

589
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:12,940
Okay?

590
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:13,940
Let's go.

591
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:17,940
I want to take Tan back.

592
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:32,940
There is a secret room.

593
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:35,940
I am meeting the doctor before Tan comes.

594
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:39,940
Go.

595
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:40,940
You want to let me go?

596
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:04,940
What are you doing?

597
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:08,940
You are so normal.

598
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:09,940
You don't need to get married.

599
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:19,940
What are you doing?

600
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:22,940
You are so normal.

601
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:23,940
You don't need to get married.

602
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:27,940
What are you doing?

603
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:29,940
I am not a man.

604
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:31,940
Don't worry.

605
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:33,940
I have warned them.

606
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:36,940
They won't mention the business to anyone.

607
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:39,940
Tan will not be able to take half of the money

608
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:41,940
that he has earned.

609
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:43,940
I don't want to talk.

610
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:45,940
I want to be quiet.

611
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:47,940
The door is open.

612
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:48,940
Besides,

613
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:51,940
we should take care of the little guy in the house.

614
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:56,940
Didn't you say you were hungry just now?

615
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:57,940
Use some snacks.

616
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:02,940
I wanted to talk to you about Yun Yi and Shuai Er.

617
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:04,940
I didn't expect to be so noisy.

618
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:06,940
Tan Er?

619
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:07,940
What's the matter?

620
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:23,940
That's the thing.

621
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:24,940
If you are not sure,

622
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:26,940
that's the thing.

623
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:27,940
What do you think?

624
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:33,940
I just want to talk to you about Yun Yi.

625
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:39,940
Eat more.

626
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:42,940
We have prepared many dishes that you like.

627
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:46,940
Don't worry about Tan.

628
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:47,940
You should eat more.

629
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:49,940
Try this.

630
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:50,940
Try this.

631
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:54,940
My lady.

632
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:56,940
What can I do for you?

633
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:04,940
I have something to do with you.

634
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:05,940
But it's not easy.

635
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:06,940
It's been a long time.

636
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:08,940
Are you willing to do it?

637
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:10,940
I can do it.

638
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:13,940
I order you to follow Shuai Er,

639
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:15,940
to go to Ling Zhou and protect each other.

640
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:17,940
After that,

641
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:19,940
you should be more polite and carefree.

642
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:22,940
You may admit it.

643
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:40,940
Yun Yi will definitely do as you wish.

644
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:49,940
Yun Yi.

645
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:53,940
Here.

646
00:34:57,940 --> 00:34:58,940
Take care.

647
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:09,940
Yes.

648
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:18,940
Yun Yi.

649
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:49,940
Yun Yi.

650
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:06,940
What are you looking for, my lady?

651
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:08,940
I will help you find it.

652
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:10,940
Mother Zhang said that

653
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:12,940
when you married into the House of Marquis,

654
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:13,940
you had been prepared for her.

655
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:15,940
Where is she now?

656
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:17,940
She was brought here by the housekeeper.

657
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:19,940
She was brought here by the housekeeper.

658
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:20,940
I will get her for you.

659
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:22,940
Wait.

660
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:24,940
You should go to the embroidery shop later.

661
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:26,940
You should get her more clothes

662
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:27,940
according to Yun Yi's figure.

663
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:28,940
And

664
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:30,940
the handkerchief and shoes.

665
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:32,940
You should prepare the clothes for her.

666
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:37,940
The head of the housekeeper

667
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:40,940
is going to marry Yun Yi.

668
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:42,940
Isn't that right?

669
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:45,940
Yun Yi will not be able to hold me for ten days.

670
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:47,940
But I have a true love for her.

671
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:51,940
She is a motherless and lonely person.

672
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:54,940
If she can really marry

673
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:55,940
Prince Shu'er in the future,

674
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:56,940
and get married,

675
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:57,940
I hope that

676
00:36:57,940 --> 00:36:59,940
she can get married face to face.

677
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:01,940
And get a new husband.

678
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:03,940
I wonder when you can

679
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:06,940
see her again.

680
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:40,940
Directed by

681
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:46,940
You say I'm the bastard

682
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:50,140
and I automulate the view.

683
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:51,780
I can leave anytime.

684
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:59,040
Don't you rewarding me?

685
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,320
I'm afraid that you'd ever feel sorry for me

686
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,760
because he will be your stepson.

687
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:08,000
Don't feel so sad.

688
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,840
Parting provides comfort.

689
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,760
I'm sure the coloured IoT

690
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:15,340
should be more than way more love than passion.

691
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:38,760
You accompanied me

692
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,820
and reached an imperfection in sleep.

693
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:47,760
I was a child, and your family was gone.

694
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,760
I thought I would never be able to live like this.

695
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,760
But since I met you,

696
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:56,760
I have had a family.

697
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:59,760
I have a family of ordinary people.

698
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,760
And my sister.

699
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:06,760
I have been living a peaceful life.

700
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,760
I have left.

701
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,760
I hope you can have a good life.

702
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:14,760
In the future,

703
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:18,760
I will help you to be a good son.

704
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:21,760
I will be brave like you.

705
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:26,760
I will do my best to make you happy.

706
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,760
I hope to see you again.

707
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,760
I will be a better myself.

708
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,760
I won't let you down.

709
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:43,760
Who is with me?

710
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:50,760
Is it a dream or a dream?

711
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,760
I am happy to see you.

712
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:58,760
Don't be afraid that I will be with you.

713
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:04,760
I will be happy.

714
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,760
Of course I will be happy for her.

715
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,760
But I can't bear to be alone.

716
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:15,760
If she is pregnant,

717
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,760
and you are well,

718
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:21,760
we will visit her in the forest.

719
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:26,760
My lord,

720
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:27,760
Princess,

721
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,760
Prince Zhang sent someone to deliver something.

722
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,760
He said that he would know what Miss Biao meant.

723
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:34,760
My lord,

724
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:35,760
Princess.

725
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,760
What a delicate bed.

726
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:54,760
You are so lucky.

727
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:57,760
You said that

728
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,760
you have been good at everything.

729
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,760
But you are a good boy.

730
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,760
You should learn from him.

731
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,760
You should learn from him.

732
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,760
I will choose the name of the princess

733
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,760
and the prince.

734
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:15,760
I will choose the name of the child.

735
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,760
I will choose the name of the prince.

736
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:45,760
Ding.

737
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:47,760
Jiang Ding.

738
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:01,760
Beigui.

739
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:03,760
Is this a word?

740
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:07,760
I haven't been born yet.

741
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,760
So I will choose the word.

742
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,760
I was born a long time ago.

743
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:14,760
So I have a word.

744
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:20,760
My lord,

745
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:23,760
please use your own style

746
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,760
to make a name for the child.

747
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:28,760
Ding Beigui.

748
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:33,760
This is the glory of my lord.

749
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:49,760
Rong,

750
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,760
don't bully Koukou.

751
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:52,760
Koukou is my sister.

752
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:54,760
Only I can bully her.

753
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:58,760
I want to be a sister who can bully her.

754
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:00,760
Auntie, aunt.

755
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:02,760
Aunt,

756
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:05,760
can I be your sister today?

757
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:08,760
No, you can't.

758
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:12,760
Of course, you should listen to your wife.

759
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:15,760
I remember that you don't want to be a princess.

760
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,760
So I will ask you again tomorrow.

761
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:23,760
Wow, this fire is so beautiful.

762
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,760
Koukou is cooking for you tonight.

763
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:26,760
It's different.

764
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:28,760
It's different.

765
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:43,760
Ah Xu.
