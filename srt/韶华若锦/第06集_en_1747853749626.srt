1
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,200
How is she birding?

2
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:04,040
Ak Everything?

3
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:08,180
Are you crazy

4
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:09,960
what else can you say?

5
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:11,540
I said I will bring her to you

6
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,720
You can charge me for you enemies

7
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:21,380
if you want to kill me

8
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,100
This ,how did you will do it

9
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:28,800
If it is gone

10
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:29,840
We will never see it again

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,640
You can't let your father hear this.

12
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,080
He has been helping you to get your husband's attention.

13
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,440
Don't make him angry now.

14
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:42,440
I don't have the heart to get the attention of the Princess Consort of the North.

15
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:48,880
If you want to compare with Mingtan, you can't.

16
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:56,240
His Majesty's marriage is also the one of the King of the North.

17
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,880
It's not something that a normal girl can do.

18
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:05,000
I know. But how am I inferior to him?

19
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:09,000
You are not inferior to him.

20
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,400
It's all my fault.

21
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,920
If you were born in the hands of the Princess Consort,

22
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:19,640
you would be the one who is now the King of the North.

23
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,720
Mother.

24
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,960
Mother.

25
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,520
You can call me mother in the house.

26
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,840
But you can't be so casual about this outside.

27
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,680
Or else, Mingtan will hear you and trouble you again.

28
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:45,320
To be honest, if you can really become the Princess Consort,

29
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:49,920
it will depend on your face to do what you want.

30
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,360
Even if it's Mingtan, I have to thank you.

31
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,880
Enough. Let's not talk about this.

32
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,240
Let's go. Don't delay the meeting.

33
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,560
I'm not going.

34
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,680
It's only because I'm older sister that I have to rush to marry him.

35
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,080
What kind of logic is this?

36
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,360
This meeting was made by your father.

37
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,800
How can you go against it?

38
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,760
Forget about the meeting. Why does Mingtan have to go with you?

39
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,400
Isn't he trying to make fun of me?

40
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,480
I told your father.

41
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,480
Mingtan is the one who is going to marry the Princess Consort of the North.

42
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:23,480
It's not just you that she has to go with you.

43
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:27,920
I don't think she will be able to see you clearly.

44
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:31,720
Listen to me. Just go out as usual.

45
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,960
Be careful on your way.

46
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,560
No matter what happens,

47
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,360
you must protect yourself.

48
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:46,840
Why don't you tell me your father'sí˜€br personnes

49
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:47,840
information?

50
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,480
There is truth.

51
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,360
I told you many times not to come on a short notice.

52
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,240
It's okay if he feels you.

53
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,000
Log it immediately.

54
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,000
Key.

55
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:11,320
Okay, got it.

56
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,360
You are a very good daughter.

57
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,360
But you are not a good daughter.

58
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,360
I don't think you should be like this.

59
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,360
I am not a good daughter.

60
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,360
I am her third sister.

61
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,360
I shouldn't have gotten into the car.

62
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,360
Today, I am here to accompany you.

63
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,360
I want to see you.

64
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,360
I am your sister.

65
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,360
You shouldn't be so arrogant.

66
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,360
You shouldn't be so rude.

67
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,360
Why are you crying?

68
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,360
You...

69
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,360
3rd Miss, please get off.

70
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,360
This is my 3rd Miss.

71
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,360
Thank you.

72
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,360
You are welcome.

73
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,360
Mr. Lu has been waiting for you at the hall.

74
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,360
Please come in.

75
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,360
Greetings, Miss.

76
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,360
Where is Mimi?

77
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,360
My Miss said that things have been going wrong.

78
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,360
She is being targeted.

79
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,360
She might have committed a crime.

80
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,360
She said that she will go to the back mountain to look for you.

81
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,360
You go and see.

82
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,360
I will wait for you here.

83
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,360
Why don't you accompany me?

84
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,360
There is no reason for me to accompany you.

85
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,360
You go yourself.

86
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,360
I am afraid that I said something wrong.

87
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,360
You are a good man.

88
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,360
You are loved by His Majesty.

89
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,360
Don't worry too much.

90
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,360
Just treat it as usual.

91
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,360
You just need to remember that

92
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,360
you are looking for someone who is in love.

93
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,360
You are looking for someone who is in love.

94
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,360
What is the most important thing?

95
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,360
What?

96
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,360
The most important thing is to be in love.

97
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,360
Whether you like it or not,

98
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,360
you will know it after looking at it.

99
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,360
If you like it, you will ask it.

100
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,360
You will want to know about it.

101
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,360
But if you don't like it,

102
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,360
you will be distracted.

103
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,360
Then you can leave after looking for a word.

104
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,360
This is a big thing in life.

105
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,360
It is common to look at it.

106
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,360
You will be familiar with it.

107
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,360
You don't need to be nervous.

108
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,360
Have you ever looked at it?

109
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,360
No.

110
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,360
Okay, you wait here.

111
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,360
Go.

112
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,360
Commander Lu.

113
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,360
Commander Lu.

114
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,360
This is the third daughter of the Ming family.

115
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,360
Third daughter, this is Commander Lu.

116
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,360
This is Commander Lu.

117
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,360
You two talk first. I will wait outside.

118
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,360
Miss Ming, please come in.

119
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,360
Please sit.

120
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,360
I am Lu Ting.

121
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,360
I am Lu Ting.

122
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,360
Nice to meet you.

123
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,360
Nice to meet you.

124
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,360
Are you really the commander of the Dianqin branch?

125
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,360
I am not.

126
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,360
Why are you so hot?

127
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,360
You look like a normal person.

128
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,360
You are not very handsome.

129
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,360
Although you are very handsome,

130
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,360
but most of all,

131
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:53,740
your

132
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,360
I am not as good as you.

133
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,360
You are the leader of the court.

134
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:09,360
You have the reputation of a good son.

135
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,360
Everyone in Shangjing has seen you.

136
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:16,360
You have no reputation and no future.

137
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,360
Why are you so arrogant?

138
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,360
I am not a lowly man.

139
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,360
I just want to be the leader of the future.

140
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,360
Your majesty, you have been to the house.

141
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:36,360
But this is not a matter of importance to you.

142
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,360
Why didn't you say so?

143
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,360
It's just a matter of opinion.

144
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,360
It's not a matter of importance.

145
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:54,360
We should know each other's situation.

146
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,360
Why can't we discuss the matter of opinion?

147
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,360
You are right.

148
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,360
But...

149
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:04,360
You should consider your own situation.

150
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,360
But I have my own opinion.

151
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:10,360
Maybe we are not the same kind of people.

152
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,360
I like to eat and sleep in the house.

153
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,360
I don't like the house and I don't like other people's service.

154
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,360
Goodbye.

155
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,360
Mr. Lu, you are leaving?

156
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:36,360
Miss, my sister is going to the house to be the concubine.

157
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,360
She is a lowly and rude person.

158
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,360
How can she be my concubine?

159
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,360
You call yourself the best concubine in Shangjing.

160
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,360
Who are you looking for?

161
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,360
Miss, you are a talented and capable woman.

162
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,360
You are the best concubine in Shangjing.

163
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,360
You deserve the position of the princess.

164
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,360
It's none of your business.

165
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,360
You are a lowly and rude person.

166
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,360
You don't need to worry about your parents' marriage.

167
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,360
You are the leader of the Jin army.

168
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,360
How can you be the concubine?

169
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,360
Mr. Shu.

170
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,360
Mr. Shu.

171
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,360
Mr. Shu.

172
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,360
Please keep this.

173
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,360
No.

174
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,360
Mine.

175
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,360
Mine.

176
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,360
Mine.

177
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,360
Mine.

178
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,360
Mine.

179
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,360
Mine.

180
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,360
Mr. Shu.

181
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,360
Mine.

182
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,360
Mine.

183
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,360
Lu.

184
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,360
Lu.

185
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,360
I am here to save you.

186
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,360
Let go of me.

187
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,360
Mr. Shu.

188
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,360
I am Lu Ting, the leader of the Jin army.

189
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,360
Who are you?

190
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,360
Why are you here?

191
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,360
What do you want?

192
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,360
Come here.

193
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,360
You are the best concubine in Shangjing.

194
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,360
You deserve the position of the princess.

195
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,360
I am glad to have you.

196
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,360
Otherwise, I would not be able to come here.

197
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,360
What are they doing?

198
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,360
They are giving gifts.

199
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,360
Gifts?

200
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,360
Yes.

201
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,360
Why are they stealing?

202
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,360
So many things.

203
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,360
You can go to the market tomorrow.

204
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,360
With your popularity, the business will be very successful.

205
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,360
That's a good idea.

206
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,360
Thank you, Mr. Lu.

207
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,360
I will go to the market tomorrow.

208
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,360
I can also do business.

209
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,360
What else do you want?

210
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,360
My hairpin.

211
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,360
When we were at the court,

212
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,360
the fire was put out twice.

213
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:03,360
It means that our business will be very successful.

214
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,360
It's a good thing.

215
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:09,360
Ah Xu, I will be very happy to see you.

216
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,360
I will be very happy to see you.

217
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,360
You are very kind.

218
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,360
Ah Xu, we will be very happy to see you.

219
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,360
We will be very happy to see you.

220
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,360
I am very happy to see you.

221
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,360
You should help me.

222
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,360
I will help you.

223
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,360
It's him.

224
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,360
The winner of the Chinese Lafeng Championship

225
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,360
is here to take you to the court.

226
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,360
Master.

227
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:03,360
The fear and anxiety are all present.

228
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,360
If you see them clearly, you can only see the empty ship.

229
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,360
You have been very kind recently.

230
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,360
You are very kind.

231
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,360
You are very kind.

232
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,360
That's right.

233
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:19,360
Please help me to get rid of the evil.

234
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,360
Thank you.

235
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,360
I am sorry.

236
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,360
I am sorry.

237
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,360
I am sorry.

238
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:17,360
Stop...

239
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,360
Forget it.

240
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,360
After we had a delicious meal,

241
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:25,360
In the nextperson's place too,

242
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,360
We have once again seen this scene.

243
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:36,560
He coasted an entire palace

244
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,400
Go...

245
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:40,960
Listen.

246
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,760
Western comedies talk aboutlv mint not romantic mass.

247
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:54,880
Only Ms. Min Si can have such lovers in Shangjing.

248
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,200
She....

249
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,560
I shouldn't have done that.

250
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:13,560
How can you make a mistake in the last part of your relationship with Miss Ming Si?

251
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,560
I know.

252
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:20,560
Ah Xu, Miss Ming Si did it on purpose.

253
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,560
Why?

254
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,560
It's because of the Chou Lang Gu from Qu You Gu.

255
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,560
Go and meet your future wife.

256
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,560
Zhang Xiao Ren?

257
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,560
Why is he here?

258
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,560
Why is he here?

259
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,560
He can't say anything behind my back.

260
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:42,560
But I have to give him the card.

261
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,560
Mr. Zhang.

262
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:54,560
Mr. Zhang, come and pray with your friends.

263
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,560
He took the wrong medicine.

264
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:02,560
Yes, Miss Bai did it too.

265
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,560
Yes.

266
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,560
Yes.

267
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,560
Mimi, A Tao.

268
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,560
Greetings, Your Highness.

269
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,560
He is King Dingbei.

270
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:37,560
Greetings, Your Highness.

271
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,560
Don't stand on ceremony.

272
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,560
We are family now.

273
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,560
Of course, we shouldn't stand on ceremony.

274
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,560
Who is this Mimi?

275
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,560
It's Sister Si.

276
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,560
Sister Si is so elegant.

277
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:56,560
I think Ming Chu and Prince have a relationship.

278
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:59,560
We met here after the last meeting.

279
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,560
Brother,

280
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,560
I'm sorry.

281
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,560
I didn't mean to offend you.

282
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,560
I was just wondering.

283
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,560
Who are you?

284
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,560
You don't remember me?

285
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:18,560
We met at a hotel in the city.

286
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,560
I don't remember you.

287
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:27,560
Sister Si, didn't you meet him at the hall?

288
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,560
Why did you leave so soon?

289
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:32,560
He has a family and a good look.

290
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:35,560
But I told him that he is not interested in me.

291
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,560
He is not interested.

292
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,560
So, I have to accompany him.

293
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:41,560
Actually, it's a matter of fate.

294
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:44,560
It's the second time that he has a family.

295
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,560
Ah Xu.

296
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,560
You met Miss Ping San again.

297
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,560
I didn't say that.

298
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:04,560
Did you two meet today?

299
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,560
No.

300
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:08,560
Did you two meet today?

301
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:11,560
So, did you two have a relationship?

302
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:15,560
I don't think I have a relationship with Miss Ming San.

303
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:18,560
She thinks that I have a good look,

304
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,560
a good family,

305
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,560
and a good reputation.

306
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,560
I have a bright future.

307
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,560
I didn't buy a house.

308
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,560
It's not a big deal.

309
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:31,560
I hope that Miss Ming San will find her beloved husband soon.

310
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,560
What do you mean?

311
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,560
It's just boring.

312
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:40,560
Did I say something wrong?

313
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:46,560
You are so quick-tempered.

314
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,560
It's a fate that we meet each other.

315
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,560
Since we met each other,

316
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:56,560
why don't you sing a song for us?

317
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,560
Miss Ling Si.

318
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,560
Please.

319
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,560
Miss Ling Si is always so strict.

320
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:08,560
She didn't tell me that she was going to be in danger.

321
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,560
Now that she is engaged,

322
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,560
she is still in the dark.

323
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,560
If it gets out,

324
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,560
she will be blamed by King Dingbei.

325
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,560
What are you talking about?

326
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,560
You didn't go back to the capital on the night of the wedding.

327
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,560
How could you see Tan get into trouble?

328
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,560
I think you are trying to frame Tan.

329
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,560
I am framing him?

330
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,560
Don't think that I don't know.

331
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,560
You two dressed up on purpose that day.

332
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,560
You did it to get into the capital.

333
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,560
You are trying to frame King Dingbei.

334
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,560
What?

335
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:37,560
You are the one who is always talking about your reputation.

336
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,560
You are the fourth sister.

337
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,560
Shut up!

338
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,560
You are trying to frame Tan.

339
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,560
Don't touch me.

340
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,560
We are all friends.

341
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,560
Why should we be angry?

342
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,560
Let go of me.

343
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,560
Everything I said is true.

344
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,560
Why?

345
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,560
You can't go to the capital and peek.

346
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,560
I won't let you do that.

347
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,560
I won't let you do that.

348
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:00,560
What a beautiful and gentle girl.

349
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,560
What a beautiful and gentle girl.

350
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,560
Did she ruin everything today?

351
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,560
Or did she ruin everything?

352
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,560
Ming Tan, tell me.

353
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,560
Did I say everything?

354
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,560
Miss, what happened?

355
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,560
Miss.

356
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,560
Tan.

357
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,560
You are pretending to be dizzy again.

358
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,560
You always use this trick.

359
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,560
Can you be more careful?

360
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,560
I said, fourth sister.

361
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,560
What?

362
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,560
That's not what I have heard nowadays.

363
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,560
You have changed.

364
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:37,560
You catch your husband like an arrow from the artifact.

365
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,560
You learnt something from him?

366
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,560
Okay.

367
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,560
Tan, what's wrong?

368
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,560
Let me calm down.

369
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,560
Then calm down.

370
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,560
But how can I calm down?

371
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:15,560
I was caught in the middle of the night and was asked to leave.

372
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:19,560
After those people left, I don't know how they will laugh at me.

373
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,560
I think you are thinking too much.

374
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,560
Those people are all friends of the king.

375
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,560
They will not be behind the scenes.

376
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,560
Even if you don't say anything,

377
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:31,560
I have been working hard for years and I am still not satisfied.

378
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,560
I am still not satisfied with the appearance of the king.

379
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:37,560
It's really embarrassing.

380
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,560
I don't know what the king will think.

381
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:44,560
I heard you said you missed your husband.

382
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:48,560
I also think your future husband is good.

383
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,560
Good in what?

384
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:54,560
I thought the king of Dingbei had a good condition.

385
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,560
He was compatible with you.

386
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,560
But you refused him because of your appearance.

387
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:01,560
But I saw the king of Dingbei was arrogant and arrogant.

388
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,560
He was very angry.

389
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,560
He was in line with your standards.

390
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:09,560
I think the king of Dingbei is not as unkind as the rumors say.

391
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,560
You pretended to be dizzy just now.

392
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,560
He didn't just expose you in person.

393
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,560
He also fulfilled your dignity.

394
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,560
You don't always say that.

395
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,560
I don't know what to do with my husband.

396
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:27,560
I think the king of Dingbei is not as unkind as you said.

397
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:34,560
Do you really think the king of Dingbei is arrogant?

398
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,560
It's embarrassing.

399
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,560
Where is the card?

400
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,560
Miss Bai.

401
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,560
Mr. Zhang.

402
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:05,560
When you were fighting, I accidentally dropped something.

403
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,560
Shut up.

404
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,560
Don't touch me.

405
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,560
I'll make you talk nonsense.

406
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:15,560
I asked for this peace charm for Mr. Zhang.

407
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:18,560
Mr. Zhang must be fated to have found it.

408
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:24,560
Miss Bai, you asked for this for me.

409
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,560
Yes, I did.

410
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,560
You did?

411
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:42,560
Miss Bai, I can feel your love.

412
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,560
I can feel it.

413
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:46,560
But I don't have anything to give back to you.

414
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:50,560
I'll choose a gift for you.

415
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:53,560
I'll give it back to you every night.

416
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,560
No need.

417
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,560
I'll keep it.

418
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:04,560
Master told me that you must wear this.

419
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:07,560
It's better to keep it under your pillow when you sleep.

420
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,560
It's more effective.

421
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,560
I'll remember it.

422
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,560
I'll wear it every day.

423
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,560
I'll leave now.

424
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:45,560
Are you still upset about what happened?

425
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:53,560
I don't know what you're thinking.

426
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:56,560
I think you're thinking too much.

427
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,560
You're the future husband.

428
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:01,560
You should be more concerned about your future husband.

429
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:06,560
Otherwise, you'll be too depressed to be a good husband.

430
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:11,560
If you pretend to be depressed, you won't be able to win her heart.

431
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:15,560
You're cold-faced and you're very thoughtful.

432
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:20,560
You'll be happy to have a husband like this.

433
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,560
What husband?

434
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:29,560
If others hear it, they'll think I'm a married woman.

435
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,560
So what if they hear it?

436
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,560
They'll think of it when they get married.

437
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,560
You'll be a husband sooner or later.

438
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,560
Don't make me angry.

439
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,560
What happened?

440
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:50,560
It seems to be a bandit.

441
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:52,560
Bandit?

442
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,560
How dare you!

443
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:55,560
Do you know whose car this is?

444
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,560
It's so illegal.

445
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:59,560
We only take money.

446
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:00,560
We don't want our lives.

447
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:03,560
Give me the money.

448
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,560
How could they take our money?

449
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,560
They're hiding here.

450
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:22,560
They're obviously prepared.

451
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,560
Don't move.

452
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,560
You should be more careful on the road.

453
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:32,560
No matter what happens, you should protect yourself.

454
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,560
What are you waiting for?

455
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,560
The car is in front of you.

456
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,560
Go!

457
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,560
The girl is good.

458
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:48,560
Don't move.

459
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,560
Go!

460
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,560
Let me go!

461
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,560
Let me go!

462
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,560
Help!

463
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,560
Let me go!

464
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,560
Let me go!

465
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,560
Let me go!

466
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:02,560
Help!

467
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:03,560
Help!

468
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,560
Help!

469
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,560
Let me go!

470
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,560
Let me go!

471
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,560
Let me go!

472
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,560
Let me go!

473
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:53,560
Let me go!

474
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,560
Dear husband!

475
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:09,560
I didn't mean that.

476
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:25,720
Faster!

477
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,080
Don't run!

478
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,360
Party leader!

479
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:39,400
What're you doing?

480
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:40,380
Who are you?

481
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:41,620
Look at her.

482
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:43,580
You stand between her and people.

483
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:47,200
Brother...

484
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,240
Brother...

485
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:49,180
Brother...

486
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:50,120
Brother!

487
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:51,420
No...

488
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:53,220
Thank you for saving me.

489
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:59,420
I knew that you and Miss Ming Si are fated to meet.

490
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:04,460
It's a fated fate that you can meet her twice in a row.

491
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:08,100
Take her away.

492
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:09,300
Leave her alive.

493
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:10,060
Yes.

494
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:11,940
Take her away.

495
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:13,380
Take her away.

496
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:26,300
She saved me in a few times.

497
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:28,900
Even if she is married now,

498
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:32,500
she has never done anything wrong.

499
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:35,340
It seems that Father is right.

500
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:37,820
She is indeed a good person.

501
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:39,940
Miss Ming.

502
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,940
Thank you for saving me.

503
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:54,340
You may leave now.

504
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:02,500
The matter of the bandits means the same to me.

505
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:05,700
Such a thing...

506
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:07,580
should be selected by Govt.

507
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:13,380
Dismiss now.

508
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:14,100
Yes.

509
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:24,480
works act

510
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,180
You may leave then!

511
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:38,180
But, we will live to see your result of our ship

512
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,480
Let's go.

513
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,480
Look at this.

514
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,480
Boss.

515
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,480
Look at this carefully.

516
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,480
Look, there's more here.

517
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,480
Boss, you're very hot.

518
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,480
Hot is not the point.

519
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,480
Let's go.

520
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,480
Boss, don't wait for me.

521
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:46,480
Didn't you notice that my fan is different today?

522
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,480
What's different?

523
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:50,480
You're so insincere.

524
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:55,480
Didn't you notice that there's a lucky card on the fan?

525
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,480
It's just a lucky card.

526
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,480
Who hasn't asked for it?

527
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:03,480
The lucky card itself is not the point.

528
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,480
Then what's the point?

529
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:09,480
The old man has a ring on his finger.

530
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,480
The ring of love is like a flower.

531
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,480
The red thread is like a red thread.

532
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,480
The love is like a red thread.

533
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,480
The red thread is like a red thread.

534
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,480
What does it mean?

535
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:23,480
Boss, this is a gift for your family.

536
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,480
This is a gift for your family.

537
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,480
You're so sweet.

538
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,480
You're so sweet.

539
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,480
It's not a gift for your family.

540
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:39,480
The important thing is that you have feelings for your family.

541
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,480
You're so low-key.

542
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:44,480
You should keep this in mind.

543
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,480
You can't show it.

544
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:54,480
The peach blossom dress of Hanyan temple is the most beautiful.

545
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:58,480
I think this family has been fond of you for a long time.

546
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,480
Peach blossom dress?

547
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,480
This is a peach blossom dress.

548
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,480
Peach blossom.

549
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,480
The lady in the house has been asking for this dress.

550
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,480
She wanted to give it to the one she loves.

551
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,480
But she told me that it's a peaceful dress.

552
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,480
How can I tell her directly?

553
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,480
The prince also said that it's impossible to show it.

554
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,480
Wait for a moment.

555
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:09,480
Tie the www site and the introduction platter of this oil plan.

556
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,480
OK.

557
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,480
Friend, what have you done?

558
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,480
Actually, I am in the toilet.

559
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:17,280
so that he can overcome the old age.

560
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,720
I will tell him to do it.

561
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:20,760
You do it yourself.

562
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:21,920
I will be worried if others do it.

563
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,920
Sir, I have two jobs.

564
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:27,040
I work day and night.

565
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,040
I am very busy.

566
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,560
I don't have time to do anything.

567
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,080
I am just a little lucky.

568
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,680
Little lucky?

569
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:36,480
Do you know how important this lucky card is?

570
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,320
You are just a little lucky.

571
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,520
Why are you so happy?

572
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:43,240
Sir, since you value it so much,

573
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,080
why don't you clean it yourself?

574
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:46,080
It will be more useful.

575
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,960
How can you do this to me?

576
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,040
You are right.

577
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,080
Then, tell him to do it.

578
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:56,400
No one is allowed to touch anything here.

579
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:57,880
Okay.

580
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,160
No.

581
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,280
Don't enter this house again.

582
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,600
Let's go.

583
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:16,240
Chuchu, you are not bad.

584
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,680
You are good at fighting against bandits.

585
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:20,240
You are so powerful today.

586
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,240
You can't protect your sister.

587
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,000
Why can't I protect her?

588
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,480
I am not a vegetarian.

589
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,840
I can't fight them.

590
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:29,840
Besides, you brought the guards with you.

591
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,840
I have no obligation to protect her.

592
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,840
I did it for her.

593
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,840
I am not a vegetarian.

594
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,840
I can't fight them.

595
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,840
I am not a vegetarian.

596
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,840
I am not a vegetarian.

597
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,840
I can't teach Chuchu well.

598
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,840
But, sir,

599
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,840
Chuchu is good at martial arts.

600
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:49,840
But she is a girl.

601
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,840
How can she fight against bandits?

602
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:54,840
Fortunately, she is not injured.

603
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:57,840
Otherwise, I can't save her.

604
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,840
Enough.

605
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,840
You are all fine.

606
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:05,840
It was a bad thing.

607
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,840
But Chuchu was not good at it.

608
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:08,840
She should be punished.

609
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,840
She should be punished to kneel in the hall.

610
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,840
She is a girl.

611
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,840
She should be punished to kneel in the hall.

612
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,840
That's all.

613
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,840
Sir, you are biased.

614
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,840
Why should I be punished to protect her?

615
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,840
She is the daughter of Ming family.

616
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,840
I am not the daughter of Ming family.

617
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:27,840
Am I just a guard in the eyes of my father and sister?

618
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:31,840
Chuchu, you can't be rude to your father.

619
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,840
I have something to tell you.

620
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,840
I have something to tell you.

621
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:44,840
I wanted to ask you in private.

622
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:47,840
But I can't do that now.

623
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:50,840
When the bandits took me away today,

624
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:54,840
why did you stop me in front of the guards?

625
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:59,840
You are against bandits.

626
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:05,840
You are against bandits.

627
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:09,840
What do you want to do?

628
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,840
What do you want to do?

629
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:18,840
Chuchu, is what Tan'er said true?

630
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:24,840
Yes, I was the one who was kidnapped by bandits.

631
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,840
You...

632
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:36,840
How can I have a daughter like you?

633
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,840
You are so stubborn.

634
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,840
I won't say anything.

635
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,840
But how can you be so cruel to your sister?

636
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:45,840
Sir, she was just saying that.

637
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,840
Shut up.

638
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,840
It's because of your stubbornness

639
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:53,840
that she is so arrogant.

640
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,840
Come on.

641
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,840
Take them to the ancestral hall.

642
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:00,840
Let go of me.

643
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:01,840
Father punished me.

644
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:03,840
I dare not to do that.

645
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,840
But Mingtan doesn't care about Ming Sheng.

646
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:08,840
How can I be punished for that?

647
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,840
What?

648
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,840
I went back to the capital with mother.

649
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:15,840
I met her in private.

650
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,840
She was so rude.

651
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:21,840
Sir, she was kidnapped by bandits.

652
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:24,840
If Tan'er can't save her,

653
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,840
how can you explain to him?

654
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:30,840
I heard about it from Chuchu.

655
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:34,840
That man has a wife and a child.

656
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:39,840
Is she really having an affair with that man?

657
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,840
Mother, you are so rude.

658
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:44,840
How can you do that to her?

659
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,840
A'Yan, I swear to God.

660
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:47,840
I swear.

661
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,840
The man who saved her from bandits

662
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,840
was the man who met her in the temple.

663
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:55,840
Actually, I met them in the temple.

664
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:59,840
That man even hit me to protect her.

665
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:03,840
Can you please let me go?

666
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:09,840
Father, Mingtan went back to the capital with her.

667
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,840
She is still in a relationship with someone after marriage.

668
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,840
She is still in a relationship with someone after marriage.

669
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:14,840
If we can find out the truth,

670
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,840
it will be a great sin to deceive the king.

671
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,840
If we can't save her,

672
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:21,840
even your master will be implicated.

673
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:27,840
Tan'er, is that true?

674
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:29,840
Yes.

675
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,840
Who is that man?

676
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:35,840
Tell me.

677
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:37,840
Father, I...

678
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:39,840
Tell me.

679
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,840
Who is that man?

680
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:46,840
Tell me.

681
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:48,840
The man who met Miss Ming in private

682
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:52,840
is me.

683
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:00,840
Your Highness.

684
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:04,840
You don't have to be polite.

685
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:06,840
If I don't come,

686
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:08,840
the future princess will be wronged.

687
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,840
I won't be able to teach her a lesson.

688
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:12,840
You... You are King Dingbei?

689
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:14,840
I have already interrogated the bandits.

690
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:16,840
This is not an accident.

691
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:19,840
Someone has bribed the bandits.

692
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:21,840
He did it on purpose.

693
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:27,840
What?

694
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:35,840
But why did you do that?

695
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:36,840
If Tan'er is a thief,

696
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:40,840
it will be of no use to Chu Chu and the duke.

697
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,840
Under the decree of His Majesty,

698
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:45,840
the marriage between the two dynasties is inevitable.

699
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:48,840
If Miss Ming is a thief,

700
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:54,840
will you have a better candidate than her?

701
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:59,840
He is really confused.

702
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:00,840
I came here last night

703
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:03,840
because I didn't want you to be deceived.

704
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:05,840
If you still have the sword,

705
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:09,840
I am afraid that you will be in trouble.

706
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:16,840
Ming Chu is not a good person.

707
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:18,840
He has been in trouble many times.

708
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:21,840
You need to think of a solution as soon as possible.

709
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:26,840
Please be quick, Your Highness.

710
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:30,840
I will not be able to help you.

711
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:35,840
Ming Chu has made a big mistake.

712
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:39,840
I cannot help the one I love.

713
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:45,840
We need to find her husband.

714
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:48,840
It is better that he is not in the capital.

715
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:51,840
Otherwise, he will cause trouble.

716
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:54,840
Do you have a candidate?

717
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:59,840
I have not found a suitable candidate.

718
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:06,840
How about the third general of Lingzhou,

719
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:09,840
General Xuan Wei?

720
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:12,840
General Xuan Wei?

721
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:14,840
I remember now.

722
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:17,840
General Xuan Wei is from Wu Pin and Wu San Guan.

723
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:18,840
He is not a good general.

724
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:20,840
Lingzhou is far from Shangjing.

725
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:22,840
That's great.

726
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:25,840
I have talked to General Feng before.

727
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:27,840
He has a good impression of me.

728
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:31,840
His third son is also a good man.

729
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:33,840
If you are satisfied,

730
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:35,840
then it is settled.

731
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:36,840
It is settled.

732
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:39,840
And, the Liu family...

733
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:23,840
Your Highness.

734
00:45:52,840 --> 00:46:22,840
The weight of the weight of the weight of the weight of the weight of the weight of the weight of the weight of the weight of the weight of the weight of the weight of the weight of the weight of the weight of the weight of the weight of the weight of the weight of the weight of the weight of the weight of the weight of the weight of the weight of the weight of the weight of the weight of the weight of the weight of the weight of the weight of the weight of the weight of the weight of the weight of the weight of the weight of the weight of the weight of the weight of the weight of the weight of the weight of the weight of the weight of the weight of the weight of the weight of the weight of the weight of the weight of the weight of the weight of the weight of the weight of the weight of the weight of the weight of the weight of the weight of the weight of the weight of the weight of the weight of the weight of the weight of the weight of the weight of the weight of the weight of the weight of the weight of the weight

735
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:25,660
You

736
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:33,680
Getting epid;;

737
