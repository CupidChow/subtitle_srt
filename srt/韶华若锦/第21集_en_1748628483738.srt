We will Grade 8

2
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:57,500
The High Flora

3
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,720
What are you waiting for, just ask Yuan He?

4
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,680
Yes?

5
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,680
The First Prince's floodans' tower in thems

6
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,960
only 180 times.

7
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,640
Shduzhu asked no people.

8
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,640
There are thousands of officials.

9
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,280
The 결 Mmmmmmmm

10
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,760
Maintenant nobody is here

11
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:26,760
at last.

12
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,720
No news.

13
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,140
He invented it?

14
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:32,800
What do you mean?

15
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,140
This ant is delighted enough to have you Envincer!

16
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,700
Hence, you are going to bet me theatiouad.

17
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:39,960
I will let you use it.

18
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,800
And I will show you.

19
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,000
Who in my mind is asking

20
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:51,360
where innocent 這個漁信盟的幸運命的信念都不保贊你?

21
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:52,680
Right?

22
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,800
What have I told him?

23
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,220
Tudo quelque东西都不知道,

24
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:56,080
I am just standing here,

25
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,280
troubled with all两个人 use看守吗?

26
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,280
How come the officials from the capital are all in the 180th house?

27
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,280
Xu, we have to be careful.

28
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,280
I want to see who should be careful.

29
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,280
It's a jewelry box from the capital.

30
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,280
It's called the Fulu Golden Tower.

31
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,280
It's the star of the town.

32
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,280
It's the goods that he gave me.

33
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,280
It's almost the same as today.

34
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,280
Let's not continue.

35
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,280
It's a rare opportunity to marry a master.

36
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,320
The guest was so thoughtful last night.

37
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:49,940
Li

38
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:52,520
What'd you do

39
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,880
when the job patterns were suddenly blurred?

40
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,220
I am so bored that

41
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:57,540
and only good goods.

42
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:00,220
The masters want to take more money,

43
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:02,340
but they are afraid that if they take the good goods,

44
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:03,740
they will be forced to look for you.

45
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:05,100
They will be in trouble.

46
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,260
We can do as you say.

47
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:08,380
There will be no trouble.

48
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,500
Send someone to look for him.

49
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:16,940
Dingbei is watching the Su family.

50
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,900
We can't let anything go wrong.

51
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,300
Yes.

52
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,300
Lord Zhang.

53
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,380
In the letter,

54
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:28,700
Lord Zhang gave Lingzhou

55
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,740
the permission to remove the water.

56
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,100
I don't want to be a spy.

57
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,900
I want the Su family to be peaceful.

58
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,500
First,

59
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:40,020
to restore Lingzhou's water for the last five years.

60
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:41,420
Second,

61
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,100
to give Lord Zhang and Zhou Baoping

62
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:46,140
a peaceful life.

63
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,580
Lord, this restoration...

64
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:49,580
Lord.

65
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:50,980
Madam.

66
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,660
Lord, it's late.

67
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:58,460
Today, I will make a wedding for you

68
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:00,260
and Shuhan Lin.

69
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,860
Why don't you

70
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,700
stay for tomorrow?

71
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,700
Thank you for your kindness.

72
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,300
I want to ask you something.

73
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,580
Do you have any rules in the house?

74
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,180
We live in a secluded place.

75
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,580
We can't be too strict

76
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,780
and disturb the house.

77
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:15,700
Su family is in a state of shock.

78
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:17,300
There are not many rules.

79
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:19,620
Lord and Shuhan Lin can live here.

80
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:21,900
They are the best friends in the family.

81
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:23,580
By the way,

82
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:24,860
I heard that

83
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,140
Princess Dingbei

84
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:28,140
came to Lingzhou with you.

85
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:29,940
Princess is not here.

86
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,340
She came here in advance.

87
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:34,180
I see.

88
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,540
Princess has been to the mansion for a long time.

89
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:37,620
I want to stay here

90
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:38,900
and live with her.

91
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:40,780
But

92
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:42,860
it's been a long time.

93
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:44,660
I'm afraid I can't recognize her

94
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:46,300
even if I see her.

95
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:49,100
Please, Lord and Shuhan Lin,

96
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:50,660
take a step forward.

97
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:54,180
Please.

98
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:01,740
The guests of the demon pearl

99
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:02,900
will have a meal.

100
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,420
I hope Lord and Shuhan Lin

101
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:06,860
can have a good meal

102
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:07,980

00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:11,340
Please.

00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:14,300
I'm very happy today.

105
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,580
I'm very happy today.

106
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:18,300
I hope Lord and Shuhan Lin

107
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,620

They all will not come and go.

00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,220
He will come and go.

115
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:03,620
All right.

116
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:05,860

We didn't accept it.

124
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:27,700

but it's too early.

130
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:40,300
I want to get rid of the emperor,

131
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:42,300
but I don't want to say anything wrong.

132
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:45,060
Why don't you go and get the wine for the prince?

133
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:59,180
I'll have three cups of wine.

134

qualitatively

152
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:45,420
I heard from director Zhang

153
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:46,060
of Yanxi

154
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,260
exsuant of meaningful character

155
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,260
director Zhang

156
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:49,340
appointed but

157
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:51,540

00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:52,780

is

168
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:10,100
Don't worry, my lord. I will find out the truth.

169
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:13,500
If you are here, I will find out the truth.

170
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:26,020
I will write the memorial to the emperor tonight.

171
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:30,900
And you will be able to rest assured.

172
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:57,380
So could you find

173
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:03,500
Lord Zhang's life here?

174
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,860
Is he here for me?

175
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:07,260
Oh,ana...

176
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:09,640
I haven't done anything for half a day.

177
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:12,680
And never have you like it.

178
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:16,380
It's never been better than one million.

179
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:18,580
It's not convenient to kill someone after all.

180
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,940
Where did you get it from?

181
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,060
To the event entertaining shows.

182
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:25,000
OK.

183
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,740
Stop joking.

184
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:28,120
What is it?

185
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,260
What?

186
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,340
This is my mobile six pound car.

187
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,760
It's worth up to three hundred per 960 contracts.

188
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:37,080
The price of the costs is too high.

189
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,440
If it's not, I'll kill myself.

190
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:42,120
If you even umpire this couplet,

191
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,540
all the numbers in the market

192
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,040
will die by you.

193
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:47,860
That's still fine.

194
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:51,520
So many orders.

195
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,140
We sod and you seek more presents.

196
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:55,160
My gosh, we should get your friends which are more important.

197
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:57,220
Okay, let's pack the gifts.

198
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,100
The food is ready to be sold during a vaccine delivery session.

199
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:03,420
Who knew that you were with Evening Sect?

200
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,460
And I know you're different to the sect leader.

201
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:10,300
Every foreign market ceases to be cherished

202
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:12,460
You must be very worried

203
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:15,460
所以 reinforcements must be in control

204
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:17,880
种类大名次

205
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,700
你是这么米的

206
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,420
Solcer, you raise me

207
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:33,580
When I will come here, you will save me

208
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:35,380
Which place may we bring

209
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,820
Thank you!

210
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:40,300
Many the public service is looking at biz parlamentarians.

211
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,540
If you want to confuse them,

212
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,580
then there's no need to rush this slow.

213
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:48,940
Mr. Wen,

214
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:50,100
I dare not,

215
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:53,540
this agent is an easy- allocatedvable work.

216
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:57,540
But it's not just a dead young man's money.

217
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:59,660
After he regains one,

218
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,220
he'll mature as an adult for sure.

219
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:04,220
You are a gold medal in Linzhou City.

220
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:06,220
Anything that passes your hand

221
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:08,220
is a real miracle.

222
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:11,220
I came here because of your name.

223
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:14,220
Although it's a common shoe,

224
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:16,220
it's not a big deal.

225
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:18,220
I'm a good person,

226
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:21,220
so I won't be so heavy.

227
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:23,220
As long as you can relax,

228
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:26,220
these little things are nothing.

229
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:27,220
Actually,

230
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:29,220
Li Rui, you are so generous

231
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:32,220
and you are happy now.

232
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:35,220
This fabric is not made of water,

233
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:37,220
it's not made of rainwater.

234
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:39,220
It's because it's not good enough

235
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:41,220
to make silk thread.

236
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,220
It causes the color of silk to be dirty.

237
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:54,220
Miss, what else do you have?

238
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:57,220
I've been to Linzhou City for a long time.

239
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:59,220
But this version of Mr. Wu

240
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:01,220
is not a good one.

241
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:03,220
If the businessmen

242
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:05,220
are like you,

243
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,220
they are so good at cheating people.

244
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:09,220
The beauty of the city of trade

245
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:11,220
is ruined.

246
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:13,220
Miss, you are right.

247
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,220
You are so good at writing.

248
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:19,220
Mr. Wu,

249
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,220
why don't you

250
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:22,220
keep this wine yourself?

251
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:26,220
Mr. Wu.

252
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:29,220
Who is the bad guy?

253
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:31,220
You are the one who ruined my business.

254
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:33,220
Are you crazy?

255
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:35,220
Wait, let go.

256
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:41,220
Fine, you two are capable.

257
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:43,220
Wait for me.

258
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:53,220
Miss, are you hurt?

259
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:55,220
I'm fine.

260
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:57,220
Miss, you are so good at reading.

261
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:59,220
You are a businesswoman.

262
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:01,220
I'm a scholar.

263
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:03,220
I wonder if you are lucky

264
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:05,220
to have a chance to ask for a meal.

265
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:07,220
I just reminded you.

266
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:09,220
You are so good at writing.

267
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:11,220
You are so good at writing.

268
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:13,220
I believe that

269
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:15,220
you will be like me

270
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:17,220
when you come to Linzhou City.

271
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:25,220
The city of trade

272
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:27,220
is a city of trade.

273
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:29,220
The city of trade is a city of trade.

274
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,220
The city of trade is a city of trade.

275
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:33,220
The city of trade is a city of trade.

276
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:35,220
The city of trade is a city of trade.

277
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:37,220
The city of trade is a city of trade.

278
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:39,220
The city of trade is a city of trade.

279
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:41,220
The city of trade is a city of trade.

280
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:43,220
The city of trade is a city of trade.

281
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:45,220
The city of trade is a city of trade.

282
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:47,220
The city of trade is a city of trade.

283
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:49,220
The city of trade is a city of trade.

284
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:51,220
The city of trade is a city of trade.

285
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:53,220
The city of trade is a city of trade.

286
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:23,220
Lady.

287
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:25,220
Water.

288
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:36,580
Singapore.

289
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,800
Qingyu.

290
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,800
Come with me.

291
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,800
Sure.

292
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:52,720
uitar sampler

293
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,640
You know before you pull

294
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,800
only one

295
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,200
Xia Lin

296
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,720
I justジ're wrong

297
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:09,560
I know

298
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:11,760
on the court

299
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,600
you will see

300
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:18,120
I can't solve your problem

301
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,960
first

302
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,960
Ok, so click it as possible.

303
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,700
Ok ok, ok.

304
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,800
Right there.

305
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:44,300
So...

306
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,540
Lang Debbie.

307
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:49,860
Go out and take a walk.

308
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:51,580
Mr. Shu, you're drunk.

309
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,900
Do you need someone to accompany you?

310
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:55,540
Don't disturb the morning dance.

311
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:56,900
I'll be back soon.

312
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:58,940
Miss Su, don't worry.

313
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,540
This person is very stable.

314
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:12,540
He's not as weak as before.

315
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:14,860
His body is very strong.

316
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:17,420
He's already dead.

317
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:20,060
Ruh-er!

318
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:22,820
What shall we do now?

319
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:25,100
What happened?

320
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,260
Are you都瀀 response?

321
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:39,740
Excuse me.

322
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:40,740
Do you eat Stressattered Skirt?

323
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,380
But there's something else I want to know.

324
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:47,120
You...

325
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,160
The restaurant is airtight.

326
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,400
There's a whole lot of customers on display.

327
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,480
Thought the wine was high in colour,

328
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,040
got into my mouth.

329
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,680
TheBA came back to me quickly.

330
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,000
-"Miss, hold on."

331
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,480
I'll get a sound toast for you.

332
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,160
andıran?

333
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:10,600
Your knight,

00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,480
go and come with us.

335
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,320
ะi.

336
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,160
It's good.

337
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,120
Kh ketchup

338
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:24,980
what are we doing?

339
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,660
are you OK?

340
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,820
I'm fine

341
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,800
Thanks for auction

342
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,880
Kh ketchup

343
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,560
Well, nothing else.

344
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,280
Well, future Glen wood?

345
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:52,720
Do I need to use material shards?

346
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,560
That's handy.

347
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,960
I'm not that crazy.

348
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,560
Of course you are.

349
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,080
I'll not let that mess.

350
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,400
Go away.

351
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,000
Because I knew about Master Wu,

352
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,440
why didn't you pass me in?

353
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,440
As long as you give me a head start,

354
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:20,440
I will make sure that Mr. Wu doesn't appear in Lingzhou City again.

355
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,440
I'm sorry for disturbing you.

356
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,440
I understand your kindness.

357
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,440
Goodbye.

358
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:31,100
Midnight.

359
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,940
WhatARK fangirl.

360
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,840
My wife.

361
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,900
Prince.

362
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,000
Why do you wait for a call?

363
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,560
My Lord.

364
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:13,200
How much did it cost for me to serveсеu?

365
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,560
You need company to do business.

366
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,440
For all these children,

367
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,240
it's a gentler stuff.

368
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,760
It's good.

369
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,320
fortune earned for a good father.

370
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:30,020
Eternity will evolve

371
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,120
or contrary to the tenlaughter,

372
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:45,940

00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,420
lifeless

374
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,060
you will fall about

375
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:53,540
and forget your father

376
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:57,140
and mother

377
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,560
Did Miss Su tell anyone

378
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,280
if you would understand me?

379
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,520
Go!

380
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:14,640
Yes.

381
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,440
Waaaaaaaaaa!

382
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,800
Waaaaaaaa!

383
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:35,320
Wah!

384
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,000
W-wife stocks can't be used.

385
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:47,040
The wine is not good enough to serve me!

386
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,760
Mr. Yu can still glutinous rice enough to find many beauties.

387
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:59,040
People rare military groceries,

388
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,000
but also Goddess' money.

389
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:02,420
In this case,

390
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:03,820
I've asked Lord Examigawa

391
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,680
to take chim faux kurz-hand food

392
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,840
and chant your име-ぶ-бו Colin.

393
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,260
There's no existence of the C slides.

394
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:21,600
If Fujia has to seclude himself from this,

395
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,160
we put him in the Harbour.

396
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:29,760
But the pirates are not sure where they will hide the Clouds.

397
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:31,760
You can be at ease.

398
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:32,760
The killer is on the way.

399
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,760
The Clouds will find out.

400
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,760
What's the point?

401
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:37,760
Did you find anything?

402
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,760
Take Jin Yunwei back to the news.

403
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:41,760
I'll be right back.

404
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,760
What's the meaning of the night?

405
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:57,760
The fairy is fine.

406
00:23:58,760 --> 00:23:59,760
How can you say that?

407
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,760
Are you dissatisfied with Qing Yu?

408
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:07,760
Madam,

409
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:09,760
it's not Qing Yu's fault.

410
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:11,760
Then why?

411
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,760
If the future sister doesn't let the pirates

412
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,760
have the possibility,

413
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,760
but the sister in the past five years

414
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,760
may not be the emperor's.

415
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:27,760
Do you think this is what the king of Dingbei meant?

416
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:29,760
Madam,

417
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,760
when Zhang Huanyu came to investigate the sister,

418
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,760
she didn't know what to do.

419
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:41,760
The future of the king of Dingbei is too big.

420
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:44,760
Madam,

421
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:49,760
did you mention the plan of the execution of the moon?

422
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:51,760
It's good that she's making a deal.

423
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,760
It's better than the questions about the death.

424
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:57,760
It's just a loss of money.

425
00:24:58,760 --> 00:24:59,760
Just make another move.

426
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,760
I'll make people pay for the money.

427
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,760
My father said

428
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:06,760
he can't let her stay in Lingzhou.

429
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,760
As for what he met in the capital,

430
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,760
it's not related to the Su family.

431
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,760
Fortunately, you took my word.

432
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,760
That's what I got from the flower.

433
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:30,760
Lingzhou is the only way.

434
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,760
If I'm broken,

435
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:34,760
I'll have to die.

436
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:39,760
You...

437
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:41,760
You've been serving me for so long.

438
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,760
You still don't know how to do it?

439
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,760
I'm just trying to be nice.

440
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:45,760
Don't touch me.

441
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,760
Don't touch me.

442
00:25:58,760 --> 00:25:59,760
By the way,

443
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,760
what's going on with Ayi?

444
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,760
He's been in a safe place.

445
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:04,760
He's injured.

446
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:05,760
He's still staying in Lingzhou.

447
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:06,760
He's been sent to the capital.

448
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:07,760
He was sent to the capital.

449
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,760
He was sent to the capital because of the Su family.

450
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:11,760
If he didn't force the Su family,

451
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:13,760
he wouldn't be able to hide it.

452
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,760
So you said Ayi was safe and sound.

453
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:17,760
You want to make things worse?

454
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:21,760
Su Errong is not a fool.

455
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,760
Besides, there's also the main thing about Su family.

456
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,760
They've been looking for Ayi for so many years.

457
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:28,760
We haven't arrived yet.

458
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:29,760
How could we know his death?

459
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:31,760
If they keep on reading,

460
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,760
Ayi will be in danger.

461
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,760
It's better to take the risk.

462
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,760
It's better to keep their eyes off them.

463
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:40,760
You're right.

464
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:43,760
Where is Ayi now?

465
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:44,760
I don't know.

466
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,760
The Su family is still in contact.

467
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:50,760
But maybe

468
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,760
it's the safest for Ayi.

469
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:00,760
In the south, a wild place

470
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,760
found the traces of the Sea Gate.

471
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,760
But we can't make sure

472
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:05,760
if the Clouds are still there.

473
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,760
A'Xu.

474
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,760
I'm going too.

475
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,760
My lord,

476
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:31,760
if this is the Great Fire Tribe,

477
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,760
we'll be dead.

478
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:36,760
There's not much time left.

479
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:37,760
The Clouds might be inside.

480
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,760
Su Errong.

481
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:45,760
Stay there. Don't get hurt.

482
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,760
Shuiying.

483
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,760
Yes.

484
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,760
Shuiying.

485
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:15,760
Shuiying.

486
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:19,760
Shuiying.

487
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,760
Watch out.

488
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:03,760
Shuiying.

489
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:12,760
Hurry up.

490
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:34,760
Zhiyin.

491
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,760
Take them away.

492
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:38,760
Yes.

493
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:43,760
When we were in the capital,

494
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,760
the Lücic Temple was destroyed by the prince.

495
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:48,760
But it was a forest.

496
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,760
The prince was alone.

497
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,760
I was so worried about him.

498
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,760
The master caught me and kept me alive

499
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,760
for the safety of the imperial guards.

500
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,760
It was a plan.

501
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:01,760
I was sure

502
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,760
that I could come here by myself.

503
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,760
I was sure that I had the strength to do it.

504
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,760
I know why you came to Lingzhou.

505
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,760
I have a lot of money to do.

506
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:13,760
I can help the Su family.

507
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:15,760
You can help the prince.

508
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:17,760
If you don't mind,

509
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,760
I'm willing to cooperate with you.

510
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:23,760
No matter what I ask,

511
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:25,760
or what you do,

512
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,760
I'll do it.

513
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,760
I'll do it.

514
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,760
The Imperial Court is in trouble.

515
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,760
I don't want to talk about it.

516
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:37,760
Unless

517
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,760
you have another identity.

518
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:01,760
When did you come to my house?

519
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:03,760
I've been a teacher for many years.

520
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,760
If I can't make it,

521
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,760
how can I help the army?

522
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:09,760
Prince Ding.

523
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,760
You're really a good man.

524
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:27,760
Prince Ding,

525
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,760
you're really a good man.

526
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:40,760
Hurry up.

527
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:49,760
I'm sorry.

528
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,760
I'm willing to take care of Princess Lofan.

529
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,760
Don't worry.

530
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:53,760
Leave it to me.

531
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:56,760
I can't bear to hurt you.

532
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,760
I'm a girl.

533
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,760
They're too heavy.

534
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:15,760
Prince, don't worry.

535
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:17,760
I'm fine.

536
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:19,760
I'll do it myself.

537
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:20,760
Don't move.

538
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,760
It's not good to get hurt by holding a wound.

539
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:24,760
You can bear it.

540
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:26,760
I'll help you clean up the wound.

541
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:28,760
Thank you, princess.

542
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,760
You're a fool.

543
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:33,760
I'm sorry.

544
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:35,760
I'm sorry.

545
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:37,760
I'm sorry.

546
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:39,760
I'm sorry.

547
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:11,760
It's still you.

548
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:14,760
Don't be afraid of me.

549
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:16,760
Lady Ying.

550
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:29,760
How is she?

551
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:30,760
Is there a problem?

552
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,760
She's just a little bit damaged.

553
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,760
She still needs some rest.

554
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:37,760
Thank you, princess.

555
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:42,420
I've never seen you this cold.

556
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,560
What's the matter with me?

557
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,260
Father.

558
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,500
What's the matter here today?

559
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:57,040
you've been

560
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,700
just one session for a whole day

561
00:33:58,700 --> 00:33:59,680
and you just bought it again.

562
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:01,620
After that, you went to theancy course for crispy soup.

563
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:04,100
It's a customs house for women.

564
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:07,220
It's not into any special delivery.

565
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:09,220
and ordered the chief to do the job.

566
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:13,020
Then he went to the department store

567
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:13,900
and bought sugar beans,

568
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:15,020
necklace and ring.

569
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:23,660
So, Wen Zong asked the princess to eat.

570
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:24,940
But the princess was so angry.

571
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:26,940
Who is Wen Zong?

572
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:29,060
I'm not sure.

573
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:30,340
But according to his words,

574
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:31,860
he is a businessman from the Linzhu.

575
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:35,100
He is young and gentle.

576
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:37,700
He is quite good-looking.

577
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:43,220
He is...

578
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:44,980
ordinary.

579
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:49,220
After the chief,

580
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:50,420
he went to find the princess.

581
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:51,700
Wen Zong was saved.

582
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:53,020
Fortunately, he hugged the princess.

583
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:54,340
The princess had no problem.

584
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:55,180
What did you say?

585
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:57,340
The chief sent...

586
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:58,060
The next sentence.

587
00:34:58,060 --> 00:34:59,180
Wen Zong was saved.

588
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,060
He hugged the princess.

589
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:04,100
It's all my fault.

590
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:07,500
please punish me.

591
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:17,660
Tomorrow morning,

592
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:20,380
this person分手 all hisős all.

593
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:21,980
Yes.

594
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:34,820
Xu.

595
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:39,660
I have a request.

596
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:41,580
I want to let Yun Yi

597
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:43,260
leave Jin Yun Wei.

598
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:46,340
No price.

599
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:47,940
Don't take it too seriously.

600
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:52,260
What do you think of Jin Yun Wei?

601
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:54,660
They are free.

602
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:57,020
Jin Yun Wei didn't sell his body.

603
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:58,660
He has no life or death.

604
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:01,380
I'm afraid.

605
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:03,140
I want to ask Prince to take Yun Yi.

606
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:04,580
Prince, please allow me.

607
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,700
I said no.

608
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:14,740
Now Yun Yi is Princess's man.

609
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:18,060
Please allow me.

610
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:25,500
Prince Shu'er.

611
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:28,700
Do you really like Yun Yi?

612
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:32,540
I really do.

613
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:34,380
I'm so happy to see you.

614
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:36,820
What about your parents?

615
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:41,860
Can they treat Yun Yi like you?

616
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:47,260
I don't mind.

617
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:49,300
I have to take care of myself.

618
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:51,580
Prince Shu'er,

619
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:54,140
think about the future.

620
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:01,940
You're right.

621
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:05,500
Love is not just a promise.

622
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:08,660
It's also a burden for a lifetime.

623
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:34,140
What's wrong, husband?

624
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:44,540
I'm so sorry.

625
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:47,500
I can't express my feelings.

626
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:50,900
I want to give them some space.

627
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:55,260
They have to decide what to do with love.

628
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,920
Are you tired?

629
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:58,500
Yes, sir.

630
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:02,980
You are so noob,

631
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:06,540
I don't know what to do with you.

632
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:09,940
But I didn't mean...

633
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:12,620
a favour.

634
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:18,540
You know what?

635
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:21,080
Prince Wireless won't allow you to travel with me.

636
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,060
But it's alright.

637
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:26,100
I just went shopping in the city

638
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:27,460
and bought some hand-pick.

639
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:29,220
By the way,

640
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:31,300
I went to the top of the tea shop

641
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:34,180
and found that if you order tea in the shop,

642
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:35,980
all the tea is not good.

643
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:37,580
But when I bought it,

644
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:40,220
the tea was full of orange tea and purple tea.

645
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:43,220
The top of the tea shop is obviously a plastic tea.

646
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:45,900
I will definitely clear the evidence.

647
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:50,660
Madam, today

648
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:52,940
I met a special person.

649
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:54,380
Special person?

650
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:58,060
Yes.

651
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:02,060
I met a shopkeeper today.

652
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:05,020
His name is Xie Chou.

653
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:06,660
He is not a big Xie.

654
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:10,420
The color of the material is orange.

655
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:14,460
It can only be due to the difficulty of the high-end shop.

656
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:16,820
I think I was wrong.

657
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:21,180
And the boss of the shop is not good at business.

658
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:25,380
What do you plan to do?

659
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:27,540
It's a smooth touch.

660
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:30,700
Maybe the pair of feet are related to the walk.

661
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:34,500
It's a clue.

662
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:39,420
But you have to be careful.

663
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:41,100
If you meet a man in the south,

664
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:42,540
you have to follow him.

665
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:44,780
If he doesn't use it, he will come to look for me.

666
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:54,260
I will go to the shop.

667
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:55,660
I will go to the shop.

668
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:57,140
I will go to the shop.

669
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:58,620
I will go to the shop.

670
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:00,300
I will go to the shop.

671
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:01,900
I will go to the shop.

672
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:03,300
I will go to the shop.

673
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:04,700
I will go to the shop.

674
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:06,100
I will go to the shop.

675
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:07,420
I will go to the shop.

676
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:08,860
I will go to the shop.

677
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:10,340
I will go to the shop.

678
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:11,900
I will go to the shop.

679
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:13,340
I will go to the shop.

680
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:14,700
I will go to the shop.

681
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:16,300
I will go to the shop.

682
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:18,100
I will go to the shop.

683
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:19,900
I will go to the shop.

684
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:21,700
I will go to the shop.

685
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:23,060
I will go to the shop.

686
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:53,500
To the wall

687
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:55,300
to the wall

688
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:59,700
please

689
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:02,180
don't put too much pressure on her.

690
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:03,780
I told her to stay back,

691
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:05,980
he was in a hurry to the gravity.

692
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:07,860
She came back

693
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:09,540
and saw Sky.

694
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:12,260
Baby,

695
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:16,820
have you changed spam to sing songs for me?

696
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:18,700
Doesn't know yet.

697
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:20,860
Take off my key.

698
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:25,860
I'm out of here. Who will take my place?

699
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:29,860
What's wrong, husband?

700
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:32,860
Nothing.

701
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:42,860
By the way, did you get a new one that day in Sha Xi?

702
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:44,860
Is it my Wu Heng Yue?

703
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:47,860
Father, are you hurt?

704
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:50,860
I'm fine.

705
00:42:57,860 --> 00:43:00,860
I thought you lost it. Where did you find it?

706
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:05,860
At the Hall of the Red.

707
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:07,860
I was the one who was out of the prison.

708
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:18,860
Your wife's jade was saved by me.

709
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:22,860
We were born together.

710
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:25,860
Why did you keep it?

711
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:28,860
I don't know why.

712
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:33,860
Maybe you were moved by the blood of the Han Yan Temple.

713
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:35,860
What are you doing?

714
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:39,860
I'm a person of fate.

715
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:44,860
This is my Wu Heng Yue. You must be the owner of the house.

716
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:46,860
Who will take my place?

717
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:53,860
You don't want to say sorry?

718
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:41,860
The Hall of the Red.

719
00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:11,860
The Hall of the Red.

720
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:41,860
The Hall of the Red.

721
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:11,860
The Hall of the Red.

722
00:46:39,860 --> 00:46:41,860
The Hall of the Red.
