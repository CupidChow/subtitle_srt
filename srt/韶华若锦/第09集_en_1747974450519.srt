an emerald

39
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
There you go.

40
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
You take it out.

41
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
That's a餚.

42
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000

In the night

45
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:09,160
knew how to get revealed

46
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:10,940
by someone from Haiyoumen

47
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,000
huh?

48
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:21,580
It wasn't me

49
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:23,580
I only got some gold for the wedding.

50
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:28,580
Today's wedding is really a great day.

51
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:37,580
Song family, why do you have to be my wife?

52
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:44,580
You? What do you think?

53
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:50,580
I don't know how my father and father treat me.

54
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:56,580
We don't want to marry Ding Bei.

55
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:00,580
I am also the leader of the family.

56
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:03,580
I have never thought that he would be so wrong.

57
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:06,580
Ding Bei is a good man.

58
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:09,580
He knows how many grudges he has.

59
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:12,580
I will kill him this time.

60
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:19,580
If you can be like me when you were in the Zexu family,

61
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:23,580
you will not have any gold today.

62
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:34,580
This is because we have a lot of people involved in the wedding.

63
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:39,580
But if they want to kill me, they can kill me.

64
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:42,580
Tang'er is a girl.

65
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:45,580
She can do anything.

66
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:48,580
Everything is not related to her.

67
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:55,580
No, no.

68
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:57,580
No.

69
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:30,580
Master, I have to go now.

70
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:32,580
I have to go now.

71
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:58,580
Su Xing, Lv Le.

72
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:03,580
Your Highness.

73
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:27,580
Your Highness.

74
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:30,580
The rules are to be followed today.

75
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:33,580
Your Highness, you are leaving now?

76
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:35,580
So early?

77
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:37,580
No.

78
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:39,580
No matter how important the military affairs are,

79
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:41,580
no one can do anything.

80
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:44,580
I will leave you alone.

81
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:45,580
As long as I can tell you,

82
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:48,580
I will not be afraid of your death.

83
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,580
I will not be afraid of your death.

84
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,580
I will not be afraid of your death.

85
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:54,580
As long as I can tell you,

86
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:56,580
I will not be afraid of your death.

87
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:00,580
From now on, we have to change the Princess Consort.

88
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:08,580
I know you are doing something wrong.

89
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:11,580
But you are a soldier.

90
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,580
You have no other choice.

91
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,580
I will marry her.

92
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:19,580
I will understand her.

93
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:23,580
Yes.

94
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:49,580
This is...

95
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:52,580
what you have done.

96
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:53,580
Ye'er.

97
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:57,580
What did you do to her?

98
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:00,580
Now,

99
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:03,580
you still don't know the truth.

100
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,580
Who is against you?

101
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:10,580
You don't know it?

102
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:14,580
You have been a dirty man

103
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:15,580
for years.

104
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:17,580
You have been a dirty man for years.

105
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:20,580
Why did these dirty men

106
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,580
appear in our house?

107
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:26,580
Why did the other men get married?

108
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:30,580
What is the use of the two brothers behind them?

109
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:32,580
I don't think

110
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,580
we need to talk about it.

111
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:40,580
I, the King of the House of Xie,

112
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:42,580
greet you, Princess Consort.

113
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:45,580
I, greet you, Princess Consort.

114
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:50,580
You are a good woman.

115
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:53,580
But you are a man.

116
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:57,580
You don't need to thank me.

117
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:00,580
I have been a good woman for a long time.

118
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,580
I finally got you here.

119
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:04,580
You are an old man.

120
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:07,580
I know you are not familiar with the King's Mansion.

121
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:09,580
I will treat you well.

122
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:11,580
Princess Consort, don't say that.

123
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:13,580
You can find me in the future.

124
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:16,580
I just don't know

125
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:19,580
why there are only men in the King's Mansion.

126
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:21,580
Is this what you want?

127
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:22,580
Your Highness,

128
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:25,580
there are only men in the mansion.

129
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:26,580
But after that,

130
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:29,580
you can go inside and ask for permission.

131
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:32,580
It is still convenient to have some maid and servant.

132
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,580
I picked some.

133
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:35,580
I will let them come up later

134
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:37,580
and let you have a look.

135
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:41,580
Come up and greet Your Highness.

136
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:44,580
Go on.

137
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:57,580
Your Highness,

138
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,840
I was greatly influenced by

139
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:03,580
yourке's ways of picking.

140
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:06,580
I have been ovalizing.

141
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:10,580
You must wait for services.

142
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:12,860
She didn't come home.

143
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,760
This is my order, Your Highness.

144
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,000
My only killings

145
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,840
are for talking aboutrate Consort.

146
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:27,020
If the Coconut 글 sauce plant was not filling you with repair逊

147
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,320
Your Highness dosetiously intermination.

148
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,720
Your Highness, you are�땨

149
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,460
int니까 offered you to marry me

150
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:35,020
hence you chose to own them.

151
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,080
I didn't want Your Highness's report to be of good fortune.

152
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:39,800
I'm sorry.

153
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,800
You're too kind.

154
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,040
But

155
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,040
you're back home soon.

156
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,240
You're going to the palace today.

157
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,000
I can't go alone.

158
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,800
Don't worry, Your Highness.

159
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,920
I've already sent someone to the palace.

160
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,360
I said I have something important to do.

161
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,880
I'll be there tomorrow.

162
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,120
Your Highness,

163
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,440
let me do whatever you want.

164
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,440
No need to say.

165
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,560
If you want to go out,

166
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,720
you can take care of the guards.

167
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:06,560
Yes.

168
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,840
You're back home soon.

169
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,200
I can't say that.

170
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,800
When His Highness is busy,

171
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,920
he won't be able to book.

172
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,760
His Highness has been a good doctor.

173
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,240
He won't look after himself.

174
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,640
Don't worry, Uncle Fu.

175
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,480
It's different from the past.

176
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,160
I'll take good care of you.

177
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,880
You're so lucky to be able to go to the palace.

178
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,840
You're the best.

179
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:39,080
Okay.

180
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,400
Uncle Fu said

181
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,320
that the previous powerлет haven't been fixed.

182
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,880
How come there's a reversible wear on this?

183
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,340
Being in theなら is His Highness'sphant start oğlum

184
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,240
his son to Services.

185
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,960
His Highness has ill Metroidism.

186
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,040
But why would he be wearable?

187
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:02,200
It's fitting to look like You are an emperor.

188
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,000

perspective on Peking is very good.

191
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,720
I'm wondering

192
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:09,080
if she could

193
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,220

If you need any help or help, please ask over me

205
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,180
I'm ashamed

206
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:22,320
This bateillo's and Jingxiu's houses

207
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:29,360

208
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,660
Out of shock and

Marquis

210
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:38,960
What can you do?

211
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:42,040
My

212
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,360
November

00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:49,720

the

218
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,660
would never figure her out.

219
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,760
When I was blood worthy of a letter,

220
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:13,280
she survived against her father's

221
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,560
and refused to marry her.

222
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,080
From now on,

223
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:17,980
I' ll rate him council.

224
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:19,700
He'll surely make business.

225
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,540
By the way, Uncle Fu.

226
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:28,200
There's tonight

227
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,400
a wedding house

228
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:31,300
or an Honors Office.

229
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,180
Tell him to shout down my name.

230
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:34,800
Your Highness.

231
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,680
This person is the one who is the most important person in the world.

232
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,880
Greetings, Your Highness.

233
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:43,680
Before His Highness went to the North, he was the one who took care of the body.

234
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,840
His Highness has many habits. He is even more familiar with the old servant.

235
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:50,000
Your Highness, His Highness doesn't like to be dirty.

236
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,800
So there aren't many servants in the house.

237
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,880
But he is very strict and doesn't have to be a very strict person.

238
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,080
His Highness used to live in the North.

239
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,560
He loved eating the lamb and the rose.

240
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,640
He also thought about it a lot after he came back.

241
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,280
It's just that the rose and the rose are unique in the North.

242
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,920
He bought several dishes in the kitchen.

243
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,480
They are all unique.

244
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,040
Only Changpingfang and his family are the same.

245
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,120
He is still able to have a wife and children.

246
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,840
Now that the death of the other wolf is here,

247
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,840
what are you talking about?

248
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,520
What are you talking about?

249
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,520
Tell me the truth.

250
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,920
If you are late,

251
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:33,520
I can't guarantee what he will do.

252
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,440
schneller

253
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,480
I want to see my daughter at once,

254
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,780
は

255
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,280
Well,

256
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:16,260
I've done good for them.

257
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,480
I haven't been out for a long time.

258
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,480
I wonder what food I should eat today.

259
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,480
I know.

260
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,480
There's a new fruit store in the third and ninth floors.

261
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,480
They sell a crystal happiness at the Xiheng Secret Store.

262
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,480
There's also a tea shop in the long-term.

263
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,480
It's now closed for a tear tea.

264
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:57,480
I heard that the difference between the tea that you like to drink is different.

265
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,480
I'll buy some more.

266
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,480
Yes.

267
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,480
More?

268
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,480
Wait.

269
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,480
There's a new year's ginseng shop in Changping.

270
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,480
Go and buy some fresh ginseng.

271
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:12,480
The shopkeeper said that you like it.

272
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,480
Yes.

273
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,480
Sweet sweet sweet.

274
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,480
The princesses are all for you.

275
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,480
You want this?

276
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,480
Yes, I have.

277
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,480
Here.

278
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,480
Here.

279
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,480
I've never been grateful to you for saving me many times.

280
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:38,480
It's not appropriate to be in love.

281
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,480
We're married and we're married.

282
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,480
But we're married and we're married.

283
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,480
She's always busy.

284
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,480
She's helped me and Ming family a lot.

285
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,480
I should also pay more attention to my wife.

286
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,480
What do you mean?

287
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,480
Princess is in love with you.

288
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,480
You're right.

289
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,480
You've been a mother for many years.

290
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,480
You're always a little bit of a lady.

291
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,480
Sometimes, women are more important.

292
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,480
What's the point?

293
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,480
It's what the princess said.

294
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,480
Princess.

295
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,480
Jiu Rou.

296
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,480
Jiu Rou, I've seen you.

297
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,480
Why are you here?

298
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,480
I came to find you.

299
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,480
I'm sorry for the trouble.

300
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,480
Please forgive me.

301
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,480
Why do you need me to explain?

302
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,480
How is the county?

303
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,480
You're both mothers.

304
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,480
It's good.

305
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,480
Thank you for your concern.

306
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,480
After my father died,

307
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,480
only the princess came to ask.

308
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,480
She even gave me a silver platter.

309
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,480
I'm in a relationship with my mother.

310
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:47,480
But my father told me to meet her in the prison.

311
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,480
You know, my princess.

312
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:52,480
I'm not a good girl.

313
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,480
Now, I don't dare to go alone.

314
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,480
Today, I can only ask for the princess.

315
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,480
Can you go with me?

316
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,480
You and my friend.

317
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,480
I'll go with you.

318
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,480
Jiu Rou, thank you.

319
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,480
You're welcome.

320
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,480
What's wrong?

321
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,480
Princess, why are you late?

322
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,480
Princess is here.

323
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,480
She sent food.

324
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,480
Hurry up.

325
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,480
It's late.

326
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,480
There's nothing to do.

327
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,480
It's our turn.

328
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,480
Let's go.

329
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,480
Thank you, princess.

330
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,480
Here.

331
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,480
This is the platter.

332
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,480
Thank you, princess.

333
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,480
This is the platter.

334
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,480
This is the platter.

335
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,480
Thank you, princess.

336
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,480
Thank you, princess.

337
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,480
Princess.

338
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,480
Princess.

339
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,480
Princess.

340
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,480
Princess.

341
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,480
Princess.

342
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,480
Here.

343
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,480
Thank you, princess.

344
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,480
Thank you.

345
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,480
Here.

346
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,480
Here.

347
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,480
Thank you.

348
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,480
Thank you, princess.

349
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,480
Here.

350
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,480
Thank you, princess.

351
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,480
General Shen is here.

352
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,480
This is yours.

353
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,480
You're the princess's cousin.

354
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,480
I said,

355
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,480
I don't know who to leave the most precious piece of the platter.

356
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,480
I think it's the princess who sent it to you.

357
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,480
Thank you, princess.

358
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,480
I have some business to attend to.

359
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,480
I don't want to waste time.

360
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,480
Princess,

361
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,480
I'm sorry.

362
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,480
I'll take my leave.

363
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,480
Are you here to eat snacks?

364
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,480
Your Highness.

365
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,480
The camp is in the morning.

366
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,480
Everything is ready.

367
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,480
I see.

368
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,480
Leave.

369
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,480
Yes.

370
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,480
Yes.

371
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,480
General Shen.

372
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,480
I'm here to serve you.

373
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,480
I want to eat something.

374
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,480
You're the one who's eating.

375
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,480
Yes.

376
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,480
Did you clean up the platter?

377
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,480
I'm not talking about it.

378
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,480
Why are you so angry?

379
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,480
When can you clean up the platter?

380
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,480
You can tell.

381
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,480
Your Highness is not a person who doesn't know how to use the law.

382
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,480
So, what did you do wrong?

383
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,480
Princess,

384
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,480
I'm here to see you.

385
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,480
If I hadn't come,

386
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,480
I wouldn't have known

387
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,480
how to arrange the wedding.

388
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,480
Yesterday,

389
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,480
Your Highness

390
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,480
was so busy with the military affairs.

391
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,480
I shouldn't have left Ah Tan alone.

392
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,480
If I tell you about it,

393
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,480
I don't know how much I'll be bothered.

394
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,480
I'm afraid that

395
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,480
you'll be worried.

396
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,480
Your Highness,

397
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,480
you've been in the capital for a long time.

398
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,480
You're not doing well.

399
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,480
Now, I'm a wife of a husband.

400
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,480
Ah Tan is planning to

401
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,480
take care of the prince and the prince.

402
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,480
He's planning to get back to the palace.

403
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,480
The most important thing is

404
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,480
to stay home and take care of the husband and wife.

405
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,480
Report.

406
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,480
Come in.

407
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,480
Your Highness,

408
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,480
I'm here to report to you.

409
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,480
From now on,

410
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,480
Ah Tan will eat with you

411
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,480
every morning.

412
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,480
From now on,

413
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,480
Ah Tan will eat with you every morning.

414
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,480
Try the sour and spicy food.

415
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,480
It's so sweet.

416
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,480
It's so delicious.

417
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,480
Just put the bag down.

418
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,480
You're not a stranger.

419
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,480
You don't have to say it.

420
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,480
I'm not saying it.

421
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,480
You've been acting like a man.

422
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,480
You're a man.

423
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,480
You're a man.

424
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,480
Your Highness, please be quiet.

425
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,480
I've seen Qi Yuan.

426
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,480
I'll obey you.

427
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,480
I was a criminal last night.

428
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:10,480
I'll keep your face and your name in mind.

429
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,480
I'll be a man

430
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,480
who can kill you.

431
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,480
I'm in a relationship with her.

432
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,480
She's in a relationship with me.

433
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,480
She's so sincere.

434
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,480
She's so stubborn.

435
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,480
She's so greedy.

436
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,480
I'm here today for a reason.

437
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,480
The girl, Gu Jiu Rou,

438
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,480
is my guardian angel.

439
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,480
She's always been timid.

440
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,480
She came to look for me.

441
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,480
She wanted me to go with her

442
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,480
to see Marquis Cheng.

443
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,480
I know Marquis Cheng is in Jingjing.

444
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,480
I'm thinking of telling you.

445
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,480
Don't worry, Your Highness.

446
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:49,480
I won't interfere with the other matters.

447
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:51,480
I'm just here to send Jiu Rou away.

448
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,480
And,

449
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:56,480
Marquis Cheng committed a lot of crimes.

450
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,480
I'm wondering

451
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,480
how he'll deal with the family.

452
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:08,480
Will Jiu Rou be implicated?

453
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,480
I'll leave now.

454
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,480
I'll leave now.

455
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,480
I'll take Marquis Cheng to the court.

456
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,480
I'll take him to the court.

457
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,480
If you're not busy,

458
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,480
you can go back.

459
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,480
I'll take care of the military affairs.

460
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,480
I'll be back earlier.

461
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,480
Then,

462
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,480
remember to finish your breakfast.

463
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,480
If you're hungry,

464
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,480
you'll be better than me.

465
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,480
Your Highness,

466
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,480
don't you want to see Ah Tan off?

467
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,480
Okay.

468
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,480
Go back first.

469
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,480
Go back first.

470
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,480
Do you think

471
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,480
this is a word

472
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,480
that's not a word?

473
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,480
A word?

474
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,480
It's just a normal word.

475
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,480
What's the difference

476
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,480
between a word and a word?

477
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,480
It's a word that's not a word.

478
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,480
It's a word that's not a word.

479
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,480
It's a word that's not a word.

480
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,480
It's a word that's not a word.

481
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,480
What's the difference?

482
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,480
Go back first.

483
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,480
Where are you going?

484
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,480
It's the Royal House.

485
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,480
Where is the Royal House?

486
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:20,480
It's the house of my husband and His Highness.

487
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,480
His Highness said

488
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:26,480
he wanted me to wait for him at home.

489
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,480
This is what a husband and wife say.

490
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,480
Is that so?

491
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,480
Of course.

492
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,480
The Royal House and His Highness

493
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,480
are both married.

494
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,480
But the couple's love

495
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,480
is true.

496
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,480
But I did make a fortune

497
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,480
and was trapped by that Lian Ying Qi Yue.

498
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,480
How could she understand my feelings?

499
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,480
I'm not good to her

500
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,480
because

501
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:08,480
she's my husband.

502
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,480
I know that

503
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,480
I'm not good at it.

504
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,480
You don't understand.

505
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,480
I don't understand either.

506
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,480
I just know how to be a good husband

507
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,480
and how to be a good wife.

508
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,480
But someone taught me

509
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,480
how to be a good husband.

510
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,480
I'm not good at it.

511
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,480
I'm not good at it.

512
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,480
I'm not good at it.

513
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,480
I'm not good at it.

514
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,480
I'm not good at it.

515
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,480
I'm not good at it.

516
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,480
I'm not good at it.

517
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,480
I'm not good at it.

518
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,480
I'm not good at it.

519
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,480
I'm not good at it.

520
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,480
I'm not good at it.

521
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,480
I'm not good at it.

522
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,480
I'm not good at it.

523
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,480
I'm not good at it.

524
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,480
I'm not good at it.

525
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,480
I'm not good at it.

526
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,480
I'm not good at it.

527
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,480
I'm not good at it.

528
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,480
I'm not good at it.

529
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,480
I'm not good at it.

530
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,480
I'm not good at it.

531
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,480
I'm not good at it.

532
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,480
I'm not good at it.

533
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,480
I'm not good at it.

534
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,480
I'm not good at it.

535
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,480
I'm not good at it.

536
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,480
I'm not good at it.

537
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,480
I'm not good at it.

538
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,480
I'm not good at it.

539
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,480
I'm not good at it.

540
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,480
I'm not good at it.

541
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,480
I'm not good at it.

542
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,480
I'm not good at it.

543
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,480
I'm not good at it.

544
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,480
I'm not good at it.

545
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,480
I'm not good at it.

546
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,480
I'm not good at it.

547
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,480
I'm not good at it.

548
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,480
I'm not good at it.

549
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,480
I'm not good at it.

550
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,480
I'm not good at it.

551
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,480
I'm not good at it.

552
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,480
I'm not good at it.

553
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,480
I'm not good at it.

554
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,480
I'm not good at it.

555
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,480
I'm not good at it.

556
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,480
I'm not good at it.

557
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,480
I'm not good at it.

558
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,480
I'm not good at it.

559
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,480
Princess.

560
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,480
It's you, Su Xing.

561
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,480
His Highness has gone back to his room.

562
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,480
But he went to the study room.

563
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,480
Princess Consort.

564
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,480
It's you, Su Xing.

565
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,480
Your Highness is back.

566
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:48,480
But she went to the study.

567
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,480
Your Highness.

568
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,480
I'm here to see you.

569
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,480
You're welcome.

570
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,480
What's the matter, Princess Consort?

571
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:23,480
Your Highness is still hungry.

572
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:26,480
I've prepared some snacks for you.

573
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:33,480
This is the pickled radish porridge that I made myself.

574
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,480
This is made by you?

575
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,480
Yes.

576
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,480
I made it myself.

577
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:44,480
I made it clear after the ingredients were cooked.

578
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,480
I also made it two times before.

579
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,480
You said you made it yourself.

580
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,480
I made it myself.

581
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,480
What else?

582
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:57,480
Do you want to make it yourself?

583
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:02,480
You asked about the words,

584
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,480
but you didn't say it yourself.

585
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,480
How is it, Your Highness?

586
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,480
How does it taste?

587
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,480
It's very smooth and delicious.

588
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:18,480
It looks like you're very generous.

589
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,480
Your Highness.

590
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,480
In a whole night.

591
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:31,480
You ll turn it into rice soup and rest in the basement on time.

592
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:37,480
I've got moreOOS stuff.

593
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:41,480
I'm afraid I'll ruin your reputation.

594
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:44,480
Let's go to the study tonight.

595
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,900
You said you wanted to take care of A-Tan's face in the daytime.

596
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:49,500
You forgot everything.

597
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:52,740
If it's the second day of the wedding,

598
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:55,100
the groom will be absent from the room.

599
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:58,500
How should I look at A-Tan in the mansion?

600
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:02,260
I'm afraid I can't see anything on the floor.

601
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:08,020
The bow is important.

602
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:10,460
A-Tan's face is also important.

603
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:12,780
If you don't want to come back, you have to.

604
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,740
A-Tan

605
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,560
Can's

606
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:26,280
a Pot of Mantis

607
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,080
for Dies and Wages

608
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:37,100
Theona and Yuan Xian are living alone for now.

609
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:39,460
They only sleeppora for some days.

610
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:43,200
Therefore, A-Tan's takes care of his own business.

611
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,200
Do you like it?

612
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,200
You can like it.

613
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,200
I have work to do.

614
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,200
You should rest early.

615
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,200
Pray or not pray.

616
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,200
You're dumb.

617
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,140
It's Masterhua64

618
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:47,140
Sleep?

619
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:07,280
Call Masterhua64

620
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:09,700
No, no

621
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:10,980
You have to be slow

622
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:22,700
This is after finish很地后

623
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,460
on this screen

624
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:38,660
essence

625
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:40,700
Have a good night.

626
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:48,700
I'm not tired.

627
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:52,700
I...

628
00:34:58,700 --> 00:34:59,700
I can't sleep anyway.

629
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:02,700
Why don't you chat with the emperor,

630
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:04,700
the emperor, and the emperor,

631
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:05,700
and solve the problem?

632
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:11,700
I'm not tired.

633
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:41,700
I'm not tired.

634
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:10,700
I'm not tired.

635
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:11,700
I'm not tired.

636
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:38,700
Princess.

637
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:41,700
Princess.

638
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:11,700
Princess.

639
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:41,700
Princess.

640
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:11,700
Princess.

641
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:41,700
Princess.

642
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:14,700
Why is he still sleeping?

643
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:22,700
Is he in a bad mood?

644
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:23,700
Is he in a bad mood?

645
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:27,700
I'll have to ask the imperial doctor to come back.

646
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:29,700
No.

647
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:32,700
His highness is our emperor again.

648
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:35,700
I'll ask the imperial doctor to come back.

649
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:37,700
No.

650
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:39,700
His highness is our emperor again.

651
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:42,700
His highness is in a bad mood recently.

652
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:44,700
Moreover,

653
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:47,700
he is a man who is very sensitive.

654
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:11,700
Princess.

655
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:14,700
It's time to get up.

656
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:17,700
I have to say goodbye to the palace today.

657
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:26,700
Where is your highness?

658
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:28,700
His highness is out again.

659
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:30,700
He said he has a military item.

660
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:33,700
But he said he'll come back early.

661
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:35,700
He'll come back with the princess.

662
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:39,700
His highness really likes military items.

663
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:41,700
He is...

664
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:43,700
Princess.

665
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:49,700
You're so arrogant.

666
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:51,700
I'm afraid that others will not know

667
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:53,700
you're so arrogant and you're so empty-handed.

668
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:55,700
You're so arrogant.

669
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:01,700
Your highness.

670
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:03,700
Princess.

671
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:04,700
Your highness.

672
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:07,700
Have you used the morning sun?

673
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:08,700
If not,

674
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:10,700
I'll have people prepare the food for you in the car.

675
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:12,700
No need.

676
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:13,700
It's all right.

677
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:14,700
Just go to the palace.

678
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:25,700
Gu Jiu Rou has asked the princess to visit you.

679
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:27,700
We've asked for forty.

680
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:30,700
I'll go to the capital to pick her up.

681
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:33,700
I'll be the one to blame.

682
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:34,700
I'll be the one to blame.

683
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:35,700
For the sake of the Ming family,

684
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:38,700
I'll have to avoid the princess.

685
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:41,700
But there are innocent people in the Gu family.

686
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:43,700
They all want to be implicated?

687
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:45,700
Jiu Rou and her daughter are always unmarried.

688
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:47,700
They live better than the other two.

689
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:50,700
I'll be the one to blame.

690
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:52,700
I'll be the one to blame.

691
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:53,700
Your highness,

692
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:54,700
I'll be the one to blame.

693
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:56,700
I'll be the one to blame.

694
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:59,700
If you're in love with His Majesty,

695
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:02,700
can you let them go?

696
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:04,700
Or do you want to be punished?

697
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:07,700
Law is law.

698
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:09,700
It's up to you.

699
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:10,700
If you don't mind,

700
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:13,700
I can let them go.

701
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:19,700
What do you mean?

702
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:21,700
You don't want to say anything

703
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:23,700
but face me?

704
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:31,700
Your highness.

705
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:32,700
Your highness.

706
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:46,700
Greetings, Your Highness.

707
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:51,700
You came alone?

708
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:52,700
Yes.

709
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:55,700
Prince Dingbei is going back to the north.

710
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:57,700
Instead of seeing you being lonely,

711
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:59,700
why don't you get used to it?

712
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:05,700
Princess, Prince Dingbei, please.

713
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:13,700
I heard Prince Dingbei is in the north.

714
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:16,700
He's in a lot of trouble with his soldiers.

715
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:18,700
Or is it that you're lucky

716
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:20,700
that you're the only one in the royal family

717
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:22,700
who's free and free?

718
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:30,700
The empress is here too.

719
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:31,700
Grandmother.

720
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:34,700
Greetings, Your Highness.

721
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:37,700
Greetings, Your Highness.

722
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:40,700
May the empress and empress

723
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:43,700
be blessed with health and health.

724
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:45,700
Please sit.

725
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:48,700
Thank you, Your Highness.

726
00:43:58,700 --> 00:43:59,700
It's dangerous.

727
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:02,700
The empress thought I didn't know the empress.

728
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:04,700
The old aunt who was pregnant

729
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:05,700
deliberately reminded me.

730
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:07,700
The empress took the first chance

731
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:09,700
but she was so ashamed.

732
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:12,700
She was more worried about this.

733
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:14,700
That's why she failed.

734
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:16,700
She wanted me to be rude

735
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:18,700
and make the empress not happy.

736
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:29,700
I'm sorry.

737
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:31,700
I'm sorry.

738
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:33,700
I'm sorry.

739
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:35,700
I'm sorry.

740
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:37,700
I'm sorry.

741
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:39,700
I'm sorry.

742
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:41,700
I'm sorry.

743
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:43,700
I'm sorry.

744
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:45,700
I'm sorry.

745
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:47,700
I'm sorry.

746
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:49,700
I'm sorry.

747
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:51,700
I'm sorry.

748
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:53,700
I'm sorry.

749
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:55,700
