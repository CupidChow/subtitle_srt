1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I am not a good person.

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I am not a good person.

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I am not a good person.

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I am not a good person.

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I am not a good person.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I am not a good person.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I am not a good person.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I am not a good person.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I am not a good person.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I am not a good person.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I am not a good person.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I am not a good person.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I am not a good person.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I am not a good person.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I am not a good person.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I am not a good person.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I am not a good person.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I am not a good person.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I am not a good person.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I am not a good person.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I am not a good person.

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I am not a good person.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I am not a good person.

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I am not a good person.

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I am not a good person.

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I am not a good person.

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I am not a good person.

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I am not a good person.

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I am not a good person.

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I am not a good person.

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I am not a good person.

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I am not a good person.

33
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I am not a good person.

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I am not a good person.

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I am not a good person.

36
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I am not a good person.

37
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Welcome back to Sahu Hi Chathong.

38
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,280
種

39
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:07,920
I am already

40
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,960
Like how you

41
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,380
praised us

42
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,380
Ask me here

43
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:20,380
I won't be a different person

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,900
Yea

45
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Come in.

46
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,440
Suoxin.

47
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,280
My Lord.

48
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,440
Did you get any news from His Highness?

49
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,400
Madam has been waiting in the backyard for a long time.

50
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,600
If we go any further,

51
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,800
he might not be able to hide it.

52
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,600
Even if he can't hide it, he has to hide it.

53
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,800
There must be something wrong with the wedding today.

54
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,080
His Majesty personally arranged the wedding.

55
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,280
Which girl can be so lucky?

56
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,640
Yes.

57
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,840
I heard that on the day of the wedding,

58
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,640
the King of Dingbei has been wearing a lot of clothes.

59
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,840
That's the only gift.

60
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,040
Didn't you see that?

61
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,040
The King of Dingbei's house is different.

62
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,040
It's different from the usual house.

63
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,040
But, my Lord.

64
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,040
Ladies.

65
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,040
Congratulations, my Lord.

66
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,040
It's like this.

67
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,840
Tan'er was not feeling well last night.

68
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,040
He is not feeling well.

69
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,040
He said that he had a headache this morning.

70
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,040
He couldn't hear the noise.

71
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,040
Oh, right.

72
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,440
The ladies are all in the backyard.

73
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,840
Why don't you go over there and have some tea?

74
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,840
Okay.

75
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,840
Hurry up.

76
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,840
Take care of him.

77
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,040
Ladies, take care.

78
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,440
My Lord.

79
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,040
Prime Minister Su has arrived.

80
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,640
Guard the yard.

81
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,640
No one is allowed to enter.

82
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,640
Yes.

83
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,640
Prime Minister Su.

84
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,640
You are finally here.

85
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,640
You are so generous.

86
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,440
But, you are not very considerate.

87
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,440
You are late.

88
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,840
We are here for a few days.

89
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,440
It's not a big deal.

90
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,440
No matter how good your parents are, they are just guests.

91
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,440
No, no.

92
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,440
I am not happy to hear that.

93
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,040
I have been away from the capital for so many years.

94
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,040
You took care of Tan'er.

95
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,440
I have been fighting with you.

96
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:47,440
But, I still remember how good you were to Tan'er.

97
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:51,440
You are not used to me anymore.

98
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,440
You are really not used to me.

99
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,440
You are right.

100
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,440
Enough.

101
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,440
Don't be so formal.

102
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,440
You are not even a little boy.

103
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,440
I will go and see Tan'er.

104
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,440
I want to talk to him.

105
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,440
Madam.

106
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,440
I have a gift for him.

107
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,440
Madam, the thing is that...

108
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:12,440
Tan'er is having a headache because of the cold.

109
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:15,440
I went to see him and he was stopped.

110
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,440
Why don't you wait for a while?

111
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,440
You will see him when you get married.

112
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,440
You are his father, but you are a man.

113
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,440
Tan'er is not willing to see you.

114
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,440
I have been with Tan'er for many years.

115
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,440
How can she care about this?

116
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,440
Madam.

117
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,440
You...

118
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,440
Why are you following their mother's words?

119
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,440
Why are you so anxious on their wedding day?

120
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,440
Is there something wrong?

121
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,440
What could be wrong?

122
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,440
Yes.

123
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,440
Of course.

124
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,440
I am just excited.

125
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,440
Please come in.

126
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,440
It is a happy marriage.

127
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,440
Yes.

128
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,440
Yes.

129
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,440
It is a happy marriage.

130
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,440
That's right.

131
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,440
It is a happy marriage.

132
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,440
That's right.

133
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,440
Greetings, madam.

134
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,440
I came to see Tan'er and talk to him.

135
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,440
Madam, don't blame me.

136
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,440
Today, my head is aching.

137
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,440
I didn't see him this morning.

138
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,440
Tan'er is sick.

139
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,440
I have to go and see him.

140
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,440
Madam.

141
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,440
Madam is resting.

142
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,440
Why don't you wait for a while?

143
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,440
It is not too late for you to come back.

144
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,440
It is not too late.

145
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,440
Tan'er is still resting.

146
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,440
If you miss the auspicious time, you will have a headache.

147
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,440
Yes.

148
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,440
Madam, don't worry.

149
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,440
I know what I am doing.

150
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,440
I won't miss the auspicious time.

151
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:57,440
Why don't you wait for a while and rest?

152
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,440
Tan'er must be feeling sad after getting married.

153
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,440
Madam.

154
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,440
That's why he is pretending to be sick.

155
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,440
Tan'er.

156
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,440
Madam.

157
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,440
Tan'er.

158
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,440
Madam.

159
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,440
Please forgive me.

160
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,440
Madam wants to see you.

161
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,440
I can't stop her.

162
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,440
Is it you, Madam?

163
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,440
Tan'er.

164
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,440
Why are you so hoarse?

165
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,440
Are you okay?

166
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,440
Come.

167
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,440
Let me see.

168
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,440
Madam.

169
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,440
I am fine.

170
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,440
Drink it while it is hot.

171
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,440
It will help you recover faster.

172
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,440
Greetings, Madam.

173
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,440
Please be careful.

174
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,440
Don't spill the blood.

175
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:00,440
When you opened your eyes, you were so happy.

176
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:04,440
You said that you would take the blood after you got married.

177
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,440
Otherwise, you would have been in a big trouble.

178
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,440
Madam, don't you think so?

179
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,440
Of course.

180
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,440
I am lucky to have a habit of covering my face.

181
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,440
Tan'er.

182
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,440
This is a token of my love.

183
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,440
Come.

184
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,440
Let me put it on you.

185
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,440
It is time.

186
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,440
You should be ready to leave.

187
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,440
I will wait in the front hall.

188
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,440
Tan'er.

189
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,440
I thought you would let me see your face.

190
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,440
Why did you put on the mask so soon?

191
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,440
Madam.

192
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,440
This...

193
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,440
Lue'er.

194
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,440
Madam.

195
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,440
Madam.

196
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,440
Madam.

197
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,440
Madam.

198
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,440
Madam.

199
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,440
Madam.

200
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,440
Madam.

201
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,440
Madam.

202
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,440
What is happening?

203
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,440
Where is Tan?

204
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,440
I am lucky that Madam has never seen you.

205
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:53,440
Otherwise, she would not have been able to come here.

206
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,440
What happened?

207
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,440
Where is Tan?

208
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,440
I don't know.

209
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,440
We can only wait for a while.

210
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,440
What is this?

211
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,440
What is this?

212
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:33,140
This is a huge

213
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,440
What time is it?

214
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,440
Your highness.

215
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,440
It is an urgent matter.

216
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,440
Is Prince Rui coming to the wedding?

217
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,440
Why is he not here yet?

218
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,440
Yes.

219
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,440
Is there any problem?

220
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,440
It is time.

221
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,440
Why is Tan not coming out to greet me?

222
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,440
Is it because you are reluctant to let your daughter hide her?

223
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,440
How can that be?

224
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,440
It is hard to say.

225
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:09,440
It is time to greet the bride.

226
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,440
Good.

227
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,440
Good.

228
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,440
Please sit down.

229
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,440
Please.

230
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,440
Good.

231
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,440
The first is the fourth season.

232
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:31,440
The first is the fourth season.

233
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,440
The first is the fourth season.

234
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,440
The first is the second.

235
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:43,440
The second is the third season.

236
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,240
I do not allow anything.

237
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,920
It is wrong to enjoy the beauty of her beauty.

238
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,880
Brother Charl Teen.

239
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:58,200
Chandny, let's July 15,

240
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,240
with a voting onshampo junior.

241
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:04,120
We express our gratitude once again.

242
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,480
Chandny,

243
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,480
We are in a very close relationship.

244
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,480
From now on, you and your son must be close to each other.

245
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,480
You must be in love with each other.

246
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,480
You must be together in marriage.

247
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,480
You must be together in marriage.

248
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,480
Enough.

249
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,480
Don't waste the time to go out.

250
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,480
Go inside.

251
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,480
Tan.

252
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,480
Tan.

253
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,480
I am not willing to see you get married.

254
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,480
After you marry into the family, you must come back to the Prime Minister's house often.

255
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,480
You must accompany me.

256
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,480
Go out quickly.

257
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,480
It's urgent.

258
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,480
Tan.

259
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,480
I didn't see you at the Zhaoshui Garden.

260
00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:01,480
I should have a good look at your wedding.

261
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,480
I can be at ease if I look at you.

262
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,480
No.

263
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,480
How dare you!

264
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,480
If you behave like this, you will be punished.

265
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,480
Mingming, don't be rude.

266
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,480
You don't understand.

267
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:26,480
If someone else takes the bride, it will be a bad omen.

268
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,480
Am I right, Madam?

269
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,480
Yes, you are right.

270
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,480
Madam, you are right.

271
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:40,480
My husband and I are like Tan'er and Jichu.

272
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,480
We can talk about it when we are married.

273
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:47,480
If you have any bad intentions, you can blame me.

274
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,480
Madam.

275
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,480
Who dares to provoke me and ruin my wedding?

276
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:58,480
The King of Northern China has arranged a marriage for the Marquis.

277
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,480
It's a great opportunity.

278
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,480
Go away.

279
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,480
Why did you come here in person?

280
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:22,480
I am very surprised to see you here.

281
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:28,480
I am your mother.

282
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,480
I know you well.

283
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,480
I am sorry for my rudeness.

284
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:38,480
I hope you don't mind.

285
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:45,480
Since you say so, I will do as you say.

286
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,480
Thank you, Your Highness.

287
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:54,480
Please take the wedding dress.

288
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,480
I will go out and board the carriage.

289
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,480
The Marquis will take you to the main hall.

290
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,480
Your Highness.

291
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,480
Are you scared?

292
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,480
Go away.

293
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,480
Your Highness.

294
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,480
Jiangxu.

295
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,480
Help.

296
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,480
Help.

297
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,480
Your Highness.

298
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,480
Since you are so affectionate,

299
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,480
I will ask the Princess to leave.

300
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,480
So that she won't be alone in the future.

301
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:52,480
I have been taken care of by my parents for many years.

302
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:58,480
I will remember your affection.

303
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:02,480
I will bid you farewell today.

304
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,480
Thank you.

305
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:12,480
I will keep the wedding dress you gave me.

306
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,480
I will keep it safe.

307
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:20,480
The bride is leaving the wedding hall.

308
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,480
I will bid you farewell.

309
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,480
Okay.

310
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,480
Go.

311
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,480
The Princess of the Northern Kingdom has returned.

312
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,480
The wedding is about to start.

313
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:30,480
The Princess has returned.

314
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,480
When I opened my eyes, the Princess was not like that.

315
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,480
It must be the time of morning, the sky is bright and the bride is looking at the flowers.

316
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,480
Don't let Prince of Dingbei hear this.

317
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:00,360
I am the king here wipest'reáp

318
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:08,400
I am Assiram

319
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,140
I have become the king

320
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:30,640
Is it true that your love medicine was spread by the evil spirit?

321
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:31,980
That's true.

322
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,740
It is not true.

323
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:36,940
Be right there.

324
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,100
Now is not good.

325
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:48,840
But mine should be working nope.

326
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:51,580
Then,

327
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:55,360
add another quelleon to a ankle.

328
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:59,000
From now on, he is my husband.

329
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,360
Don't worry, father.

330
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,800
I shall take my leave.

331
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,440
Please, my lord.

332
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,360
You are the one who married her.

333
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,120
I used to think that she is cold-hearted.

334
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,080
She must be the last one among us.

335
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,800
But she is the first one.

336
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,040
She is not the first one.

337
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:27,040
But she is a very decent and gentle lady.

338
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,520
I feel touched when I see her.

339
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,400
It's lucky that the ladies in Shangjing are so good.

340
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,400
They don't look down on you.

341
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,320
I only want to see her heart.

342
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:39,040
It's not my business if the ladies look down on me.

343
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,360
We are not even close.

344
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,360
Look at my cousin's house.

345
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,360
Look at yourself.

346
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,760
Cousin's house?

347
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,320
King Dingbei married Tan.

348
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,320
She is my cousin's wife.

349
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:00,920
What are you looking at?

350
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,520
Why are you grabbing my pearls?

351
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,240
This is money for the wedding.

352
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,640
My cousin's wife prepared it.

353
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,040
Besides, no one gives money for the wedding.

354
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,760
And you.

355
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,120
You can't steal it as a token.

356
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,120
The more money you give, the more lucky you will be.

357
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,120
Come on.

358
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,440
I'll give you all.

359
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,440
Is it enough to give you money?

360
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,120
It's enough.

361
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,520
You are more talented than me.

362
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,520
You are not a family without a family.

363
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31,920
You two look like a couple.

364
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:35,920
You two have a good chemistry.

365
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,920
Who is a couple?

366
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,920
Let's go.

367
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,920
Let's go.

368
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:20,920
Let's go.

369
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:24,920
Let's go.

370
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:42,920
The daughter of Duke Jing An, Ming Shi.

371
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,920
She is a beautiful lady.

372
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:45,920
She is a well-known lady.

373
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,920
She is a well-known lady.

374
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,920
She is a well-known lady.

375
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,200
Princess Ding Bei will have the crown as the legal wife.

376
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:55,200
Her staying in the manor includes much action.

377

Let's not bother with the formalities.

Let my wife rest early.

407
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,840
Your Highness, you are in a hurry.

408
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,840
You should have the strength to do so.

409
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:49,840
Please sit down and prepare the food for the Princess.

410
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,840
The night of youth is just around the corner.

411
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,840
A flower blooms in the red night.

412
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,840
It is a treasure that is easy to see.

413
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:06,840
It is a treasure that is easy to see.

414
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,840
The Princess is holding the Prince's hand.

415
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,840
She is sincere.

416
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,840
If the Prince can't do good deeds,

417
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,840
the Princess will not be able to receive the fan.

418
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,840
The red night is like a flower.

419
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,840
It is a treasure that is easy to see.

420
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,840

It is a treasure that is easy to see.

422
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,840
It is a treasure that is easy to see.

423
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:01,840
She remembers that the red night is like a flower.

424
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,840
Your Highness, your poem is not enough to impress the Princess.

425
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,840
Why don't you sing another song?

426
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:09,840
Yes, let's sing another song.

427
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:18,840
The pink powder of the young man's house is gold.

428
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,840
The golden hair of the princess is golden.

429
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,840
The golden hair of the princess is golden.

430
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:27,840

00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:46,840
She remembers that my wish is true.

436
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:06,840
Because you are in the destiny.

437
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:12,840
I am willing to be your branch.

438
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:15,840
I will take care of our love.

It is a treasure that is easy to see.

441
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:28,840
The red night is like a flower.

442
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:35,840
The green color of the flowers is like the moon.

443
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,840
It is a treasure that is easy to see.

444
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,840
I will take care of our love.

445
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,840

It is a treasure that is easy to see.

454
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:33,840
I will take care of our love.

455
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,840
Because you are in the destiny.

456
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:39,840
I will take care of our love.

457
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:44,840
I will take care of our love.

Greetings, Your Highness.

481
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:02,960
Your Highness.

482
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,720
If you are injured, you must take the medicine.

483
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,000
Please rest well.

484
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:13,480
If you are hungry, you can order the kitchen.

485
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,640
It's too windy.

486
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:24,960
You should rest.

487
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,400
Have you ever been injured?

488
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,400
Are you alright?

489
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,400
I'm fine.

490
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,400
That's good.

491
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,880
But you scared us.

492
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,720
Thank God.

493
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,400
The wedding is over.

494
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:49,120
You didn't know that you were pregnant this morning.

495
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,720
You were pregnant this morning.

496
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:53,480
Miss, you don't know how scared we were this morning.

497
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:56,680
We almost forgot...

498
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,720
Miss, thank you for the gift.

499
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:07,080
It's so heavy.

500
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,120
Your Highness.

501
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:12,560
Your Highness.

502
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,200
Congratulations, Your Highness.

503
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,720
May you have a long life and a good family.

504
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,360
Thank you.

505
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,160
Your Highness, you know I'm always a little bit of a mouthful.

506
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,680
I have a few drops of water in my stomach.

507
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,040
I'll give you a few more glasses.

508
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:26,200
I'll put all my words in the wine.

509
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,880
Every time we celebrate, you always drink less.

510
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,080
Today is your wedding.

511
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,440
You shouldn't refuse.

512
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,200
That's right.

513
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,200
Come, Your Highness.

514
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,200
Enough.

515
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,920
I know that Ah Xu is a good man.

516
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:39,920
He's cold.

517
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:42,320
You don't dare to act like this.

518
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:45,160
You are taking advantage of the opportunity to make him suffer.

519
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:48,880
I'll have to tell him a few more things while Ah Xu is still awake.

520
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:49,880
Okay.

521
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:04,680
I have to say that you are really considerate.

522
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,240
You are the princess of your own family.

523
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,640
You should be considerate and considerate.

524
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,640
That's right.

525
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:12,720
Otherwise, how could you have gone to the Marquis Manor to celebrate?

526
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:16,040
He wanted to celebrate, but he didn't tell me in advance.

527
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:18,440
Your Highness must have come here because you were worried that you would suffer.

528
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:21,040
Who would dare to make a fool of himself when he was here?

529
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:30,640
Your Highness should like me.

530
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:34,040
You are so considerate and considerate.

531
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:36,440
You are not just a little girl.

532
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,840
What else can you be?

533
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:41,360
Ah Yu, are you really busy or are you just being nosy?

534
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,360
You will know in a while.

535
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:55,360
Your Highness, if I leave you for a few days, I won't be able to live.

536
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:58,360
Go ahead. I'll come later.

537
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:02,360
I'm sorry.

538
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:04,360
I'm sorry.

539
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,880
I'll come later.

540
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,880
Since Lord Liu's visit,

541
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:13,880
the accounts of the Ministry of Revenue have been cleared.

542
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,880
Lord Liu has been very busy.

543
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:20,880
A few days ago, His Majesty even named the matter as a family matter.

544
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:24,880
Lord Liu has always been diligent and diligent.

545
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:27,880
He never missed a single day of the year.

546
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:31,880
With him around, the Ministry of Revenue has not made any mistakes.

547
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,400
That's right.

548
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:37,400
But how come Lord Liu was not present at the ceremony last night?

549
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:42,400
Which lady did you meet?

550
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,400
Congratulations, Your Highness.

551
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,400
Congratulations, Your Highness.

552
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,400
Congratulations, Your Highness.

553
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,400
Please, Your Highness.

554
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,400
I'm sorry for not being able to entertain you.

555
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,400
I've brought you tea and wine.

556
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,400
Please forgive me.

557
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,400
Your Highness is too kind.

558
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:24,400
Lord Liu, please.

559
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,400
Thank you, Your Highness.

560
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,400
Please have a seat.

561
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,400
I'm sorry.

562
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,400
I'm sorry.

563
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,400
I'm sorry.

564
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,400
I'm sorry.

565
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,400
I'm sorry.

566
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,920
Thank you, Your Highness.

567
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,920
Thank you, Your Highness.

568
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,920
When did you become friends with the Ministry of Revenue?

569
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,920
We don't talk about the day of the wedding.

570
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,920
Drinking is the most important thing.

571
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,440
Come.

572
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:31,440
This is the wedding wine I've been looking for.

573
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,440
I've been waiting for this day to have a drink with you.

574
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,440
The feast will start at 3 pm.

575
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,440
A'lu, you're drinking too much.

576
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,440
You can't wait any longer.

577
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,440
You can drink it yourself.

578
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,440
Ah Xu has been working all night to save the Princess.

579
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,440
He hasn't had a drink yet.

580
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,440
He'll drink it soon.

581
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,440
What if he gets drunk in the evening?

582
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:53,440
I didn't ask him to come here to drink with us.

583
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:56,960
You didn't just ask him to drink with you.

584
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,960
I didn't want to interfere in anyone's business!

585
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,960
So I asked him leave...

586
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,960
to stay at home for work?

587
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,960
I'm afraid the tyres won't legalize music.

588
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:08,960
If someone notices this at home,

589
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,960
they'll catch him.

590
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,960
He must be around here.

591
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:17,960
Like many formal people,

592
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:21,960
many police officers always in chorus.

593
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,960
You shouldn't be too cold to her.

594
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:24,960
Think about it.

595
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:27,960
You two are sleeping together.

596
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,960
She is shy.

597
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,960
You shouldn't talk to her like you do.

598
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,960
Yes, you are right.

599
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,960
You shouldn't talk too much.

600
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,960
You are right.

601
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:40,960
What's the point of talking about that on a happy day?

602
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,960
Anyway, you are right.

603
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,960
You can talk about things that she likes.

604
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,960
Don't talk about fighting.

605
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:50,960
You can talk to her about poetry.

606
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:51,960
You know that.

607
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,960
Yes, you should talk about things.

608
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:56,960
You shouldn't talk about things that are too much.

609
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:02,960
You two seem to have a lot of experience.

610
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,960
How many wives did you marry?

611
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,960
How many concubines did you have?

612
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,960
We didn't marry.

613
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:10,960
But in this respect,

614
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,960
you should know better.

615
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,960
Luan Feng is here.

616
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:26,960
He is being praised by the bandits.

617
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:31,960
Please come to the court.

618
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:51,960
Miss.

619
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,960
Miss.

620
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,960
Miss.

621
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,960
The prince is coming.

622
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:01,960
The prince is coming.

623
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,960
The prince is coming.

624
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,960
The prince is coming.

625
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,960
The prince is coming.

626
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,960
The prince is coming.

627
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,960
The prince is coming.

628
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,960
The prince is coming.

629
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,960
The prince is coming.

630
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,960
The prince is coming.

631
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,960
The prince is coming.

632
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,960
The prince is coming.

633
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:43,960
The prince is coming.

634
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,960
The prince is coming.

635
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,960
The prince is coming.

636
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,960
The prince is coming.

637
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:50,960
The prince is coming.

638
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,960
The prince is coming.

639
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,960
The prince is coming.

640
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,960
The prince is coming.

641
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,960
A comforts message to your highness.

642
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,280
Send all of them, then.

643
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,240
Oh.

644
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,320
Send the rest of the two of them.

645
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:33,600
What is she doing here?

646
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:35,720
She's here to say thank you.

647
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:39,280
The king and adept of countries must be following this woman in my country.

648
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,240
You can ask her to go home.

649
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,720
What will you do now?

650
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:46,800
I'll send the rest of them to watch the feeding of the pigs.

651
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:47,480
No problem.

652
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,760
Thank you, before I leave.

653
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:50,760
Go to sleep.

654
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:57,760
I will sleep now.

655
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:05,760
If you don't sleep, do you have anything else to do?

656
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:16,760
Yes, I do have something to do.

657
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,760
But I haven't thought of anything.

658
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:47,760
Your Highness.

659
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:50,760
I didn't put it here.

660
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,760
I didn't put it here.

661
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,760
I really didn't put it here.

662
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,760
Your Highness, I really didn't put it here.

663
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:22,760
Your Highness, there is no need to explain.

664
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:23,760
I understand.

665
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:25,760
What do you understand?

666
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,760
This has nothing to do with me.

667
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,760
I have to explain it clearly.

668
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:32,760
Even if you have to explain it, you don't have to pay me.

669
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,760
Why did you sign the contract?

670
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:43,760
You are not only a good person, but also a good person.

671
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:46,760
You even made him misunderstand that I am a bad person.

672
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:48,760
You are a bad person.

673
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:54,760
Come, come, come.

674
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:57,760
Such a happy event shouldn't be made public.

675
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:58,760
Come.

676
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,760
Last time, we drank together.

677
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,760
It was many years ago.

678
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:18,760
I remember that we were just new officials.

679
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:20,760
We were very friendly.

680
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:24,760
Don't panic.

681
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:28,760
It has been many years.

682
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:37,760
Why are you so sad today?

683
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:40,760
Are you still not willing to marry Tan'er?

684
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:42,760
Come, come, come.

685
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:44,760
Let's drink to end our grudge.

686
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:46,760
Let's drink together.

687
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:49,760
Come.

688
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:56,760
Let's drink.

689
00:43:58,760 --> 00:43:59,760
Okay.

690
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:00,760
Please.

691
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:06,760
Last night,

692
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:11,760
Tan'er was kidnapped by the Haiyou Sect.

693
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:25,760
I am sorry.

694
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:26,760
I am sorry.

695
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:27,760
I am sorry.

696
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:28,760
I am sorry.

697
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:29,760
I am sorry.

698
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:30,760
I am sorry.

699
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:31,760
I am sorry.

700
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:32,760
I am sorry.

701
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:33,760
I am sorry.

702
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:34,760
I am sorry.

703
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:35,760
I am sorry.

704
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:36,760
I am sorry.

705
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:37,760
I am sorry.

706
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:38,760
I am sorry.

707
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:39,760
I am sorry.

708
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:40,760
I am sorry.

709
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:41,760
I am sorry.

710
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:42,760
I am sorry.

711
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:43,760
I am sorry.

712
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:44,760
I am sorry.

713
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:45,760
I am sorry.

714
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:46,760
I am sorry.

715
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:47,760
I am sorry.

716
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:48,760
I am sorry.

717
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:49,760
I am sorry.

718
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:50,760
I am sorry.

719
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:51,760
I am sorry.

720
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:52,760
I am sorry.

721
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:53,760
I am sorry.

722
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:54,760
I am sorry.

723
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:55,760
I am sorry.

724
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:56,760
I am sorry.

725
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:57,760
I am sorry.

726
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:58,760
I am sorry.

727
00:45:58,760 --> 00:45:59,760
I am sorry.

728
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:00,760
I am sorry.

729
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:01,760
I am sorry.

730
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:02,760
I am sorry.

731
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:03,760
I am sorry.

732
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:04,760
I am sorry.

733
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:05,760
I am sorry.

734
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:06,760
I am sorry.

735
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:07,760
I am sorry.

736
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:08,760
I am sorry.

737
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:09,760
I am sorry.

738
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:10,760
I am sorry.

739
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:11,760
I am sorry.

740
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:12,760
I am sorry.

741
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:13,760
I am sorry.

742
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:14,760
I am sorry.

743
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:15,760
I am sorry.

744
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:16,760
I am sorry.

745
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:17,760
I am sorry.

746
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:18,760
I am sorry.

747
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:19,760
I am sorry.

748
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:20,760
I am sorry.

749
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:21,760
I am sorry.

750
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:22,760
I am sorry.

751
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:23,760
I am sorry.

752
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:24,760
