[Episode 11]

3
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:50,410
It's him.

4
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:56,780
Chase them!

5
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:01,190
Are we

6
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:02,440
going to die here today?

7
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,490
Ming Tan!

8
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:05,350
Jiurou!

9
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:06,610
Don't come any closer!

10
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:08,580
Jiurou!

11
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:20,530
It's Zhang Huaiyu.

12
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:21,720
It's Zhang Huaiyu.

13
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:49,720
Young Lord,

14
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,470
are you alright?

15
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,350
Are you all okay?

16
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:06,350
We're fine, thank you.

17
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:27,000
Zhang...

18
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,840
Why didn't you knock?

19
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,320
You're not some delicate maiden.

20
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,720
There's nothing to hide.

21
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,470
What are you doing here?

22
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:43,320
You're injured.

23
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,250
I'm here to apply medicine for you.

24
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,510
I can do it myself.

25
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:51,950
No need to trouble you, Miss Bai.

26
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:54,750
Zhang Huaiyu,

27
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,350
are you feeling shy?

28
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:57,820
I... I...

29
00:03:58,190 --> 00:03:59,560
I'm a grown man,

30
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,560
why would I be shy?

31
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:03,070
In Xian, we value reputation and propriety.

32
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:04,840
We strictly observe gender segregation.

33
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,840
The two of us,

34
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,040
both unmarried,

35
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,460
shouldn't be so intimate, should we?

36
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,520
I'm thinking of your reputation.

37
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:13,110
Of course,

38
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:15,200
if you insist

39
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,730
on applying medicine for me,

40
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:18,790
I suppose it wouldn't be impossible.

41
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:21,269
You're right.

42
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:23,350
I will eventually get married.

43
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:24,350
In that case,

44
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:25,810
take care of yourself.

45
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:27,350
You...

46
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:28,900
Since you're already here,

47
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,560
and you've already seen it...

48
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:33,350
It's indeed inconvenient for me.

49
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:36,070
Then I'll have to trouble you, Miss Bai.

50
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:39,600
We'll throw propriety
between men and women to the wind?

51
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:42,230
A true man doesn't fuss over trifles.

52
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,430
You,

53
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,600
your martial arts skills are lacking,

54
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,130
yet you rushed to the front.

55
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,520
My martial arts skills are lacking?

56
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,550
If it weren't for me today,

57
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:56,810
you'd all be carried back horizontally.

58
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,080
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

59
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:04,310
I...

60
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,160
I'll try to be gentle.

61
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,640
It hurts, it hurts.

62
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,350
I understand.

63
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:10,480
I... I... It hurts, it hurts, it hurts!

64
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,850
I know what I'm doing.

65
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,040
Be gentle, it hurts!

66
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,640
I'm being as gentle as I can.

67
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:19,550
You made Tan come here?

68
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,250
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

69
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,790
Jiurou.

70
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:25,840
This has nothing to do with you.

71
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:27,350
As for you,

72
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:29,620
to investigate the case,

73
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,550
you actually put Jiurou in danger,

74
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,760
using her as bait to lure out the culprit.

75
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,640
If something unexpected

76
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,700
were to happen,

77
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,610
who could guarantee absolute safety?

78
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:38,290
I...

79
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,300
I have already planned
everything thoroughly, of course...

80
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,050
If it weren't for
Young Lord Zhang's intervention,

81
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:47,800
we would have been in danger long ago.

82
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,070
Is this your plan?

83
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:50,659
Where is the thoroughness?

84
00:05:50,659 --> 00:05:52,220
Whose interests are being served here?

85
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:53,490
No, I...

86
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,409
How could you act so recklessly?

87
00:05:55,409 --> 00:05:56,659
Your Highness, you've misunderstood.

88
00:05:56,659 --> 00:05:57,980
His Highness's plan was comprehensive.

89
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:59,580
He was already
protecting us from the shadows.

90
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,340
It was me who panicked

91
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:02,580
and ruined the plan.

92
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:03,810
Jiurou.

93
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:05,900
You don't need to make excuses for him.

94
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,250
His actions today

95
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:09,370
show a disregard for others' safety

96
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:10,610
and a lack of consideration
for consequences.

97
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:12,170
I had already
discussed it thoroughly with her.

98
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:13,410
How can you say
I didn't consider the consequences?

99
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:15,290
It was I who failed
to act according to the plan.

100
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:16,580
His Highness is not to blame.

101
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:17,220
Jiurou.

102
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,170
As a young lady,

103
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:21,290
it's natural to be
frightened when facing danger.

104
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:23,420
Losing composure is understandable.

105
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:25,770
If he wants to investigate,
just do it himself.

106
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:27,020
Why involve you?

107
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:27,960
Your Highness,

108
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:29,490
His Highness did this

109
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:31,050
to actually provide me with an

110
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:32,510
opportunity to make merit,

111
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:34,780
so that before His Majesty
and the court officials,

112
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:36,370
he could plead for me and my mother,

113
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:38,630
to spare us from collective punishment.

114
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:52,890
Tan, without distinguishing
right from wrong,

115
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:54,650
you're holding me accountable.

116
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:57,050
Do you know what the consequences might be?

117
00:06:58,470 --> 00:06:59,230
Jiurou.

118
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,150
You just

119
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:03,050
had quite a scare.

120
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:04,100
How about I help you go rest?

121
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,810
Your Highness, I'm fine.

122
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,590
You're not fine.

123
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:09,970
You fell quite hard just now.

124
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:11,340
We need to check if you're injured.

125
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:11,870
Let's go.

[Bieyu House]

127
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:27,220
Let me do it.

128
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:30,100
I...

129
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:34,050
Zhang Huaiyu.

130
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:38,780
Minmin,

131
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:40,510
why are you here?

132
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,100
Have you had dinner yet?

133
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,500
Would you like to join us?

134
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:50,810
I thought

135
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,370
black chicken soup
is best for nourishing blood.

136
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:53,900
I brought a bowl
especially for you, Young Lord Zhang.

137
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,100
But here at your place,

138
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,630
there's every kind of tonic imaginable.

139
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:57,460
I suppose...

140
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:58,850
It's not needed.

141
00:07:58,850 --> 00:07:59,700
I... I... I...

142
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:00,800
Minmin.

143
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,250
Minmin.

144
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,250
None of the tonics

145
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,340
are as good as your black chicken soup.

146
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:06,940
Shuiying.

147
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:08,380
Clear all of these away.

148
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:10,700
I was just craving
a bowl of black chicken soup.

149
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:11,370
What a coincidence,

150
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:13,370
the black chicken soup has arrived.

151
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:29,210
Did you make this soup yourself?

152
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:31,820
Let me take a look.

153
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:38,490
Just by its color and aroma,

154
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,250
this soup already promises to be delicious,

155
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:42,010
making my mouth water.

156
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:44,850
Then eat it.

157
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:49,650
Then I'll have to trouble you, Minmin.

158
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:55,770
Around you,

159
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:56,580
there are Shuiying,

160
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:57,580
Yuying, Xueying.

161
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:58,910
You don't need me at all.

162
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:01,180
I'll go call Shuiying for you right now.

163
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:01,970
No, no, no.

164
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:02,850
No, that's not...

165
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:03,850
No, no, no.

166
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:05,460
No, no, it's not necessary, really.

167
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:06,390
Calling her here

168
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:07,840
would ruin the mood.

169
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:11,420
I, I just injured my hand.

170
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:12,980
It's inconvenient.

171
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:15,460
Is that so?

172
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:16,730
I seem to remember

173
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:18,010
you injured your back.

174
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:20,290
Why are you faking an arm injury?

175
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:21,660
Well...

176
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:24,960
The imperial physician
said I can't move my arm.

177
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:38,220
How is it?

178
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:41,840
Does it taste good?

179
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:44,490
This soup...

180
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:46,610
The cooking time...

181
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:49,890
Is actually quite right.

182
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:54,170
But it might be the salt.

183
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:57,060
It's a bit too salty.

184
00:09:57,770 --> 00:09:59,460
If this soup could have

185
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:00,820
a pinch of ground pepper added,

186
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:01,890
and a dash of sesame oil,

187
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:03,420
then the flavor would be...

188
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:04,570
Don't drink it anymore.

189
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:05,180
No, no.

190
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:06,040
I...

191
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:14,980
The Prince of Dingbei has already

192
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:16,250
sent Gu Jinzhong's booklet

193
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:17,580
to Zhang Qian.

194
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:19,760
I have learned that

195
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:21,250
in the booklet,

196
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:22,700
there are just some officials

197
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,700
of the Capital Prefecture
who bribed Gu Jinzhong.

198
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,960
It has nothing to do with the Chancellor.

199
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:28,050
I suppose

200
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,940
Gu Jinzhong is trying to save his son,

201
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,300
putting on a show of strength

202
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,630
in a desperate attempt.

203
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,580
Gu Jiurou, being a woman,

204
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:38,370
may not know whether
the booklet is genuine or not.

205
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:41,100
But the Prince of Dingbei
would know at a glance.

206
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:43,070
In today's situation,

207
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:45,420
he attempts to use a worm to catch a fish,

208
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:47,270
trying to expose
the mastermind behind it all.

209
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:49,250
It's truly a cunning plan.

210
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,560
Fortunately, he didn't succeed.

211
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,220
The matter of Gu Jinzhong

212
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:55,740
can be considered completely settled now.

213
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:57,950
Chancellor,

214
00:10:58,420 --> 00:10:59,880
the most urgent matter now

215
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,100
is the position
of the Governor of the Capital Prefecture.

216
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,160
It cannot remain vacant for too long.

217
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:05,620
The one we mentioned last time,

218
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:07,060
the Marquis of Jiangyang,

219
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:08,490
whether in terms of experience, prestige,

220
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:09,490
or royal favor,

221
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,300
is unmatched by anyone else.

222
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:14,700
It's just that this person
is too rigid in character.

223
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:17,700
I'm afraid he might be difficult to control.

224
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:22,420
It doesn't matter
if the Marquis of Jiangyang is hard to control.

225
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,350
There is someone

226
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:26,750
who can be controlled by you, Chancellor.

227
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,370
Who might that be?

228
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:33,460
The eldest legitimate son
of the Marquis of Jiangyang,

229
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,250
Gao Chen.

230
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:36,420
Gao Chen's first wife died just last year,

231
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:37,880
and he's eager to remarry.

232
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:39,300
This son has always been

233
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,300
the Marquis of Jiangyang's greatest concern.

234
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,770
If you, Chancellor, could arrange
a marriage alliance with him,

235
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:44,770
the relationship

236
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:47,860
would be extraordinary.

237
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:18,770
Such a small matter

238
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,490
should be left to Suxin.

239
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:23,300
There's no need to trouble Your...

240
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:23,890
Ouch!

241
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:27,160
Please be gentle, Your Highness.

242
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,610
Now you know it hurts.

243
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:30,850
When you went to look for Gu Jiurou,

244
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:33,050
didn't you think there might be danger?

245
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:35,700
Jiurou is my close friend.

246
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:37,580
She suddenly left the capital,

247
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:38,530
and I was worried about her.

248
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:40,330
Of course I had to go look for her.

249
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:43,730
How could I have known
it would be such a dangerous situation?

250
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:45,530
Tan, you're truly kind-hearted.

251
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:46,940
I left the palace today

252
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,530
and wasn't in the city either.

253
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:49,610
Why didn't I see you

254
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:51,180
being so worried about me?

255
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:54,920
Well...

256
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,080
Your Highness is out and about every day,

257
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,060
and has never informed the household

258
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:04,920
of your schedule or whereabouts.

259
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:08,100
If the household
were to worry and search for you every day,

260
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,010
wouldn't the entire mansion

261
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:13,650
♪ You walk beside me
like a gentle breeze ♪

262
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:10,270
be in constant unrest?

263
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:13,290
You're right about everything.

264
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:21,140
♪ We journey through mountains,
hearts entwined ♪

265
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:20,660

267

268
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:41,290
♪ The vows we made together ♪

269
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:41,610
It hurts.

270
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:45,230
♪ I'll never regret guarding you
or being wild with you ♪

271
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:43,730
Sorry,

272
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:45,300
I was too rough.

273
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:51,220
♪ Because the landscape of fate
always bears your shadow ♪

274
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:56,250

276
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:00,730

277
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,520
♪ Red threads bind us tightly ♪

278
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,820
This really him?

♪ This is what happiness looks like ♪

280
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,230
So gentle and considerate,

281
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:06,920
attentive to every detail.

282
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:09,770
Such a small matter,

283
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:10,890
I'd better do it myself.

284
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:13,220
There's no need to trouble Your Highness.

285
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:15,450
Your wound shouldn't get wet.

286
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:17,320
Let me clean your face.

287
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:20,800
Come.

288
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:22,490
Your Highness, there's no need for this.

289
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:23,770
If others were to see,

290
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,250
it wouldn't be appropriate.

291
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:26,580
What's wrong with that?

292
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:28,940
Well...

293
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:34,490
Why do you think

294
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:36,180
that if others were to see,

295
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,780
it wouldn't be appropriate?

296
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,340
What exactly

297
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,180
is inappropriate about it?

298
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,340
I kindly request you to explain in detail.

299
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:51,100
I am eager to hear the particulars.

300
00:14:58,420 --> 00:14:59,250
It's late.

301
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:02,390
Your Highness,
you should bathe and rest early.

302
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,130
I, too, am

303
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:08,330
tired from today's journey.

304
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:09,840
I'd like to rest early.

305
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:11,110
Alright.

306
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:12,290
Someone come!

307
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:13,580
Prepare water

308
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:15,610
for bathing.

309
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:17,730
Yes.

310
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,300
His Highness didn't specify clearly.

311
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,940
Who are bathing exactly?

312
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,130
Is this water for one person

313
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:28,610
or for two?

314
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:29,990
And what about the tub?

315
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:31,300
Should we prepare one tub

316
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,530
or two tubs?

317
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:34,200
Do you even need to ask?

318
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:35,730
A couple bathing together,

319
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:37,190
who uses two tubs for that?

320
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,250
What are you so surprised about?

321
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:41,220
Didn't you see

322
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:43,530
it was His Highness who suggested it?

323
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:44,940
That's right.

324
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:47,040
How did I not think of that?

325
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:57,060
Tan, after you.

326
00:15:58,530 --> 00:15:59,340
After me?

327
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:03,180
Suxin,

328
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:06,880
you've been a bit too considerate this time.

329
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:12,940
Your Highness just said

330
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:14,940
my wound can't get wet.

331
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:18,950
In that case,

332
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:20,590
I won't stand on ceremony.

333
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,130
This... I...

334
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:26,220
Your Highness, what are you doing?

335
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,130
Didn't you

336
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,030
want me to bathe and rest first?

337
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:31,850
I... I...

338
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,460
Tan, are you

339
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:47,350
planning to watch me bathe?

340
00:16:58,620 --> 00:16:59,700
What's there to see?

341
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,560
You're unable to perform anyway.

342
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:27,820
Standing tall at seven feet,

343
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:30,670
with a face like polished jade,

344
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,240
every move captivating the heart and soul.

345
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:35,530
If he doesn't have any issues in that area,

346
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:37,660
he would truly be perfect in every way.

347
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:52,530
Tan, your face is flushed.

348
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:55,290
Are you feeling unwell?

349
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:00,860
I'm just feeling a bit hot.

350
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:02,340
Tan, don't you want to

351
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:04,140
ask me something?

352
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,330
No, I don't.

353
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:12,090
But I...

354
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:15,980
I have something to say to you.

355
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:20,530
He wants to be frank with me?

356
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:23,330
There's no need to be in such a hurry.

357
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:27,730
What I'm about to say...

358
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:31,420
I ask you to listen carefully to every word

359
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:33,330
and remember it well.

360
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:38,880
Please speak, Your Highness.

361
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:42,420
I am in good health,

362
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,300
and have no hidden ailments.

363
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,520
Although I have not
been close to women in the past,

364
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:57,030
when it comes to marital relations...

365
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:58,530
Everything is normal.

366
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:03,620
Normal.

367
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,980
What's normal?

368
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:13,180
You tell me.

369
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:22,340
So you're saying

370
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,940
my husband is perfectly normal.

371
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:27,770
I'm absolutely

372
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:30,900
normal.

373
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:40,850
How would my husband
know that I know these things?

374
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:42,460
In the future,

375
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:44,620
if you have any more doubts,

376
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:47,330
you can always come and ask me directly.

377
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:49,530
I would be delighted to

378
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:52,890
answer your questions
and clear up any confusion.

379
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,900
After all, chasing rumors

380
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:57,860
and gossiping

381
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:01,330
won't solve your troubles.

382
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:45,460
About the conclusion
of the Marquis of Cheng'en's case,

383
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:47,060
ministers, you still need to

384
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:49,510
work together with one heart and mind.

385
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:52,030
Be sure not to leave any future troubles.

386
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:54,290
I obey Your Majesty's command.

387
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,730
The Ministry of Personnel has submitted

388
00:23:57,730 --> 00:24:00,180
candidates for the next
Governor of the Capital Prefecture.

389
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:01,700
I have reviewed them all.

390
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:05,330
Chancellors,

391
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:08,350
do you have any preferred candidates?

392
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:09,740
Your Majesty,

393
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:11,860
I believe among these candidates,

394
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:13,730
the Marquis of Jiangyang stands out.

395
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:15,980
He is experienced,
mature, and highly respected.

396
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:19,780
He is indeed the best choice
for Governor of the Capital Prefecture.

397
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:20,980
Your Majesty,

398
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:23,140
the Marquis of Jiangyang is selfless
and devoted to public service,

399
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:24,270
upright in conduct,

400
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:25,770
and although he has
lived in Shu for many years,

401
00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:27,770
he still has
a good reputation in the capital.

402
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:28,570
I believe

403
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:30,660
having him preside
over the Capital Prefecture

404
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:32,120
is indeed the best choice.

405
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:34,870
Since both Chancellors agree,

406
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:37,020
let's settle on this decision.

407
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:46,060
Your Majesty,
I have one more matter to report.

408
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:49,090
The Marquis of Jing'an has led
the Yangxi Prefecture for many years,

409
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:51,570
and the Prince of Dingbei
is the commander of the Dingbei Army.

410
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:54,010
Both of them
command significant military forces.

411
00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:55,660
Now that their families
are joining in marriage,

412
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,500
we should be cautious.

413
00:24:57,530 --> 00:25:00,180
I implore Your Majesty to consider
the stability of the empire.

414
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:02,010
Remove the commander of Yangxi Prefecture.

415
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:03,870
Reassign the Marquis of Jing'an.

416
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,700
You all in Changming Hall

417
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,230
are used to verbal battles,

418
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,860
thinking that being a military commander

419
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:13,990
is as casual and easy as giving advice.

420
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,110
You think you can
just replace someone at will?

421
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:17,420
Transferring the military tally

422
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:19,220
may seem like a mere formality,

423
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,400
but I ask you, in the entire court,

424
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,490
who can take on this military tally,

425
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:26,130
stabilize the morale of the army,

426
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:28,890
and keep the ambitious barbarians in check?

427
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:40,180
Your Majesty,

428
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:41,420
actually, after my daughter's

429
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:43,220
wedding with the Prince of Dingbei,

430
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:45,420
I have already considered this matter.

431
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:48,250
I am approaching
the end of my natural lifespan.

432
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:51,140
My energy is failing,
and I suffer from many ailments.

433
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:53,340
I humbly request Your Majesty's mercy.

434
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:56,530
Please allow me
to remain in the capital to recuperate.

435
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:59,010
As for the position
of commander in Yangxi Prefecture,

436
00:25:59,010 --> 00:26:01,090
I would never dare
to cling to this position.

437
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:04,460
I implore Your Majesty
to select another capable individual

438
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:06,520
to entrust with this important task.

439
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:10,680
Lord Ming has governed
Yangxi Prefecture for many years.

440
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,940
Moving him carelessly

441
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:14,650
would indeed be inappropriate.

442
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:17,060
And choosing a new commander

443
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:18,860
should not

444
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:20,940
be done hastily.

445
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:22,940
So

446
00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:26,210
everything will remain as it is for now.

447
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:28,380
When a new commander is appointed,

448
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:31,460
Lord Ming, you can
then hand over the military tally

449
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:33,720
and be reassigned to stay in the capital.

450
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:36,010
I obey Your Majesty's order.

451
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:37,650
Your Majesty,

452
00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:40,660
since Your Majesty has made a decision,

453
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:42,530
regarding the reassignment
of the Marquis of Jing'an,

454
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:44,590
we should also discuss it in advance.

455
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:46,220
In my opinion,

456
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:49,090
the Marquis of Jing'an has guarded
Yangxi Prefecture for many years,

457
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:50,820
with great merit and hard work.

458
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:52,730
This time, during his stay in the capital,

459
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:54,930
his rank should not be lowered too much,

460
00:26:55,010 --> 00:26:57,410
to avoid disheartening the border troops.

461
00:26:57,770 --> 00:26:58,770
Of course.

462
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:00,730
In the twelve departments
of the Privy Council,

463
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:02,530
the Southern and Hedong departments

464
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:03,790
still have vacancies.

465
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:05,010
Why don't we

466
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:07,380
transfer the Marquis of Jing'an
to the Privy Council

467
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:10,780
and appoint him
as the Deputy Envoy of these two departments?

468
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:12,460
This proposal

469
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:14,660
is quite appropriate.

470
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:20,660
I thank Your Majesty
for your great kindness.

471
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:31,380
Sir,

472
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:33,250
on the eve of your wedding,

473
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:34,620
Vice Minister Liu did indeed leave the city.

474
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:36,950
He didn't return until the following day.

475
00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:49,820
As per your instructions, Sir,

476
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:51,140
I have found information on Liu Mo

477
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:52,720
in the records of the Jia Archive.

478
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,380
There are records of his life

479
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,460
only from when he entered the capital

480
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:55,320
at the age of 12.

481
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:57,940
There are only a few brief notes
about his earlier life,

482
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:59,090
merely mentioning
that after his parents passed away,

483
00:27:59,090 --> 00:28:00,550
he drifted to the capital.

484
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:03,450
Keep investigating.

485
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:06,050
No one can completely erase

486
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:07,770
their past.

487
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:08,980
Understood.

488
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:18,630
There's some travel money in here.

489
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:20,180
I heard your mother

490
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:22,140
has been ill these past two days.

491
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:23,250
So I had Suxin

492
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:25,130
add some tonic herbs inside.

493
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:27,550
Me and my mother thank Your Highness.

494
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:29,570
Jiurou,

495
00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:32,610
there's no need
for such formality between us.

496
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:35,090
If it weren't for His Highness
and Your Highness,

497
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:37,890
my mother and I
would surely have no way to survive.

498
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:40,460
Please convey to His Highness on my behalf,

499
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:41,490
thank him

500
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,660
for giving my mother and me

501
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:46,220
a chance at a new life.

502
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:49,070
I will certainly pass on your message.

503
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:52,180
I just don't know

504
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:56,460
if we'll have the chance

505
00:28:57,090 --> 00:28:58,050
to meet again.

506
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:01,180
Your Highness, please rest assured,

507
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:02,460
my mother and I will

508
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:04,050
take good care of ourselves

509
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:05,890
and live peacefully from now on.

510
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:07,360
If I have the opportunity,

511
00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:09,830
I will certainly write to Your Highness.

512
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:11,050
Now,

513
00:29:11,290 --> 00:29:12,090
I don't have many

514
00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:13,690
valuable possessions left.

515
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:15,700
I can only offer this

516
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:18,330
silk handkerchief I embroidered myself
as a gift to Your Highness

517
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:20,130
as a small token of my gratitude.

518
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:26,770
I will cherish

519
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:30,290
this handkerchief dearly.

520
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:33,560
Your Highness,

521
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:35,010
it's getting late.

522
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:37,620
I must take my leave now.

523
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:40,710
Take care, Your Highness.

524
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:02,180
Grandmother, I won't marry! I won't marry!

525
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:03,640
I'd rather die than marry!

526
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:06,270
I'm only thinking of your best interests.

527
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:09,980
If you truly cared for me,

528
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:12,530
how could you let me
become someone's second wife?

529
00:30:12,530 --> 00:30:13,710
Moreover, that Gao Chen

530
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:15,230
is a notorious womanizer

531
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:16,250
and a lecher.

532
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,330
If I marry him,

533
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,700
the rest of my life will be ruined.

534
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:21,660
Silence!

535
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:26,490
Greetings, Empress Dowager.

536
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:28,090
Princess.

537
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:28,860
Uncle.

538
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,490
Please speak up for me.

539
00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:33,940
Grandmother insists that I marry

540
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:35,920
the son of the Marquis of Jiangyang
as his second wife.

541
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,140
As a noble princess,

542
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:40,860
how can I suffer
such humiliation by marrying beneath me?

543
00:30:41,050 --> 00:30:43,310
Moreover, that Gao Chen is not a good man.

544
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:46,980
Princess,

545
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:49,460
this marriage,

546
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:50,940
whether for you

547
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:52,700
or for the Su family,

548
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:54,860
is already the best arrangement.

549
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:01,440
So you've all discussed this already,

550
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:03,490
and I'm the only one kept in the dark.

551
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:06,140
Today, crying and making a scene

552
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:07,290
won't help.

553
00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:10,090
This matter is not for you to decide.

554
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:24,530
His Majesty has already decided.

555
00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:27,730
The Marquis of Jiangyang will succeed
as the Governor of the Capital Prefecture.

556
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:29,660
The marriage
between the Princess and Gao Chen

557
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:31,730
cannot afford any mistakes.

558
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:34,460
I will make arrangements

559
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:36,490
for Nianci and Gao Chen to meet,

560
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:38,660
and I will ensure that they

561
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:41,290
naturally come together.

562
00:31:49,730 --> 00:31:50,460
Tan,

563
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:52,570
why are you still buying

564
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:54,370
so many things for His Highness?

565
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:55,880
He's incapable,

566
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:57,360
yet you don't despise him?

567
00:31:59,170 --> 00:32:00,830
It's all a misunderstanding.

568
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:04,040
His Highness has already
explained everything to me.

569
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:04,750
He

570
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,610
is totally fine.

571
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:09,090
I knew it.

572
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:10,660
It must be a misunderstanding.

573
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:11,620
The misunderstanding has been cleared up.

574
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:12,460
That's excellent.

575
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:13,940
I don't have to worry about you ending up

576
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:15,670
with the wrong person anymore.

577
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,940
Last time when I went back home,

578
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:21,290
I heard from Uncle

579
00:32:21,530 --> 00:32:22,730
that they

580
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:24,180
arranged for many young gentlemen

581
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:25,110
to meet with you.

582
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:28,220
They're in a hurry
to choose a good son-in-law.

583
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:29,900
They can go and choose for themselves.

584
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:31,140
I'm not in a rush to get married.

585
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:32,140
I won't go.

586
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:33,490
How can that be?

587
00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:36,250
Marriage is a serious matter,
how can it be taken lightly?

588
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:38,460
Besides, you must
be satisfied with the choice yourself.

589
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:40,590
Only then can Uncle and Aunt be at ease.

590
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:42,050
Unless

591
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:45,000
you already have someone in mind.

592
00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:47,810
That would be a different story.

593
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:48,770
I...

594
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:51,940
Who has someone in mind?

595
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:53,140
Don't talk nonsense.

596
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:54,770
You don't?

597
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:59,140
There isn't someone in your mind?

598
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:00,010
I'll go.

599
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:01,530
Is it not okay if I go?

600
00:33:02,050 --> 00:33:03,290
Then next time
when meeting potential matches,

601
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:04,490
you'll accompany me.

602
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:06,160
As you wish.

603
00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:09,730
It's still early.

604
00:33:09,810 --> 00:33:11,430
Let's go watch a play.

605
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:13,620
Are there any new plays recently?

606
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:14,460
I'm not sure.

607
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:15,250
According to Zhang Huaiyu,

608
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:16,050
the best seats

609
00:33:16,050 --> 00:33:17,330
at Wentao Pavilion

610
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:18,260
are always mine.

611
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:21,720
Look how pleased you are with yourself.

612
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:25,390
Child, why aren't you
watching where you're going?

613
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:26,580
I'm so sorry.

614
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:28,010
This child hasn't

615
00:33:28,010 --> 00:33:29,290
eaten for several days.

616
00:33:29,290 --> 00:33:30,860
He's so hungry his legs are shaking.

617
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:32,700
He... He didn't mean to.

618
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:34,140
We're really sorry.

619
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,190
Suxin, bring some money.

620
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:39,490
Quickly, quickly.

621
00:33:39,490 --> 00:33:41,290
Kneel down, kneel down quickly.

622
00:33:41,530 --> 00:33:42,460
Thank you, noble lady.

623
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:42,860
Ma'am.

624
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:43,940
Thank you, Miss.

625
00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:46,420
-Thank you.
-Get up.

626
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:47,900
Thank you, noble lady.

627
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,050
Ma'am.

628
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:50,660
Get up, get up first.

629
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:51,570
Noble ladies,

630
00:33:51,570 --> 00:33:53,010
please give me some more money.

631
00:33:53,010 --> 00:33:54,530
I have many uncles and aunts

632
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:56,090
who haven't eaten for a long time either.

633
00:33:56,090 --> 00:33:58,090
We barely managed to make it to the capital.

634
00:33:58,090 --> 00:33:58,940
We really don't want to

635
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:00,290
starve to death here.

636
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:01,400
Get up first.

637
00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:02,340
Be good.

638
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:04,200
Listen to this Miss, get up first.

639
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:06,550
Suxin, bring some more money.

640
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:09,380
Miss, you truly have
the heart of a Bodhisattva.

641
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,130
Thank you so much.

642
00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:11,260
Thank you, Miss.

643
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:12,190
May I ask, Ma'am,

644
00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:13,610
where do you come from?

645
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:16,210
We are refugees from Lizhou.

646
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:17,780
Lizhou?

647
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:18,900
Tan.

648
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:26,130
Please, have mercy.

649
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:27,650
Give us some food, please.

650
00:34:37,449 --> 00:34:39,010
When did the capital

651
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:40,940
get so many refugees?

652
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:41,920
Indeed.

653
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:44,260
When I went out a few days ago,

654
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:45,540
I didn't even notice.

655
00:34:46,659 --> 00:34:48,120
Quickly, go buy some food.

656
00:34:49,050 --> 00:34:49,690
Let's go.

657
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:50,050
Thank you.

658
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:51,900
We'll have food. Let's go.

659
00:34:57,910 --> 00:34:58,690
Be careful.

660
00:35:01,050 --> 00:35:01,820
Careful.

661
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:04,240
Your Highness.

662
00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:10,150
[Harmony and Abundance]

663
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:08,180
What's going on here?

664
00:35:09,130 --> 00:35:09,990
Your Highness,

665
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:11,130
Her Highness instructed us

666
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:11,820
to gather unused items

667
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:12,820
from the mansion

668
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:15,150
and send them to aid the disaster victims.

669
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,520
Please, take it easy.

670
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:40,900
Hold on a little longer.

671
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:43,170
Thank you.

672
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:43,940
Here you go.

673
00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:45,460
Have some water.

674
00:35:47,050 --> 00:35:48,170
Here, take it.

675
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:49,050
Thank you.

676
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:22,620
Your Highness, why are you here?

677
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:24,210
I heard that recently,

678
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:25,620
a large number of refugees
have flooded into the capital.

679
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:26,880
When I learned that...

680
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:29,900
When I learned you were here,

681
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:30,650
I came to see.

682
00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:32,320
There's food now.

683
00:36:32,350 --> 00:36:33,750
They're all from Lizhou.

684
00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:35,130
Make way for the children.

685
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:36,570
Lizhou is suffering from severe flooding,

686
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:38,100
and the people are destitute.

687
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:39,340
The local governor

688
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:40,820
only thinks about deceiving
his superiors and subordinates,

689
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:41,530
covering up the situation.

690
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:42,210
Come, here.

691
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:44,590
They came to the capital

692
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:47,080
to file a complaint against the governor,

693
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,100
seek justice,

694
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:50,390
and beg for a way to survive.

695
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:52,460
Thank you, noble lady.

696
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:53,210
Thank you, noble lady.

697
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:54,210
-Thank you.
-Thank you, My Lord.

698
00:36:54,210 --> 00:36:55,020
Honored nobles,

699
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:56,570
our farms were flooded,

700
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:58,010
our homes were destroyed.

701
00:36:58,010 --> 00:36:59,860
Even all our food is gone.

702
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:01,820
Those officials

703
00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:04,090
not only ignored our plight,

704
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:06,050
but also blocked our escape routes.

705
00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:07,170
We escaped

706
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:08,820
and begged our way here.

707
00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:11,490
We thought we could seek justice,

708
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:13,330
but the capital's government offices

709
00:37:13,330 --> 00:37:15,260
won't even acknowledge us.

710
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:19,170
During the continuous thunderstorms,

711
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:20,380
the Ministry of Works had already reported

712
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:22,040
about the flooding in Lizhou.

713
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:25,420
The Ministry of Revenue
also allocated relief funds.

714
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:27,610
We thought the flood problem was resolved,

715
00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:28,870
but seeing this today,

716
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:32,040
we realize Lizhou is in dire straits.

717
00:37:33,170 --> 00:37:33,980
Sir,

718
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:35,570
are you perhaps an official in the court?

719
00:37:35,570 --> 00:37:37,650
My Lord, please help us!

720
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:39,090
We beg you, honorable official,

721
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:40,570
to uphold justice for us.

722
00:37:42,610 --> 00:37:44,470
If you could speak for us in court,

723
00:37:44,490 --> 00:37:45,560
please

724
00:37:45,690 --> 00:37:47,530
present our grievances.

725
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:50,530
Help us, My Lord.

726
00:37:51,650 --> 00:37:52,980
The flooding in Lizhou

727
00:37:53,650 --> 00:37:55,050
has persisted until now.

728
00:37:56,090 --> 00:37:58,290
It has become a severely affected area.

729
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:00,340
Are all the officials in Lizhou dead?

730
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:02,000
Have you all gone deaf as well?

731
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:06,110
Why is there not
a single word from the court?

732
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:07,060
Your Majesty,

733
00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:09,130
the Ministry of Revenue previously reported

734
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:11,490
that all disaster relief funds
and grain have been distributed.

735
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:13,900
It should have alleviated the urgent needs
of the disaster victims in Lizhou.

736
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:15,610
However, based on what I've seen today,

737
00:38:15,610 --> 00:38:16,610
the Ministry of Revenue

738
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:18,670
seems to have deceived Your Majesty.

739
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:23,820
Your Majesty, please consider this.

740
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:24,460
The entire Ministry of Revenue

741
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:26,210
would never dare to deceive
Your Majesty or act recklessly.

742
00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:26,740
I

743
00:38:27,050 --> 00:38:29,460
only learned of this matter
upon Your Majesty's summons.

744
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:30,520
It seems to be the officials from Lizhou.

745
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:31,860
They intentionally concealed it.

746
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:32,900
But the Ministry of Revenue
failed to notice.

747
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:34,230
We cannot escape blame.

748
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:36,740
I humbly request Your Majesty to punish us.

749
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:39,610
Your Majesty, please calm your anger.

750
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:40,460
In my opinion,

751
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:41,490
the most urgent matter

752
00:38:41,490 --> 00:38:43,170
is to send people
to Lizhou for disaster relief

753
00:38:43,170 --> 00:38:45,260
and save the people from calamity.

754
00:38:47,690 --> 00:38:50,460
All officials in Lizhou,
from top to bottom, failed to report.

755
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:52,790
There must be hidden reasons behind this.

756
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:56,570
If Your Majesty trusts me,

757
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:57,570
my second son...

758
00:38:57,570 --> 00:38:58,090
No.

759
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:00,860
The journey to Lizhou,

760
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:02,340
even if it's by imperial order,

761
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,610
could still face
assassination attempts or ambushes.

762
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:05,940
Jingran doesn't know martial arts.

763
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:08,140
He absolutely cannot risk going there.

764
00:39:10,170 --> 00:39:10,980
Your Majesty,

765
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:12,940
if we hastily dispatch officials,

766
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:14,490
I'm afraid those
unfamiliar with the affairs

767
00:39:14,490 --> 00:39:15,980
may find it hard to take over.

768
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:18,570
Moreover, the disaster-stricken areas
are rife with banditry.

769
00:39:18,570 --> 00:39:20,030
Without military escort,

770
00:39:20,050 --> 00:39:22,460
I fear the funds and supplies
might be compromised en route.

771
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:24,690
Therefore, I believe there is one person

772
00:39:24,690 --> 00:39:27,150
who is the perfect candidate
to go to Lizhou.

773
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:28,210
Who?

774
00:39:29,690 --> 00:39:31,020
The Marquis of Jing'an.

775
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:33,380
The Marquis of Jing'an has returned
to the capital to report on his duties,

776
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:35,010
and he has brought a contingent
of soldiers from Yangxi Prefecture.

777
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:36,090
They are stationed in the capital region.

778
00:39:36,090 --> 00:39:36,980
A few years ago,

779
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:38,530
he was in charge of
disaster relief in Xizhou.

780
00:39:38,530 --> 00:39:40,050
He has considerable
experience in this matter.

781
00:39:40,050 --> 00:39:41,980
I believe
with the Marquis of Jing'an's abilities,

782
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:43,010
he will certainly be able to

783
00:39:43,010 --> 00:39:44,460
successfully transport
the funds and supplies to Lizhou.

784
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:47,690
He will help the people of Lizhou
rebuild the disaster-stricken area.

785
00:39:47,690 --> 00:39:49,340
Although the situation is urgent,

786
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:50,690
the Ministry of Revenue will surely prepare

787
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:51,900
the funds and supplies overnight,

788
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:55,100
to help the Marquis of Jing'an
depart as soon as possible.

789
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:56,940
I suppose that's the only way.

790
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:58,340
Convey my verbal decree.

791
00:39:58,570 --> 00:39:59,740
Grant my golden command token.

792
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:01,340
Order the Marquis of Jing'an

793
00:40:01,490 --> 00:40:02,550
to depart tonight.

794
00:40:03,010 --> 00:40:04,070
Yes, Your Majesty.

795
00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:12,980
Tomorrow,

796
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:15,980
I will bring all the food and supplies

797
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:17,460
from my mansion here.

798
00:40:17,490 --> 00:40:19,020
We'll help as many as we can.

799
00:40:21,170 --> 00:40:23,230
But this is not a long-term solution.

800
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:25,620
Even if we empty our own pockets,

801
00:40:26,010 --> 00:40:27,050
for the refugees,

802
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:29,110
it's still a drop in the bucket.

803
00:40:31,490 --> 00:40:33,490
If we could raise some capital,

804
00:40:33,490 --> 00:40:35,130
start some sustainable businesses,

805
00:40:35,130 --> 00:40:36,260
and then teach the refugees,

806
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:38,320
they could become self-sufficient.

807
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:41,460
But how can we raise the capital?

808
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:43,010
For women,

809
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:44,900
it's usually selling some embroidery.

810
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:45,530
But I...

811
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:47,460
I've only been writing stories.

812
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:49,390
I don't know any needlework at all.

813
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:53,300
Writing stories is an idea!

814
00:40:54,010 --> 00:40:54,980
Think about it,

815
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:56,050
those plays at Wentao Pavilion,

816
00:40:56,050 --> 00:40:57,420
they've been performed for so many years,

817
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:59,090
and people still come to watch every day.

818
00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:00,780
If you can write something different,

819
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:02,050
it will surely stand out

820
00:41:02,050 --> 00:41:03,340
and make a fortune.

821
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:06,780
That's really a good idea.

822
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:07,570
But

823
00:41:07,570 --> 00:41:09,630
how can I write something different?

824
00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:13,530
Since it's about helping refugees,

825
00:41:13,530 --> 00:41:15,530
it's best to use that as the theme.

826
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:17,300
But without

827
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:18,690
some novel and touching

828
00:41:18,690 --> 00:41:19,890
elements of romance,

829
00:41:20,570 --> 00:41:23,130
it's ultimately hard
to keep the audience engaged.

830
00:41:23,130 --> 00:41:24,340
Novel...

831
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:25,740
Romance...

832
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:27,900
Tan,

833
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:29,050
how about

834
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:31,050
I use your story with Jiang Xu

835
00:41:31,050 --> 00:41:32,210
as the basis for a novel,

836
00:41:32,210 --> 00:41:33,870
and polish it into a new story?

837
00:41:36,570 --> 00:41:37,650
I think

838
00:41:38,490 --> 00:41:40,470
this idea is not bad.

839
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:41,820
This way, we can also help His Highness

840
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:43,170
improve his reputation.

841
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:44,780
Then let me provide the story,

842
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:45,570
and you put it to paper.

843
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:46,430
How about that?

844
00:41:46,850 --> 00:41:47,780
No problem.

845
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:52,280
[Prince of Dingbei's Mansion]

846
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:07,050
I heard you're going to write a story

847
00:42:07,050 --> 00:42:08,100
with Miss Bai.

848
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:11,510
How did you know about this?

849
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:14,660
Mr. Fu mentioned it
when I returned to the mansion.

850
00:42:17,010 --> 00:42:20,050
A large number of refugees
suddenly flooded into the capital.

851
00:42:20,050 --> 00:42:22,580
I wonder what the situation
is like in Lizhou.

852
00:42:23,130 --> 00:42:25,300
The noble ladies
are raising funds for charity.

853
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:26,110
Minmin and I

854
00:42:26,130 --> 00:42:27,930
should also do our part.

855
00:42:28,650 --> 00:42:30,650
Besides, I'd like to allocate
some of the profits from Cuojin Pavilion

856
00:42:30,650 --> 00:42:32,460
and Jinxiu Workshop

857
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:33,740
to aid the refugees.

858
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:35,200
I hope you'll approve, Xu.

859
00:42:37,170 --> 00:42:38,370
You're kind-hearted

860
00:42:38,530 --> 00:42:39,780
and considerate of the people.

861
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:41,530
I naturally approve.

862
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:44,010
Thank you, Xu.

863
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:47,950
But before that,

864
00:42:48,090 --> 00:42:49,650
You need to eat properly.

865
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:51,780
If you can't take care of yourself,

866
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:53,170
how can you help others?

867
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:21,110
Your...

868
00:43:33,170 --> 00:43:34,300
His Majesty has appointed my father-in-law

869
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:35,530
to provide disaster relief in Lizhou.

870
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:36,930
He's departing tonight.

871
00:43:37,050 --> 00:43:38,650
I'm going to see him off.

872
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:40,570
Would you like to come along?

873
00:43:45,050 --> 00:43:46,270
Lizhou isn't far.

874
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:48,750
Father should be back soon.

875
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:50,040
I won't go.

876
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:51,030
Suxin,

877
00:43:51,050 --> 00:43:52,450
go fetch the fur knee pads

878
00:43:52,450 --> 00:43:53,710
I bought a few days ago.

879
00:43:54,530 --> 00:43:55,280
Yes.

880
00:43:59,010 --> 00:44:00,870
The flooding in Lizhou is severe.

881
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:03,780
I'm afraid Father's
old leg injury might flare up.

882
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:04,740
Please, Xu,

883
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:06,460
take these knee pads to Father.

884
00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:08,720
Tell Father to take good care of himself.

885
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:11,700
Okay.
