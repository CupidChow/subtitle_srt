There are countless rumors

You can't possibly believe them all, can you?

It's true that my niece from my maternal family

are just baseless rumors.

If you're still uneasy,

I give you my word here and now:

00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:05,800
but Miss Ming is clever and cunning,

174
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:07,540
skilled in social maneuvering

175
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,050
with formidable finesse.

176
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:10,930
These scholarly types

177
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:12,680
couldn't possibly keep her in check.

178
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:15,340
What about descendants of military officials?

179
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:19,420
Does the other registry have better candidates?

180
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:24,230
This is Her Majesty's curated list

181
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:25,360
of noble daughters.

182
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:28,090
It's for you to choose a consort.

183
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,370
The Ming family's marriage is urgent,

184
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:33,590
and yours is no less pressing.

185
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:35,870
I'm not forcing you to marry,

186
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:37,520
but if you delay any longer,

187
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:39,360
the Empress Dowager will surely

188
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:41,059
arrange a match between you and Fengzhao.

189
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:44,200
The Su family has no authority over my decisions.

190
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:46,100
You and Marquis of Jing'an

191
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,630
both command heavy armies.

192
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:51,830
Do you truly think the Su family would let such opportunities slip?

193
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,260
I'll marry

194
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:57,740
Miss Ming.

195
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:01,020
What?

196
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,660
I'll marry her.

197
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,400
It is indeed a win-win solution

198
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:14,440
and the best choice.

199
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:17,390
Xu,

200
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,600
do you fancy Miss Ming?

201
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:27,730
It's not about fancying or not.

202
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:28,810
Then why...

203
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:32,190
If not me to bear this for the country, then who?

204
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,200
I will marry

205
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:01,860
Miss Ming.

206
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:31,450
[Gardening House]

207
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:48,540
Chancellor.

208
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:55,580
[Vice Minister of Revenue, Liu Mo]

209
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,560
the confiscation of Duke of Ling's Mansion

210
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,440
is complete.

211
00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:58,520
All sensitive records uncovered

212
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,970
during the investigation

213
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:01,520
have been thoroughly altered

214
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,870
and reclassified under neutral categories,

215
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:05,870
ensuring no further implications for other parties.

216
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,990
Liang Qiwei's entire family was exiled three thousand li.

217
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:12,590
The Emperor sparing his life

218
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:14,790
was mercy enough.

219
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:18,010
The hijacked military supplies case is closed,

220
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,480
but Prince of Dingbei has sworn to

221
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,650
uncover who intercepted his convoy to the capital

222
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:22,710
and to fully investigate years of

223
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:24,310
embezzled army provisions.

224
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:27,470
Prince of Dingbei always keeps his word.

225
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:28,600
He will never relent

226
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,850
until his goal is achieved.

227
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:35,100
That Sheriff Wu is one of Gu Jinzhong's men.

228
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,040
No matter how much he denies it,

229
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,240
suspicion will inevitably fall on him.

230
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:41,690
Find a discreet opportunity to warn him.

231
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:43,690
Liang Qiwei's fate should serve as

232
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:45,410
a stark lesson.

233
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:47,320
Those messy accounts of his

234
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,780
must be thoroughly cleaned up.

235
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:50,850
Leave no handles for others to grab.

236
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:52,030
Yes.

237
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:54,570
As for Gu Jinzhong's past embezzlement records,

238
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:56,980
I have long covered the gaps and smoothed them over.

239
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:59,640
Even Prince of Dingbei won't uncover anything.

240
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:02,390
Just as you predicted,

241
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,440
the families less entangled with

242
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,630
Duke of Ling's faction

243
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:06,390
are scrambling to cut ties.

244
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:07,860
These past two days,

245
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,430
the Empress Dowager even summoned Chancellor Su

246
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:11,030
for prolonged discussions.

247
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:14,450
Keep close watch on

248
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:16,100
what paths those families are taking.

249
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:16,900
Yes.

250
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:20,290
Is there anything unusual at Marquis of Jing'an's Mansion?

251
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:21,420
All appears normal.

252
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,480
Recently,

253
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,400
many calling cards have been delivered there.

254
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,280
However,

255
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:27,430
Marquis of Jing'an seems to dislike such formalities.

256
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:29,290
He hasn't received any visitors.

257
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,940
However, today Chancellor Su and his wife

258
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:34,030
paid a visit and had a rather lively gathering with Marquis of Jing'an and his daughter.

259
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:35,500
The two families seemed quite cordial

260
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,540
upon meeting.

261
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:43,110
Regarding the matter of Marquis of Jing'an,

262
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:45,820
Chancellor Su will undoubtedly pursue it relentlessly.

263
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:47,230
His visit

264
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:50,310
was undoubtedly about arranging a marriage alliance.

265
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,290
This is truly unexpected.

266
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,310
Fortunately, we withdrew from the betrothal in time

267
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:02,150
to avoid a scandal.

268
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:03,950
Tan is exceptional in

269
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:05,120
both beauty and virtue.

270
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,880
In time, she'll surely find

271
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:08,430
a perfectly suited match.

272
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:10,940
Wait,

273
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,600
your previous letters sang praises!

274
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:15,530
You said that generations of the Liang family are scholars,

275
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:16,610
noble and refined;

276
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,600
Liang Zixuan's

277
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:19,020
literary brilliance

278
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:19,970
and boundless prospects—

279
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:20,750
what happened to all that?

280
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,110
It was all pretense.

281
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:24,260
Your judgment as her godfather

282
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:25,900
is truly lacking.

283
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:26,280
I...

284
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:27,810
Do you even know about the Lantern Festival...

285
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:28,570
Father,

286
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,500
I'm fine now.

287
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:32,710
Let's leave the past in the past.

288
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:34,260
Moreover,

289
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:37,020
during all those years you were away from the capital,

290
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:38,510
it was Godfather and Godmother

291
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:40,030
who cared for me.

292
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:42,000
This time, Godfather

293
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:43,870
was simply deceived by the Liang family.

294
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:44,510
He?

295
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:46,690
Godfather, please don't take it to heart.

296
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:48,250
Father just worries too much,

297
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:49,430
speaking a bit impulsively.

298
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:50,590
Do you think

299
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,440
I don't know how he is?

300
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:54,110
Would I stoop to his level?

301
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:56,860
You're just too considerate.

302
00:13:56,890 --> 00:13:57,500
Had you told me earlier

303
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,800
about that "accidental drowning" incident,

304
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,860
I'd have skinned Liang Zixuan alive.

305
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:03,150
That's easy for you to say.

306
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:04,850
Where were you when it mattered?

307
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:06,350
Quite the expert in hindsight, aren't you?

308
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:07,190
Father!

309
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,600
Today the kitchen

310
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,460
prepared special Yangzhou dishes.

311
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:14,320
Godfather, Godmother, please enjoy them while they're hot.

312
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:14,960
Alright.

313
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:17,710
I personally made

314
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:19,210
this pigeon soup.

315
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:20,150
Okay.

316
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:20,700
Come on.

317
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:25,600
I picked up my bowl first.

318
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:27,720
Everyone saw that I raised it first.

319
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,080
I was the first to raise it.

320
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:29,910
How could you... You...

321
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,270
She's my daughter.

322
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,680
Tan is my daughter too.

323
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:35,530
How can you be so unreasonable?

324
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,580
When have you ever been reasonable?

325
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:39,140
Let's settle this outside!

326
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,020
Look how capable he thinks he is.

327
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:42,680
You're a military officer, I'm a civil official.

328
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,630
I won't fall for your tricks.

329
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,350
You just don't dare.

330
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:48,850
Tan is thoughtful enough

331
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,950
to know I've been suffering from palpitations.

332
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:52,810
Pigeon soup is just what I needed.

333
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:56,430
Be careful, it's hot.

334
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:57,440
Good girl.

335
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:03,330
Tan,

336
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:05,610
in a few days, your godfather will go to the palace

337
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:07,410
to ask the Empress Dowager to help

338
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:09,360
find some good matches among the noble families.

339
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,900
I'll accompany you to meet them properly.

340
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,570
Thank you for your care, Godfather, Godmother.

341
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:15,290
But

342
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,040
I've decided to retreat to Hanyan Temple

343
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,000
for 49 days of prayer—

344
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:21,390
to calm my mind and reflect.

345
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:22,740
-Good.
-Good.

346
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:26,130
You speak.

347
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:27,660
Tan, even though

348
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,190
your engagement was called off,

349
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:30,340
staying in the capital

350
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:31,900
will only invite gossip.

351
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:35,760
You're leaving to avoid the gossip—seeking some peace and quiet.

352
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,130
Marquis of Jing'an's Mansion has prepared five carriages

353
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:47,250
to take Miss Ming

354
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:48,540
to Hanyan Temple to pray.

355
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:49,380
Five?

356
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,200
I have checked.

357
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:52,560
Every carriage is filled with

358
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,210
her clothes, shoes,

359
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,270
jewelry, hairpins,

360
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:56,840
bed curtains, incense burners,

361
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,680
and full tea sets.

362
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:07,790
She plans to settle in at Hanyan Temple—

363
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:10,060
a dramatic display of chaste defiance?

364
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,390
My Lady,

365
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:15,410
His Lordship said he'd see you off tomorrow morning.

366
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:17,610
Why are you leaving tonight?

367
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:19,660
If we leave tomorrow,

368
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:20,920
that one at Yiyun House

369
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,880
will surely seize the chance to mock and humiliate me.

370
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,320
Rather than suffer that,

371
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:26,260
I'd rather leave now.

372
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:27,710
That makes sense.

373
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:33,980
[Hanyan Temple]

374
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:48,660
[Monk Zhiyu of Hanyan Temple]

375
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,560
I, Zhiyu,

376
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,890
greet the benefactors.

377
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,280
For monastic devotion,

378
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:59,810
only essential belongings are needed.

379
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,400
These are my essentials.

380
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:07,140
Honored benefactors,

381
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:08,780
during your retreat,

382
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:09,770
you may seek me

383
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:11,510
for any needs.

384
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:17,430
What is this?

385
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:19,280
All short-term guests

386
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:20,829
must wear these garments.

387
00:17:20,849 --> 00:17:22,560
Don't worry.

388
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:24,619
They're freshly laundered.

389
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,770
You must be tired from the journey.

390
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:28,250
Do rest.

391
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:30,190
I won't disturb you further.

392
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:39,780
This isn't about cleanliness at all.

393
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:40,790
Look,

394
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,530
broad shoulders, long sleeves,

395
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:47,930
no shape at the waist,

396
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:49,970
and the color, the fabric..

397
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:52,910
Even the third-rank maids in our household

398
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:54,920
dress better than this.

399
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,140
How is my lady supposed to wear this?

400
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:59,010
If it weren't for that Zhu'er,

401
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:01,140
you wouldn't have to suffer like this.

402
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:02,970
Enough, enough.

403
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:06,850
Everyone knows that life in the monastery is austere.

404
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:08,200
Besides, it was my own choice

405
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,680
to come here.

406
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:11,170
Who else is there to blame?

407
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,800
If anything, blame

408
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:16,190
my own poor luck,

409
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,670
always running into Jiang Xu.

410
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,310
Come to think of it,

411
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:22,200
every time things go wrong lately,

412
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,620
it somehow involves him.

413
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:26,220
Last time we ran into danger at Hanyan Temple,

414
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:27,830
it was because of him.

415
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,600
And those times we were so close to

416
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,410
getting the evidence,

417
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:34,730
he ruined that too.

418
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:38,220
My Lady,

419
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:41,090
could it be you've offended a petty villain?

420
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:42,490
That makes sense.

421
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,500
We'll dine here.

422
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:58,390
We'll keep watch outside.

423
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,460
Once you're done, we'll come back in.

424
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:02,760
The dining hall makes no distinction—

425
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,280
all eat together.

426
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,620
Rules are rules.

427
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:06,650
You eat first.

428
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:08,220
Lyu'e and I aren't hungry yet.

429
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:09,170
Have a seat.

430
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,160
Thank you.

431
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:22,890
It's said that the vegetarian meals at Hanyan Temple

432
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:24,250
are exceptionally delicious.

433
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:27,260
That's why I chose this retreat.

434
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:29,150
Try it!

435
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:36,430
How is it?

436
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,600
My Lady,

437
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,600
I think those rumors are misguided.

438
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:46,540
This taste bears

439
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:47,700
little resemblance

440
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:50,090
to exceptionally delicious.

441
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:52,210
My Lady, there are plenty of local farms nearby

442
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:53,560
with fresh fish and vegetables.

443
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,240
Shall I

444
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,890
prepare something else for you instead?

445
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:57,550
No, how can it be called a proper retreat

446
00:19:57,550 --> 00:19:59,140
if we indulge in special meals?

447
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:00,210
Though this temple meal

448
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:01,790
may not compare to our home chefs' meals,

449
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:03,630
the presentation is quite lovely.

450
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:04,900
The greens glisten with oil,

451
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:07,030
and the rice has a delicate fragrance.

452
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,730
The Buddhist path

453
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,740
is profound in its wisdom.

454
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:23,020
Perhaps this simple, unadorned meal

455
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:25,360
is meant to remind us of hardship and gratitude—

456
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,820
to never forget our roots.

457
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,560
Since we're here, we might as well embrace it.

458
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,400
Let's treat this as part of our enlightenment.

459
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:40,470
But if it's truly unpalatable,

460
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:43,490
don't force yourself.

461
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,560
Amitabha.

462
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:51,420
Benefactor,

463
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:53,850
you must not waste any food during the meal.

464
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:57,520
Miss Ming is...

465
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:59,570
You two have disrupted the temple's peace

466
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:00,890
with your chatter.

467
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,060
As a small lesson,

468
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:05,640
please stay and clean the dining hall.

469
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:08,920
Young monk,

470
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,520
I have a small appetite.

471
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:15,270
May I skip this meal?

472
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:16,250
Then

473
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:19,340
you may reflect in the side chapel.

474
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,200
Punished for how I eat.

475
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:32,720
Where did I go wrong?

476
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:41,060
With so many chapels,

477
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:42,240
which one did

478
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,700
the young monk refer to?

479
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:46,230
But reflection is about sincerity.

480
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:48,250
Surely any of them would suffice?

481
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,880
I didn't expect you to remember this place.

482
00:21:57,170 --> 00:21:58,240
This was where Your Majesty and I

483
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,690
used to steal moments of leisure in our youth.

484
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:01,350
I certainly wouldn't forget.

485
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:04,520
After enduring twenty lashes from the military baton,

486
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,850
you should at least pretend for a few days.

487
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:08,400
How come you so swiftly and decisively

488
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,080
dealt with Liang Qiwei?

489
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,560
I am not skilled at acting.

490
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,430
Liang Qiwei was merely the beginning.

491
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:14,430
With your aid,

492
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,520
I'll purge corruption

493
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:18,760
and restore order to the court.

494
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,710
This time I returned to the capital

495
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:22,440
only to reclaim the army's pay.

496
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:24,090
I have no intention of

497
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,570
getting involved in court affairs.

498
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:27,570
But now that you've stepped onto the board,

499
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:28,740
you must see the game through

500
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:29,580
with me.

501
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:30,600
How can you throw down your pieces

502
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,000
just as the match begins?

503
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:34,840
I have sat the throne for nearly ten years,

504
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,280
yet the Su family's influence

505
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,340
still pervades both court and harem.

506
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:40,240
Their ambition is boundless,

507
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,800
their greed insatiable.

508
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,320
It is nothing more than a disunited rabble

509
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,180
with a hollow facade of strength.

510
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:48,850
The only one who has ever truly held sway over Your Majesty

511
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:50,570
is Chancellor Su.

512
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,720
What I want is simple:

513
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:55,740
a court that is clean,

514
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:57,220
with power in balance.

515
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:04,930
This case of embezzled military funds runs deep, involving many.

516
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:06,530
If we can uproot it entirely,

517
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:09,070
your will shall be fulfilled.

518
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:10,700
However,

519
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,760
if we pursue this matter the way I intend,

520
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,170
I fear that your imperial desk

521
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:16,500
will soon be buried beneath

522
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,960
memorials impeaching me.

523
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,760
Today, I grant you

524
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,630
the power to act first and report later.

525
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:22,420
No matter how great the trouble you stir up

526
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:24,080
in the future,

527
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,860
I shall bear it for you.

528
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,460
In observing this situation,

529
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:34,460
I have come to understand one truth:

530
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,810
the way of the sovereign is to remain uninvolved;

531
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:40,210
the way of the minister is to take action.

532
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:45,910
The one who truly knows me

533
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:47,490
is you, Xu.

534
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:54,630
Buddha above,

535
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:57,530
I, Tan of the Ming family, offer this prayer.

536
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:00,820
I'm accustomed to fine fare

537
00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:02,780
and modest portions in daily life.

538
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:05,320
Today, upon partaking in the temple's vegetarian meal,

539
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,920
I found myself unaccustomed

540
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,360
and, regrettably, left food uneaten.

541
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:11,720
May the Buddha forgive this waste

542
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:13,880
and spare me from karmic retribution.

543
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:18,260
Buddha above,

544
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:20,310
beyond this repentance,

545
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:23,200
I have another sincere prayer:

546
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,400
This broken engagement

547
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,920
was due to my betrothed's unworthy character,

548
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,320
making him unfit as a spouse.

549
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:31,200
Now that this matter is settled and I return to the capital,

550
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,720
I pray the Buddha grants me

551
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:34,830
a suitable husband—

552
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:36,770
one of equal family standing,

553
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:39,530
with no need for royal or noble lineage,

554
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,810
aristocracy, or scholarly elites.

555
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,300
What I truly value is talent and comeliness.

556
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:45,590
In terms of talent,

557
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:47,690
one who can rank among the top scholars in the imperial examinations would suffice.

558
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:49,040
As for appearance, he must be undeniably handsome—

559
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:51,200
only then would he be a worthy match for me.

560
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,040
Of course,

561
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:53,990
ample wealth would be ideal,

562
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:56,660
ensuring our married life

563
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,340
is comfortable and carefree.

564
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,050
But even without the fortune of a marquis' household,

565
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:02,430
he must at least provide me

566
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:04,590
with bird's nest porridge whenever I desire,

567
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:06,190
afford seasonal wardrobes

568
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:08,060
from Jinxiu Workshop,

569
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:10,040
and ensure I can acquire the latest jewelry

570
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,650
as soon as it releases.

571
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:13,460
I also pray that my future mother-in-law

572
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:15,310
be kind and amiable—

573
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:17,370
one who does not burden me with endless rules

574
00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:18,640
and nitpicking.

575
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:21,850
As for family ties, the simpler the better.

576
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,120
Above all, there must be no childhood sweethearts

577
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:27,120
or overly intimate cousin-sisters lingering about.

578
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:29,880
In stature, may he stand over

579
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:31,030
seven feet tall,

580
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,280
robust and vigorous.

581
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,280
If he practices martial arts,

582
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,480
may it be the sword—

583
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,650
his movements graceful and refined—

584
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:39,730
so that

585
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,200
when he wields his blade,

586
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:44,310
I may accompany him with the zither, creating a scene of perfect harmony.

587
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:45,640
These are my humble requests.

588
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,370
May the Buddha grant my wishes.

589
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:51,400
This humble devotee

590
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:54,420
is the first-born daughter of the Marquis of Jing'an.

591
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:56,580
I fear my lengthy prattle

592
00:25:57,230 --> 00:25:58,640
may have wearied your divine ears.

593
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,060
Perhaps I failed to make my wishes clear.

594
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:03,080
Tomorrow, I shall return

595
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,020
and transcribe these marital criteria

596
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:06,180
on paper,

597
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:07,970
burning it as an offering before your altar.

598
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:09,090
Should you grant me

599
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,100
such an ideal husband,

600
00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:13,510
I vow to gild your sacred statue anew

601
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:16,130
and keep your incense burning for ages untold.

602
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,820
This girl

603
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:19,850
is truly beyond cure.

604
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:23,700
Her standards for a spouse

605
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:25,100
are absurdly high.

606
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,400
Where in this vast world

607
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,320
could one find

608
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,050
such a flawlessly perfect man?

609
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:30,230
As predicted,

610
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:32,160
this girl

611
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:34,950
would indeed

612
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,020
overpower the sons of scholarly officials.

613
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:38,950
Fortunately, you've taken her in.

614
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:42,170
That was not what I meant.

615
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:43,770
My thoughts align precisely

616
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:44,980
with Your Majesty's.

617
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:52,310
I shall seek your counsel another day.

618
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:54,930
Why have you stopped playing?

619
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:57,110
The winner has yet to be decided.

620
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:04,550
Though Sheriff Wu was silenced

621
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:05,950
before he could confess,

622
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:07,920
his ties to the Marquis of Cheng'en

623
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,160
are indisputable.

624
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:12,420
As you previously ordered surveillance on the Gu family,

625
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:13,990
we've uncovered something suspicious.

626
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:15,770
Gu Jinzhong's son, Gu Wenyan,

627
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:17,950
is most certainly involved.

628
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:20,480
Does Gu Jinzhong

629
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,360
have only this one son?

630
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:23,790
Yes.

631
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:25,750
The young man is notoriously extravagant

632
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:26,680
and idle,

633
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,610
utterly lacking in scholarly merit.

634
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:31,220
Yet somehow, he not only entered the Imperial Examinations,

635
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:32,100
but secured

636
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:33,260
fourth place in the second-tier rankings.

637
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:35,140
Recently, he's been flaunting his success everywhere,

638
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:36,360
drawing flocks of sycophantic scholars

639
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,560
eager to curry favor.

640
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:46,080
Send Shen Yu to deal with this young man.

641
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,280
He

642
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:49,450
is escorting Zhu'er and her child back to their hometown under orders.

643
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:50,690
A message this morning stated

644
00:27:50,690 --> 00:27:53,180
he won't return to the city until late tonight.

645
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:55,000
Zhu'er's hometown isn't far from the capital.

646
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,080
A lone rider could make the round trip

647
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,120
in two days at most.

648
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,980
Why would he only return tonight?

649
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:00,740
I don't know.

650
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:01,640
Tan!

651
00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:03,810
Shen Yu?

652
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:05,670
What brings you here?

653
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:07,620
I was passing through the teahouse

654
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:09,940
[Vice General of the Dingbei Army, Shen Yu]

655
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:09,120
on my way back to the capital

656
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,000
when I heard

657
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,720
you'd broken off the engagement with the Liang family

658
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,360
and come to Hanyan Temple to avoid gossip.

659
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,690
So I came straight away.

660
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:17,130
You went out of your way to find me;

661
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:18,660
is there something urgent?

662
00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:22,510
I came to tell you that

663
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:25,520
I've admired you for a long time.

664
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:27,040
Before,

665
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,720
you were betrothed to the Liang family,

666
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,420
and our statuses differed.

667
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,750
But now that you're free,

668
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:33,070
and finding another match may take time.

669
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:34,260
Why not marry me instead?

670
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:35,470
After the great victory in Dongzhou,

671
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:36,600
His Highness has petitioned

672
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,720
for my promotion to Fourth-Rank Valiant General.

673
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,320
Though there's still a gap

674
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,340
between my status and yours as the primary daughter of a marquis' household,

675
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:43,290
I swear to earn more military merits in the future—

676
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:45,820
enough to secure a noble title for you as well.

677
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:49,190
Young General Shen

678
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,580
is renowned for his battlefield prowess

679
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,840
and integrity—

680
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,560
a perfect match for the Miss Ming...

681
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:01,990
Shen Yu, do you even realize what you're saying

682
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,250
and what you're doing?

683
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,400
I...

684
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,020
I‘m proposing marriage to you.

685
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,570
You're not here to propose,

686
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:09,600
but you're here

687
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,640
to ruin me.

688
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,720
A proper proposal requires parental approval

689
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,640
and a matchmaker's words.

690
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,560
These rules you should know.

691
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,510
If I were to accept

692
00:29:17,530 --> 00:29:18,630
your words and gifts today,

693
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:19,750
at best,

694
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:21,920
it might be called a mutual affection, a meeting of hearts.

695
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,010
At worst?

696
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:25,580
An illicit exchange,

697
00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:27,050
a shameless scandal.

698
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,480
Tan, I...

699
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,720
Since you know I came to the temple

700
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,800
to avoid gossip,

701
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:32,350
you'd know

702
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:33,480
my every word and step

703
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,020
must be measured as if treading on thin ice.

704
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:37,150
Had you even an ounce of respect for me,

705
00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:38,810
you would never have recklessly

706
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:40,340
bared your heart like this.

707
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:42,470
Foolish man.

708
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:44,960
I was reckless.

709
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:47,010
-But I…
-Since you know it's reckless,

710
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:48,430
please leave immediately.

711
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:50,890
Today, we never met

712
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,640
and no proposal

713
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:53,750
was ever spoken.

714
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:57,440
Shen Yu, I have no feeling for you.

715
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,440
I will never marry you.

716
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,720
Abandon this delusion.

717
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,410
My Lady!

718
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:08,450
My Lady, why are you here?

719
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,640
We searched the prayer hall three times,

720
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,280
but couldn't find you.

721
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:12,700
You gave us such a fright!

722
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,640
Young Master?

723
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:18,820
Let's return to my quarters to transcribe sutras.

724
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:25,420
Tell him to return to camp and come see me immediately.

725
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:26,180
Yes!

726
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:38,560
[Lilies of the River and Fragrant Angelicas of the Marsh]

727
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:40,880
Chuchu,

728
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,490
where are you going?

729
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,720
I'm going to practice my whip.

730
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:44,480
Might even challenge Father

731
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,680
to a spar later.

732
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,080
How can a young lady

733
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,910
spend her days swinging swords and whips?

734
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:51,150
How do you expect to secure a marriage match like this?

735
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:52,280
You may not have the delicate grace

736
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:54,000
of those noble maidens,

737
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:55,560
but my daughter has her own brilliance—

738
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,780
a face like blooming peonies and a spirit fiercer than spring wind.

739
00:30:57,780 --> 00:31:00,020
You're one of a kind in the capital!

740
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:02,220
I've told your father

741
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:03,410
to start vetting

742
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:04,710
worthy suitors.

743
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,590
But you must learn some decorum.

744
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:08,720
Start acting like a proper young lady.

745
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:10,120
With Ming Tan's broken engagement

746
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,450
causing such a scandal,

747
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:12,450
who would dare

748
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,550
arrange a marriage with our household now?

749
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:14,960
You...

750
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:16,760
My Lady.

751
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:21,230
Seriously?

752
00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:24,880
Where are you going now?

753
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,680
I haven't finished talking yet.

754
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:31,100
Shen Yu!

755
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,320
When we were children, Ming Tan and I

756
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,580
often played with you.

757
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:41,990
Have you forgotten?

758
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:44,360
Oh, it's Cousin Ming Chu.

759
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:45,840
Why are you still as stiff as the day

760
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,160
you first arrived at

761
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:48,100
our estate?

762
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,500
I'm not some vengeful spirit.

763
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:52,100
What are you recoiling from?

764
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:54,870
You're here to see Ming Tan, aren't you?

765
00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:55,740
It's a pity though.

766
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:56,890
She's just retreated to the temple

767
00:31:56,890 --> 00:31:58,480
after breaking off her engagement.

768
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,230
I came to pay respects to His Lordship.

769
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:02,100
He took me in years ago

770
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:04,240
and recommended me to the Dingbei Army.

771
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,780
Now that he's returned to the capital,

772
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:07,440
it's only proper that I visit.

773
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:09,890
Why the pretense?

774
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:12,140
Even when we played together as children,

775
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:13,140
I knew

776
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,950
you adored Ming Tan.

777
00:32:15,290 --> 00:32:16,910
Now that she's free of her betrothal,

778
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:17,770
isn't this your

779
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,330
perfect chance to confess?

780
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:22,130
Mind your words.

781
00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:24,170
It's just affection.

782
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:24,960
It's

783
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:26,530
no disgrace.

784
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,440
With your military merits

785
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:29,590
at such a young age

786
00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:31,810
and the favor of the Prince of Dingbei,

787
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,310
you'd actually make a fine match for Tan.

788
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,970
She has no

789
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,660
such inclination toward me.

790
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:48,470
When a maiden says "I don't like it" or "I'm unwilling,"

791
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:50,310
it's often mere coyness.

792
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:51,580
Besides,

793
00:32:51,610 --> 00:32:52,850
true affection

794
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:53,950
takes time to grow.

795
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:54,720
How could there be mutual love

796
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,240
at first sight?

797
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:58,320
If you're truly serious about

798
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,800
marrying Tan,

799
00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:02,570
why not speak to the Prince of Dingbei?

800
00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:04,370
He cares deeply for his subordinates.

801
00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:08,730
He would surely petition the Emperor for an imperial marriage decree on your behalf.

802
00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:11,140
Shen Yu, think carefully,

803
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,060
don't wait until the pearl falls into another's hands

804
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:14,630
to regret your inaction.

805
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:32,290
Your Highness,

806
00:33:32,290 --> 00:33:33,600
I have properly settled

807
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,800
Zhu'er and her child.

808
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:37,030
All the silver Liang Qiwei hid through her father

809
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:39,090
has been recovered and brought back.

810
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:48,550
Liang Qiwei has reaped what he sowed

811
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:49,840
for his corruption and abuse of power.

812
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,160
Tan nearly

813
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:52,900
married into the Liang family.

814
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,590
Thanks to Your Highness' decisive actions,

815
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:56,250
she was spared this calamity.

816
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:02,620
I delayed the return

817
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,880
while inventorying the confiscated assets.

818
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,250
It was my failure to complete the task efficiently.

819
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:07,310
I request Your Highness to punish me.

820
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:12,239
Go sweep the training grounds clean.

821
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:13,860
Then shovel all the manure

822
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:14,750
from the stables.

823
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:15,389
Yes!

824
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:18,480
Come back.

825
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,500
The Marquis of Cheng'en has a son

826
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:22,500
named Gu Wenyan.

827
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:24,870
Send someone to keep a close eye on him.

828
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:25,840
Yes!

829
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:28,880
Then,

830
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:30,639
the horse manure...

831
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:32,380
Go after you've finished cleaning it.

832
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:32,960
Yes!

833
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:44,929
Your Highness,

834
00:34:45,610 --> 00:34:46,570
if one day

835
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:48,090
I have someone I love,

836
00:34:48,489 --> 00:34:49,770
would Your Highness

837
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,659
request a marriage decree for me?

838
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:55,710
As long as it's not the fourth young lady of the Ming family,

839
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:56,840
for any other woman,

840
00:34:56,969 --> 00:34:59,010
I can try my best for you.

841
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:02,910
Why?

842
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:05,290
I don't need subordinates

843
00:35:05,290 --> 00:35:07,280
who are constantly preoccupied with personal affairs.

844
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,630
I have never...

845
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:10,210
You lied to me

846
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,020
just because you wanted to see her.

847
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:13,040
Given time,

848
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,040
how do I know you won't

849
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:17,040
draw your sword against me because of her?

850
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:17,600
I...

851
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,040
Go!

852
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,610
Starting from today, clean horse manure

853
00:35:19,610 --> 00:35:20,640
for a month.

854
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,530
Yes, Your Highness.

855
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:46,400
I pay my respects to the Empress Dowager.

856
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:52,580
[All blessings arrive in full measure]

857
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:49,780
Elder Brother, you come to the palace at dawn.

858
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:50,880
Could it be for

859
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,810
that Miss Ming's marriage matter?

860
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:54,570
In recent years,

861
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:56,370
the Su family's businesses

862
00:35:56,370 --> 00:35:57,520
and connections across the realm

863
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,480
have been quietly

864
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,860
eroded.

865
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,420
We lack reliable allies in the military,

866
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:06,080
[Empress Dowager, Su Xvjin]

867
00:36:02,810 --> 00:36:04,040
and without intervention,

868
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:06,920
our influence at court will wane further.

869
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:09,980
When I adopted Ming Tan as my goddaughter years ago,

870
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:12,380
it was all planned for this day.

871
00:36:12,450 --> 00:36:14,790
Since your last visit,

872
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:17,820
I've been carefully considering candidates.

873
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:19,530
A single nod from you,

874
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:22,650
and I'll draft the imperial marriage decree at once.

875
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:24,280
As for the Prince of Dingbei,

876
00:36:24,690 --> 00:36:26,740
long before his departure for the northern territories,

877
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:30,660
I had considered betrothing Nianci to him.

878
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:35,030
Now is the time.

879
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:38,490
It would be great if the Princess could marry him,

880
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:40,530
but given her temperament..

881
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:42,520
The bigger picture is more important.

882
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,980
She doesn't have a choice.

883
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,500
Yes, with the Empress Dowager's decree for marriage,

884
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:49,010
even if the Prince of Dingbei is unwilling,

885
00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:51,100
he wouldn't dare to defy the imperial order.

886
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:53,120
But the imperial decree must be issued swiftly,

887
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,040
before the Emperor intervenes.

888
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:58,400
Especially regarding the Ming family's marriage affairs.

889
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:02,150
As for the Liang family, not a single member was spared.

890
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:04,360
They were sent into exile days ago.

891
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:05,560
We've finally

892
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:06,760
settled that score.

893
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:08,390
I've also heard that

894
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:09,640
this time it was the Prince of Dingbei

895
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:10,940
who personally uncovered the embezzled funds,

896
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:12,540
which led to the Liang family's downfall.

897
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:13,740
In my opinion,

898
00:37:13,950 --> 00:37:15,080
he doesn't seem as worthless

899
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,520
as you claimed—

900
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:18,940
at least he's both brave and resourceful.

901
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,160
Tan, you've been craving

902
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,520
these pastries for days.

903
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,680
How can you not eat them now?

904
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:28,160
I think you're right.

905
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,050
Godfather and Father

906
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,640
will certainly arrange another marriage for me.

907
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,000
With Liang Zixuan gone,

908
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,700
there'll be someone else.

909
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:37,640
A woman must marry.

910
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:38,800
Sooner or later you'll have to choose someone.

911
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:39,560
Unless

912
00:37:39,870 --> 00:37:41,940
I can select a husband

913
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:43,440
before they intervene.

914
00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:47,470
Have you taken a liking to some young master?

915
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,560
We daughters of inner chambers,

916
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,400
without parental permission,

917
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:54,050
when would we ever have the chance to meet eligible men,

918
00:37:54,050 --> 00:37:56,050
let alone carefully evaluate them?

919
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,260
If opportunity won't come to us,

920
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:00,450
we'll go find it ourselves.

921
00:38:00,450 --> 00:38:02,210
Second Young Master Shu placed third in the imperial exams.

922
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:03,430
Tomorrow he'll parade through the streets on horseback.

923
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:04,540
I've already scouted locations.

924
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:06,560
The Wentao Pavilion is the prime vantage point,

925
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,340
though we'll need to arrive at dawn to secure seats.

926
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:08,860
Tan,

927
00:38:09,450 --> 00:38:10,930
would you care to

928
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:11,780
join me tomorrow

929
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:13,410
to see Second Young Master Shu's grand procession?

930
00:38:13,410 --> 00:38:14,920
Second Young Master Shu?

931
00:38:15,330 --> 00:38:17,390
Even you've taken an interest in him?

932
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:19,480
Don't misunderstand.

933
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:20,560
My appreciation for him

934
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,210
is purely academic.

935
00:38:22,610 --> 00:38:23,840
My enthusiasm

936
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:24,880
is entirely for your sake.

937
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,140
The top three scholars

938
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:27,600
will all parade tomorrow.

939
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:29,650
Who knows, your future husband

940
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:30,830
might be among them.

941
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,400
I'm not going.

942
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:35,830
Truly?

943
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:38,570
Such public display

944
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:40,340
would be beneath my standing.

945
00:38:40,930 --> 00:38:44,360
[Marquis of Jing'an's Mansion]

946
00:38:43,550 --> 00:38:44,520
Become a nun?

947
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:48,420
You...

948
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:50,050
How could you wish such misfortune upon Tan!

949
00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:50,390
You...

950
00:38:50,390 --> 00:38:51,510
Brother-in-law,

951
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:52,990
I was merely speculating.

952
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:54,780
Why such an intense reaction?

953
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,520
Think about it, the broken engagement

954
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:57,680
was hardly honorable,

955
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,120
and Tan has been immersed in Buddhist practice for days now.

956
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,380
Aren't you concerned she might take drastic measures?

957
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:00,930
Well, well...

958
00:39:00,930 --> 00:39:02,760
She wouldn't go so far as to become a nun, would she?

959
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,580
The capital is full of noble young men.

960
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:06,240
We'll simply find another.

961
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:08,380
With Tan's beauty and talents,

962
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,730
how could she possibly remain unmarried?

963
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,080
Wait a minute.

964
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,480
Weren't you two supposed to be accompanying

965
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,620
Tan in Buddhist devotions at Hanyan Temple?

966
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:27,460
Where is Tan?

967
00:39:27,970 --> 00:39:28,770
My lord,

968
00:39:28,790 --> 00:39:30,480
Fourth Miss and Miss Minmin went to see...

969
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,900
Fourth Miss and Miss Minmin,

970
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:32,930
having not seen each other for days,

971
00:39:32,930 --> 00:39:35,740
arranged to meet at Wentao Pavilion for sisterly conversation.

972
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:37,140
Sisterly conversation.

973
00:39:37,290 --> 00:39:39,610
[Wentao Pavilion]

974
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:39,670
You arrived somewhat late.

975
00:39:39,730 --> 00:39:40,590
This is the only remaining private booth

976
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:41,990
overlooking the street.

977
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:44,780
No matter. This spot will do nicely.

978
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:48,320
Tan, please sit down.

979
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:55,430
See? I told you

980
00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:56,580
Tan wouldn't

981
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:57,400
become a nun

982
00:39:57,430 --> 00:39:58,930
over such trivial matters.

983
00:39:58,930 --> 00:39:59,590
Come on now!

984
00:39:59,770 --> 00:40:01,370
Brother-in-law, come here.

985
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:01,970
What is it?

986
00:40:01,970 --> 00:40:03,290
Then let me ask you,

987
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,830
is Tan's marriage arrangement

988
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:05,680
something

989
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:06,880
you alone can decide?

990
00:40:08,470 --> 00:40:10,860
How could I not understand your concerns?

991
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:12,420
Do you know that recently

992
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:15,360
the Empress Dowager and His Majesty have frequently summoned me to the palace?

993
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,360
It seems like casual conversation,

994
00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:20,270
but in reality, they intend to arrange a marriage.

995
00:40:20,270 --> 00:40:23,280
The Empress Dowager even dangled titles like Princess Consort

996
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,550
and Imperial Prince's Primary Wife

997
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:25,750
for me to choose from!

998
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:30,910
Laughably, these two

999
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:34,090
are inferior to Liang Zixuan in both looks and talent.

1000
00:40:34,090 --> 00:40:35,730
Let alone Tan,

1001
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,360
even I don't approve of them.

1002
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:39,870
The Empress Dowager's will

1003
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:41,930
is ultimately Chancellor Su's will.

1004
00:40:42,050 --> 00:40:44,440
Her matchmaking

1005
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:46,930
serves only to co-opt you for Chancellor Su.

1006
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:48,390
With the Liang family fallen,

1007
00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:50,390
they've simply produced new pawns.

1008
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:53,000
After all, she's not his biological daughter.

1009
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,640
No matter how much he considers Tan's interests,

1010
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,160
isn't it still putting his own interests first?

1011
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:58,220
My Yangxi Prefecture defends Xian

1012
00:40:58,250 --> 00:40:59,790
and answers only to His Majesty.

1013
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:01,760
Shall the Marquis of Jing'an

1014
00:41:01,790 --> 00:41:03,160
pledge allegiance to in-laws

1015
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,860
through a mere marriage?

1016
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:07,390
Brother-in-law, you're making it sound too easy.

1017
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:08,170
You may think that way,

1018
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:09,440
but others certainly don't—

1019
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,800
least of all His Majesty.

1020
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,180
I don't care what others think.

1021
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,050
I walk the path of righteousness

1022
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:17,450
with a clear conscience!

1023
00:41:19,670 --> 00:41:21,270
An imperial decree it may be,

1024
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:23,410
but if Tan is unwilling,

1025
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:26,830
be it the Empress Dowager or His Majesty himself,

1026
00:41:26,830 --> 00:41:28,590
I won't consent!

1027
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:29,420
That's right.

1028
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:33,230
My lord, the palace sent word.

1029
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:34,280
His Majesty summons you

1030
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,480
with utmost urgency.

1031
00:41:40,370 --> 00:41:42,180
Please enjoy your meal at leisure.

1032
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:42,730
Thank you.

1033
00:41:42,730 --> 00:41:43,490
Thank you.

1034
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:47,320
Tan,

1035
00:41:47,490 --> 00:41:49,930
How does my makeup look today?

1036
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:56,510
Rouged lips with powdered jade, brows like distant mountains—

1037
00:41:56,510 --> 00:41:57,560
perfect.

1038
00:41:58,370 --> 00:41:59,370
That's good then.

1039
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:06,360
He's coming, he's coming!

1040
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,400
Tan,

1041
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:19,160
look!

1042
00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:21,030
That's Second Young Master Shu.

1043
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:22,590
Young Master Shu!

1044
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:24,570
Young Master Shu!

1045
00:42:26,130 --> 00:42:29,220
Look at his bearing, his noble demeanor...

1046
00:42:30,370 --> 00:42:32,210
Graceful as jade carved and polished—

1047
00:42:32,210 --> 00:42:35,640
a gentleman refined.

1048
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:37,830
That's the verse!

1049
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:41,610
Second Young Master Shu's talent and looks are truly top-tier.

1050
00:42:41,610 --> 00:42:43,480
He indeed embodies those words.

1051
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,080
Young Master Shu!

1052
00:42:46,350 --> 00:42:47,270
Only a man

1053
00:42:47,290 --> 00:42:48,270
like Second Young Master Shu

1054
00:42:48,270 --> 00:42:49,870
could catch your eyes.

1055
00:42:50,730 --> 00:42:51,570
When he glanced this way

1056
00:42:51,570 --> 00:42:53,600
just now,

1057
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:55,050
that spring-breeze smile

1058
00:42:55,050 --> 00:42:57,470
must have been for you.

1059
00:42:59,290 --> 00:43:01,380
Now that he's ranked third in the exams,

1060
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:02,790
suitors

1061
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:04,610
will swarm his doorstep.

1062
00:43:04,670 --> 00:43:06,960
Since you and he share mutual affection,

1063
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,120
why not

1064
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:10,740
request the Empress Dowager's decree at once?

1065
00:43:11,510 --> 00:43:12,940
My marriage affair

1066
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:14,790
is not yours to comment upon!

1067
00:43:16,530 --> 00:43:17,990
Let's not talk about this.

1068
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:19,560
Don't you know the Empress Dowager intends to

1069
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:21,260
betroth the Princess of Fengzhao to the Prince of Dingbei?

1070
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:23,250
Why bring this up now?

1071
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:25,270
Prince of Dingbei?

1072
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:30,600
They say capital ladies

1073
00:43:30,630 --> 00:43:32,390
prize composure,

1074
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:33,120
yet

1075
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:34,400
before Second Young Master Shu,

1076
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:35,120
they've all forgotten

1077
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:36,520
what restraint means.

1078
00:43:36,670 --> 00:43:39,470
You always accuse me of being improper,

1079
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:41,900
yet I'm far more restrained than these ladies.

1080
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:43,300
I wonder

1081
00:43:43,330 --> 00:43:44,890
what kind of wife

1082
00:43:44,910 --> 00:43:45,860
such a radiant gentleman

1083
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:46,960
will eventually wed.

1084
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,240
Our Second Master Shu

1085
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:49,850
will certainly be most particular about

1086
00:43:49,850 --> 00:43:51,330
family status, appearance, and character,

1087
00:43:51,330 --> 00:43:52,440
especially

1088
00:43:52,890 --> 00:43:54,720
seeking one who is cultivated,

1089
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:57,190
well-read, and knows her place.

1090
00:44:11,030 --> 00:44:12,620
It's you again!
