[Episode 26]

3
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,710
You accuse Zhou Baoping

4
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:36,240
of being silenced by the Su family.

5
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,640
Do you have any evidence?

6
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:42,610
I have no hard proof,

7
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,200
but the list Lord Zhou gave me

8
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,860
is the best evidence there is.

9
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,030
The Su family, in search of that list,

10
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:50,490
killed innocent women without hesitation.

11
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,680
Several girls Lord Zhou

12
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,720
frequently requested

13
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,720
have lost their lives because of it.

14
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,479
Go on.

15
00:01:58,370 --> 00:01:59,800
Unable to leave the city,

16
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,600
I took an alias

17
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:02,770
and found work as a maid

18
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:04,250
at the 180 Pavilion.

19
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:06,880
To avoid raising suspicion,

20
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,680
I remained quiet for six months.

21
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:10,960
Until the day Young Lord Zhang

22
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,690
came to investigate the taxes.

23
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,200
I finally got my chance

24
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,560
to meet with him.

25
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:22,180
I, Qiuyue,

26
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,590
humbly ask you to speak up for Lord Zhou

27
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,700
and restore his name.

28
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,610
Miss Qiuyue,

29
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,800
I know you came for Commissioner Zhou.

30
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,920
I've heard of his case

31
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,050
even in the capital.

32
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,760
But why seek me out?

33
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,040
I know you came to Lingzhou

34
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:40,920
to investigate the Su family's

35
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,360
tax extractions.

36
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,990
That mission

37
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:46,120
aligns perfectly with Lord Zhou's goal.

38
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:46,980
He was silenced

39
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:48,480
because he uncovered

40
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,040
the Su family's crimes.

41
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,040
His injustice remains unresolved.

42
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,200
What crimes did he uncover?

43
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,800
A list of officials bribed
by the Su family.

44
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,560
That list is in my possession.

45
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,710
I stayed in Lingzhou

46
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:01,840
just to wait for the court

47
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,040
to send someone again,

48
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,780
so I could clear his name

49
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,360
and fulfill his unfinished mission

50
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,130
of restoring law and order.

51
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:12,840
Qiuyue,

52
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,360
I came only

53
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,200
to audit the diverted taxes.

54
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,320
If I can settle

55
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:17,079
all accounts,

56
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:18,600
I'd consider it a mission accomplished.

57
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,960
Such lofty tasks as restoring

58
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,760
discipline and justice...

59
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,960
I'm not worthy to carry them out.

60
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,680
But with this list in hand,

61
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,140
the court can easily
take down the Su family.

62
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,520
Yes,

63
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,480
but as you said,

64
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,320
only the court has that power.

65
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:34,500
I hold no office,

66
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,120
just an honorary title

67
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,120
as imperial tax inspector.

68
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,380
Even if I know Commissioner Zhou's death

69
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:41,480
has hidden truths,

70
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,960
I have no authority to investigate

71
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,250
or reopen the case.

72
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,070
It's the Su family!

73
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:57,270
My Lord, you go first!

74
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:58,550
Be careful!

75
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:01,900
Protect her.

76
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,160
What she knows is too important.

77
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:03,770
She must not

78
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:04,760
fall back into the Su family's hands.

79
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,410
Yes.

80
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,050
Only by staying alive
can we hope for another chance.

81
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,200
Go!

82
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,540
Fall back!

83
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,130
-Your Lord!
-Your Lord!

84
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,620
It was I who brought
this trouble upon Young Lord Zhang.

85
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,450
After this,

86
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,890
the Su family believed

87
00:04:32,909 --> 00:04:34,640
the list fell into
Young Lord Zhang's hands,

88
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,640
so they eased off the hunt for Qiuyue

89
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,760
but placed a kill order on him instead,

90
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,980
tracking him in secret.

91
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,320
Where is the list now?

92
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:55,000
The Imperial Inspector
acts on behalf of the Emperor,

93
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,260
with the power to dismiss and punish,

94
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:57,590
to take life or spare it.

95
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,580
No matter how powerful the Su family is,

96
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,280
they cannot defy the throne.

97
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,330
Please hand over the evidence.

98
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,730
As long as it's real,

99
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,640
the Imperial Inspector will
not tolerate corruption.

100
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,100
Zhou Baoping's injustice
will be set right.

101
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:54,640
[Fang Yiyan, Liu Yan, Zhang Daoyuan,
Cheng Xiu, Lin Shouren]

102
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:05,690
[Fang Yiyan, Liu Yan, Zhang Daoyuan,
Cheng Xiu, Lin Shouren]

103
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:27,730
After Lord Zhou's death,

104
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:31,770
I knew the Su family
would try to silence me

105
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:33,870
and destroy the list.

106
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:36,070
So I took precautions.

107
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,240
Even if one day

108
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:40,100
they succeed in killing me,

109
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,480
I can at least

110
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,200
keep the list safe.

111
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,520
Only then

112
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,400
would I feel

113
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,420
I've honored Lord Zhou's

114
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,340
trust in me.

115
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:15,630
Su Errong, do you admit guilt?

116
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,040
Just a few names...

117
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,360
Just because she calls it a bribery list,
does that make it so?

118
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,090
How can you believe her easily?

119
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,810
Anyone can write names.

120
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,760
If I scribble a few,

121
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,790
would that count

122
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:31,410
as evidence of bribery too?

123
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,320
This is absurd!

124
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,770
It's not just a list.

125
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,990
There's a witness.

126
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,040
He

127
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,820
can prove this list is real.

128
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,960
A man who's already dead

129
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:49,510
can prove nothing.

132
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,450
What...

What...

134
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,610
What's happening here?

135
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,360
Lord Yin.

136
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,230
Today's incident

137
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:27,420
was a trap set by Su Errong.

138
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,870
He meant to frame His Highness

139
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:30,060
for your murder.

140
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,140
It was His Highness who saved you.

141
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,320
Su Errong, you scoundrel.

142
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:37,530
We followed your

143
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:40,390
orders blindly,

144
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:44,650
yet you still wanted to silence us!

145
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,800
My Lord, you once said

146
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,640
you hid the evidence
at the Maritime Trade Bureau.

147
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,180
Why not present it now

148
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,120
while the Imperial Inspector is here?

149
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,720
Yes! I have evidence!

150
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,160
My Lord,

151
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,440
I'll go retrieve it at once.

152
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,770
No need.

153
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,850
Please take a look, My Lord.

154
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,680
-Wang Wang, from Maritime Trade Bureau.
-Pang You, from Maritime Trade Bureau.

155
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,540
Greetings, Imperial Inspector.

156
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:41,080
I was ordered by Lord Yin

157
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,760
to retrieve this evidence

158
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,720
to present it to Your Highness.

159
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,800
Who knew the Su family

160
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,800
would discard us like worn shoes

161
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,320
and try to kill us off?

162
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,900
Thankfully, Lord Shu

163
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,050
and this young lady

164
00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:59,120
saved us.

165
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,760
Use and discard,

166
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,230
they truly see lives as worthless.

167
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,120
I'm glad

168
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,350
I kept a backup plan.

169
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,280
Imperial Inspector,

170

All merchants who bribed the Su family

173
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,880
are clearly marked.

that the servant is uninvolved,

Please ensure

231
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:26,440
he is kept under strict watch,

232
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,760
lest he take his own life

By the way,

does Wen Zong have any part in this case?

237

According to Mr. Luo,

Wen Zong's visits to Fu Lu Gold Store

239

with nothing suspicious.

also say he's a legitimate trader.

243
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:48,150
Though somewhat opportunistic,

244
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:50,630
it's still within reason.

245
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,790
Then it seems I misjudged him.

Why would you betray the Su family?

256
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,290
I never wanted to betray the Su family.

257
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,720
But as someone of low rank,

258

my fate was always in others' hands.

00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:32,690
and given me a second chance,

263

You truly show no remorse.

Well, I don't think
I've done anything wrong.

Then according to family rules,

522

you'll be confined

Ming Tan,

525
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,600
if it weren't for you,

526
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,520
I wouldn't have married
far away in Lingzhou.

527
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,880
I wouldn't have been
separated from Mother.

528

If it weren't for you,

529
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,720
I wouldn't be blamed by my in-laws

530
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:54,930
and fall this low.

531
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:58,570
It's all your fault.

532
00:28:19,930 --> 00:28:22,160
You've lived here so long. You'll miss it?

533
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,150
I was just praying to Buddha

534
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,730
that I'll never set foot

535
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,320
in this godforsaken place again.

536

As for future missions

537

please,

539

count me out.

540
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,610
Looks like our dear Young Lord Zhang

541
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:37,210
has become even more wary.

542
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,140
I suppose he'll now devote himself

543
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:40,560
entirely to the world of commerce.

544
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,410
Business is full of trickery,

545
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,730
but at least

546
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,240
it doesn't require me to risk my life.

547
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,040
But,

548
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:47,600
are you really not
staying a few more days

549
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,060
and coming back
to the capital with me and Xu?

550
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:54,230
I've earned some merit this time.

551
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,830
Of course I'll return with Lord Tan

552
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:56,740
to the capital

553
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,560
to claim a reward from His Majesty.

554
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,360
Besides,

555
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,320
I'm just barely recovered;

556
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:03,540
it's safer with Imperial Guards.

557
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,820
If I go with you two,

558
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,770
who knows what might happen again.

559
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,520
He's a grown man we can't keep anymore.

560
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,960
Best let him go.

561
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,120
Wouldn't want him blaming us

562
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,110
for ruining his marriage.

563
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,560
Can't keep me, so what?

564
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,280
You both have
your loved ones by your side.

565
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:20,560
You don't know the ache of longing.

Come, both of you,

let's toast with tea.

570
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,810
I'll head back to the capital first,

571
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:34,490
prepare a feast,

572
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:35,670
and when you return,

573
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,400
we'll celebrate together.

574
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:37,940
Cheers.

Are you leaving, miss?

577
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:09,480
His Highness has
removed my servant status.

578
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,820
Now that I'm free,

579
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,650
I want to explore

580
00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:13,720
a world beyond Lingzhou,

581
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,120
see different people and places,

582
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,180
live a life

583
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:18,080
unlike that of Hui House.

584
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:24,480
They say women
are like vines needing a tree to cling to,

585
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,200
but who says

586
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:27,950
a woman can't be a tree herself?

587
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,880
From now on, you'll live for yourself.

588
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,810
No more bowing or scraping.

589
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,820
You're right, Your Highness.

590
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:41,600
In truth,

591
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,340
I must thank you for aiding His Highness.

592
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:47,210
If it weren't for your decisive words

593
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,440
that turned the tide,

594
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,260
he might not

595
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,450
have quelled the crisis so easily.

596
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:57,430
I'm ashamed.

597
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,520
If not for His Highness's
wise and earnest words,

598
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,380
I might never have seen the light.

599
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,080
And today,

600
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,880
I'd be full of regret.

601
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,850
Greetings, Your Highness.

602
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:54,570
I wonder why

603
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,400
Your Highness

604
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,570
summoned me today.

605
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,380
You are one of Su Errong's people.

606
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,760
From the day I entered the city,

607
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,720
she placed you by my side to serve.

608
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,400
Did she intend to use you

609
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,370
to get close and harm me?

610
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,240
N-No!

611
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,740
I would never dare!

612
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,760
You were born of a humble status.

613
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,120
No matter how hard
you serve the Su family,

614
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,440
your fate will always

615
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,370
be in others' hands.

616
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,850
Whether you're a courtesan

617
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,170
or the mistress of the pleasure house,

618
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:45,530
to you, there's no real difference.

619
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:47,920
In the end,

620
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,740
you're merely a pawn to the Su family.

621
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,610
They're using you,

622
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,480
so they want you blind and obedient.

623
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,580
I heard Su Errong planned to send you

624
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,160
to the Lingzhou Prefect's residence

625
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,700
as his seventh concubine.

626
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:11,600
Do you accept that fate?

627
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:19,210
I do not.

628
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,080
But

629
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:24,740
as a woman of base status,

630
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,410
I have no say.

631
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,120
Where I go, what I do,

632
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,140
it's never up to me.

633
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,680
When useful, they coax me;

634
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:35,460
when not,

635
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,360
they throw me away.

636
00:33:39,630 --> 00:33:41,360
According to our empire's law,

637
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,640
anyone who renders service to the court

638
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:45,330
may shed their lowly status

639
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,340
if recommended

640
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,560
by a senior official.

641
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,880
I grant you this promise,

642
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,140
freedom

643
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,520
for the rest of your life.

644
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,920
With His Highness's capabilities,

645
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,280
even without me,

646
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,570
he could have taken down the Su family.

647
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,170
So truly,

648
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,510
it is not me helping His Highness,

649
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,540
but His Highness who saved me.

650
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:22,150
His Highness is a noble soul,

651
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:25,190
a pillar of this land,
a bearer of its peace.

652
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:28,090

to have his love.

After the rain,

700
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,560
a rainbow shines across the clouds.

701
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,700
Indeed, after the storm,

702
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,290
comes the most beautiful view.

703
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,870
So, how's my taste?

704
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,080
Not bad.

705
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,800
Would you like to look
at the wind chimes, miss?

706
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:09,310
You're not in the mood today.

707
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,320
Not really.

708
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:16,470
Usually you

709
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,980
enjoy shopping.

710
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,410
When I went shopping,

711
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,980
you've never joined me.

712
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:24,120
So how would you know what I was like?

713
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,530
Besides, these past few days in Lingzhou,

714
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:31,640
it was Miss Qingyu
who spent the most time with you.

715
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,520
Can you put less jealousy

716
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,500
in that head of yours?

717
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:41,600
Qingyu and I only

718
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,720
teamed up for mutual gain.

719
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:46,040
Nothing more.

720
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,920
You may feel nothing,

721
00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:52,420
but she may

722
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,840
have feelings for you.

723
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,200
How can I

724
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,840
control others' feelings?

725
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:03,430
I practically wrote “Stay Away”

726
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:04,280
on my forehead.

727
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,330
Then clearly,

728
00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:06,990
“Stay Away” wasn't enough,

729
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,440
so she still had hope

730
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,640
and developed feelings she shouldn't.

731
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:12,870
Then next to

732
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:14,370
“Stay Away,”

733
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,280
shall I add:

734
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:17,410
“I'm already married”?

735
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:19,840
Not enough.

736
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:20,980
Far from it.

737
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:24,360
Then how about adding:

738
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:29,960
“My heart belongs to one, forever loyal”?

739
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:30,800
How is it?

740
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,320
Write whatever

741
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,280
you want on your face.

742
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,120
It's not like I know

743
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:43,000
what you're actually doing outside

744
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,730
and what words you would write.

745
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,360
Sir, how much are these clay figurines?

746
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,880
Pre-made ones are five wen each.

747
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:56,760
Pick whichever you like.

748
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,960
If you want a custom one, it's eight wen.

749
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,520
How do you make custom ones?

750
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:01,480
Just tell me who you want it to look like,

751
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:03,080
and I'll sculpt it right now.

752
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,080
Then can you make one

753
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,680
that looks like my wife?

754
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:10,790
Of course.

755
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,580
Such beauty.

756
00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:14,090
Sir, you're truly lucky.

757
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,360
Sir,

758
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,120
would you like one of yourself too?

759
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,150
I'll give you a deal:

760
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:19,280
two for fifteen wen.

761
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,490
-Sure.
-No need.

762
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:23,840
Then let's each have one made

763
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:24,710
to look like us.

764
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:25,920
Alrighty.

765
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,340
A perfect pair, an auspicious match.

766
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,140
Sir, please stand still.

767
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,420
I'll sculpt you first.

768
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:38,220
When did you get interested

769
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:40,320
in clay figurines?

770
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:43,360
Since writing words
on my face wasn't enough,

771
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,700
I now need figurines.

772
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,720
Dough figurines?

773
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,400
How will you use them?

774
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,510
Wherever I go,

775
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:54,390
whoever I meet,

776
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,330
I'll bring along

777
00:39:55,330 --> 00:39:56,530
a figurine of my wife.

778
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,210
Let's see who dares

779
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,960
have thoughts about your husband then.

780
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:09,130
Seeing you smile like this,

781
00:40:09,130 --> 00:40:11,060
this figurine is worth every coin.

782
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,080
Then why make another one

783
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:22,080
looking like you?

784
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,480
When you go out,

785
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:28,260
you'll carry a figurine of me,

786
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,570
to block off any admirers

787
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,080
and crush false hopes.

788
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,300
I won't carry it.

789
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:49,580
Your Highness.

790
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,080
Is everything ready?

791
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,580
Your Highness can rest assured.

792
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:04,720
Bring it up.

793
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:18,550
Your Majesty,

794
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,640
On this southern inspection,

795
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,080
I've uncovered that
the Su family of Lingzhou

796
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:24,160
has committed large-scale smuggling,

797
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:26,480
trafficking, embezzlement, and bribery.

798
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,840
The amounts involved

799
00:41:28,010 --> 00:41:30,250
are unprecedented in our empire.

800
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:33,500
This is the Su family's

801
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:35,280
record of embezzlement and smuggling.

802
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,850
I will hand it over
to the Court of Judicial Review

803
00:41:36,850 --> 00:41:37,680
for a thorough investigation,

804
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,010
to ensure its accuracy.

805
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:39,970
In addition,

806
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:43,970
I have also uncovered evidence that
the Su family sold official positions,

807
00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:46,160
bribed officials,
and formed illicit alliances.

808
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,350
This roster

809
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:50,200
is solid proof

810
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:53,100
of the Su family's
collusion with court officials.

811

The Su family's crimes

833
00:43:02,670 --> 00:43:04,470
are countless and inexcusable.

834
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:05,920
With such solid proof,

835
00:43:06,190 --> 00:43:08,190
why can they still not be convicted?

836
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:13,280
Your Majesty,

837
00:43:14,310 --> 00:43:15,950
the Lingzhou maritime trade

838
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:17,200
has long been solely controlled

839
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:18,680
by Su Errong and her husband.

840
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:21,800
It has no connection
whatsoever to Chancellor Su.

841

All profits from the Su family's business

have never reached
the Chancellor's estate.

Su Errong is the daughter of Su Wenchun.

he cannot escape implication.

Your Majesty,

847
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,130
as I understand,

848
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:46,470
there is a legal complication

849
00:43:46,470 --> 00:43:47,430
in this case.

850
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:50,080

if engaged in trade or commerce,

must relinquish all official aspirations.

00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,790
When Chancellor Su passed the civil exams,

855
00:43:58,790 --> 00:43:59,800
in order to be eligible for office,

856
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:01,800
he formally severed household ties

857
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:03,320
with the Su family in Lingzhou.

858
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:05,050
After Su Errong married,

859
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:07,650
he did the same,

860
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,920
transferred her household registration,

861
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:12,200
and recorded the change
in the Ministry of Revenue archives.

862
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:13,610
This, Your Majesty,
is the core of the complication.

863
00:44:13,610 --> 00:44:15,220
I ask Your Majesty
to weigh it with utmost discernment.
