1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm going to make a little bit of a

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
little bit of a

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
little bit of a

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
little bit of a little bit of a

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
little bit of a little bit of a

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
little bit of a little bit of a

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
little bit of a little bit of a

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
little bit of a little bit of a little

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
bit of a little bit of a little

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
bit of a little bit of a little bit

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
of a little bit of a little bit of

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
a little bit of a little bit of a

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
little bit of a little bit of a little

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
bit of a little bit of a little

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
bit of a little bit of a little

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
bit of a little bit of a little

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
bit of a little bit of a little

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
bit of a little bit of a little

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
bit of a little bit of a little

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
bit of a little bit of a little

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
bit of a little bit of a little

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
bit of a little bit of a little

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
bit of a little bit of a little

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
bit of a little bit of a little

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
bit of a little bit of a little

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
bit of a little bit of a little

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
bit of a little bit of a little

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
bit of a little bit of a little

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
bit of a little bit of a little

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
bit of a little

31
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
It's

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
the

33
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
last

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I didn't have time to do this.

35
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
But the best evidence that you gave me was the evidence.

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Su Jia is a criminal.

37
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
He didn't want to kill innocent people.

38
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
All the girls who were killed in the prison

39
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
were killed because of this.

40
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Tell me.

41
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
You can't get out of here.

42
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I only have a picture of a girl in a 180-yard house.

43
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I'm not afraid of losing.

44
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I haven't been in the prison for half a year.

45
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I was so moved.

46
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Until I found out that the father was sleeping,

47
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I finally found a chance to meet the master.

48
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I asked you to help him

49
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
to help Mr. Zhou

50
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
to prove his justice.

51
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Miss Qiu Yue.

52
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I know you came for Zhou Tongzhi.

53
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I heard about his case in the capital.

54
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
But why did you hurt me?

55
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I, Zhang Shizi, came here to investigate

56
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Su Jia's father's sleep.

57
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Mr. Zhou and I were together for a long time.

58
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Mr. Zhou was the one who found out

59
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
that Su Jia was the one who was killed.

60
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
He was so innocent.

61
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
What did he do?

62
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Su Jia was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was killed.

63
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I was the one who was the one who was killed.

64
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I was in the prison of Lin Zhou.

65
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I wanted to wait for the court to send someone else.

66
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
So I could go to the hospital for him.

67
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I wanted to complete the mission of the Donggang Pavilion.

68
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Qiu Yue.

69
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I came here for the sake of Zhou's father's sleep.

70
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Now I can clear all the accounts

71
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
without any delay.

72
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
The Su Qing internal affairs, the Donggang Pavilion,

73
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
and the people of this world.

74
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I really can't afford it.

75
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
With my reputation,

76
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
the court can't take the Su family.

77
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Yes.

78
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
You know that I can only take the Su family if I have the court.

79
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I have no official position.

80
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I just hang a clear and clear account of the Su family.

81
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Even if I know that

82
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
there is another reason behind the death of Zhou,

83
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I have no right to ask.

84
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I have no right to make a mistake.

85
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Mr. Su.

86
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I'll go with you.

87
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Be careful.

88
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
You go first.

89
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
The information in his hand is very important.

90
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Don't fall into the Su family again.

91
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Yes.

92
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I'll keep my life first.

93
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Then I can have a chance.

94
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Retreat.

95
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Mr. Su.

96
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I've implicated Mr. Zhang.

97
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I think that the Su family has fallen into the hands of Mr. Zhang.

98
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I let Qiu Yue go to kill him.

99
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I objected to Mr. Zhang's death.

100
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I forced him to kill me.

101
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I kept on investigating the traces.

102
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Then why is the Su family here?

103
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
When the Emperor was in power,

104
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I had the power to kill him.

105
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
No matter how I tried to kill him,

106
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I couldn't get over the Emperor.

107
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Please give me the evidence.

108
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
As long as I'm in power,

109
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I won't let the Su family suffer.

110
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I can definitely make a comeback.

111
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
The Su family is in power.

112
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I can't let the Su family suffer.

113
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I can't let the Su family suffer.

114
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I can't let the Su family suffer.

115
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I can't let the Su family suffer.

116
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I can't let the Su family suffer.

117
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I can't let the Su family suffer.

118
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I can't let the Su family suffer.

119
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I can't let the Su family suffer.

120
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I can't let the Su family suffer.

121
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I can't let the Su family suffer.

122
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I can't let the Su family suffer.

123
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I can't let the Su family suffer.

124
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I can't let the Su family suffer.

125
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I can't let the Su family suffer.

126
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Lord Zhou, you are not well.

127
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I know the Su family is trying to kill you.

128
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I know the Su family is trying to kill you.

129
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I know the Su family is trying to kill you.

130
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I want to destroy Minglu.

131
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Only that.

132
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Even if I have to suffer for a day,

133
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I don't believe the Su family will suffer.

134
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I also hope

135
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
that I can guarantee Minglu won't be found.

136
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I just decided

137
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
to kill myself

138
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
and let Lord Zhou live.

139
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Su Errong, you are guilty.

140
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
There are several people in the area.

141
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
He said that it was Minglu who was in charge.

142
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
How can I believe

143
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
that it's hard to write a name?

144
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I can write a few names.

145
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Could it be that

146
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
he is guilty of being a criminal?

147
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
He is so absurd.

148
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I don't know Minglu.

149
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
There is also a witness.

150
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Does he prove that Minglu is not guilty?

151
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
A dead man.

152
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
What else can he prove?

153
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
There is no weapons.

154
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
At least we have something to prove to rat worried.

155
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Your luxury you have.

156
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Tzhana

157
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Prince

158
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I'm hiding from Uncle Shi.

159
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,280
Why don't you go to the battlefield today

160
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,280
and tell me about the palace?

161
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,280
Yes, I have evidence.

162
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:16,920
My lord, I'll go now and get the evidence.

163
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,920
No need to trouble me.

164
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,480
My lord, please look at the screen.

165
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,320
Uncle Shi, I've seen the master of the kitchen.

166
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,320
I, Feng Yin, am ordered

167
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:59,320
to go to Uncle Shi and get the evidence to the King of Cheng Yu.

168
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,600
Never thought that the Su family

169
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:06,360
would actually need dessert to kill fish and fish and the ancients.

170
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,480
My friend,�� promotes such a thing

171
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,880
like he has been a damitite and I,

172
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,880
planned to save them all.

173
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,480
With all the evidence I've learned,

174
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:22,120
I'd now instantly shoot myself dead.

175
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:27,240
It seems I've stMinump献

176
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,800
Retainer of the Lord Fei-tian.

177
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,800
These sleepy alarming而梦

178
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:36,200
Is the last performance-laden tree mutated for almost ten years.

179
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:44,100
Among them is the nawet for the handwoven

180
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:46,880
cobra

181
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:51,360
It is the been under capture and taken to the next next

183
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:57,780
As well as Su's

00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:01,180
and the contribution of our political affairs

186
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,020
will be reflected in.

187
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,220
Mr. Tan.

188
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,540
Mr. Shi look after Zhao

189
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:13,060
just to along with Zhou Baoping with the mistakes he made.

190
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:14,620
Not just Su's,...

191
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:16,500
All turn signals

192
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:19,540
some military criminals.

193
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,260
If Su is guilty,

194
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:25,580
it's likely to be so.

195
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:28,580
Please punish me, Mr. Tan.

196
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:30,580
I'm not a criminal.

197
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:41,580
Be careful. Don't let anything happen.

198
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:42,580
Sir, I found it.

199
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:45,580
Sir, this is from the secret room.

200
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,580
The police and the treasure are all dead.

201
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:52,580
It's a secret. I don't know anything.

202
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:54,580
I don't know where the secret room is.

203
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:57,580
Xiao!

204
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:59,580
Sir, please forgive me.

205
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:01,580
Sir! Sir!

206
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:03,580
Please forgive me. Sir!

207
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:11,580
My lady.

208
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:17,580
These things are enough to be the punishment for Mr. Luo.

209
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:18,580
As for Xiao'er,

210
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:20,580
can you tell him the truth

211
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:23,580
if you've heard what he said?

212
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:25,580
If Xiao'er is innocent,

213
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:27,580
we need to release him as soon as possible.

214
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,580
Yes, my lady.

215
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:32,580
I'll let him report the evidence to the prince.

216
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:36,580
Mr. Luo is the key witness of this case.

217
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:39,580
Please tell him to watch over Yanjia

218
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:42,580
and prevent him from shooting or killing himself.

219
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:43,580
My lady, don't worry.

220
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:45,580
By the way,

221
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:48,580
can I ask for your permission?

222
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:49,580
As you've said,

223
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:51,580
the prison is usually closed.

224
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:53,580
It's just a normal business.

225
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,580
It's not allowed to be held in court.

226
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:56,580
Among the victims,

227
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:58,580
the most common victim is the normal one.

228
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:01,580
Although there are some risks of the first case,

229
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:04,580
they are all in the love of the case.

230
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:08,580
I was wrong about him.

231
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:17,580
My lady,

232
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:20,580
the imperial guards have helped the princess to get rid of the dirty stuff.

233
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:22,580
The police are in charge of the Su family.

234
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:26,580
Guards, take the Su Errong

235
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:29,580
and send a team of horses to lock the city.

236
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:31,580
You bastard.

237
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:33,580
Why do you want to betray the Su family?

238
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:51,580
No.

239
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:22,580
Qingyu doesn't want to betray the Su family.

240
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:25,580
Qingyu is just a low status.

241
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:27,580
Anyone can be the master of Qingyu.

242
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:30,580
I don't want to live like this anymore.

243
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:35,580
Since you're willing to let Qingyu be reborn,

244
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:37,580
I will cherish it.

245
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:40,580
I will.

246
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:53,580
If the witness is correct,

247
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:55,580
I will investigate the case.

248
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:57,580
I will not let Qingzong be the master.

249
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:00,580
The commander of the Su family, Zhang Daoyuan,

250
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:01,580
is in charge of the road.

251
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:03,580
Take the Su family to the police station

252
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:04,580
and interrogate them.

253
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:09,580
Take the Su Errong

254
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:12,580
and send a team of horses to lock the city.

255
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:17,580
You can't escape.

256
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:19,580
You can't escape.

257
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:22,580
The Su family is in charge of the city.

258
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:25,580
I lost.

259
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:28,580
But...

260
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:38,580
It may be a secret.

261
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:45,580
I didn't expect the investigation to be interesting.

262
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:47,580
This books is almost addiction.

263
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:50,580
I think thehmm is irrefutable.

264
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:53,580
Well.

265
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:54,200
Do I have a couple of

266
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,580
legacy Lord plusalth today?

267
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:59,580
Not much.

268
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:01,580
If you have any master,

269
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:03,580
you must handle the future.

270
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:05,580
He has a perfect order.

271
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:09,580
We can process the escape as soon as possible.

272
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:10,580
No master won't waste any effort

273
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:11,580
on someone or vice department.

274
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:12,540
You're wasting half of it.

275
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:15,580
Am I two of us

276
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:27,980
ashramswho serve the same Jiang

277
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,220
Every time I see you in person

278
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:30,180
I mean

279
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:31,020
I've never had a tea STAN

280
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:33,140
I wonder if it's true

281
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,260
that it's tea

282
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,900
Poetry dough

283
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:36,900
For someone to taste it

284
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:37,980
Then for Su Di

285
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,220
Is the amount ofš

286
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:39,940
made true?

287
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:40,700
You know

288
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,420
I can't walk with my strength.

289
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:43,780
I'm not as good as you.

290
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:44,980
But I've never been so good.

291
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,300
Maybe it's just luck.

292
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:49,460
I'm a little bit noisy.

293
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:51,060
I just want to find out some tricks.

294
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,580
I want to find out the mastermind behind the scenes

295
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:53,740
and find out the truth.

296
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:55,740
I'm still not good.

297
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:59,340
The investigation is going on.

298
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:00,900
I don't understand.

299
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,180
But since you believe me,

300
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,180
I believe you.

301
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:05,620
You can definitely break this case.

302
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:08,740
My husband really believes me?

303
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,220
My lord,

304
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,380
although you're a weak woman,

305
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:13,460
you dare to be so insensitive and don't lose your men.

306
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:15,220
You should be more careful.

307
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:17,260
His letter,

308
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:18,540
you can definitely find out the truth

309
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:19,380
by yourself.

310
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:21,500
What else did he say?

311
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:24,060
He also said

312
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:27,020
that as long as you plan to leave,

313
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:28,500
all the subordinates will listen to you.

314
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:29,980
But the same goes for you.

315
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:32,780
You must be careful with your wife.

316
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:35,380
You can't cause her any trouble or danger.

317
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,860
My husband always thinks about her.

318
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:45,780
I wonder what's going on with her.

319
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:51,500
I'm not sure.

320
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:54,220
But you said it was dangerous.

321
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:56,100
I think it's a good idea.

322
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:57,140
Then...

323
00:17:58,460 --> 00:17:59,100
Don't worry.

324
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:00,660
You're always cautious.

325
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,420
You don't have to worry too much.

326
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:05,380
My lady,

327
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,540
it's getting late.

328
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:07,420
Let's go back to the inn

329
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:08,420
and wait for your good news.

330
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:12,260
I will leave you alone.

331
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:13,580
OK.

332
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:19,100
These people...

333
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,700
Are you thighs?

334
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:25,620
Yes.

335
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:31,420
That was delicious!

336
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:34,740
And you got meLet's go!

337
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,460
Oh!

338
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:57,460
Over there.

339
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:04,200
Hurry up!

340
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:04,920
What's wrong?

341
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:11,880
What's wrong?

342
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:12,760
Why are you so nervous?

343
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:13,960
Go home.

344
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,440
Zheng Yi Ke is fighting there.

345
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,120
I think he's a little bit more fierce.

346
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:17,920
Go.

347
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,800
Is Wang Yan at the battle today?

348
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,760
If the guest is surrounded,

349
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,560
we'll be out of the country to rest.

350
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,600
I don't want to go first.

351
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,400
Hurry up and tell the commander

352
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,120
to send the army in.

353
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:34,960
Yes.

354
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,720
I can definitely take care of him.

355
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,280
You don't have to worry too much.

356
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,920
But the Su family must be prepared.

357
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,760
The Su family is in the inn.

358
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,120
Wang Yan is a father and a son.

359
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,480
He's fierce and difficult to deal with.

360
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,080
I must see him in person

361
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,400
to be at ease.

362
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,520
Get the queen on the carriage.

363
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,920
I'll send you there.

364
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,440
Okay.

365
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:37,440
Why cheaper aye ay to would make choice

366
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,720
in your son's

367
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,560
wife

368
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,540
you are

369
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,640

370
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:48,600
ρω

371
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,640
now

372
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:50,840
I am

373
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,340
where

374
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:56,880
our

375
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,140
where

376
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:00,740
has

377
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:02,480
died

378
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,800
Don't be eliminated

379
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,680
lettuce

380
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,680
principal

381
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,680
Go.

382
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,680
Go.

383
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,680
It's 2 o'clock.

384
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,680
Fu Quan is dead.

385
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,680
The god of the world.

386
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,680
The god of the world.

387
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,680
The god of the world.

388
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,680
The god of the world.

389
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,680
The god of the world.

390
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,680
Go.

391
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,680
Didn't you say that I have a master?

392
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,680
I didn't know that.

393
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,680
I'm a criminal.

394
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,680
I can't be a criminal.

395
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,680
I'm a criminal.

396
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,680
If I have a master,

397
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,680
I'll be punished.

398
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,680
Go.

399
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,680
Don't chase.

400
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,680
We all know

401
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,680
his arrival.

402
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,680
Bring the master down.

403
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,680
If you only care about yourself,

404
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,680
Su Er Rong will not dare to kill you.

405
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,680
Unless he's behind it,

406
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,680
he will be caught.

407
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,680
Master.

408
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,680
The war is over.

409
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,680
Su Er Rong is out of the way.

410
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,680
We can't stop him.

411
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,680
We can't stop him.

412
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,680
No need.

413
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,680
The Su family is in a bad mood.

414
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,680
They are still on the road.

415
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,680
This is the best result.

416
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,680
Su Er Rong thinks

417
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,680
he can be a good man

418
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,680
if he's a man.

419
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,680
But as long as he's alive,

420
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,680
the financial power of Ling Zhou

421
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,680
will never be able to stop him.

422
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,680
Only if the Su family is defeated,

423
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,680
can we be able to take the responsibility.

424
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,680
You're wise.

425
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,680
Officer,

426
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,680
Mrs. Feng is not aware of the death.

427
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,680
She took the evidence in the auction.

428
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,680
The evidence is not yet received.

429
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,680
She only sent the evidence

430
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,680
to prove the innocence.

431
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,680
But Mrs. Feng should not have

432
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,680
sent the evidence.

433
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:35,680
The case is decided by the money.

434
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,680
We need to take the evidence back.

435
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,680
We can decide when the case is released.

436
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,680
Thank you.

437
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,680
Do you know the fault?

438
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,680
I don't know the fault.

439
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,680
The police just said

440
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,680
I was not aware of the innocence.

441
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,680
It's all because of the innocence.

442
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,680
Why did you go to the auction?

443
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,680
Why did you have to

444
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,680
buy the real goods?

445
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,680
I did this

446
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,680
to make up for my family's fault.

447
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,680
For the family's fault.

448
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,680
How could I not buy it?

449
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:09,680
When did the family need you

450
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,680
to make up for their fault?

451
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,680
I've been a burden to you

452
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,680
since you passed the door.

453
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,680
Third Brother,

454
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,680
what did I do wrong?

455
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,680
Just because of Ming Tan's words,

456
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,680
you don't have to

457
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,680
be so harsh to me.

458
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,680
I'm sorry.

459
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,680
I'm sorry.

460
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,680
I'm sorry.

461
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,680
Third Brother,

462
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:47,680
if Ming Tan really wants to protect

463
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,680
the Feng family,

464
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,680
she can direct me

465
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,680
to our manor

466
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,680
for the future.

467
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:57,680
I know that your wife

468
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,480
You don't have the guts to say that to your princess.

469
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,280
You even want to say something annoying.

470
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:01,780
You just...

471
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:02,780
To tell you the truth,

472
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:05,980
it's because of self-protection that she abandoned me as a sister.

473
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:06,980
You...

474
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:09,180
It's only a few days before King Dingmei's rainy season.

475
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:10,780
You don't care about the imperial decree.

476
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:12,380
You don't care about me and the three wolves.

477
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,980
You're a big fan of the King Ding.

478
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:16,980
You're going out to the gate to shout and to steal the concubines.

479
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:19,980
You really don't know how to change.

480
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:22,080
Anyway, I don't think it's wrong.

481
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,380
Ming Shu?

482
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:26,980
Then let's just do as we say.

483
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:31,580
Golden Clothes, I'm going to teach you a lesson.

484
00:27:56,980 --> 00:28:01,980
Mingtan, unless you, I won't marry Lingzhou,

485
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:03,980
nor will I divorce my mother.

486
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:08,980
Unless you, I won't be punished by the Fu family and be punished by the Luo family.

487
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:12,980
All of this is your fault.

488
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:30,980
I've been living here for so long, but I won't give up.

489
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:32,980
I'm begging the Buddha,

490
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:35,980
don't let me get into such a place.

491
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:39,980
Don't ever think about this kind of thing again.

492
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:42,980
You two, please understand.

493
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:45,980
It seems that our master Zhang is the most willing to give up his wish.

494
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:48,980
In the future, he will be more willing to give up his wish.

495
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:50,980
Although the business is a mess,

496
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:52,980
he will still be willing to give up his wish.

497
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:54,980
I'm a little sad here.

498
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:56,980
Although the business is a mess,

499
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:58,980
at least I don't need to be born into this world.

500
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:01,980
But you really don't need to stay for a few more days.

501
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:04,980
We will go back to the capital together.

502
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:08,980
I've done my best this time.

503
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:11,980
Of course, it's like going back to the capital with Mr. Tan.

504
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:14,980
Besides, I'm a strong man.

505
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:17,980
It's safer to have a safe escort.

506
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:20,980
It's difficult to go on the same path with you.

507
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:24,980
Is he a bad guy or should we go back to the capital?

508
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:26,980
In case he gets the chance,

509
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:28,980
we will be wronged.

510
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:30,980
How about a bad guy?

511
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:32,980
You two are all around him.

512
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:34,980
You don't know how to deal with him.

513
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:37,980
I will go find my own money.

514
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:41,980
Alright.

515
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:42,980
Come on, you two.

516
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:44,980
We've already had a cup of tea.

517
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:47,980
I'll take a step back to the capital to order some food and drinks.

518
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:50,980
We'll celebrate together when you two come back.

519
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:51,980
Come on.

520
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:53,980
The Prince

521
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,980
Are you leaving this place?

522
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,160
The Prince has managed to speed it up for me.

523
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:23,020
The pardon I deserve is for myself to remember.

524
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:26,620
I must test a home of my own sprites,

525
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:29,160
a pure love that is different from Lingzhou...

526
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:32,520
from aApplause где's unique day.

527
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,960
They say,

528
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:39,020
that one should hold it just like a powiedzip order.

529
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:42,080
ЕThough who said in view of women'sartenance to become a Ta southern Limited.

530
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:43,680
Lady...

531
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:47,660
will then throw forth their light to get the Wrath on their knees.

532
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:51,860
Princess Consort, you kept your voice heard in me for a long time.

533
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:58,260
What I'm saying is that...

534
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:00,060
In terms of herbs,

535
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,740
小碎头 心奈锅、寡人饭碗 everyday��면

536
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:03,060
却成不 just one- polygenic herbs,

537
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,900
the person who has already been could neverly需要

538
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:09,580
她还够嘛性有吧

539
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:12,060
傍晚 就能帮到她

540
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:14,300
可以把她做得幸福

541
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,520
我只需要她

542
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:20,520
I'm afraid Qingyu will regret her life.

543
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:50,660
track

544
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,400
Greetings, prince.

545
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,960
What is the meaning of

546
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:14,600
coming here withoutAUse to find Qingyu?

547
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,520
You are Su Errong's man.

548
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Since I entered the city for the first time,

549
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,720
he has arranged for you to serve me.

550
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:31,120
He wants to borrow your hand and deal with me.

551
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,560
No.

552
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,800
Qing Yu wouldn't dare.

553
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,440
You are so strong.

554
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:46,040
No matter how hard you try to sell your family,

555
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,840
you're not afraid of NFL players.

556
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,480
You're totally loyal.

557
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,600
He's Hua Kui and the owner of the Pavilion of Flowers.

558
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:00,120
There hasn't been any difference from you.

559
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,600
Put it in the end,

560
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,040
you're just a pawn of Su family.

561
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:10,920
They want you.

562
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,800
They希望 you'd follow the fate.

563
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:18,800
I heard that Su Errong sent you to Lingzhou to be the seventh concubine.

564
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:23,800
Are you willing to do it?

565
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,800
I'm not.

566
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:36,800
But I've seen a woman.

567
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:41,800
I can't decide where to go.

568
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:44,800
They're all their puppet.

569
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,800
If they're useful, they'll be red.

570
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,800
If they're useless, they'll be thrown away.

571
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:56,800
According to the law, if the court's official is to be executed,

572
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,800
if the main official is to be executed,

573
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,800
he'll be a commoner.

574
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,800
I'll allow you to do this.

575
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:07,800
I'll allow you.

576
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,800
I'll allow you.

577
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,800
With your sense of humor,

578
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:24,800
even without Qing Yu,

579
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,800
you can't fight against Su Jia.

580
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,800
So this time,

581
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,800
it's not that Qing Yu helped you,

582
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,800
but that you saved Qing Yu.

583
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:35,800
You're a gentleman.

584
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:37,800
You're a man of God.

585
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:38,800
You're a man of peace.

586
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:39,800
You're a gentleman.

587
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,800
You can't be so greedy.

588
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,800
You're a gentleman.

589
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,800
I believe

590
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,800
he's the man of God.

591
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:04,800
But the love life

592
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,800
is not just about the world.

593
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:08,800
It's about the whole world.

594
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:11,800
I'm the only one.

595
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,800
I'm also the only one

596
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,800
who's in love with him.

597
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,800
No matter what he's like,

598
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,800
whether he's noble or white,

599
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,800
I'll be like him

600
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,800
and be like him.

601
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,800
You love me comes true.

602
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,800
Qing Yu said so to me.

603
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,800
I was really touched

604
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:55,180
by the

605
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:58,120
two of us.

606
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,800
I don't think Qing Yu

607
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,800
still hasn't said anything.

608
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:09,800
A woman is as lonely as a bridge.

609
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,800
No matter if she's a secret lover,

610
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:14,800
she can find her own world.

611
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:22,800
But I still hope that you can do it.

612
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:27,800
It's worth the effort to meet that one.

613
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,800
Thank you, Your Highness.

614
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,800
The wind is blowing.

615
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,800
The rain is coming out.

616
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,800
The red mud is coming.

617
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:54,800
It's really going to be a beautiful scenery after the rain.

618
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,800
How do you feel about me?

619
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,800
Not good.

620
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,800
Miss, do you want to see the wind?

621
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,800
Is your wife not at home today?

622
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,800
No.

623
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,800
It's not like that to be shopping at the street.

624
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,800
When I was shopping at the street,

625
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,800
my husband never met me.

626
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,800
I don't know what he looks like.

627
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,800
Besides, my husband came to Linzhou these days.

628
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,800
He must be the longest I've met Miss Qing Yu.

629
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,800
You're really worried.

630
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,800
Can you stop pretending to be a thief?

631
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,800
We are just friends.

632
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:00,800
We don't need to do anything else.

633
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,800
My husband is not suspicious.

634
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:07,800
I don't want to help her fall in love with you.

635
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:14,800
I'm not sure how to handle her.

636
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,800
I almost wrote the word,

637
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,800
That's because I'm not good enough.

638
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,800
That's why I feel that I have a hope.

639
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,800
I shouldn't have written it.

640
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,800
I don't only write the word,

641
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,800
but also my wife.

642
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,800
What do you think?

643
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,800
It's not good.

644
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,800
Then add it up.

645
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:44,800
I'm not good enough.

646
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:54,800
What do you want to write on your husband's face?

647
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:58,800
Anyway, I don't know what you'll write on your face.

648
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,800
Boss, what's the matter with this face?

649
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,800
You have a good five-point pen.

650
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,800
So you can choose.

651
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,800
If you want to write, you can write eight-point pen.

652
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,800
How do you write?

653
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:15,800
As long as you say something,

654
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,800
I can write one for you.

655
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,800
Can you write one for my wife?

656
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:24,800
Of course.

657
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:27,800
You're a good husband.

658
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:30,800
You can write one for yourself.

659
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:31,800
Two are cheaper.

660
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:32,800
Only 15 yuan.

661
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:33,800
Okay.

662
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:34,800
No need.

663
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,800
Then you can write one for us.

664
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,800
Okay.

665
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,800
Call Tiancheng and write it.

666
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,800
Please stand up.

667
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,800
I'll write it for you.

668
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:46,800
Here.

669
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:54,800
When will you be interested in the mask?

670
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,800
It's not enough to write on your face.

671
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,800
I can only use the mask.

672
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,800
Mask?

673
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,800
How do you use it?

674
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,800
In the future, wherever you go,

675
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:10,800
you'll see someone with a mask you don't need.

676
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,800
You'll see who will dare to die

677
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,800
when you write to your husband.

678
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:22,800
You can be praised by your wife.

679
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,800
The mask is worth it.

680
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:34,800
Then why do you need to

681
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,800
read another husband's face?

682
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,800
My wife will be married

683
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,800
and will wear the mask of her husband.

684
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,800
She will be embarrassed

685
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,800
when she sees the mask.

686
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,800
I won't wear it.

687
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,800
Princess, the koto is ready.

688
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:06,800
I'll do it.

689
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:07,800
Don't worry.

690
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,800
The mask is ready.

691
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:18,800
Come on.

692
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:34,800
Your Majesty, I'm from Nanxun.

693
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,800
I've been investigating the Su family in Lingzhou.

694
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,800
I've been thinking, thinking, and watching.

695
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,800
There's no such thing as a rumor.

696
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,800
There's no such thing as a rumor.

697
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:48,800
This is the case of Su family's corruption and treason.

698
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,800
I'll hand over the case to the Court of Justice

699
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,800
to confirm the case.

700
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,800
I'll also investigate

701
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:59,800
the case of the Su family's selling of the koto.

702
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,800
This is the evidence

703
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,800
of the collusion of Su family

704
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,800
with the court officials.

705
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:07,800
Read it.

706
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:08,800
Yes.

707
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:13,800
Theни rze!!!

708
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:39,240
Zhuo Ran, Qi Du Wei, Xie Wei.

709
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:42,080
The internal affairs is Tao Xi Yan.

710
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:44,480
The national affairs is Ye Liu Yun.

711
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:47,480
General Zhuang Wu, Wu Wen Dao.

712
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:53,720
I'm confused.

713
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:56,800
I'm the most innocent.

714
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:08,960
I'm aKu Pan yo girl.

715
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:11,160
Hint!

716
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:13,560
Yes?

717
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:19,520
The enemy is coming.

718
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:21,120
We have a war to go.

719
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:26,200
Why are we not getting into the口?

720
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:31,400
Your Majesty.

721
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:36,000
I have no connection with Prime Minister Su.

722
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:40,000
I have never been good to him

723
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:42,800
in the business of the Su family.

724
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:46,200
Su Errong is the daughter of Su Wenchun.

725
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:49,920
He can't escape from this.

726
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:56,160
Your Majesty.

727
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:57,880
According to the officials,

728
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:00,160
there isס rustic in Su family.

729
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:01,480
We in吶 dynasty

730
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:06,000
is in a critical state.

731
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:10,080
So we no longer had to work.

732
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:13,160
While Prime Minister Su was in the imperial house,

733
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:15,600
Su Errong chose it.

734
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:16,520
Its passenger pods were opened

735
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:19,540
because she is the

736
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:23,940
Transfercher he has signed.

00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:30,480
the Ministry of Revenue left our以報

00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:55,940
I'm not a fan of you.

739
00:44:55,940 --> 00:44:57,940
