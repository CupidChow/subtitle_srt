00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:30,010
[Youthful Glory]

2
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:32,900
[Episode 14]

3
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,320
I heard

4
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,320
the Empress Dowager is seeking candidates

5
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,979
to select a concubine for you.

6
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,910
How did you come to know this?

7
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:43,310
Her Majesty summoned Yu

8
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,440
to Changchun Palace a few days ago

9
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,900
and brought up the matter.

10
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,680
She clearly wanted Yu
to pass the message to you

11
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,080
so you could be prepared.

12
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,539
How do you plan to handle this?

13
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,300
The Empress Dowager's
intentions are obvious.

14
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,720
But she's using the excuse

15
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,880
of securing your family's lineage.

16
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,840
How could you refuse that?

17
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,440
If I want to refuse, I need no reason.

18
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,280
Such a strong rejection

19
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,160
might be seen as disrespecting her goodwill.

20
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,720
Then it becomes your fault.

21
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:09,800
Absurd.

22
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,120
Everything I do is for the my household,

23
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:12,960
for His Majesty,

24
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,320
and for the people of this nation.

25
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,800
What fault is there in that?

26
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,720
Your Highness is truly selfless,

27
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,710
sacrificing much
for the country and its people.

28
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,210
But the household is thin in heirs.

29
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,340
If you don't extend the line soon,

30
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,640
how can you nurture someone

31
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:30,520
as capable as yourself for the court?

32
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,640
Tan, so you already know.

33
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,560
I... I'm fine.

34
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,800
This is Your Highness's regular medicine,

35
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,079
most effective.

36
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:52,740
These surface wounds

37
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,620
should heal within a few days.

38
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:56,900
Then you can

39
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,560
once again focus on

40
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,620
your duty to continue the royal line.

41
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,340
Her Highness is so meticulous,

42
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:10,400
even remembering
His Highness's usual remedy.

43
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,040
The one truly meticulous

44
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:14,970
is someone else.

45
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,360
How would I know

46
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,079
what His Highness has used for years?

47
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:30,500
Even a simple gift
from afar carries deep feeling.

48
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,620
Your Highness,

49
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34,180
please don't let that sentiment go to waste.

50
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,650
When Her Highness
heard Your Highness were hurt,

51
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:46,970
she was frantic.

52
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:48,420
She rushed here right away.

53
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:49,960
This is what deep affection
between husband and wife

54
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,360
is...

55
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,440
Is truly about.

56
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,320
Yes, yes.

57
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,600
I also heard

58
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,550
that the Empress Dowager wants to
choose a concubine for Your Highness.

59
00:03:58,550 --> 00:03:59,910
And I share that view.

60
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,360
While you're recovering

61
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,600
in the residence,

62
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,240
why not let me

63
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,340
carefully select
a few good families for your consideration?

64
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:08,980
Then you can make the final decision.

65
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,320
The Empress Dowager's intent is clear.

66
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,560
I will deal with it in my own way.

67
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,839
Your Highness will have
to take a concubine eventually.

68
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,120
Rather than let the Empress Dowager
force someone in,

69
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,160
why not choose someone

70
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,440
you actually favor?

71
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,840
Rest assured,

72
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:27,960
I will choose a young lady

73
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,240
from a good family

74
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:30,920
with all the right qualities,

75
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,300
preferably someone even better than me.

76
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,720
But to have such a fine girl

77
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,720
as a mere concubine

78
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,040
would be quite the injustice.

79
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,800
Once she bears an heir for Your Highness,

80
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,230
you could petition
to make her the principal wife.

81
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:42,290
That wouldn't be out of the question.

82
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,240
What do you mean by this, Tan?

83
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,560
Does His Highness's
injury need herbal decoctions?

84
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,560
How long before

85
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,280
he can bathe again?

86
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,520
Take good care of yourself, Your Highness.

87
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,120
I won't disturb you further.

88
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,100
I'll visit again another day.

89
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:18,660
Second Young Master Shu, please stay.

90
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,160
The medicine's delivered,

91
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,820
so I should be the one to leave.

92
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:23,540
Your Highness.

93
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:25,580
I... I'll walk Her Highness out.

94
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:29,310
Your Highness, slow down.

95
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:31,130
What's wrong with Her Highness?

96
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,560
Qizhi,

97
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,860
how did you offend her?

98
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:37,590
I just took a flogging on her behalf.

99
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:39,450
What more could I have done wrong?

100
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,680
There are things I shouldn't say...

101
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,920
Then don't say them.

102
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,200
I must.

103
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,680
For your sake, Qizhi,

104
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,040
I must.

105
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:51,680
You must understand:

106
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,320
only with tolerance
can we accommodate others,

107
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,320
and only with depth can we bear weight.

108
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,800
Flowers need rain and dew,

109
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,800
and women need gentleness and care.

110
00:05:58,870 --> 00:05:59,940
If Her Highness is upset,

111
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,500
she has her reasons.

112
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,950
Women often overthink and doubt.

113
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:05,950
Bad moods are natural.

114
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:07,530
And if there's blame to go around,

115
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:09,290
it falls on us men.

116
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:10,420
Qizhi,

117
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,100
you must learn to be understanding.

118
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,660
Develop a heart vast as Mount Tai,

119
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,090
broad as rivers that accept every stream.

120
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,000
Don't ask for reasons,

121
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,830
don't argue right or wrong.

122
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,960
Just offer a sincere apology.

123
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,360
It'll smooth things over

124
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:25,710
and dispel any discord.

125
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:28,150
What nonsense.

126
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,040
You don't even have a woman

127
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:30,960
close to you.

128
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,240
What right do you have to lecture me?

129
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,300
These were wise words from my father.

130
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:37,680
That's all I have to say.

131
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,240
Take care of yourself, Qizhi.

132
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,120
I'll visit another time.

133
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,670
Hey, wait...

134
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,159
No need to see me out.

135
00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:46,840
I'm not the one who's injured.

136
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,600
Sir, bear with it.

137
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,440
When did

138
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:13,680
Prince of Dingbei's Mansion

139
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,610
gain such a girl?

140
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:32,220
Chai Gui,

141
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,120
take this to His Highness while it's hot.

142
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:34,919
-Hurry.
-Yes.

143
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,000
Wait.

144
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,610
What's His Highness meal today?

145
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:44,790
This West River stew,

146
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:47,660
and this Yunmeng pork,

147
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:49,480
his favorites.

148
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:51,320
His Highness is seriously injured.

149
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,720
He should watch his diet.

150
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:54,650
Heavy meat,

151
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,400
high salt, greasy dishes,

152
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:58,140
none are good for recovery.

153
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,500
Your Highness,

154
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:17,970
external wounds

155
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,040
only require avoiding alcohol and spice.

156
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,920
It's not like

157
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,380
he can't touch meat at all.

158
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,370
A balanced diet of meat and vegetables

159
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,330
is best for healing.

160
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,960
I'll prepare a proper meal plan

161
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,600
for the kitchen to follow.

162
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,000
His Highness risked it all,

163
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,720
flying into a rage for Her Highness's sake.

164
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,960
Such love,

165
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,840
even Heaven bears witness.

166
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:55,750
But still, that thing he did

167
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,800
was too reckless.

168
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:58,410
Even I couldn't bear to watch.

169
00:09:58,410 --> 00:09:59,680
Still, rest assured, Your Highness,

170
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,440
everyone in the mansion

171
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:02,880
is on your side.

172
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:04,120
To us, there is only one true mistress

173
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:04,760
of this household,

174
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,360
and that's you.

175
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:08,880
Isn't that right?

176
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,070
You may all go.

177
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:46,600
Sir,

178
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,330
it's time to eat.

179
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,360
Is the mansion tight on money lately?

180
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,010
Her...

181
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,520
Have Concubine Yun

182
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,480
deliver this to His Highness later.

183
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,520
He's injured.

184
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,430
A calming scent

185
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:31,730
will help him sleep.

186
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,250
Yes, Your Highness.

187
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,840
I'd say Your Highness

188
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,800
has a sharp tongue but a soft heart.

189
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:44,020
He did get hurt because of me, after all.

190
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:47,440
I just don't want to owe him anything.

191
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,280
Yes.

192
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:55,900
Your Highness,

193
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,280
there are many new trinkets

194
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,560
and ornaments on South Yuhe Street.

195
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,820
Why not go for a stroll?

196
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,490
Getting out and about

197
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,290
is surely better than
moping around the mansion.

198
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:12,580
[Prince of Dingbei's Mansion]

199
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,930
Your Highness, where are you heading?

200
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,440
Madam Yun, such recklessness and disrespect

201
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,840
is completely improper.

202
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,320
So what if you know martial arts?

203
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,920
Does that make you superior?

204
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,960
Since you've entered
the Prince of Dingbei's Mansion,

205
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,840
you ought to follow
the rules and observe proper conduct.

206
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,370
If you offend Her Highness,

207
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,130
can you bear the consequences?

208
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,290
Enough. Let her be.

209
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:40,730
[Prince of Dingbei's Mansion]

210
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,480
Madam Yun, how can you
be so ignorant of protocol?

211
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:00,210
Do you even see
the Her Highness as your superior?

212
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,050
I see no one above Her Highness.

213
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:03,510
Then are you aware

214
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,160
according to proper customs and etiquette,

215
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,400
a concubine may not

216
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,960
share a carriage

217
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,080
with the Prince and Princess Consort,

218
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,480
unless explicitly permitted.

219
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,240
I'm aware.

220
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,920
And yet you act so brazenly?

221
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,660
This was His Highness's instruction.

222
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,860
He said that if Her Highness goes out,

223
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,720
I must not leave her side.

224
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,730
Is this meant as a show of force,

225
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,780
or are you trying
to force me to acknowledge her?

226
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:28,800
Well then,

227
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,430
since it's His Highness's command,

228
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:32,330
let Concubine Yun come along,

229
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:34,050
so others won't accuse me

230
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:36,830
of being petty

231
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:38,990
and unable to tolerate a concubine.

232
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:42,840
[Prince of Dingbei's Mansion]

233
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,760
Miss, have a look at our fans.

234
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:00,120
All handcrafted.

235
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:09,730
This one is elegant and understated.

236
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:12,630
This one is dignified and graceful.

237
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,490
Each has its own charm.

238
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,300
Which one do you like?

239
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:20,960
Thank you, Your Highness.

240
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:23,160
I don't usually use fans.

241
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,880
And there's no reason for the Princess

242
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,410
to buy a fan for a concubine.

243
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:38,740
How could Madam Yun
be so unaware of her place?

244
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,480
How long does she intend to follow us?

245
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,780
With her tailing us like this,

246
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,760
it just feels off.

247
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:48,290
What feels off?

248
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:51,110
I can't quite explain.

249
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:53,330
In any case,

250
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,890
find an excuse to
send her back to the mansion.

251
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:57,450
I want some time alone.

252
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:08,960
You've already shared
Her Highness's carriage,

253
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,560
and followed along this far.

254
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:13,200
You should return now, Madam Yun.

255
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,400
Her Highness hasn't returned yet.

256
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,840
How could I go ahead of her?

257
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,200
If something happens to her,

258
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,120
what then?

259
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,600
You being here would cause more danger.

260
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,930
What do you mean by that?

261
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,060
Can't you tell, Madam Yun?

262
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,220
Her Highness doesn't want to see you.

with Madam Yun and Suxin.

287

It's just for recovery. Nothing so extreme.

On the battlefield, food is often scarce.

Isn't this better than that?

But that was then, this is now.

298
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,880

goes nowhere else.

307

He lives alone

308
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,830
and avoids political networking.

309

Didn't expect

00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:40,420
to run into Your Highness here.

322
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,520
Who is that?

323
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:46,520
Her Highness didn't seem

324

to know him.

Her Highness's matters

326

aren't your concern, Concubine.

327

We're all part
of the household. It's only right.

328
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,320
Who says that?

329
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:05,310
Vice Minister Liu. How do you know me?

330
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,220
Your Highness,

331
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,760
have you truly forgotten me?

332
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,480
You've brought this guqin
for repair dozens of times.

333
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,680
It really can't be fixed anymore.

334
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,480
Perhaps it's time to replace it.

335
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,080
Once I pass the Spring Imperial Exam

336
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,280
and receive a salary, I'll buy a new one.

337

Mr. Fang.

338
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:32,390

As it happens,

342
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,020
Fourth Miss, the one
you ordered last time has arrived.

343
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:42,340
Much appreciated.

344
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:48,870
This really is a fine instrument.

345
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:54,540
Sir,

346
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,280
do you have

347
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:58,420
any used guqin at a lower price?

348
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:01,240
We only sell new ones here.

349
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,620
But if you're serious,

350
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,000
I'll keep an eye out.

351
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:06,920
Can't say when one will appear though.

352
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,440
Thank you, sir.

353
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:09,800
Oh.

354
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,840
If it's not too much trouble,

355
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,700
I could help around the shop,
run errands, odd jobs,

356
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,760
and use the wages
to offset the price of a new guqin.

357
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,920
Would that be acceptable?

358
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:18,920
Well…

359
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,680
Young Master, might I have the honor

360
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:30,890
of hearing you play?

361
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,240
I'm afraid my guqin is too damaged.

362
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,770
You might be disappointed.

363
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,280
Suxin,

364
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,600
fetch my guqin.

365
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,360
Catalpa wood, Fuxi style,

366
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,960
lacquered smooth as oil.

367
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,010
Young Miss, if you don't mind,

368
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:01,450
I shall humbly perform.

369
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:33,900
You truly are devoted to the guqin.

370
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,480
How can a guqin lover be without one?

371
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:42,410
Here, consider this guqin a gift from me,

372
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:44,660
as a token of shared passion.

373
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:49,230
To play this guqin is already my fortune.

374
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,280
But I dare not

375
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,880
accept such a generous gift.

376
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,000
Your kindness

377
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,440
will stay with me.

378
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:56,690
Farewell.

379
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,130
Young Master. Please wait.

380
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,830
My lady has a new guqin now.

381
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:04,560
This old one

382
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,600
will only collect dust on the shelf.

383
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,400
Please take it,

384
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:09,480
treat it with care.

385
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:12,380
Let it be your memento
of this melody you shared.

386
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:17,810
[Marquis of Jing'an's Mansion]

387
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:25,240
To hear one's music
is to know their heart,

388
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:27,040
and to resonate with each chord.

389
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:28,530
That one song just now

390
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,360
proves you have the talent of Bo Ya.

391
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,340
May you one day, like the legends,

392
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,160
pluck strings like pines

393
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,090
in mountain winds, or silence them

394
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:42,030
more powerful than rain on Tai Mountain.

395
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:47,440
One should not
receive reward without merit.

396
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,000
I cannot

397
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,520
accept such a gift lightly, Young Miss.

398
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,120
Earlier, hearing your tune

399
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,410
was like witnessing
all the beauty under heaven.

400
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:56,250
Exchanging a guqin for a song,

401
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,890
clearly, I got the better deal.

402
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,450
To hear one's music is to know their heart,

403
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,320
and to resonate with each chord.

404
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:43,760
Miss Ming,

405
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:45,320
surely you know

406
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,180
the second half of that poem goes:

407
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:49,980
“Cease lamenting Heaven's melody,

408
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,440
let it join

409
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,490
our hearts in harmony.”

410
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,320
That was never my intention.

411
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,020
Vice Minister Liu,

412
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,520
you're stretching the meaning too far.

413
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,840
The gift of the guqin back then

414
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,500
was a gesture of passing fate.

415
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:06,930
As for that matter,

416
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:09,860
I've long put it behind me.

417
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:12,810
To you, it was a passing gesture,

418
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,700
but to me, it's remained unforgettable.

419
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,650
Vice Minister Liu, mind your words.

420
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:21,300
I am already married,
a woman with a husband,

421
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,820
the Princess Consort of Prince of Dingbei.

422
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:25,640
The one I entrust my life to

423
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:28,660
is none other than
my husband, Prince of Dingbei.

424
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,160
I ask you, Vice Minister Liu,

425
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,440
to put an end to these deluded thoughts.

426
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:35,770
Show some respect.

427
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:43,660
This scent...

428
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:46,360
I know I am unworthy of you, Miss Ming.

429
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:48,070
All I hope

430
00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:54,100
is for your safety and well-being.

431
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:17,530
We barely know each other.

432
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,120
We're strangers in passing.

433
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,850
Vice Minister Liu, don't you think

434
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:25,610
these words are

435
00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:27,330
rather presumptuous and inappropriate?

436
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:29,060
More than just inappropriate.

437
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,730
Vice Minister Liu, what is the meaning

438
00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:41,270
of pestering my Princess Consort?

439
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:43,670
Your Highness, don't jump to conclusions.

440
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:45,510
If I am misunderstood, so be it.

441
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,710
But don't wrongly accuse the Princess.

442
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:50,710
Tan has always been above reproach.

443
00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:53,190
It's others

444
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:56,250
who may harbor hidden intentions.

445
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,400
Tonight, I...

446
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:58,300
I don't care

447
00:26:58,330 --> 00:26:59,490
why you're here.

448
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,260
Tan's safety

449
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:03,220
is the responsibility of the palace guards.

450
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:04,190
And her future,

451
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:06,430
will be protected by me alone.

452
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,160
I suggest you

453
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,610
know your place.

454
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:50,670
Why are you upset today?

455
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:53,370
You know the answer.

456
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:55,200
You and Vice Minister Liu

457
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,970
ran into each other by chance earlier?

458
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:03,020
If you ever see him again,

459
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,810
you'd better avoid him.

460
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,310
Vice Minister Liu and I

461
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,440
knew each other in the past.

462
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:15,640
A brief encounter and a few words.

463
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:16,910
It's quite normal.

464
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:18,600
Why should I avoid him?

465
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,610
From before?

466
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:20,570
That's right.

467
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:23,330
I met Vice Minister Liu

468
00:28:23,650 --> 00:28:27,470
five years before I ever

469
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:28,560
met Your Highness.

470
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:37,050
Your meeting a man at night in private,

471
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:38,310
is that proper?

472
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,480
Me, meeting a man in private?

473
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,240
Did you feel it improper

474
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,280
when you met with other women?

475
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,760
Official duties have
piled up in the Capital Garrison.

476
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:45,960
I work day and night.

477
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,360
How would I have time for secret meetings?

478
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,910
She's already entered your mansion,

479
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:50,840
and yet you still defend yourself?

480
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:54,800
Feeling guilty, are you?

481
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,400
Men are all the same.

482
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:59,020
And you, Jiang Qizhi,
you're the worst of them.

483
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:02,220
All your promises and vows,

484
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:04,170
nothing but lies.

485
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,900
So you are angry with me

486
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:11,650
because of Yun Yi?

487
00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:13,290
Still acting?

488
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:16,700
You truly are a master of playing dumb.

489
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,040
Lately,

490
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:20,480
the Empress Dowager, citing the need

491
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,880
for heirs of our mansion,

492
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,480
planned to arrange a concubine for me.

493
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:26,280
So you just went along with it

494
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,930
and took in a concubine?

495
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,080
Why not go all the way

496
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:32,280
and bring Fengzhao

497
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,400
into the mansion too?

498
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:36,040
The Empress Dowager's been trying

499
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,160
to pair you two for ages.

500
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,200
That way,

501
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:39,810
you could fully enjoy

502
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:42,540
the blessings of many women.

503
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,760
I don't like a crowded household.

504
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,000
You say that, but...

505
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,660
Yun Yi is a secret guard of Jinyun Guards,

506
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:49,390
no less skilled than Zhuiying.

507
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,280
Bringing her in as a concubine

508
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:54,320
was to avoid the Empress Dowager's meddling

509
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,850
while also protecting your safety in secret.

510
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:05,840
So...

She's not a real concubine?

She's just a secret guard?

513

Why didn't you say so earlier?

it couldn't be made public.

you took in a concubine

00:37:31,050 --> 00:37:32,650
but only finds fault with me.

681
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:33,870
Better to

682
00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:35,370
avoid him from now on.

683
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:38,680
That's called fate binding foes.

684
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:40,240
If I can't find a husband,

685
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,350
you'll marry me, right?

686
00:37:41,350 --> 00:37:42,390
I'll marry you.

687
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:48,800
We have food now.

688
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:49,730
Here, thank you.

689
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:53,400
Here.

690
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:54,840
Take it.

691
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:56,600
Eat slowly.

692
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,760
So good, Mom!

693
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:00,680
Go over there.

694
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:06,130
Come, take your medicine.

695
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:08,400
Be careful.

696
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:08,920
Okay.

697
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,000
Mom, you eat too.

698
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,200
I'm fine. Eat slowly.

699
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,360
Here.

700
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:14,480
Thank you!

701
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:21,640
Minmin, be careful.

702
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:22,840
Don't hurt yourself.

703
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:26,280
No need. I can handle it.

704
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,160
Go help someone else.

705
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:28,400
Why help someone else?

706
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,060
Of course I'm here to help you!

707
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:32,120
You're so strange, honestly.

708
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:33,320
Well...

709
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:35,160
Minmin, I said I want to help you.

710
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:36,370
Is that wrong?

711
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,270
L–Let me hold this for you.

712
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,280
No need.

713
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:39,920
Minmin.

714
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,680
Could I trouble you for another bowl?

715
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,400
Kids! Come get roast chicken!

716
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,280
Want some roast chicken? Come on.

717
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,640
I want some, Miss!

718
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:54,840
Be careful.

719
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:55,910
No need to rush.

720
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,300
There's plenty for everyone.

721
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:58,040
I want a drumstick!

722
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:58,960
I want another piece!

723
00:38:58,960 --> 00:38:59,640
Me too!

724
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:01,000
It's been so long since we had meat!

725
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,480
I'll get it!

726
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,360
Easy now. Don't fight.

727
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,720
Everyone will get some.

728
00:39:07,730 --> 00:39:08,660
Drumstick girl!

729
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:11,640
Who are you?

730
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,410
We met briefly yesterday

731
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:15,230
at Prince of Dingbei's Mansion.

732
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:21,200
But I'd never

733
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,240
seen you there before.

734
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,120
Are you new to the mansion?

735
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:26,410
Are we that familiar?

736
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:27,760
You don't live at the mansion,

737
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:30,160
isn't it normal you haven't seen me before?

738
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,650
At present, the number
of registered refugees

739
00:39:33,650 --> 00:39:34,980
is 164.

740
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,700
Each gets 20 qian
worth of porridge and cakes daily,

741
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:38,160
and two strings of coins
for clothing and bedding.

742
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,620
All the numbers check out.

743
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:41,720
Clearly, you and your brother

744
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,120
have done your part well.

745
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:44,740
Your Highness's charity

746
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:45,810
has given

747
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:46,770
our people hope.

748
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,800
Of course, we must do our part

749
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:51,100
and avoid adding unnecessary expenses.

750
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:55,900
This...

751
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:57,960
Roof repairs,

752
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:58,880
medical care,

753
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,200
firewood for various locations,

754
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,260
all require funds.

755
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:02,690
Take this first.

756
00:40:02,730 --> 00:40:04,730
Record all expenses as they come.

757
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:06,610
Thank you, Your Highness.

758
00:40:06,650 --> 00:40:08,650
I'll go check on the others up front.

759
00:40:12,330 --> 00:40:13,330
By the way, Yun Yi,

760
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:15,740
why did you join the Jinyun Guards?

761
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:17,180
Isn't that job harsh?

762
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:20,200
It's not harsh.

763
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:24,200
I was orphaned and helpless since childhood.

764
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:27,840
I survived thanks to His Highness.

765
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,230
So I swore loyalty

766
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:31,130
to him for life.

767
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:33,420
But he told me,

768
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,040
once I entered the mansion,

769
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,570
he'd no longer be my master,

770
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:37,970
Your Highness would be.

771
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:39,850
You are your own person.

772
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:42,020
You don't need a master.

773
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:47,400
But Suxin and Lyu'e

774
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:49,440
both see you as theirs.

775
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:52,590
That's just their duty.

776
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:54,710
If one day

777
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:56,610
they find a good future elsewhere

778
00:40:56,790 --> 00:40:57,810
and know

779
00:40:57,980 --> 00:40:59,510
what kind of life they want,

780
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,830
I won't stop them.

781
00:41:02,890 --> 00:41:05,530
As for me, I've got no one.

782
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:08,160
I'll follow Your Highness wherever you go.

783
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:14,440
[Capital]

784
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:17,580
Open the gates!

785
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:25,200
Marquis of Jing'an
failed in disaster relief!

786
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,560
He's negligent and careless!

787
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,560
He doesn't care if people live or die!

788
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,040
Don't push! Don't run!

789
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:34,760
We beg His Majesty to deliver justice.

790
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:37,680
Go report this to the officials.

791
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:38,040
Yes!

792
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,810
Everyone, come with me!

793
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:41,840
Xu!

794
00:41:43,490 --> 00:41:46,020
Something's happened to Marquis of Jing'an!

795
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:50,360
How dare you!

796
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:57,880
Is this

797
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:59,940
a charity hall sheltering refugees?

798
00:42:00,490 --> 00:42:02,580
Are you from Lizhou?

799
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:03,980
Yes, yes, that's right.

800
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:04,720
Alright.

801
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:05,840
Everyone, please

802
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:07,040
head to the tents to rest first.

803
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,300
Once we've finished registering your names,

804
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:10,020
I'll take you to receive your food.

805
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:11,000
-Let's go, let's go!
-Quickly!

806
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:11,480
-This way.

807
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:12,240
Let's go.

808
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:13,420
This is wonderful.

809
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:15,840
There's more if it's not enough!

810
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:17,040
Eat slowly, eat slowly.

811
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:17,760
You'll definitely have your fill.

812
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:18,420
Here you go.

813
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,130
There's more if you need it!

814
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,180
This is for you.

815
00:42:22,570 --> 00:42:23,400
That's better now.

816
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:24,930
Greetings, Your Highness.

817
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:25,840
Everyone,

818
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:28,110
this is the Princess of Dingbei.

819
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:29,970
This relief hall

820
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:32,140
was built and funded by Her Highness.

821
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,060
The refugees from Lizhou

822
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:36,460
were also resettled thanks to her efforts.

823
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:38,410
Princess of Dingbei.

824
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:41,500
Isn't she the daughter
of the Marquis of Jing'an?

825
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:42,560
The daughter of the Marquis of Jing'an?

826
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,280
Thank you, Your Highness!

827
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:45,400
Thank you, Your Highness!

828
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:47,000
There's no need for all this.

829
00:42:47,070 --> 00:42:48,830
The Marquis of Jing'an is my father.

830
00:42:48,830 --> 00:42:50,530
He went to Lizhou for disaster relief,

831
00:42:50,530 --> 00:42:51,990
and I couldn't be of much help.

832
00:42:51,990 --> 00:42:54,440
So I'm simply doing
what little I can here in the capital.

833
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:55,820
If there's anything you need,

834
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:56,980
just let Jin Er know.

835
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:58,720
It was the Marquis of Jing'an

836
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:00,200
who left us homeless!

837
00:43:00,490 --> 00:43:02,130
Relief? He did no such thing!

838
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:04,080
He brought ruin to the people!

839
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:04,900
That's right!

840
00:43:05,890 --> 00:43:06,750
How can that be?

841
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:08,450
My father was sent
to Lizhou by imperial decree.

842
00:43:08,450 --> 00:43:09,760
He would have done everything in his power

843
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,090
and put the people first.

844
00:43:11,090 --> 00:43:12,800
There's no way it happened as you claim.

845
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:13,840
Why not?

846
00:43:13,870 --> 00:43:15,490
The Marquis of Jing'an failed in his duties!

847
00:43:15,490 --> 00:43:17,170
Many in Lizhou

848
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:18,440
died in vain!

849
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,560
My son was perfectly fine.

850
00:43:21,370 --> 00:43:23,850
But the Marquis conscripted him

851
00:43:23,870 --> 00:43:26,250
to help with the flood defense.

852
00:43:26,650 --> 00:43:28,430
He was swept away by the floodwaters,

853
00:43:28,430 --> 00:43:30,250
and we still haven't found his body.

854
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:31,990
Give me back my son!

855
00:43:32,010 --> 00:43:32,810
Don't be rash!

856
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:34,680
Don't be rash!

857
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:35,000
Give me back my son!

858
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,130
Stay calm!

859
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:38,230
What right do you have?
