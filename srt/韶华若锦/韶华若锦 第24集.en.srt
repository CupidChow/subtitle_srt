[Youthful Glory]

2
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,890
[Episode 24]

3
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,370
Just a guess.

4
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:42,800
I wonder how many

5
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,660
more surprises Mr. Wen is hiding.

6
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,300
Let's hope they won't disappoint me.

7
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,320
What you saw today

8
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,800
is just an appetizer.

9
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,600
You'll see

10
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,530
my true capabilities another day.

11
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,600
The auction in Lingzhou City,

12
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,930
hosted by the Su family,

13
00:01:57,039 --> 00:01:58,880
is nothing short of a spectacular.

14
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,200
The items on offer are rare—

15
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,850
not something money alone can buy.

16
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,560
If you'd honor me with your presence,

17
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,680
I will certainly reserve

18
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,880
the best seat for you.

19
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:11,560
I guarantee you won't be disappointed.

20
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,710
Only today do I truly feel

21
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,760
coming to Lingzhou City

22
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:17,740
was the right decision.

23
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,200
Please.

24
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,370
Chancellor,

25
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,820
according to the news from Lingzhou,

26
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,320
only Prince of Dingbei

27
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,120
and Officer Shu

28
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,390
arrived in Lingzhou.

29
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,560
Princess Consort reportedly

30
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,400
turned back before entering Lingzhou.

31
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,700
Yet, all this time,

32
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:40,590
our scouts have found

33
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,270
no trace of her

34
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:43,420
on the return route.

35
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,400
Prince of Dingbei has achieved his goal.

36
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,510
If they still choose to press the matter,

37
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,190
the Su family

38
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:56,840
would be left with no choice
but to eliminate all threats.

39
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,720
But if the Su family acts personally,

40
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,520
I'm afraid

41
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,600
it may implicate you.

42
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,000
I have my own plans.

43
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,170
Any news on Yu Bozhong's whereabouts?

44
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,640
None as of yet.

45
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,200
Ever since he fled wounded that day,

46
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,200
he has vanished without a trace.

47
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,600
I'll continue to have men search for him.

48
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,840
I never expected him

49
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,920
to be Chief of Haiyou Sect.

50
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,800
I chose him as the Su family's son-in-law

51
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,810
because he seemed loyal and honest.

52
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,040
But after all these years

53
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,000
of cultivating him and granting him

54
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,400
wealth and status,

55
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:41,560
he repaid the Su family

56
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,780
with betrayal!

57
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,440
Idiot. Idiot.

58
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,320
Master.

59
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,920
The new batch of goods has arrived.

60
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,240
Tell Su Errong

61
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,760
that she can start preparing

62
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,440
for this month's auction.

63
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,360
All the goods this time are top-quality.

64
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:10,600
Yes.

65
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,320
Master, you wanted to catch attention

66
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:20,800
of Xian's authorities

67
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,090
through the contraband, so that they

68
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,040
could investigate the Su family.

69
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,320
But now, Miss He

70
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,630
came uninvited.

71
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,540
I wonder

72
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,250
what her true intention is.

73
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,120
She's certainly no ordinary person.

74
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,440
She saw through the flaws

75
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,520
in the tie-dyed silk at a glance,

76
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,240
and followed the lead of a hairpin

77
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,020
all the way to Fu Lu Gold Store.

78
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,720
She's certainly not here

79
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,920
just to eat and sightsee.

80
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,159
She's not with the authorities,

81
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,150
yet she sensed something amiss.

82
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,150
Moreover,

83
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:03,510
Prince of Dingbei is now in Lingzhou.

84
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,400
Prince of Dingbei

85
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,240
came for the Su family.

86
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,840
If he can discover

87
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,380
clues about the Su family's smuggling,

88
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,360
he'll surely investigate thoroughly.

89
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,880
leaving them nowhere to escape.

90
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,720
I spent years planning in Lingzhou,

91
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,320
taking each step carefully.

92
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:20,560
Now,

93
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,240
it's finally time to put an end to it.

[Shengyi Inn]

95
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,560
I think you

96
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,080
are a smooth-talking,

97
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:32,920
disloyal,

98
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,590
and fickle playboy!

99
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,720
Last time we were together,

100
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,680
you said sweet words.

101
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,440
You said next time we met,

102
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,760
you'd make me a roast chicken.

103
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,950
I did say that,

104
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:40,560
but...

105
00:05:41,159 --> 00:05:42,080
you insisted

106
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,200
on doing it yourself.

107
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,320
If I hadn't done it myself,

108
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,720
I would have starved to death!

109
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,000
Tell me,

110
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,820
this time we meet,

111
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,320
did you make a roast chicken for me?

112
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,360
I haven't even seen a chicken foot,

113
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,600
let alone a roast chicken!

114
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,560
I think

115
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,390
you're not sincere at all.

116
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,290
That's because you are injured

117
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,120
and shouldn't eat greasy food.

118
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,080
Do you really think

119
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,600
your roast chicken tasted good?

120
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,200
It was dry and bland.

121
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,200
You didn't even pluck all the feathers!

122
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,660
Even pigs wouldn't eat it!

123
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,200
Miss Yun, that is not

124
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,400
what you said before.

125
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,310
What did I say?

126
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:10,580
That my roast chicken

127
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,520
was the second best delicacy in the world.

128
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,560
That was just lip service.

129
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,160
You actually believed that?

130
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,720
If it really wasn't tasty,

131
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,000
why did you just eat

132
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,400
more than half a chicken?

133
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,400
When people are starving,

134
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,680
they'll even eat pig slop,

135
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,000
let alone roast chickens.

136
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,880
If that's really the case,

137
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,200
why did you ask me

138
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,280
for the secret recipe?

139
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:26,760
I...

140
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,680
You should learn.

141
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,240
Look at this lady. How improper.

142
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,760
You...

143
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,240
You... You shrew...

144
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:52,720
This way.

145
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,780
Look at him. And look at yourself.

146
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,000
Wash all the clothes after we go back.

147
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,880
Not just the clothes.

148
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,760
I'll wash the shoes and socks too.

149
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,920
Let's go eat.

150
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,000
My Lady,

151
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,100
the bedding has been changed.

152
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,430
It's the finest, right?

153
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,080
Yes.

154
00:07:33,159 --> 00:07:33,920
Also,

155
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,640
tell the kitchen

156
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,240
to prepare some wine and dishes—

157
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,240
nothing too rich,

158
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,480
just something that goes well with drinks.

159
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,280
Yes.

160
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,600
You may all leave.

161
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,720
-Yes.
-Yes.

162
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,360
Such tender bliss—

163
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,080
who wouldn't be enchanted?

164
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,160
Why do I think something is missing

165
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,760
by this bed?

166
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,560
Shall I fetch

167
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,520
the glass lamp

168
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,780
your husband gave you?

169
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,600
You insolent maid! How dare you mock me!

170
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,760
Forgive me, My Lady!

171
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,320
It was just a slip of the tongue.

172
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,320
I forgot to change
how I should address him.

173
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,080
Get lost!

174
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:29,880
Yes.

175
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,039
Come back.

176
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,520
Bring the glass lamp.

177
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,679
Place it here.

178
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,520
Yes.

179
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,480
My Lady,

180
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,280
our watchers delivered a message.

181
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,200
Officer Shu made a move.

182
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,640
Zhang Huaiyu still

183
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,370
hasn't shown up in the capital.

184
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,560
The claim of his return to the capital

185
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,520
should be Prince of Dingbei's attempt

186
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,000
to distract us.

187
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,080
He's not

188
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,410
an easy one to deal with.

189
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,780
Although he's retrieved the tax,

190
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:14,540
he might
have something else up his sleeve.

191
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,650
Send more men to keep a close watch.

192
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,220
Whatever Zhang Huaiyu has

193
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,080
must not fall into anyone else's hands.

194
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,240
Yes.

195
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,600
He came all the way here

196
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,720
just to avoid attention.

197
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,180
He must be up to something.

198
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,250
Where on earth is he going?

199
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,760
People always say nature calls,

200
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,820
but why isn't she slightly bothered?

201
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,920
Why are you here?

202
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,000
Why are you here?

203
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,450
She's fishing here.

204
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:01,640
Of course I'm here keeping an eye on her.

205
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,770
He's been circling around on the cart.

206
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:05,520
Why haven't the backup people

207
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,640
arrived yet?

208
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,360
Stop talking!

209
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,200
Hurry! Keep up!

210
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,080
I'm exhausted.

211
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,720
Why did you bring so much food?

212
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,440
It's enough for us

213
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,500
to have a few rounds of meals tonight.

214
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,470
What would you like to eat tonight,
Second Young Master Shu?

215
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:39,320
You didn't get to try
the grilled fish last time.

216
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,780
How about trying it today?

217
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:43,720
The fish I caught today

218
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,880
would surely be tasty if we grill them.

219
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,560
But roast chickens are not bad either.

220
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,560
What do you think?

221
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,560
Didn't you think

222
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,280
my roast chicken was so awful

223
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,130
that even pigs wouldn't eat it?

224
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,320
Pigs aren't that lucky.

225
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,700
So,

226
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,050
you were just acting back at the inn?

227
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,380
You actually meant the opposite?

228
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,400
Second Young Master Shu,

229
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,860
weren't you acting even more convincingly?

230
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:13,240
I...

231
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,280
But in my opinion,

232
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,720
you don't need to keep acting.

233
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,360
Those two fools are far behind.

234
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,720
They can't hear a thing.

235
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,490
His Highness's idea

236
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,720
is truly brilliant.

237
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,400
Just a quarrel has made them

238
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,010
utterly confused.

239
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,160
Interesting.

240
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,800
Your Highness, why are you here?

241
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,060
I thought it was Ms. Su

242
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,400
who invited me here.

243
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,160
I guess Ms. Su

244
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,040
misunderstood.

245
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,600
She must think I like you,

246
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,200
so she's trying to play matchmaker.

247
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,320
Ms. Su thinks

248
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,920
you like me?

249
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,150
So you mean

250
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,320
you don't like me?

251
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,250
That's...

252
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,080
not what I meant.

253
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,820
Then what did you mean?

254
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,080
Right,

255
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:41,640
of course you don't like me.

256
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,050
After all,

257
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,240
Miss Qingyu alone

258
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:48,440
outshines all the beauties.

259
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,400
Where is Miss Qingyu?

260
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,460
Why didn't you bring her back?

261
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:11,240
Are you waiting for an auspicious day

262
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,600
to bring her back from Hui House?

263
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,880
Do you really want me

264
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,600
to bring her back?

265
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,440
That's what you want.

266
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,320
Why did you say I want that?

267
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,400
Don't you know

268
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,720
if I want that or not?

269
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,280
Indeed, a drunk man's words

270
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,810
are a sober man's thoughts.

271
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,520
So much for starting over

272
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,780
and pursuing me again.

273
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,440
It was all a lie.

274
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,880
I heard Prince of Dingbei's Mansion
is a lonely place.

275
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,560
If Princess Consort
could have someone for company,

276
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,690
that would be great.

277
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,000
It's just that

278
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,120
I'm not considerate enough.

279
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,200
I don't know how to serve you.

280
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,230
I'm simply not destined

281
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,760
to be your family.

282
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:03,760
Fine.

283
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,520
I'll order someone

284
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,280
to bring her here now.

285
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,200
Why did you hit me?

286
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,840
I haven't even asked you

287
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,360
about

288
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,910
you being fickle,

289
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,440
and you're accusing me first.

290
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,190
Me being fickle? When?

291
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:33,800
I...

292
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,400
Xu,

293
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,360
we're in Su's Mansion.

294
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,630
Just because we're in Su's Mansion,

295
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:49,360
we should act more recklessly.

296
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,800
Consummating our marriage here

297
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,860
is not appropriate. Don't you think?

298
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,650
I'd love to,

299
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,400
but I have urgent matters to handle.

300
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,720
Yu is still waiting for me.

301
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,720
I'll be back soon.

302
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,920
I have to trouble you

303
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,000
to finish this act.

304
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,240
How am I supposed

305
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,770
to finish this act on my own?

306
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,720
I see.

307
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,359
Keep watching.

308
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,920
Tender romance

309
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,819
is the path to the underworld.

310
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,760
Money and women—

311
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,920
either of them will be your doom.

312
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:51,800
Granny.

313
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,880
-I can't go any further.
-I can't either.

314
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,610
If they move again,

315
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,740
you go follow them.

316
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,240
I... I'll rest for a while
and catch up later to take the shift.

317
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,500
I can't go any further.

318
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:17,290
Even if they move again,
I'm not going to follow them.

319
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,340
Where are they?

320
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:22,310
You're finally here.

321
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,520
Why don't you just wait until tomorrow

322
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,740
to show up?

323
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,120
You two have the nerve to complain?

324
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,020
The marks you left

325
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:27,880
are almost all over the city.

326
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:28,930
It's a miracle

327
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:29,720
we found this place.

328
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,350
Yeah.

329
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:31,410
Are they inside?

330
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,240
Yes.

331
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:33,420
We saw them go in.

332
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:34,400
That Shu fellow

333
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,560
circled around all day.

334
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,120
I think

335
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,320
he did that on purpose.

336
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,930
He was just trying
to conceal his true intention.

337
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:40,520
I think it's very likely

338
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,520
that they... they're meeting here.

339
00:18:58,840 --> 00:18:59,440
Guys,

340
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:00,480
Ms. Su gave an order.

341
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,080
We must find

342
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:01,760
Zhang Huaiyu

343
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,800
and take back the evidence.

344
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,640
Even if we kill the wrong one,

345
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,760
we can't let them escape!

346
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:05,310
Go!

347
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,490
Go, hurry.

348
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:09,720
I'm worn out.

349
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,670
If he circled around on purpose,

350
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:12,240
then...

351
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,440
that would be exactly his true intention.

352
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,400
Why do I think...

353
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,860
-we've been fooled?
-We've been fooled?

354
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,200
Granny, please stay.

355
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,560
You brought so many things.

356
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,080
I really can't accept them.

357
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:42,880
Madam,

358
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,360
we troubled you enough before.

359
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,000
Consider this

360
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,410
our way of thanking you.

361
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,560
You live alone,

362
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,880
so take good care of yourself.

363
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,400
Don't overwork yourself.

364
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:51,630
Okay.

365
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,880
This... This...

366
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,560
Boss.

367
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,440
I've checked.

368
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,700
There's no one inside.

369
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,390
Isn't that obvious?

370
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,880
Don't be afraid, Granny. They're with us.

371
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,010
You go inside first.

372
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:27,640
This...

373
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,130
Gentlemen, are you here

374
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:36,170
for Granny

375
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,480
or for the two of us?

376
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,880
You've been traveling all day.

377
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,080
You must have something urgent, right?

378
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,720
Let me explain.

379
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,080
We were ordered to come here

380
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,280
to protect you two.

381
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,600
And

382
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,760
whose order?

383
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,520
We are guards of the Su family.

384
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,160
Of course it's Ms. Su's order.

385
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,000
You came all the way from the capital,

386
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,680
and you're not familiar with this place.

387
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,480
The Su family

388
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,730
simply wishes to act as a proper host

389
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,480
and ensure your safety.

390
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,400
Yes, yes.

391
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,400
Well, that's...

392
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,880
very kind of Ms. Su.

393
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:10,680
Yeah.

394
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,360
No, no, no.

395
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,560
It's what we should do.

396
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,240
You're as stupid as pigs,

397
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,080
and you think everyone else

398
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,010
is just like you!

399
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,400
B-Boss,

400
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,880
should... should we kill them or not?

401
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,360
She called you a pig,
and you're really acting like one.

402
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,120
I just said

403
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:28,920
we're here to protect them.

404
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,760
Fighting them now
would be a slap in the face!

405
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,000
Boss, I get it now.

406
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:36,720
We're here to protect Officer Shu.

407
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:40,330
Let's... talk... properly.

408
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,200
Get... off me.

409
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,700
Move.

410
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,240
What time is it now?

411
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,520
Where are you from?

412
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,520
7 p.m. I'm from the north.

413
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:06,680
Sir.

414
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:10,880
Just delivering a few letters—

415
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,560
is that going to cost you your lives?

416
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,560
How many times do I have to say it

417
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,560
for you to understand?

418
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:14,960
I'm...

419
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:15,840
worried...

420
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,770
Someone might be worried about me.

421
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,640
It's just a few letters.

422
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,240
They don't even mention names or origins.

423
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,080
What's there to be afraid of?

424
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:22,720
All of you

425
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,800
have worked for Xu for too long,

426
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,730
and you've become as rigid as he is!

427
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:27,720
Young Lord Zhang, you're full of life

428
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,840
and eloquent.

429
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,560
Looks like I should lock you up
for a few more days

430
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,020
to smooth out your temper.

431
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,480
Xu.

432
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,760
What took you so long?

433
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,720
Miss Yun, you haven't fully recovered.

434
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,410
Did that fight earlier
affect your injuries?

435
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,140
Just a superficial wound.

436
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,080
I'm fine now.

437
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,480
Second Young Master Shu,

438
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,520
from now on, no matter what happens,

439
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,440
don't risk your life like that again.

440
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,640
But I'm a man.

441
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,290
Of course I should protect you.

442
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,440
I'm skilled in martial arts.

443
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,500
It should be me protecting you daily.

444
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,840
Miss Yun, do you think...

445
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,000
I'm completely useless?

446
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,460
Since we left the capital,

447
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:28,650
you've been the one
saving and protecting me.

448
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,280
I've been of no help,

449
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,600
and I've been a burden.

450
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:35,580
Not at all.

451
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,810
Everyone has their own strengths.

452
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,510
I might not be good

453
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,400
at what you excel in.

454
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,600
As they say, each plays their own role.

455
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,640

00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,300
flowery language,

517
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,850
I find them quite interesting.

518
00:25:54,960 --> 00:26:01,740
♪ Keep you and me,
unchanged even in old age ♪

519
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,310
I wish

520
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,640
this road

521
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,620
could never end.

522
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,720
That won't do.

523
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,530
Even if we're not tired,

524
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,040
the horse will be.

525
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,180
Slow down, please.

526
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,400
Heroes,

527
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,840
please slow down.

528
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,040
We can't walk any further.

529
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,480
Let us rest for a while.

530
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,080
Just a short break, please.

531
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,680
My Lady.

532
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,200
Come in.

533
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:47,700
My Lady,

534
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,090
around Officer Shu,

535
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,370
we didn't see Young Lord Zhang.

536
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:53,480
They only

537
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,840
took a ride to the outskirts.

538
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:57,080
But... our men were caught.

539
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,080
Your subordinates' failure

540
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,600
is your responsibility.

541
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,000
Those who are useless

542
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,080
don't deserve to stay in the Su family.

543
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:05,840
Yes.

544
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,240
But I think it's strange.

545
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,400
Even if Officer Shu

546
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,040
noticed someone tailing them,

547
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:11,560
it doesn't explain why

548
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,090
they took such a long detour

549
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,520
and deliberately aroused our suspicion.

550
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,850
Something's not right.

551
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,160
Could that...

552
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,280
be a diversion?

553
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,520
It's been almost two hours.

554
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,770
Why hasn't he come back yet?

555
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,560
My Lady.

556
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,360
Are they still inside?

557
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,120
My Lady,

558
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,800
I have been here the entire time.

559
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,200
They've never come out.

560
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,040
Was there any noise inside?

561
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,080
Did they...

562
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,480
I heard everything clearly.

563
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,460
Your Highness.

564
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:16,800
Miss He.

565
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,100
Your Highness?

566
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:25,900
Your Highness.

567
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,050
Your Highness?

568
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:50,700
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

569
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,000
Just now, the maid knocked on the door,

570
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,720
but there was no response
for quite a while.

571
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,450
Out of concern for your safety,

572
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:58,470
we entered without permission.

573
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,560
Miss He, what's wrong?

574
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,480
You should

575
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,880
ask yourself.

576
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,440
Today, you were the one

577
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,290
who invited me here, right?

578
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,240
But why did

579
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,900
His Highness show up instead?

580
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,690
Last time, I invited you two
to Xianquan Restaurant,

581
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:39,080
but I had to leave early
due to some matters.

582
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:41,260
I failed to be a proper host.

583
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,000
So today, I thought I might as well

584
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,530
invite you two to my mansion

585
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,760
to make amends.

586
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,300
But who would have thought

587
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,240
something came up again

588
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,240
and delayed me until now?

589
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,440
Miss He,

590
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,140
I've hosted you poorly

591
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:03,320
and caused this misunderstanding
between you and His Highness.

592
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,440
Since it's a misunderstanding,

593
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,840
clearing it up is enough.

594
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,400
Your Highness,
thank you for your affection.

595
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,800
But what I want

596
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:22,920
is love true and undivided,
lasting for a lifetime.

597
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,580
Since you already have a wife,

598
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,020
you can no longer give me

599
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:27,680
love that belongs to me alone.

600
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,670
You and I

601
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,720
are not meant to be.

602
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:36,080
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

603
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:36,840
Miss He.

604
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:39,320
Miss He, you're truly straightforward.

605
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:42,880
I respect your decision.

606
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:45,250
I'll take my leave.

607
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,360
Ms. Su,

608
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,760
I apologize for the disturbance tonight.

609
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:55,700
I'll visit you another day.

610
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,280
Ms. Su,

611
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,210
is there anything else?

612
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,120
Nothing else.

613
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,100
Your Highness, please rest well.

614
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,880
This was intercepted
by the secret guards today.

615
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,280
It came from the capital.

616
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,210
The letter is for Su Errong.

617
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:38,080
Make sure to return it intact,

618
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,880
so that those in the capital
won't be suspicious.

619
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:40,720
Yes.

620
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,920
According to the content of the letter,

621
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:47,340
the Su family is getting impatient
and ready to make a move.

622
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:55,280
[Su's Mansion]

623
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,760
So? Did you see Young Lord Zhang?

624
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,880
The Su family has noticed
you haven't returned to the capital.

625
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,260
Whether it's
thoroughly investigating the Su family

626
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:04,520
or the smuggling case,

627
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,440
we have to make a risky move

628
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,700
and finish it quickly.

629
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,720
With the Su family's methods,

630
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,600
if they find out who you really are,

631
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,060
they will surely kill you.

632
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,380
Right now,
we have merchants from the capital

633
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:20,710
and Mr. Wu as witnesses.

634
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,640
Mr. Luo is the source of smuggling.

635
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,760
That much is clear.

636
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,600
But I think

637
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,040
he's just a pawn.

638
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,600
The real mastermind

639
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:29,680
is someone else.

640
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,490
The Su family will

641
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:33,200
hold an auction in the coming days.

642
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,280
I haven't figured out

643
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,410
its true intention.

644
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,400
Once I uncover the truth,

645
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,880
we'll catch them red-handed

646
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:42,010
and solve the problem once and for all.

647
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:53,400
Tan,

648
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:56,680
I have never felt

649
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,810
this uneasy before.

650
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,560
The closer we get to the truth,

651
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,890
the greater the danger.

652
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,560
I'm worried if you investigate further,

653
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,690

My Lady,

689
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:50,760
what I just heard

690
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,250
wasn't like this.

691
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:54,320
You know the rules of the Su family.

692
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,600
Go accept your punishment.

693
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,320
Yes,

694
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,050
thank you for your mercy.

Ms. Su.

696
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:14,920
Second Young Master Shu,

697
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,160
what is this about?

698
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,480
Today, Miss Yun and I

699
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,520
were hunting in the outskirts of the city.

700
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:21,360
We accidentally

701
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,090
encountered these lost souls.

702
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:24,400
After asking them,

703
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,920
we learned they're the Su family's guards.

704
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,360
To prevent them from getting lost again,

705
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,000
I

706
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,930
escorted them back to the mansion.

707
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:34,240
These people were ordered

708
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,160
to protect you.

709
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:39,000
It seems they have failed in their duty

710
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:40,810
and have troubled you instead.

711
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,560
With such poor skills,

712
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:44,760
they can't even protect themselves.

713
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,360
How can they protect others?

714
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,080
The Su family's guards

715
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,520
should protect the Su family's members.

716
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,080
His Highness and Second Young Master Shu

717
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,560
have their own people to protect them.

718
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,820
It's not your concern.

719
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:56,790
Goodbye.

720
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:10,720
My Lady,

721
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:13,140
there's a letter from the capital.

722
00:36:15,850 --> 00:36:19,340
[Princess of Dingbei isn't in the capital.
She may be in disguise in Lingzhou.]

723
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:22,830
[Investigate thoroughly
in case she's up to something.]

724
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,540
Princess of Dingbei is in Lingzhou City?

725
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,120
The taxes have been paid.

726
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,120
But Prince of Dingbei shows

727
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,850
no sign of preparing to depart.

728
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,330
It must have something to do with this.

729
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,160
Jiang Xu deliberately said

730
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,490
Zhang Huaiyu had returned to the capital.

731
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:39,710
It was to make us lower our guard

732
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,850
and stop looking for Zhang Huaiyu,

733
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,660
so they could meet each other.

734
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:45,880
Shu Jingran's behavior today

735
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,040
was a diversion,

736
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:49,320
but it has proved

737
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,860
Zhang Huaiyu certainly hasn't left.

738
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,250
The evidence is still in his hands.

739
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,960
I'll send more men

740
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:59,420
to secretly investigate
across Lingzhou's 12 districts.

741
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,840
Looks like Jiang Xu

742
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,720
will stop at nothing.

743
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,400
He's made up his mind

744
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,240
to thoroughly investigate the Su family

745
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,500
and leave us no chance to make a comeback.

746
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,540
We must find Zhang Huaiyu.

747
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,770
And the guest in our mansion

748

can't be kept any longer.

Although Father offered help,

753
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:36,320
if we can solve the issue
with just one move,

754
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,660
why stir up chaos needlessly?

I can bid on your behalf.

836
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,440
If the bidding outside gets too fierce,

837
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,280
I'll talk to Ms. Su and ask her

838
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,600
to reserve one or two pieces.

839
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,060
It shouldn't be a problem.

I appreciate your kindness, Mr. Wen.

841

If there really is something I like,

842
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,320
I won't hesitate.

843
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:20,160
But an auction

844
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,960
must still be fair.

845
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,520
I don't intend to force others.

846
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,320
Whether I get it or not,

847
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,440
I'll leave it to fate.

848

You're truly different from the rest.

849

00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:54,440
Your Highness, you came to this banquet.

856
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,320
I am deeply honored.

857
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,250
Lord Yin has long wished

858
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:11,120
to host a banquet

859
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:12,450
for you, Your Highness.

860
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,760
But he was worried it might be improper.

861
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:17,880
So he asked me
to arrange this banquet and invite you.

862
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:19,360
Fortunately, you accepted my invitation

863
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:21,080
and did not embarrass me.

864
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:28,280
[Yin Shi, Deputy Envoy
of the Maritime Trade Bureau]

865
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,440
Your Highness, there are some words

866
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,550
that I've been kept in my heart
for a long time.

867
00:42:33,550 --> 00:42:35,080
Now that I've met you today,

868
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,000
I must speak my mind.

869
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:47,080
The Maritime Trade Bureau has suffered
from deep-rooted corruption for years.

870
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:49,120
It's hard to eliminate the issue.

871
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:52,000
Although I have great ambition,

872
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:54,460
I have to compromise

873
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:56,280
given my lower rank.

874
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:59,410
Your presence here

875
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:02,800
is the salvation
of the Maritime Trade Bureau

876
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,240
and a blessing for Lingzhou.

877
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:05,720
-Yes.
-Yes.

878
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:17,100
Now the Maritime Trade Bureau

879
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:19,160
is temporarily under my management.

880
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:20,400
As long as you give your orders,

881
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,280
I will fully cooperate.

882
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:23,840
I'll burn the bridge behind me

883
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:25,200
and replace the old rules with new ones.

884
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:26,880
-Your Highness, I'm willing to offer
-Your Highness, I'm willing to offer

885
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:30,480
-everything I have to serve you.
-everything I have to serve you.

886
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:34,610
This... This...

887
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:44,780
This...

888
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:49,460
Your Highness,

889
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:51,560
what does this mean?

890
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:53,520
This is a memorial

891
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:55,280
detailing your crimes.

892
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:59,020
A wise man submits to circumstances.

893
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:02,600
If you're willing to hand over evidence
of the Su family's wrongdoings

894
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:04,730
and declare your loyalty to the court,

895
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:08,160
you can remain in your posts at
the Maritime Trade Bureau without worry.
