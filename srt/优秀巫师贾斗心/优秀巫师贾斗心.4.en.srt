00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:04,640
Is there any around here?

2
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:08,030
- Yes.
- How many?

3
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:09,960
Check with your own eyes.

4
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:16,910
Close your eyes.

5
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,910
Will it really let me see ghosts?

6
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:38,160
This is really crazy.

7
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,800
Welcome to my world.

8
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,630
Do something.

9
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:58,450
- You said you wanted to see them.
- I didn't know it'd be this bad.

10
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,650
Face it. You can never avoid them.

11
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:02,580
It's better if you enjoy it.

12
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:07,030
Doo-shim. Ga Doo-shim.

13
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:09,840
Ga Doo-shim!

14
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,210
Move. Get out of my way.

16
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:38,620
Will he be okay?

17
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:42,090
He asked for it.

18
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,200
The preview will end soon anyway.

19
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:11,350
Something's wrong.

20
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:13,730
This is a dream.

21
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:29,350
My goodness. He can see us.

22
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:30,840
I doubt it.

23
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:33,170
Hey. Can you see us?

24
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:36,870
See? I told you. We had eye contact.

25
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:40,480
Sir. Please drive fast.

26
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:41,670

00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:24,910
"Wiping the window at night alone"

40
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,810
"is a lonely and magnificent feeling."

41
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:31,690
"With the fine blood vein ripped,"

00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:36,000
"oh, you flew away like a bird."

43
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:41,020
It's "Window" by Jung Ji-yong.

44
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:43,750
It's about bereavement.

45
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:47,520
With the poem "Tears"
we learned previously...

<i>Keep Order</i>

47
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,730
Do you know why Woo-soo didn't
come to school today?

48
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:57,910
Why are you asking me?

49
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,290
Something happened
between you and him yesterday.

50
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,100
I don't know.

51
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:06,840
If something happened to Woo-soo,
you'll be in trouble.

52
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:10,010
Can't you feel
that people are talking about you?

53
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,980
I heard Doo-shim pushed him.

54
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,270
She and Woo-soo made a fuss,

55
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,710
and he didn't come to school today.

56
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:21,090
What? Then did she do something to him?

57
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:23,430
- Unbelievable.
- She's famous in our school.

58
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,630
Hey. We're having a test again.

59
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:27,870
- Gosh.
- Seriously.

60
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,150
We're having a test.

61
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:31,970
What do you mean? Cancel the test?

62
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:33,770
Yes.

63
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,320
It's only a mock test.

64
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:38,170
It's best not to do unnecessary...

65
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:39,620
What's your reason?

66
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:48,730
We're having the test as planned.

67
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,070
Mr. Principal. Someone might die again.

68
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,440
- Please...
- My goodness.

69
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:56,600
Are you serious about canceling the test
over some ridiculous rumor?

70
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:58,060
If we do cancel it,

71
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:00,260
that means we're only admitting it.

72
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:03,120
Don't worry about someone dying.

73
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:06,640
Worry about preventing the bottom student
coming from your class.

74
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,310
That's the best for students.

75
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,130
By the way, why didn't Na Woo-soo
come to school today?

76
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:26,920
Hey.

77
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:29,340
Do me a favor.

78
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:31,890
A favor? What is it?

79
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:33,910
Can you visit Woo-soo?

80
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:36,420
- Visit him?
- He's not answering his phone.

81
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:37,920
I think something happened to him.

82
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:39,330
I'll give you the address...

83
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:41,570
If you're so worried, go yourself.

84
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:45,220
His parents really hate me.

85
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,290
Will you do it please?

86
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:50,410
- I'm busy.
- Aren't you worried about Woo-soo?

87
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:54,900
You think he didn't come to school
because of me?

88
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:57,280
That's not it.

89
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,410
Okay.

90
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:09,070
It's not my fault.

91
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,180
People worry about the top student
skipping school for just one day.

92
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,730
They never cared
about the bottom student.

93
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,140
Darn school.

94
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:25,000
By the way,
why didn't he come to school?

95
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:28,080
Don't you know?
It's because of Doo-shim.

96
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,040
Doo-shim?

97
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:31,420
Didn't you see them making a ruckus
yesterday?

98
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:34,370
Woo-soo looked like he was possessed
by a spirit.

99
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:37,840
Doo-shim must've done something to him.

100
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,600
- My goodness.
- Let's go.

101
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:42,420
I wonder what she did.

102
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:48,400
What are we having?

103
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:50,730
<i>Beautiful Clairvoyant Hyo-shim</i>

104
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:00,330
What are you looking at?

105
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,350
- <i>Hello, Schoolgirl</i>
- Webtoon.

106
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:06,180
Everyone was reading it, so I started too.
It's funny and interesting.

107
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:08,330
Really? Is there anything
for me to read?

108
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:11,680
Yes. Quite a few.

109
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:14,540
Where are you going?

110
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:17,920
Chairman Na's wife wants
to see me urgently.

111
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,080
Her son has a problem.

112
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:24,260
- What kind of problem?
- He went crazy.

113
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:27,690
She made him study so much,
so he could be a doctor.

114
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,290
He must've gone crazy
from all that studying.

115
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:32,840
I'll go with you.

116
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,220
What's gotten into you?

117
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,970
You were worried
about people finding out

118
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:38,510
that you're a shaman's daughter.

119
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:49,910
Don't be tacky.

120
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,630
What are you staring at?

121
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:56,100
There are a lot of guests.

122
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,370
Guests?

123
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:03,150
Hello, Beautiful Clairvoyant.

124
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,630
You look so pale, ma'am.

125
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,300
What on earth is going on?

126
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:10,810
I know.

127
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:13,670
He was screaming all night.

128
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,970
He was screaming "leave" and "get out"

129
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:19,740
when there was no one.

130
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:22,690
It was just insane.

131
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:24,840
What should I do?

132
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,530
I'm here now. Don't worry.

133
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:29,900
Where's your son?

134
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:43,490
It's the boy I saw yesterday.

135
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:50,710
He was Chairman Na wife's son?

136
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,030
Be quiet.

137
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:54,590
What is it? What's wrong with him?

138
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:57,140
Stay outside. I will take care of it.

139
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:58,630
Stay outside? I'm the shaman.

140
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,870
I said, leave.

141
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,790
Oh, come on.

142
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:18,520
You too.

143
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,900
You too.

144
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,200
Leave.

145
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:41,530
Are you okay?

146
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:48,610
Put it up in your room.
Then they won't be able to enter.

147
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:53,670
How did you bear it for all these years?

148
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:55,830
I can't even bear it for one day.

149
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:00,410
The souls are same as humans.

150
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,050
At first, they appear at any time,

151
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:06,350
but if you ignore them,
they give up eventually.

152
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:08,550
Word gets around among souls.

153
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:11,490
They won't appear
if you're known as the unfortunate man.

154
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:13,650
Do you hear that?

155
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,730
I'm the most unfortunate girl to them.

156
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:20,560
They're only coming to you
because you just started. Don't worry.

157
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:22,100
"Started"?

158
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:24,740
When a new restaurant opens,
customers rush in.

159
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,480
Then when word gets around that it's not
that delicious, customers stop coming.

160
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,970
That will happen to you too.

161
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:33,710
So ignore them
and pretend you can't see them.

162
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:36,480
That's hard.

163
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,620
- But it's pretty interesting.
- What is?

164
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:42,470
Souls don't gather this much

165
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,710
even around a new shaman.

166
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,790
It seems you have a hidden talent.

167
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,950
Are you saying
I was born to be a shaman?

168
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:52,060
Well, maybe.

169
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:55,620
Oh, are you coming to school tomorrow?
We have an exam.

170
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:57,290
An exam?

171
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:59,580
If you don't want to lose
your top student title, come.

172
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:02,270
Lose it? To whom?

173
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:04,600
Who else? Me.

174
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:20,000
Do you get help from ghosts
during the exam?

175
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:22,770
You jerk.

176
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,510
I should hear that from the ghosts,
not you.

177
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:30,160
Son. Are you okay?

178
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:31,830
I'm okay thanks to Doo-shim.

179
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:35,570
You're really skillful.
You're better than your mom.

180
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,380
She's not a shaman.

181
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,900
She's here to cheer me up as a friend.

182
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:42,700
Stop acting cool.

183
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:45,210
Thanks.

184
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,740
Don't mention it. It's what friends do.

185
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:51,370
Really?

186
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,610
Didn't you say your daughter will be
a shaman too?

187
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:54,800
Pardon?

188
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:57,840
No parent would want their daughter
to become a shaman.

189
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,290
I should make her study.

190
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:02,940
I'm going out with Doo-shim.

191
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:08,790
- Sure.
- Go where?

192
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,550
Let's get some fresh air.

193
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,270
We have an exam tomorrow.
I have to study.

194
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:14,820
Doo-shim. Go on.

195
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,840
Get some fresh air with your friend.

196
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:18,870
And cool your head.

197
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:20,450
Bye.

198
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:34,000
- Where are you going?
- To save a man.

199
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,670
Save a man?

200
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,020
<i>Raonro 7 gil</i>

201
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:50,460
- Check please.
- It's delicious.

202
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:52,300
- Excuse me. One more soju please.
- Yes.

203
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:53,490
It's coming.

204
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,910
- Eat up.
- Good work.

205
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,190
- Hello.
- Woo-soo.

206
00:12:58,070 --> 00:12:59,480
Woo-soo.

207
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:05,190
Ma'am. I'll have
fishcake soup and Il-nam.

208
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,250
Okay.

209
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:07,700
Do you want some soju?

210
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:10,030
If you get drunk,
more ghosts will follow.

211
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,710
A drunken soul falls apart easily.

212
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,480
I should never drink again.

213
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:16,240
What are you doing here?

214
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:18,130
You didn't come to school
and ignored my calls.

215
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:20,680
- What brings you here?
- Did you study or not?

216
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,490
Oh, come on.

217
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:26,580
I tried, but I just can never do it.

218
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,510
I knew it.

219
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:32,300
I've marked the expected questions.
Solve them.

220
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:34,370
What a jerk.

221
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:38,630
What? You think I'm afraid of dying?

222
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,950
I'm not afraid at all.

223
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,800
Stop being proud.

224
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:49,060
Il-nam. I got to see a new world.

225
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:52,930
If I see you in that world,
I'll be annoyed.

226
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:55,750
What on earth is he talking about?

227
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,810
What? Is something here?

228
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,160
Let's start.

229
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:18,140
Start what? I need to help Mom.

230
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:19,420
Eat your fishcake and go home.

231
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:21,440
Your father wants to see you studying.

232
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:28,920
That's his wish.

233
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:32,270
What are you doing?

234
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:34,600
My father passed away a long time ago.

235
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:36,400
Is she mad?

236
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:39,090
Sit down. Didn't you hear
what Doo-shim said?

237
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:42,340
My goodness. Sit down and study.

238
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:45,160
- Woo-soo. Will you help him please?
- Yes.

239
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:48,680
Solve them.

240
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,070
The antilogarithm of log should
be a positive number.

241
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,120
Then what do you do?

242
00:14:57,210 --> 00:14:58,930
X plus five is bigger than zero.

243
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:01,170
X minus one is also bigger than zero.

244
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,760
Do you get it?

245
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:14,060
Now, change the given inequation.

246
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:15,290
And solve it.

247
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:20,050
Log one half X plus five is smaller than
log one half X minus one.

248
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:21,410
Do you get it?

249
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:43,150
<i>What do you mean, Mom?</i>

250
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:45,520
You want to transfer Doo-shim
to a different school?

251
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:48,290
I've found where that evil spirit is.

252
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,400
Songyoung High School.

253
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,560
He's there.

254
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:54,360
So?

255
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:57,180
You want to send her there?

256
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:00,920
Even you can't handle him.

257
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:03,380
How can Doo-shim deal with him?

258
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:05,360
Only Doo-shim can do it.

259
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:08,530
Only she can handle him.

260
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,260
How will she fight alone?

261
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:14,080
Are you telling her to die?

262
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:17,460
Someone will fight with her.

263
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:20,720
Me?

264
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:25,470
Mom. You know that
I'm only a novice shaman.

265
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:29,870
Can ghosts enter the human body?

266
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,070
Only the souls with special abilities.

267
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:35,900
Or humans with special abilities
must cast a spell.

268
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,670
Only humans? What about animals?

269
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:41,880
Dogs, cats, fish in the tank,

270
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:43,550
even to a fly and a mosquito.

271
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,180
Really?

272
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:46,810
It can even enter plants

273
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:49,670
or a drawing or a doll.

274
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:52,220
That's interesting.

275
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:58,510
- <i>Beautiful Clairvoyant Hyo-shim</i>
- I'm sure someone's soul was in my body.

276
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,580
What?

277
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:03,790
When I hugged you, someone was in me.

278
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,760
I don't remember hugging you.

279
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:12,900
When people are in a rush, that happens.

280
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:15,050
You don't remember what you did.

281
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,510
Don't blame everything on souls.

282
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:30,540
I did hug you, but I don't remember it

283
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:32,520
or what it felt like.

284
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,040
That's so unfair.

285
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:45,150
I will only take the memory.

286
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,980
Let me go or I'll kill you.

287
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,750
There's one thing nice
about seeing ghosts.

288
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:53,990
I can run home like crazy.

289
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,300
<i>That day, it was Woo-soo
who was running,</i>

290
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:08,120
<i>and it was my heart</i>

291
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:11,060
<i>that was racing.</i>

292
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,970
<i>The Great Shaman Ga Doo Shim</i>

293
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:32,010
<i>I'll listen to what you have to say,
so listen to me too.</i>

294
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:33,500
<i>Doo-shim is your daughter?</i>

295
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:35,390
<i>Are you a shaman's daughter?</i>

296
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,730
<i>I'm sick of talking about ghosts.
Let's stop.</i>

297
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:40,230
<i>Where are you going? To see Doo-shim?</i>

298
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,210
<i>There's nothing good about provoking me.</i>

299
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,450
<i>Don't provoke me.</i>

300
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:45,380
<i>Before I introduce you
to my new friends.</i>

301
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:46,970
<i>There's an evil spirit
in Songyoung High School.</i>

302
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:48,640
<i>An evil spirit that only kills
bottom students.</i>

303
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:51,410
<i>We have the top student again
in our class.</i>

304
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:52,770
<i>What about the bottom student?</i>

305
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:54,930
<i>Don't you think the bottom students
committed suicide?</i>

306
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,950
<i>- It's not suicide. There is someone.
- Get up.</i>

307
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:59,020
<i>A murderer who only kills
the bottom students.</i>

308
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:01,717
