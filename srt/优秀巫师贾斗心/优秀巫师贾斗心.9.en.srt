- The bottom students.

They must be students
who died in this school.

locked up their souls?

you want to be the top at this game.

Yes. There is an evil spirit

that only kills the bottom student.

33
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:00,190
The same spirit did that to Il-nam.

00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:29,100

you have to hit the top of its head.

- The top of the evil spirit's head?
- Yes.

What do we do?

170
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:57,020
We have to find the evil spirit first.

No more students will die.

00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:03,800
Right.

00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,500
If I find the evil spirit,
Mr. Principal will start acting.

175
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,960
Then I can find evidence.

176
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:15,500
I'm going to make him admit
that he killed my grandma.

177
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:19,550
How are we supposed to find
the evil spirit, by the way?

00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:25,840
Do you have an idea?

00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:46,520

00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:39,450
Are you sure I will become
a webtoon artist?

193
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:46,800
Say it. Am I really not dying?

194
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,300

<i>The evil spirit can only kill
the bottom student</i>

196
00:17:55,820 --> 00:18:00,220
<i>which means the evil spirit will visit
the bottom student for sure.</i>

197
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:03,170
<i>How can we find
the evil spirit, by the way?</i>

198
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:06,200
<i>If I can't find it,</i>

199
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:10,560
<i>I'll have to make it find me.</i>

200
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,150

205
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:37,050

206
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:39,550
<i>What have you done to me?
Did Doo-shim tell you to do that?</i>

207
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:42,020
<i>If you're so afraid of dying,
you should've studied.</i>

208
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:45,620
