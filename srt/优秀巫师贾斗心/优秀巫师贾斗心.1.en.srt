Did you ask your grandma to help you?

- How many times must I tell you?
- You know you can't lie to me.

161
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:58,180
I know you're pretending not to see
or hear anything when you do.

162
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:01,480
You're trying your best to ignore
the ghost standing behind you.

163
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:04,210
There's a ghost
standing right next to you

164

165
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:09,660
Aren't you scared?

166
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:12,430
You're just pretending like you're not

Yes, ma'am. Hello.

You should've come to me,

00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:35,360
Beautiful Clairvoyant,
first for things like that.

171
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:36,940
You wasted your money.

to make sure you could transfer to

180
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,880
Korea's best high school,
Songyoung High School.

181
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,040
But you can't help me?

182
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:06,510
Did I say I wanted to go there?

183
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,660
In any case, I don't want to do it.

184
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,420
People treat you better
if you run a business with a kid.

185
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:17,150
Aren't you going to become independent
when you graduate high school?

186
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:21,250
Didn't you agree to bear with it...

187
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:24,190
and help me out until then?

188
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:33,300
I knew it.

189
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:35,850
Okay. Let's go.

190
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:40,690
<i>Songyoung High School</i>

191
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:43,290
<i>Don't the results for the midterms
come out today?</i>

192
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:46,110
- Yes.
- I heard everyone's grades went up.

193
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:49,320
Yes. Overall, everyone's grades
went up a lot.

194
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:52,040
But of course, there will still be
someone who comes in last.

195
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:54,380
I made sure to tell
all the teachers that

196
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:56,580
if that student is in their class,

197
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:58,860
they should make sure
to keep an eye on them.

198
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:06,740
Let's pray that there are no problems.

199
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,100
Right.

200
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:10,920
Hello.

201
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:16,380
I heard that a student is transferring
into Mr. Sa's class.

202
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:19,410
Yes. Chairman Na's wife

203
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,010
asked us to open up a spot for her.

204
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:25,090
Apparently, she's close with
the transfer student's mom.

205
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,370
What does her father do?

206
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:30,370
She doesn't have a father,
and she lives with her mother.

207
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:32,300
Apparently, she's a religious person.

208
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:34,190
A religious person?

209
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,260
Yes.

210
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:51,000
Il-nam.

211
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:56,320
What do you want?

212
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:02,880
Mr. Sa. The student in the last place
isn't in our class, right?

213
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:06,270
How would I know? I don't know.

214
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:09,000
I know that all the teachers know.
Please tell us.

215
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,860
- Tell us.
- Tell us.

216
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,700
- You know who it is.
- Tell us.

217
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:15,070
Be quiet everyone.

218
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:20,040
I may not know
who came in the last place,

219
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:22,460
but I know who's in first.

220
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:25,010
I'm sure you all know who it is too.

221
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,910
Let's take some of Woo-soo's energy

222
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,040
and get better scores next time. Okay?

223
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:32,490
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

224
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:33,940
Okay, Kim Il-nam?

225
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:36,980
Gosh, I'm a lot handsomer than him.

226
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:40,450
- What is he saying?
- What?

227
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:42,520
Hey. Be quiet.

228
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,910
Everyone got their grades, right?

229
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:48,070
Tomorrow's exam— What was that?

230
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:50,050
<i>Oh, my gosh.</i>

231
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:56,250
<i>Jong-geun. What's wrong?</i>

232
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:58,670
- What is it?
- What happened?

233
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:01,440
- Hey.
- Hey, something happened.

234
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:02,850
- What happened?
- Oh, my gosh!

235
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:05,840
Hey! Everyone back in your seats!

236
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:08,130
Someone must've jumped from the roof!

237
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:09,760
I think it's Jong-geun from Class Three.

238
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:12,180
- Listen to me, kids!
- I got chills.

239
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:14,600
I had a feeling
it was Jong-geun this time.

240
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:16,360
What happened?

241
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:19,790
- From the roof...
- He jumped?

242
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:20,330
<i>The Great Shaman Ga Doo Shim</i>

243
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:21,780
<i>She's that shaman's daughter.</i>

244
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:24,020
<i>I heard she has
a lot of mysterious powers.</i>

245
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,120
<i>She even sees ghosts.</i>

246
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:26,930
<i>He broke open the locked door
to the roof,</i>

247
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:28,950
<i>and he jumped without hesitation?</i>

248
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,100
<i>What is this?</i>

249
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:32,340
<i>If you come in the last place,
you commit suicide?</i>

250
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:34,940
<i>It's not a suicide,
but it's not a homicide either.</i>

251
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:37,570
<i>If you don't want to die, you must
study like your life depends on it</i>

252
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:38,760
<i>here at Songyoung High School.</i>

253
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:41,710
<i>- Why are you all scratched up like that?
- I got into an accident on my way here.</i>

254
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,950
<i>How long do you intend
on denying that you have powers?</i>

255
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,020
<i>Is this the reason
why you made me transfer?</i>

256
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:48,050
<i>I don't believe in those things.
It's all a scam.</i>

257
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:50,550
<i>The year I turned 18 was in danger.</i>

258
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:53,017
