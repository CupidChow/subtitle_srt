1
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:06,090
Why would you look for a priest,
monk, or reverend?

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:08,200
You should've come to me,

3
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:10,140
Beautiful Clairvoyant,
first for things like that.

4
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:11,940
You wasted your money.

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,630
I'll be right there,
so make sure to have some cash ready.

6
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:17,750
Where are we going?

7
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:21,180
Cheongdam-dong
and then Songyoung High School.

8
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:23,030
Are you crazy?

9
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:24,970
I'm transferring to a new school today.

10
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:26,640
Go to Songyoung High
then Cheongdam-dong.

11
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:30,330
Who managed to get you transferred?

12
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:34,070
Aren't you going to become independent
when you graduate high school?

13
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:38,340
Didn't you agree to bear with it...

14
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:41,070
and help me out until then?

15
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:58,580
Doo-shim. Come save me.

16
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:02,980
What is this? Is this for real?

17
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:09,230
Help me. Doo-shim, he's killing me.

18
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:11,430
Be bound by my words and stop.
You got what you wanted.

19
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:13,450
You've had your fun in that body.
Now leave!

20
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:18,690
Darn it. Why you little...

21
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:21,900
Hey, that's enough.

22
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:24,540
How are you going
to handle the aftermath of it all?

23
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:48,950
Be bound by my words and stop.
You got what you wanted.

24
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:50,850
You've had your fun in that body.
Now leave!

25
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:04,400
Darn it. I'm late!

26
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:08,090
Wait, Doo-shim...

27
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:14,340

29
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,950
Hey. Be quiet.

30
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,200
Everyone got their grades, right?

31
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:23,670
Tomorrow's exam— What was that?

32
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:25,560
<i>Oh, my gosh.</i>

33
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:31,760
<i>Jong-geun. No. This can't be.</i>

34
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:34,400
- What is it?
- What happened?

35
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:36,770
- Hey.
- Hey, something happened.

36
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:38,360
- What happened?
- Oh, my gosh!

37
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:41,310
Hey! Everyone back in your seats!

38
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:43,420
Someone must've jumped from the roof!

39
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,180
I think it's Jong-geun from Class Three.

40
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:47,690
- Listen to me, kids!
- I got chills.

41
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:49,890
I had a feeling
it was Jong-geun this time.

42
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:51,650
What happened?

43
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:55,040
- From the roof...
- He jumped?

44
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:02,300
Hey. Everyone back to your seats!

45
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,530
Jong-geun!

46
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,140
- Oh, my gosh.
- Is this really happening?

47
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:10,130
Hold on. Jong-geun! Everyone, get back.

48
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:12,590
- Why?
- Everyone, get back.

49
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,610
Everyone back in your seats.

50
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,120
Hey, Chang-do!

51
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,850
Chang-do, Ae-kyung.
Get back in your seats.

52
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:29,000
You guys...

53
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,600
Excuse me, sir.

54
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:34,330
Who are you?

55
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,540
I'm a transfer student.

56
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:40,090
Oh, right.
We have a transfer student today.

57
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:42,950
Why don't you introduce yourself later?
First...

58
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:47,170
Why are you all scratched up like that?
Are you okay?

59
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,130
I got into an accident on my way here.

60
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:55,890
Okay. Take a seat in the empty chair.

61
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:00,590
Hey, Chang-do, Ae-kyung.
Get back in your seats. Sit down.

62
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:06,490
Study quietly until I get back, okay?

63
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:09,610
Don't look outside, okay?

64
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:11,460
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

65
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:27,300
It's nice to meet you. I didn't
get to introduce myself earlier.

66
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,320
My name is Jo Su-jeong.

67
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,180
I'm Ga Doo-shim.

68
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:33,770
Are you a good student?

69
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:35,790
Why do you ask?

70
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:38,690
I want to be friends with you
for a long time,

71
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:41,250
but that would be hard if you die early.

72
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:43,090
What are you talking about?

73
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:45,380
If you get bad grades at this school,
you die.

74
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:46,970
You saw the kid who jumped, right?

75
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:49,690
He was guaranteed to
come in the last place this time.

76
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:51,810
And just as we expected...

77
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:56,950
So you're saying if you come
in the last place, you commit suicide?

78
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,120
It's not a suicide,
but it's not a homicide either.

79
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:03,510
In any case, you end up dying.

80
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,070
That's why if you don't want to die, you
must study like your life depends on it

81
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:08,790
here at Songyoung High School.

82
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:12,970
Okay. I'm going to go.

83
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:21,990
She seems perfect to be my maid.

84
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,750
What about me?

85
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,920
You? You're my attendant.

87
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:34,310
What a mess.

88
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,080
Did this student have any problems?

89
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,230
He didn't have any problems.

90
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:43,410
Say that he had problems at home.

91
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:45,700
There were no issues at home either.

92
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:49,790
How can anyone recognize
when there are problems at home?

93
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:51,770
Say that he had problems
with his parents,

94
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:54,590
and that he spoke with you
about it on a few occasions.

95
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:57,180
- Just leave a record of it.
- That's a bit—

96
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,570
Then should we say that he had a problem
with his homeroom teacher,

97
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,820
and he spoke with other teachers
about it before?

98
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,620
Is that what you want?

99
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:07,040

that if anyone spreads false rumors,

103
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:24,770
they will be punished in accordance
to school regulations.

104
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,500
Furthermore,
we'll file civil and criminal charges

105
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:29,520
for damaging the school's reputation.

106
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,070

Why would I be scared? The only thing
I'm worse at than you is studying.

115

He broke open the locked door
to the roof,

116
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,750
and he jumped without hesitation?

117
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,820
That doesn't make any sense.

118
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,800
Jong-geun was a coward,
and he was weak too.

119

What is this?

120
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:21,880
Why are you so interested in someone
else's business? It's so unlike you.

121
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,310
Because it's not
someone else's business.

122
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,290
It has to do with my friend
who's in trouble.

- The next exam.

Never mind.

141
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:27,480
How long do you intend on denying
that you have powers?

142
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,480
Do you think I became a shaman
because I wanted to?

143
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:33,950

that can't be changed.

I don't want to.

145
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:37,910
I don't have any powers.

146
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,970
I said the same thing
when I was your age.

147
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:43,890
I would yell at your grandma,
cry and make a scene.

148
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:48,550
Mom. You asked the wife of that chairman

149
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,090
not to say anything, right?

150
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:52,560
To keep the fact that I'm the daughter
of a shaman a secret?

151
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:56,690
Did you ask her or not?
If people at school find out—

152
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:58,500
What if they do?

153
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:02,190
Are you embarrassed that I'm a shaman?

154
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,010
I'm not embarrassed about you.

155
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,190
Then?

156
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,310
Then?

157

<i>I heard your grandma is a shaman
and so is your mom.</i>

158
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:15,170

00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,910
This is my room. Get out.

165
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,420
I told you not to come in here.

166
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:56,180
Your mom said she's going to make me
pay for what I did when she finds me.

167
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,170
Let me stay here for a bit longer.

168
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:01,810

169
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:05,810
Be bound by my words and stop.
You got what you wanted.

170
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,700
You've had your fun in that body.
Now leave!

171
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:15,890
She always makes me work,
and she hasn't kept her promise.

172
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,170
It's been ages since she said
she'd help me meet my mom.

173
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:19,800
It's been ten years already!

174
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:22,530
Don't complain to me.
Go say that to my mom.

175
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:30,540
Doo-shim. Can you find my mom for me?

176
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:33,480
I'd look for her
if I could remember anything,

177
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,600
but I don't remember anything.

178
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,690
I remember that I had a mom.

179
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:45,760
Hyun-soo. What are you doing up there?

180
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,050
Please?

181
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,560
Doo-shim. Please.

182
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,690
Get out before I tell my mom
that you're in here.

183
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:56,580
My gosh.

184
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,280
<i>Of course.</i>

185
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:02,170
<i>- It's all thanks to you.</i>
- Darn it.

186
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:05,780
<i>My daughter must really like
her new school.</i>

187
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:09,740
<i>But I heard something happened
at the school today.</i>

188
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:12,200
<i>You didn't know about it?</i>

189
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:16,380
I know. I feel so bad for that student.
He was so young.

190
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:19,680
If they don't send him off properly,
he'll wander around the afterlife.

191
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,630
Mom!

192
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:26,320
Do you know the phone number
of the mother of the deceased child?

193
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:29,320
They must hold a rite
to comfort the child's soul. Gosh.

194
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:33,010
What are you doing?

195
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:35,260
Why would you call the mom
of the deceased child?

196
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:37,280
Do you want everyone to find out?

197
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:39,920
Do you want everyone to know that
Ga Doo-shim's mom is a shaman?

198
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:43,310
What are you talking about?
I just feel bad for the deceased child.

199
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,450
That's enough.

200
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,190
Is this the reason

201
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,700
why you made me transfer?

202
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:54,880
- What?
- There are a lot of rich customers here,

203
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:57,740
so you wanted to use me
to approach those people?

204
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:05,220
I guess I was right.

205
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:07,590
You made me transfer
so that you can find

206
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:09,620
some high-paying customers.

207
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,190
You're quite intuitive, Sweety.

208
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,640
She has proven to be quite useful.

209
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,270
She's obsessed with money,

210
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:30,870
but she's definitely worth it.

211
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:34,700
She said money will come in from the west,
and I wondered what it meant.

212
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,510
But the business
you're starting in Jordan...

213
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:44,990
Jordan is to the west of us, right?

214
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,660
Yes.

215
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:50,580
Oh, right. You know the girl
who transferred to your class today?

216
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,470
She's that shaman's daughter.

217
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:55,200
I heard she has
a lot of mysterious powers.

218
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:56,520
She sees ghosts well too.

219
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,440
You should use her when you need her.
She'll prove to be useful.

220
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:16,670
I don't believe in those things.
It's all a scam, Mom.

221
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,400
What are you talking about?

222
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:23,090
I'm sure that shaman told her
to keep an eye on everything that I do.

223
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:27,010
If she finds something out, she's going to
intimidate you and make you spend money.

224
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:28,860
It's obvious.

225
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,210
I knew I could count on you, son.
You're smart.

226
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:41,170
Mom, your son is doing a good job.

227
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,370
Don't worry about anything.

228
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:59,170
Excuse me.

229
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:01,850
That belongs to me.

230
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:11,310
If you get into an accident while
riding my motorcycle,

231
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:13,070
will your parents let me get by with it?

232
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,320
They will probably kill you.

233
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,210
Just the thought of it sounds fun.

234
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:19,500
You're really annoying. You know that?

235
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:25,520
I wrote down how to solve each question,
so memorize everything.

236
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:29,570
I'm going to help save
my one and only friend.

237
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:38,550
Who's going to end up dying?

238
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,000
I couldn't ride it
because I didn't want to waste gas,

239
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:41,190
so let me ride with you.

240
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:43,340
Let's go!

241
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:07,540
<i>The Centennial of
Independence Movement Day</i>

242
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:10,270
<i>Hurray for the independence of Korea!</i>

243
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:13,220
Hurray for Ga Doo-shim's independence.

244
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:15,900
Until that day comes.

245
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,970
<i>Songyoung High School</i>

246
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:34,330
So the way you calculate the value
of line AB is...

247
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,030
It's just a ridiculous dream.

248
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,980
Hey. I have some big news.

249
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:48,410
Apparently, that girl was
next to Jong-geun when he fell.

250
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:51,190
- No way.
- The new girl?

251
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,690
She must've pushed Jong-geun.

252
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:58,580
She pushed Jong-geun off
even though he didn't want to die.

253
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:02,180
When she came in yesterday,
she looked like she was in a huge fight.

254
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:04,560
Gosh, I got chills. Is she crazy?

255
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:06,850
But why would the new girl
do that to Jong-geun?

256
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:08,870
I guess she had a grudge against him.

257
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,680
- It's possible.
- Right?

258
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:12,000
What?

259
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:13,760
It's the rule that

260
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,700
the new girl gets picked on
over the most ridiculous things.

261
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:18,420
- That's the rule.
- Right.

262
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:22,470
Hey.

263
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:24,450
You.

264
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:27,970
Do you know how to
read compatibility too?

265
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,100
Can you check how compatible
she and I are?

266
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:35,750
Tell us if we're a good match or not.

267
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,110
What is he saying?

268
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:43,980
Why? How could she tell
how compatible we are?

269
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:46,400
I heard your grandma is a shaman
and so is your mom.

270
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:48,290
- My wallet disappeared.
<i>- You must be one too.</i>

271
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:49,830
You must know if someone stole it.

272
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,340
My parents are driving me crazy.
I wish they were gone!

273
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:54,010
Can you see ghosts?
What about Jong-geun?

274
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,600
<i>- That's enough.</i>
- Stop it, you guys.

275
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,220
<i>- What if she ends up</i>
- Please stop.

276
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:59,030
killing us like she did to Jong-geun?

277
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,180
Stop it!

278
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,760
Did we do something?

279
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:07,960
I guess she feels guilty
about something.

280
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:10,690
Gosh, she knows
how to attract attention.

281
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:17,370
<i>I can't hear anything you're saying.</i>

282
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:20,100
<i>To be honest, I heard what she said.</i>

283
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,830
<i>My grandma told me</i>

284
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:25,730
<i>to protect myself
during the year I turn 18.</i>

285
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:29,470
<i>If I do, I'll be able to live
a long and happy life.</i>

286
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:35,770
<i>The year I turned 18 was in danger.</i>

287
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:41,000
What is she doing?

288
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,550
Is she leaving?

289
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:46,320
Gosh, she scares me.

290
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:51,560
<i>Eighteen. Can I get through it safely?</i>

291
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,890
Don't go, Doo-shim.

292
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:45,540
<i>The Great Shaman Ga Doo Shim</i>

293
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:47,040
<i>I don't want you to be mistaken.</i>

294
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:49,990
<i>I don't remember anything.
I must've been possessed.</i>

295
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,440
<i>Can you mind your own business?</i>

296
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:53,290
<i>- What is that?
- A ghost.</i>

297
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:55,660
<i>Ghosts don't exist.
What did you do to me?</i>

298
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:57,200
<i>Do you think I did that to you?</i>

299
00:18:57,290 --> 00:18:58,660
<i>Who could've possibly done it then?</i>

300
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,020
<i>Do I have to live like this?</i>

301
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:01,300
<i>- No!
- And keep seeing ghosts?</i>

302
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:02,970
<i>Welcome to my world.</i>

303
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:04,240
<i>I never did that!</i>

304
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:06,710
<i>I even have evidence.
What are you talking about?</i>

305
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:08,950
<i>Do you know how surprised
Woo-soo was because of you?</i>

306
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,240
<i>- Do you like him?
- He's here.</i>

307
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:14,890
<i>The evil spirit you met ten years ago.</i>

308
