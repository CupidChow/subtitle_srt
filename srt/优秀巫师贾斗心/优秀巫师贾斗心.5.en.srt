<i>Find the divisor
of the following equation.</i>

3
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:02,930
<i>The Great Shaman Ga Doo Shim</i>

4
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:05,570
Su-jeong, look at this.

5
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:09,620
"Beautiful Clairvoyant Hyo-shim?"
What's that?

6
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,930
This place is run by a shaman.

7
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:18,420
I've seen her going inside there.

8
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:19,920
A shaman?

9
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,120
To see if she'd be a match for Woo-soo?

10
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:23,660
I don't know.

11
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:27,660
Right. Yesterday,
I saw Doo-shim leave Woo-soo's house.

12
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,340
Why?

13
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,820
I don't know.

14
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:36,590
Then what is it that you know?

15
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:45,260
You're wearing them again.

16
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:48,340
I see. You have
exceptional observation skills.

17
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:50,360
These sneakers are comfortable

18
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:52,200
and go well with any outfit,
so I like them.

19
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,250
Thank you

20
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,100
for waking Il-nam up earlier.

21
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,870
Are you that worried about Il-nam?

22
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,490
You kept checking up on him.

23
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:05,410
I can't let my only friend die
because he gets the lowest mark.

24
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:07,170
Although he wouldn't
go down that easily.

25
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:10,380
So you don't think students
with the lowest marks committed suicide?

26
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,100
Suicide?

27
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:16,230
People always conclude the deaths
of students with bad grades very easily.

28
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:19,180
It's not suicide.

29
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,170
I'm sure there's a murderer

30
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,990
who only kills students that place last.

31
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,340
I didn't expect this.

32
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:32,470
I thought you weren't
interested in other students.

33
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,940
- It's all because of you.
- Me?

34
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:38,940
Because of you, I can see ghosts
and listen to their stories.

35
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,840
Everyone had their own stories.

36
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:47,020
Stories of injustice and grudges
someone ought to listen to.

37
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:58,770
Na Woo-soo. You're not being yourself.

38
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:02,030
Come on, focus.

39
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:26,190
<i>It was a mistake.</i>

40
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:30,060
<i>It was you.</i>

<i>After I got drunk, I jumped...</i>

42
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:40,660
Fine. I'm a weak newbie.

43
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:44,800
I'll listen to all of your stories,
so you listen to mine.

44
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:50,040
All right. Who wants to go first?

45
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:54,570
Anyone?

46
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:58,260
We were just at a stop.

47
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:00,990
Who knew that the truck driver
behind us was dozing off.

48
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,130
So what happened?

49
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,200
<i>They said the surgery would be easy.</i>

50
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:07,680
<i>I mixed strawberries,
bananas, and yogurt.</i>

51
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:09,350
<i>They said I'd ruin my husband.</i>

52
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,020
<i>Who knew the Han River was that deep?</i>

53
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:12,390
<i>I couldn't even say goodbye.</i>

54
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:13,440
<i>Sell it.</i>

55
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:15,110
No way.

56
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:20,390
It's my turn.

57
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:27,170
Someone came in here.

58
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:39,180
<i>No. She's not a spirit. She's alive.</i>

59
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:40,760
A girl with a beating heart.

60
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,900
She came into my heart,

61
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:47,760
so whenever she's here, my heart pounds.

62
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:53,000
<i>I don't know what to do because
this has never happened to me before.</i>

63
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,010
<i>What should I do?</i>

64
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,390
This is hard even for the spirits.

65
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:10,510
Did you listen to all of their stories
instead of ignoring them?

66
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:12,620
I gave you the talisman.

69

What brings you here?

70
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:33,210
I... Well...

71
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,170
What about you?

72
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,660
Me?

73
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,080
- I heard that this shaman is good.
- <i>Beautiful Clairvoyant Hyo-shim</i>

74
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:45,880
No. She's not good at all.

75
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:47,820
She's a con artist.

76
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,310
A con artist?

77
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:53,670
When did you get here?

78
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:59,650
You'd rather die than letting your friends
know your mom is a shaman.

79
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,810
What a surprise.
You brought a friend home.

80
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,170
Hello.

81
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:05,110
Her mom is a shaman?

82
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,460
So you're her mom?

83
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:29,040
That's why Woo-soo asked you
to check how compatible we would be.

84
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:35,550
You're hurting my feelings.
You didn't even tell me about it.

85
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,880
I thought we were friends.

86
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,230
Friends?

87
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,160
I'm not that petty.

88
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:44,620
I'll keep it a secret.

89
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,590
But answer this.
What do you think about Woo-soo?

90
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,180
Woo-soo.

91
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,420
There's nothing between us.

92
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:01,730
- Really?
- He's like any other classmate.

93
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:03,970
Just a classmate.

94
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,440
I'm glad to hear that.

95
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:08,900
Don't cross the line.

96
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:11,100
Then, I won't either.

97
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:14,800
See you at school.

98
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:32,440
I've been thinking about this all night,
but something doesn't add up.

99
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,340
I can see all the other spirits,

100
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,630
but why can't I see
the dead students' spirits?

101
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:39,600
Have you seen them?

102
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,220
What's wrong?

103
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:50,350
I'm sick of talking about spirits.
Just drop it.

104
00:07:58,490 --> 00:07:59,500
What's wrong?

105
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,390
Nothing.

106
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:04,290

107

Let's go.

108
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,990
What happened?

109
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,820
Am I dead?

110
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:47,190
I didn't do it. I didn't want to die.

111
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:49,740
I'm so scared.

112
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:24,680
This clause followed by "that"
describes this part.

113
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,230
And when you try to interpret this,

114
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:30,350
you need to consider
all the prepositions.

Only when I need to be.

128

You didn't come out to greet me?

She didn't. Have fun.

I just have one question.

What is it?

163
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:31,680
What should I do

00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,830
What do you mean?

165
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,030
The evil spirit
will kill another student.

166
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:39,550
Is there a way to catch him
before he does?

167
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:43,200
Do you think the evil spirit is like
Casper the Friendly Ghost?

168
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,500
Just hope that you or your friend
don't end up on the bottom.

You can't do anything about it.

- Look at her face. It's true.
- I guess it's true.

181
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,250
I told you, didn't I?

182
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:57,560
I try to escape it,
but it always ends the same way.

183
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:00,550
The more I try to stay,

184
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:03,410
I have no choice but to leave.

185
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:06,010
Everyone. What are you all doing?

186
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:07,990
Go back to your seats.

187
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:29,320
I have the results for the exams.

188
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:38,210
The student in our class
got the highest mark again.

189
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,540
Who had the lowest mark?

190
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:16,400
Stop it.

191
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,670
You crazy jerk.

192
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:37,960
Don't think about becoming a celebrity.

193
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:40,200
I'll expose you for school violence.

194
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,720
I gave you the expected questions.

195
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:45,000
They were about the same.

196
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:47,370
- Really?
- "Really?"

197
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:50,540
What happened? Tell me!

198
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:54,280
- It's annoying.
- What's annoying?

199
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:58,240
Studying not because I want to,
but because I'm scared I might die.

200
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:01,190
I'm not interested in studying at all.

201
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,890
So you got them wrong on purpose?

202
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:06,120
No.

203
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:10,470
To be honest, I forgot
everything you went over with me.

204
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:23,940
Go and get your bag.

205
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,180
- Why?
- Just don't ask me why.

206
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,800
We need to go somewhere.

207
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:30,620
- Where?
- Anywhere.

208
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:32,470
Just not here.

209
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,700
<i>Do Not Enter</i>

210
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:54,340
All right. It's time for your meal.

211
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,190
Do as I say.

212
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,670
Gosh. Don't worry about me.

213
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:04,850
I won't die.

214
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:06,610
He can come at me.

215
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,900
Whoever he is, I'll crush him.

216
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:10,620
Like this!

217
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,420
What is it?

218
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:22,940
What's going on?

219
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:25,050
I can sense something.

220
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:37,680
<i>Doo-shim.</i>

221
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,950
<i>The Great Shaman Ga Doo Shim</i>

222
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,890
<i>What's going on?</i>

223
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:16,080
<i>How come you're not telling me anything?</i>

224
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:18,550
<i>The evil spirit that disappeared
a decade ago was at school,</i>

225
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:20,260
<i>killing students.</i>

226
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:22,990
<i>I can't be a match to him.
I'll stall time, so run.</i>

227
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,850
<i>It became a school
that all the wealthy parents</i>

228
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:27,480
<i>want to send their kids to.</i>

229
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:29,550
<i>Mom, how do you know so much about it?</i>

230
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,440
<i>Is the chairman the evil spirit?</i>

231
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:34,780
<i>How can a student at the top be
friends with a student on the bottom?</i>

232
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:37,910
<i>I can't kill you,
but I can make you sad.</i>

233
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:39,980
<i>Did he go crazy
after hanging out with her?</i>

234
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:41,870
<i>You cannot tell Il-nam about this.</i>

235
