<i>Songyoung High School</i>

2
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:13,160
<i>I had forgotten</i>

3
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:17,650
<i>that I have to deal with more
than just evil spirits.</i>

4
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:49,020
<i>I had forgotten</i>

5
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:52,280
<i>that there's someone on my side.</i>

6
00:00:58,390 --> 00:00:59,930
<i>The Great Shaman Ga Doo Shim</i>

7
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:03,360
What did you say?

8
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:06,130
Either transfer or quit school.
Choose one.

9
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:07,850
Choose one.

10
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:09,040
What's the reason?

11
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:11,280
Son. Stay quiet.

12
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:13,310
Disturbing the academic atmosphere.

13
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:16,650
She interrupted the class
and left school without permission.

14
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,010
So did I.

15
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:21,970
So I will also
either quit school or transfer.

16
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:23,560
Are you out of your mind?

17
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:29,450
I'm not transferring or quitting.

18
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:31,040
Ga Doo-shim.

19
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:33,240
This isn't a simple issue.

20
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,300
When Il-nam tried to commit suicide
last night,

21
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:36,670
you were with him, weren't you?

22
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:40,850
It will get complicated
if the police raise questions.

23
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:42,700
But we barely stopped it.

24
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:54,530
I was there too.

25
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:59,020
That's because
she forced you or threatened you,

26
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,210
so you had no choice...

27
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:01,920
I forced her and threatened her.

28
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:03,460
To help my friend.

29
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,350
What are you going to do?

30
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,190
Please calm down, ma'am.

31
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,910
We'll send her to another school.

32
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:15,080
I will give her one more chance.

33
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:20,310
As an educator, I should never
give up on my students easily.

34
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:23,390
I will take responsibility
and teach her.

35
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,900
Do you want to have a go with me?

36
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,170
It was you who brought her
to this school.

37
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,490
That was for Songyoung High School...

38
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,340
Everyone. Please leave.

39
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,110
You may stay, Doo-shim.

40
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:11,610
Ma'am. Please calm down.

41
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,460
I will...

42
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,970
Oh, ma'am.

43
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:24,770
I was in the middle of a rite
and rushed over.

44
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:26,660
What about Doo-shim?

45
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:29,870
The principal decided to let her stay
for now.

46
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,630
Really?

47
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,560
What's that sound?

48
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:49,800
This rings when there's a ghost nearby.
What's wrong with it?

49
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:34,020
Will you be able to quietly concentrate
on your studies?

50
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:37,580
Are you really not sending me
to another school?

51
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:41,590
As long as you don't cause problems
and talk about evil spirits.

52
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,720
How did you know?

53
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,050
What?

54
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:51,400
I've never once mentioned evil spirits.

55
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:07,280
I think I heard the kids talking.

56
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:15,460
Do you believe
evil spirits exist, Doo-shim?

57
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:18,280
Yes.

58
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:30,770
You'd better be careful too.

59
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:36,190
<i>CSAT Mock Exam Results</i>

60
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:41,860
One or two mistakes make
a huge difference in this school.

61
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,590
If you believe there are evil spirits,

62
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:48,150
I'd recommend you
to focus on your study.

63
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,870
Pardon?

64
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,200
Okay.

65
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:53,960
You may go.

66
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:09,670
- <i>CSAT Mock Exam Results</i>
- Not 1st, not 11th, but 101st?

67
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,840
That's not bad.

68
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:14,290
You're right in the middle.

69
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:16,710
So you're the top student, is that it?

70
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:18,420
Don't be like that.

71
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,120
I was the top student
at my previous school too.

72
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:23,750
But how is this possible?

73
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,110
That doesn't matter right now.

74
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:28,280
We don't know what'll happen to Il-nam,
and the evil spirit is still here.

75
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,650
I've already evacuated Il-nam's soul.

76
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:32,900
Evacuate? Where to?

77
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,000
I don't know.

78
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,910
I asked Hyun-soo never to tell me.

79
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:39,320
Why?

80
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:42,620
If the evil spirit enters my body,
he'll find out where Il-nam is.

81
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:49,710
Why are you looking at me like that?

82
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:54,190
I got better grades, but you're smarter.

83
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:55,950
Stop talking about grades.

84
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:00,310
I wonder how long Il-nam can hold out.

85
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,730
We don't have much time.

86
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:05,460
Once his mom agrees
to remove the respirator—

87
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:06,690
That can never happen.

88
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:10,430
We must catch it before then.

89
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:19,930
<i>Get the mock exam ready right away.</i>

90
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:22,220
A mock exam?

91
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:26,310
But it's only been a few days
since we had an exam.

92
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:29,700
We need to push students until the CSAT,
so they'll stay alert.

93
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:32,950
The bottom student got
into an accident again.

94
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:35,990
The students are anxious as it is.

95
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:39,950
The students are anxious?

96
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:46,420
- And the books in Chinese text...
- They're doing just fine.

97
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,480
Don't worry and get it ready.

98
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:54,250
If a problem occurs,
I will take responsibility.

99
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:01,680
<i>Such an idiot. What a fool.</i>

100
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,070
<i>There's no doubt
that I'm the next bottom student.</i>

101
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,120
<i>I will die too.</i>

102
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,380
<i>No, that won't happen.</i>

103
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:17,830
<i>No, I will die too.</i>

104
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:28,830
What? Why are you
looking at me like that?

105
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:35,900
You said you're a shaman.

106
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:39,430
Do you see me dead after the next exam?

107
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,380
Can shamans see that stuff?

108
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,650
We're not friends, are we?

109
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:50,650
- What?
- Don't make me think

110
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:52,630
it doesn't matter
whether you die or not.

111
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:55,230
Don't make a fool of me

112
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,650
for thinking about saving you.

113
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:01,610
What kind of crazy nonsense is that?

114
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:12,210
What's going on?

115
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:16,790
I've got a bad feeling.

116
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,410
Lee Ae-kyung.

117
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,800
Listen to me carefully.

118
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:53,570
You won't die.

119
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,180
I will leave the bag here.

120
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:59,460
See you tomorrow at school.

121
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:12,530
What a fool.

122
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:15,430
The bottom student dies anyway.

123
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:18,910
And I'm the next bottom student.

124
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:22,300
Everyone wants me dead.

125
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:26,260
So they can live.

126
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:32,150
<i>Lee Ae-kyung.
Are you trying to kill yourself?</i>

127
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:34,090
<i>Do something.</i>

128
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,740
<i>Ae-kyung. Wait.</i>

129
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,980
<i>That won't stop her.</i>

130
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:44,650
<i>Ae-kyung. Let's talk.</i>

131
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,220
- Excuse me?
<i>- Ae-kyung.</i>

132
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:55,030
<i>Over here.</i>

133
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,610
<i>Ae-kyung. Look here.</i>

134
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,330
<i>Yes. Down here.</i>

135
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:09,290
<i>Lee Ae-kyung.
Are you just going to die like that?</i>

136
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:12,540
<i>We can't end it like this.</i>

137
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:15,670
<i>Can't you please reconsider it?</i>

138
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:18,220
<i>Yes. It's too brutal</i>

139
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:22,220
<i>for us to be over
even before we give it a try.</i>

140
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,400
Who wants you dead?

141
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:33,480
Plenty of people want you to live.

142
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:35,200
How did you do that?

143
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,190
What? The characters I drew...

144
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,130
Did you do that?

145
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:50,070
Do you want to become a webtoon artist?

146
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:54,690
How did you know?
I've never told anyone about it.

147
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:58,030
If you pass this year safely,

148
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:00,100
you will become a famous webtoon artist.

149
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:02,740
Can you see that?

150
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:06,610
No, I can't see the future.

151
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:09,740
I'm saying it because you have talent.

152
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:12,950
No one will die
at Songyoung High School anymore.

153
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:15,900
Doo-shim and I'll make that happen.

154
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:38,730
No one will die
at Songyoung High School anymore?

155
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,320
Are you sure?

156
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,160
I can't do it alone.

157
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:44,450
You were showing off to her.

158
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:46,960
Are you confident without me?

159
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:50,080
Yes, I can do it.

160
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:53,340
What does that mean?

161
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:55,230
Are you worried that I'll be hurt?

162
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,210
That I'll be hurt.

163
00:12:57,650 --> 00:12:59,150
If you get involved,

164
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:01,130
I have to fight with the school
and your parents.

165
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:03,550
Fighting with evil spirits is enough.

166
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:07,550
There must be a reason
I got this ability.

167
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,720
I just started this game,
and I'm not good at it.

168
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,310
But if you help me
since you're familiar with it,

169
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,590
I'll get used to it soon.

170
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:17,760
Then I could be of help.

171
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:20,000
This isn't a game.

172
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:22,020
I decided to consider it a game.

173
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:24,710
Do you think it's realistic
for an 18-year-old high school boy

174
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,260
to fight against evil spirits
and save his friends?

175
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:31,620
I want to be the top at this game too.

176
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:55,900
What about Il-nam?

177
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:58,850
I hid him well,
but there are a lot of ghosts—

178
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:00,260
Say no more.

179
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:05,190
- Oh, I just remembered.
- I said no.

180
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:06,370
Not that.

181
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:07,960
When I brought Il-nam here,

182
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:10,510
someone was chasing
after the evil spirit.

183
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,580
What?

184
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,060
<i>Beautiful Clairvoyant Hyo-shim</i>

185
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,400
Wait.

186
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,980
We'll have the chance soon.

187
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,740
<i>Beautiful Clairvoyant Hyo-shim</i>

188
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,820
Who was it?

189
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:34,840
I know I've seen him before.

190
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:38,580
But I can't remember.

191
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:45,000
Hyun-soo. Repeat after me.

192
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:46,320
What?

193
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:48,390
Draw a circle with your left hand,

194
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:49,970
and a triangle with your right.

195
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,580
It's the best way to
improve your memory.

196
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,030
If you keep practicing it,

197
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:57,980
you'll remember that person
and your mom.

198
00:14:58,420 --> 00:14:59,520
Really?

199
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:01,850
Mom?

200
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:05,460
Okay.

201
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:14,300
Triangle... Darn it.

202
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,210
What are you doing? Mom. What's wrong?

203
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:47,040
Transfer schools this instant.

204
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:49,630
- What?
- This instant.

205
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:53,070
Quit that school.

206
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:56,100
What are you talking about?

207
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,590
There's something in your school.

208
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:02,830
I know that. An evil spirit.

209
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:08,900
It's not just an evil spirit.

210
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:15,370
<i>Songyoung High School</i>

211
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:18,670
<i>Underneath the school,</i>

212
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,930
<i>it's crowded with non-human beings.</i>

213
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,220
What's in here?

214
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:59,340
- It's Woo-soo.
- It's the top student.

215
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,030
Oh Jong-geun?

216
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,680
Kang Ji-soo.

217
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,100
Kim Jun.

218
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:11,480
Lee So-ra.

219
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:13,110
Yoo Tae-hyun.

220
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:35,550
Doo-shim.

221
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,480
<i>The Great Shaman Ga Doo Shim</i>

222
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:56,880
<i>The bottom students.</i>

223
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:59,040
<i>They're the ones
who died at this school.</i>

224
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:02,300
<i>Are you saying the evil spirit locked
the dead students up? Why?</i>

225
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:04,100
<i>Are you sure I won't die?</i>

226
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,830
<i>Say it. Am I really not dying?</i>

227
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:07,840
<i>(Announcement)</i>

228
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:10,080
<i>- I know who it is. It's your principal.
- (Principal, Park Kyung-pil)</i>

229
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:13,780
<i>It was all the principal's doing.</i>

230
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,070
<i>Do you have evidence?</i>

231
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:17,690
<i>Who would trust us?</i>

232
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:20,160
<i>People trust adults,
and that's who we're dealing with.</i>

233
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:21,300
<i>I'm not running away.</i>

234
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:23,190
<i>I'm going to make him admit</i>

235
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,817
<i>that he killed my grandma.</i>
