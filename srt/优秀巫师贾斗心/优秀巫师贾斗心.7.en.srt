00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:05,270
Are you also curious
why he's my closest friend?

2
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:08,570
People think I have
some special story behind it.

3
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:10,470
But I don't.

4

You do.

5
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:16,230
What?

6
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:18,910
You two were siblings
in your past lives.

7
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:24,810
You two were a brother and a sister
who were full of love for each other.

8
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:28,420
Which one of us was the sister?

9
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:30,620
It was Il-nam, right?

10
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,170
It was you.

11
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:37,080
You were his whining sister
who was younger than him by three years.

12
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:39,860
Don't...

13
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:45,090
You cannot tell Il-nam about this.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,050
By the way,

15
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:52,090
What?

16
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,200
So that was my past life.
What about my future?

17
00:00:58,250 --> 00:00:59,350
Close your eyes.

18
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:04,840
What do you see?

19
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:06,960
You can't see anything, right?

20
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:09,070
- That's your futureâ€”
- You.

21
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:12,060
I can see you when I close my eyes.

22
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:13,470
No.

23
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:15,490
I can only see you.

24

Are you my future?

25
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:38,630
How do I know what the future holds?
It's hard to guess a minute from now.

26
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:41,100
I'll explain everything.

28

- Oh, my.
- Mom!

29
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:51,750
I'm sure you two planned it all
and did something to my son.

35

36
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:35,390
I'm sorry, Doo-shim. I'll get going.

37

Go where?

38
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:40,410
I don't want to see people suffer
because of me.

39

41

48
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,840
Is it friendship or sympathy?

hang out with the student on the bottom?

I'm going to kill Ga Doo-shim
and take her soul.

181
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:49,360
Don't get in my way! If you do, I'll...

182
00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:01,110
How dare you put your hands on me!

183
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:09,470
Please!

184
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:12,500
Please let me kill Ga Doo-shim!

185
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:14,440
Please!

186
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:16,680
Capture the spirit. Lead the way.

187
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:19,540
Capture the spirit. Give salvation.

188
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:34,680
<i>Principal's office</i>

189
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,430
<i>I had forgotten</i>

190
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:51,350
<i>that I have to deal with more
than just evil spirits.</i>

191
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,460
<i>I had forgotten</i>

192
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:25,930
<i>that there's someone on my side.</i>

193
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:50,680
<i>The Great Shaman Ga Doo Shim</i>

194
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:52,750
<i>Get the mock exam ready right away.</i>

195
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,910
<i>I'll take responsibility
for any problems.</i>

196
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:56,310
<i>When I brought Il-nam here,</i>

197
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,030
<i>someone was chasing
after the evil spirit.</i>

198
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:00,840
<i>Do you believe
evil spirits exist, Doo-shim?</i>

199
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:04,060
<i>How did you know?
I've never once mentioned evil spirits.</i>

200
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,380
<i>Are you confident without me?</i>

201
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,780
<i>I don't know.</i>

202
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:09,420
<i>Either transfer or quit school.</i>

203
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:10,920
<i>Choose one.</i>

204
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:14,180
<i>Transfer schools this instant.
Underneath the school,</i>

205
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:16,680
<i>it's crowded with non-human beings.</i>

206
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:18,710
<i>No one will die
at Songyoung High School anymore.</i>

207
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,950
<i>I want to be the top at this game too.</i>
