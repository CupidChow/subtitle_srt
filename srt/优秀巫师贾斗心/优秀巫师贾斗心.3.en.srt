<i>Songyoung High School</i>

2
00:00:01,430 --> 00:00:05,390
So the way you calculate the value
of line AB is...

3
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,130
It's just a ridiculous dream.

4
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:16,080
Hey. I have some big news.

5
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:19,640
Apparently, that girl was
next to Jong-geun when he fell.

6
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:22,240
- No way.
- The new girl?

7
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:24,830
She must've pushed Jong-geun.

8
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:28,880
She pushed Jong-geun off
even though he didn't want to die.

9
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:31,520
But why would the new girl
do that to Jong-geun?

10
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:33,410
I guess she had a grudge against him.

11
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,260
- It's possible.
- Right?

12
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:36,450
What?

13
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:38,300
It's the rule that

14
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:41,240
the new girl gets picked on
over the most ridiculous things.

15
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:42,920
- That's the rule.
- Right.

16
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:46,790
Hey.

17
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:48,940
You.

18
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:52,600
Do you know how to
read compatibility too?

19
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:56,690
Can you check how compatible
she and I are?

20
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:00,290
Tell us if we're a good match or not.

21
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,530
- What is he saying?
- Stop it.

22
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:08,350
Why? How could she tell
how compatible we are?

23
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:11,070
I heard your grandma is a shaman
and so is your mom.

24
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,050
- My wallet disappeared.
<i>- You must be one too.</i>

25
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,510
You must know if someone stole it.

26
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:16,710
My parents are driving me crazy.
I wish they were gone!

27
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:18,470
Can you see ghosts?
What about Jong-geun?

28
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:19,960
<i>- That's enough.</i>
- Stop it, you guys.

29
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:21,680
<i>- What if she ends up</i>
- Please stop.

30
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:23,390
killing us like she did to Jong-geun?

31
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,680
Stop it!

32
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:30,390
Did we do something?

33
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,590
I guess she feels guilty
about something.

34
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:35,140
Gosh, she knows
how to attract attention.

35
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:41,700
<i>I can't hear anything you're saying.</i>

36
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:44,640
<i>To be honest, I heard what she said.</i>

37
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,280
<i>My grandma told me</i>

38
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:50,140
<i>to protect myself
during the year I turn 18.</i>

39
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:54,020
<i>If I do, I'll be able to live
a long and happy life.</i>

40
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:00,220
<i>The year I turned 18 was in danger.</i>

41
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:05,450
What is she doing?

42
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,010
Is she leaving?

43
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:09,670
Gosh, she scares me.

44
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:11,660
I know, right?

45
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:16,010
<i>Eighteen. Can I get through it safely?</i>

46
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,270
Don't go,

47
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:54,690
Doo-shim.

48
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:01,150
Grandma?

49
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:10,880
- You two should date!
- I'm getting goosebumps.

50
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:16,110
This is unbelievable!

51
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:36,520
<i>Authorized Personnel Only</i>

52
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,800
<i>The Great Shaman Ga Doo Shim</i>

53
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:50,480
What is that?

54
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,850
It's a melodrama I filmed. How is it?

55
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:55,050
I never did that!

56
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:59,050
What? I even have evidence.
What are you talking about?

57
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,670
That's so funny!

58
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:09,220
Come out for a minute.

59
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:12,560
- Why?
- Just come out for a minute!

60
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:20,030
Is this classroom a volcano?

61
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:22,810
I hear something boiling like hot lava.

62
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,660
Come on, stop it!

63
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:26,860
- Seriously.
- It's so hot!

64
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:34,120
I don't know how to put it.

65
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:37,770
- About what?
- What happened earlier, I didn't do it.

66
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,100
I didn't hug you.

67
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:43,890
What I mean is,
it's not me that hugged you.

68
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:45,870
I don't remember anything.

69
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,920
How do you know you didn't do it
when you don't remember anything?

70
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,290
What?

71
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,510
That's why I'm saying I don't remember.
Because I didn't do it.

72
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,960
I must've been possessed.

73
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,820
Possessed?

74
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:07,600
What I'm trying to say is,
I don't want you to be mistaken.

75
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:09,890
Mistaken?

76
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,220
I wouldn't be interested
even if you did do it.

77
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:13,500
That's good to hear.

78
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:16,010
Can you mind your own business?

79
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:18,430
We don't have to be friends
just because our moms are.

80
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,180
Can you hear me?

81
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,170
What?

82
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,330
He's here.

83
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:36,070
The evil spirit you met ten years ago.

84
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:40,850
He's killing the kids here.

85
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,420
Just like back then.

86
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:46,280
What are you talking about?

87
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,960
How do you know that evil spirit?

88
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:53,310
Doo-shim. Open your eyes and look at me.

89
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:57,410
Look at the face beyond this one.

90
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,400
What are you saying?

91
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:02,730
Stop messing with me.

92
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,230
Doo-shim.

93
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:07,090
It's grandma.

94
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,430
I told you to stop messing with me!

95
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:30,010
Grandma?

96
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:45,940
That's so creepy!
They're practically glued together!

97
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:49,100
- They might even kiss at this rate!
- Oh my goodness.

98
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:01,160
What happened?

99
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:03,670
Is that really you, Grandma?

100
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:06,660
I'll explain later.

101
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:07,980
For now...

102
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:13,350
He's coming.

103
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,350
Long time no see, Myo-shim.

104
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:36,180
- Run away!
- Grandma!

105
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:39,040
Be bound by my words and stop.
You got what you wanted. You've had...

106
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,040
Grandma!

107
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:46,120
Myo-shim's granddaughter, Doo-shim.

108
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,100
You've grown a lot.

109
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,810
You've become more evil.

110
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,560
What on earth happened?

111
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:49,480
- Who are you?
- Get lost.

112
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:50,800
What?

113
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:55,770
Doo-shim. I think he can see me.

114
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:13,190
What? He can really see me!

115
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:17,730
Hurry up and get lost!

116
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,440
What was that just now?

117
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:25,160
Did you really see Hyun-soo?

118
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:26,790
Hyun-soo?

119
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:28,500
That can't be possible.

120
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:33,960
Here!

121
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:35,810
You punk.

122
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:41,750
What is that?

123
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,940
A ghost.

124
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:44,830
A ghost?

125
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:50,280
I see ghosts?

126
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:52,170
I'm dreaming now, right?

127
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,180
"If only this were a dream."
I always think that.

128
00:09:57,410 --> 00:10:00,230
Ghosts don't exist.
What did you do to me?

129
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:02,820
Let go of me. It wasn't me.

130
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:04,410
What is it then? What's wrong with me?

131
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:06,170
I don't know. I really don't.

132
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,830
<i>Enter this way when it rains!</i>

133
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:28,600
Goodbye.

134
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,120
Capture the spirit. Lead the way.

135
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:33,840
Capture the spirit. Give salvation.

136
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,620
Did you forget?

137
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:39,780
"Only possess the student
who is in last place."

138
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:41,580
That's the pact between you and me.

139
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:44,490
I will trap you forever
if you do this again.

140
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:59,140
Did something happen to you at school?

141
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,460
Nothing happened.

142
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:02,390
I heard you went to the nurse's office.

143
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,670
What happened?

144
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:05,740
I was tired from
adjusting to the new school.

145
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:08,470
You must be tired.
It's a prestigious school.

146
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:10,930
Let's eat something
good for your health, Sweety.

147
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,460
Why did you come to school?

148
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:26,150
Hey, I'm a student too.

149
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,090
It's only natural for a student
to go to school.

150
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:30,420
You talk as if you excelled in school.

151
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:31,650
Darn you.

152
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:34,200
Do you know how surprised
Woo-soo was because of you?

153
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,370
Do you like him?

154
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,670
- What?
- I mean...

155
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,260
It seems like you care about him.

156
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,320
You like him, don't you?

157
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:46,650
Hey, you can fool a ghost but not me.

158
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,850
You're a ghost too, you idiot.

159
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:50,700
Oh, that's right.

160
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:56,110
Hey. Did Woo-soo really see me?

161
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,050
What happened?

162
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:02,490
Grandma possessed his body for a while.

163
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:03,640
Grandma?

164
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:06,320
Your grandma?

165
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:10,990
I'm sure something changed
because of Grandma.

166
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:16,570
Are you feeling okay, Woo-soo?

167
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:18,640
I heard you went to the nurse's office.

168
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:20,710
I was surprised.

169
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:28,280
Okay, Sweety. Eat up.

170
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:29,990
Here.

171
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:37,080
Why? Is something wrong?

172
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:41,960
I saw Grandma at school.

173
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:45,570
Your grandma?

174
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:48,070
I haven't seen her once
even at the charnel house,

175
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,450
but she suddenly appeared at school.

176
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:54,630
So? What did she say?

177
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:57,310
Well, she said she missed me.

178
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:00,390
Is that all?

179
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,610
Didn't she tell you the winning numbers
for the lottery or something?

180
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:09,150
Sure enough. That's my mom.
She wouldn't tell us such things.

181
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:12,580
My gosh. I suddenly feel empty.

182
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:14,210
You're not going to eat this, are you?

183
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,420
Did you run away from home?

184
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,360
Are you finally being rebellious?

185
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,160
I saw a ghost.

186
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:35,860
I thought it was a human,
but it was a ghost.

187
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:41,140
Doo-shim. I think he can see me.

188
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:48,440
She said I saw a ghost.

189
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:50,900
- Who said that?
- Doo-shim.

190
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:53,410
Doo-shim? The heroine of the melodrama?

191
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,970
You are so into her.

192
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:59,260
- It's not like that.
- "It's not like that."

193
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:04,500
Does that even make sense?
There's no such thing as ghosts.

194
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:14,090
But I saw them twice today.

195
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:19,980
Woo-soo. Get some fresh air
and come to the food cart.

196
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:22,140
I'll ask my mom
to make you something healthy.

197
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:44,580
<i>He's here.</i>

198
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:47,970
<i>The evil spirit you met ten years ago.</i>

199
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:51,310
<i>He's killing the kids here.</i>

200
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:53,910
<i>Just like back then.</i>

201
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:57,160
<i>Myo-shim's granddaughter, Doo-shim.</i>

202
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:59,360
<i>You've grown a lot.</i>

203
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,570
It's driving me crazy.

204
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,090
Why is there an evil spirit
at the school I transferred to?

205
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:09,920
<i>We're closed.</i>

206
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:16,170
You look like a student.

207
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:18,810
We don't read tarot cards here.

208
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:21,760
I'm not here to have my fortune told.
I'm here to see Doo-shim.

209
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:25,890
Doo-shim? Do you know him?

210
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,400
Leave.

211
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,300
- Let's talk.
- Let's talk at school tomorrow.

212
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:33,330
- Why did you come at this late hour?
- It's urgent.

213
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:34,960
I can't stand even a day like this.

214
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:38,080
I didn't even believe in ghosts,
so why do I see them?

215
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:40,320
What did you do to me?

216
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:49,390
Do you think I did that to you?

217
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:51,190
Who could've possibly done it then?

218
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:58,930
I'll give you as much money as you want.
Put me back to normal.

219
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,120
What are you talking about?

220
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,110
You're a shaman.

221
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:05,270
I'm a shaman.

222
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:19,700
Go. It wasn't me,

223
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:21,460
and there's nothing I can do about it.

224
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,190
Tell me if you find out how to do that.

225
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:27,050
Do I have to live like this?
And keep seeing ghosts?

226
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:28,590
I've been living that way.

227
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,930
The world I see has
always been like that.

228
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,880
<i>Beautiful Clairvoyant, Hyo-shim</i>

229
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,770
Are you scared already?

230
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,890
You're not even close
to seeing that world clearly.

231
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:41,260
I'm not scared.

232
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,600
Is the world you see
different from mine?

233
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:47,510
Yes, a lot.

234
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:50,850
- How is it different?
- It's clearer than yours.

235
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:53,840
The things I see and the things I hear.

236
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,980
You're saying
I'll become like you, right?

237
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:00,050
Maybe.

238
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:01,630
Wait.

239
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:05,850
Can I have a preview?

240
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,010
You'll regret it.

241
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:10,770
I've already been regretting it

242
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:12,670
since I asked you
to read my compatibility.

243
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:20,800
Are they around here too?

244
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:22,700
There are.

245
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:24,510
How many?

246
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:26,440
See it with your own eyes.

247
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,350
What are you doing?

248
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:35,860
Close your eyes.

249
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:48,130
Can I really see ghosts if we do this?

250
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,160
Welcome to my world.

251
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:31,340
<i>The Great Shaman Ga Doo Shim</i>

252
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:33,230
<i>Hey, we have to take the exam again.</i>

253
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,170
<i>Mr. Principal,
someone else might die again.</i>

254
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:37,540
<i>Are you saying we should cancel the exam
because of a rumor?</i>

255
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:41,110
<i>Just make sure none of your students
come in last place.</i>

256
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:43,530
<i>You'll be in trouble
if something happens to Woo-soo.</i>

257
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:45,510
<i>Can't you feel
that everyone is talking about you?</i>

258
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:47,790
<i>Chairman Na's wife
is asking for me urgently.</i>

259
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,640
<i>His son must be in trouble.</i>

260
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:51,620
<i>How have you put up with it
all this time?</i>

261
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:53,120
<i>I can't stand it even for a day.</i>

262
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:54,880
<i>Even you struggled
with that evil spirit.</i>

263
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:56,990
<i>How can Doo-shim deal
with that evil spirit alone?</i>

264
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,230
<i>The only one who can deal with him</i>

265
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,990
<i>is Doo-shim.</i>

266
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:03,384
