<i>Songyoung High School</i>

2
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:12,870
You crazy jerk.

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,200
Don't think about becoming a celebrity.

4
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:17,220
I'll expose you for school violence.

5
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:22,330
I gave you the expected questions.
They were about the same.

6
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:25,100
- Really?
- "Really?"

7
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:28,130
What happened? Tell me!

8
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:31,430
- It's annoying.
- What's annoying?

9
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:35,520
Studying not because I want to,
but because I'm scared I might die.

10
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:38,160
I'm not interested in studying at all.

11
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:42,260
So you got them wrong on purpose?

12
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:43,580
No.

13
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:47,490
To be honest, I forgot
everything you went over with me.

14
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:01,310
Go and get your bag.

15
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,730
- Why?
- Just don't ask me why.

16
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:05,210
We need to go somewhere.

17
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,640
- Where?
- Anywhere.

18
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:09,890
Just not here.

19
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:22,120
<i>Do Not Enter</i>

20
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:31,930
All right. It's time for your meal.

21
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,870
Do as I say.

22
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,270
Gosh. Don't worry about me. I won't die.

23
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,070
He can come at me.

24
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,400
Whoever he is, I'll crush him.

25
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,900
Like this!

26
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:56,830
What is it?

27
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,260
What's going on?

28
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:02,420
I can sense something.

29
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:18,650
What should I do
if there's an evil spirit like you said?

30
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:21,020
What do you mean?

31
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,450
The evil spirit will
kill another student.

32
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:26,660
Is there a way to catch him
before he does?

33
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:30,180
Do you think the evil spirit is like
Casper the Friendly Ghost?

34
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:33,520
Just hope that you or your friend
don't end up on the bottom.

35
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,720
You can't do anything about it.

36
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:39,950
What if it was your friend?

37
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,130
<i>I don't care what happens to Il-nam.</i>

38
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,240
<i>He's not my friend.</i>

39
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:54,600
He's not my friend!
I don't have friends!

40
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:59,390
We know. We all know that you don't.

41
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:04,630
Did she see another ghost?

42
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:13,740
<i>Doo-shim.</i>

43
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:29,800
<i>Be bound by my words and stop.
You got what you wanted.</i>

44
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,290
You've had your fun in that body.
Now leave.

45
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:32,350
Doo-shim!

46
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:40,520
Did he run away?

47
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:42,950
He's here. Can you see him?

48
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,860
- No.
<i>- Listen to me carefully.</i>

49
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:49,200
When the evil spirit comes at us,
take Il-nam to the gate.

50
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,090
<i>You'll do this alone?</i>

51
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:53,950
No. I can't be a match to him.

52
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:56,410
I'll stall time, so run.

53
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:59,320
- I want to fight too.
- You'll only get in my way for now.

54
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:01,390
Hey, can someone explain
what's going on?

55
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:03,980
Shut it. I have no interest
in saving you.

56
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:05,650
This is all your friend's fault.

57
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:07,630
So live.

58
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,390
This is driving me crazy.

59
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:11,330
What on earth is going on here?

60
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,750
He's coming.

61
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,940
Run!

62
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,270
Be bound by my words and stop.
You got what you wanted.

63
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,070
You've had your fun in that body.
Now leave.

64
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,080
<i>Be honest, stay diligent,
and challenge yourself.</i>

65
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,440
- Hurry.
- I'm tired.

66
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:42,350
- Where are we going?
- Just hurry up!

67
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:46,970
My bag is still at school.

68
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:00,390
Are you all right?

69
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:05,620
How...

70
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:46,350
Are you all right?

71
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,270
What? Yes.

72
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:50,890
I don't know what's going on.

73
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:54,500
Isn't Doo-shim so cool?

74
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,850
She went, "Take this!"

75
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,230
She was like a heroine
in a martial arts novel.

76
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,910
She's totally my type.

77
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,670
I get why dummies live long.

78
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:08,360
- What?
- Fine. Enjoy it while you can.

79
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:10,160
You'll end up crying soon.

80
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:17,820
<i>Grandma, what am I supposed to do?</i>

81
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,380
Run.

82
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,060
<i>Exit</i>

83
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:54,120
<i>Available parking spots</i>

84
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,290
Be bound by my words and stop.
You got what you wanted.

85
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,700
You've had your fun in that body.
Now leave.

86
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:30,060
Take this!

87
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,710
Be bound by my words and stop.
You got what you wanted.

88
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,210
You've had your fun in that body.
Now leave.

89
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:43,790
Be bound by my words and stop.
You got what you wanted.

90
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:50,600
Is this a friendship or pity?

91
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:54,390
How can a student at the top be
friends with a student on the bottom?

92
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,540
Shut it.

93
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:57,560
I can't kill you,

94
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,940
but I can make you sad.

95
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:50,580
Why are you so eager to save
a useless boy like him?

96
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:51,990
Are you talking about yourself?

97
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,880
Is Myo-shim here too?

98
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:55,590
No.

99
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,570
What can you do by yourself?

100
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,600
I'm not alone.

101
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,340
What happened?

102
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:06,080
I told them I would listen
to their stories if they helped us.

103
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:10,120
When will I finish listening to
all of those ghosts' stories?

104
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:12,500
I'll help you.

105
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:15,100
Are you all right?

106
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,870
What about you?

107
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:20,160
What do you mean?

108
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:22,180
The whole school knows.

109
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:26,670
I heard that your mom is a shaman.

110
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:28,470
It's true, right?

111
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:31,110
I can't do anything about that.

112
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:33,620
Keeping Il-nam safe comes first for now.

113
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:37,800
Thank you.

114
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:43,690
He's safe thanks to you.

115
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,430
What are you doing?

116
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:55,090
What's going on?

117
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:58,210
How come you're not telling me anything?

118
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:03,400
Well, let's go to a safe place for now.

119
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:11,500
<i>An evil spirit?</i>

120
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,610
And he only kills students
on the bottom?

121
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:16,470
The evil spirit that disappeared
a decade ago was at school,

122
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:18,060
killing students.

123
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:22,630
Fine. Let's say there is an evil spirit.

124
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,870
Why would the evil spirit kill students?

125
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,410
Out of jealousy for the low scores?

126
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,800
What would the evil spirit
gain from killing us?

127
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,880
You really are dumb. Isn't that obvious?

128
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,830
What is it then? Do you know why?

129
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:39,090
What happened to the school
when the students

130
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:40,930
with the lowest scores died?

131
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:42,300
Nothing much.

132
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,720
Kids with low scores
started to get scared.

133
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:47,840
Right. So what happened then?

134
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,560
After that?

135
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:52,590
They all started to study frantically.

136
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,400
Right.

137
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,770
That's when our school
rapidly became prestigious.

138
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:59,630
It became a school
that all the wealthy parents

139
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,610
want to send their kids to.

140
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:05,090
Is the evil spirit the chairman
of the foundation?

141
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:12,700
Anyway, kids will continue to die.

142
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:14,060
Unless someone puts a stop to it.

143
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:18,150
Mom, how do you know so much about this?

144
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:21,010
Me?

145
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:27,350
I'm the one and only
Beautiful Clairvoyant Hyo-shim.

146
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,830
Okay?

147
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:41,390
<i>What's happening?</i>

148
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:44,860
Capture the spirit. Lead the way.
Capture the spirit. Give salvation.

149
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:49,390
Be patient. You'll get your chance soon.

150
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:50,980
<i>Beautiful Clairvoyant Hyo-shim</i>

151
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:18,250
I don't know about this.

152
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:20,850
I'm leaving.

153
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:27,360
Sit down.

154
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:30,490
An evil spirit?

155
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:33,700
I take back how I said
Doo-shim was cool earlier.

156
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:35,460
Did you go crazy
after hanging out with her?

157
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:39,150
Keep wasting your time
with this evil spirit.

158
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:40,600
I'll go help my mom.

159
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,170
Your baby toe is severely crooked

160
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:48,960
because he couldn't buy you new shoes,
so you had to wear small shoes.

161
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,130
Your father is heartbroken about it.

162
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:58,560
That's a secret no one knows.
How did you...

163
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:02,960
Did you tell her?

164
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:06,170
This is my first time hearing about it.

165
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:09,070
When you were seven,
he was distracted for a moment.

166
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,230
And a dog bit you which left a scar.

167
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:13,470
Whenever he saw that,
it broke his heart.

168
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,460
Darn it.

169
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,190
Stop that. If you're playing me—

170
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,870
When you were in sixth grade,
kids thought you were a thief.

171
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:24,690
He didn't believe you, so he went

172
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:27,290
- to your school and begged—
- That's enough. Stop lying to me!

173
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:32,650
So you know everything?

174
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:36,000
My father wouldn't be sorry.

175
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:37,180
Do you know why?

176
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,290
Because he died
after pulling you out of the water?

177
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,780
He's sorry about that too.

178
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:51,400
To have died on your first family trip
and when it should've been

179
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:53,820
the happiest day of your life.

180
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,080
And that he tainted
the day with sadness.

181
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,990
So don't do anything stupid
for your father's sake.

182
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,550
If you can get through this year,

183
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:07,810
you'll live a very long life.

184
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,340
When did you talk to his father?

185
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:48,680
When you were tutoring him
at the food stall.

186
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:54,180
Let me tell you
why his baby toe is crooked.

187
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:56,560
I couldn't buy him shoes growing up,
so he wore small shoes.

188
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:59,060
When he was seven, if I was
more attentive, he would have...

189
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:01,790
If I hadn't died that day...

190
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,960
You listen to their stories too.

191
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:08,610
I wasn't listening. I just let him
talk to himself next to me.

192
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,110
Good for him.
A lot of people want to protect him.

193
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:16,750
Aren't you his biggest guardian angel?

194
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:18,950
Me?

195
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:24,890
Are you also curious
why he's my closest friend?

196
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:27,620
People think I have
some special story behind it.

197
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,690
But I don't.

198
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:33,470
You do.

199
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:35,450
What?

200
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:38,180
You two were siblings
in your past lives.

201
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:43,940
You two were a brother and a sister
who were full of love for each other.

202
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,560
Which one of us was the sister?

203
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:50,760
It was Il-nam, right?

204
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,220
It was you.

205
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:57,450
You were his whining sister
who was younger than him by three years.

206
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:00,130
Don't...

207
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:05,370
You cannot tell Il-nam about this.

208
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:08,840
By the way,

209
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,000
can you see my future too?

210
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:14,080
What?

211
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:16,230
So that was my past life.
What about my future?

212
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:19,450
Il-nam will live a very long life.

213
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:20,990
What about me?

214
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:26,090
Close your eyes.

215
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:31,370
What do you see?

216
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:33,830
You can't see anything, right?

217
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,420
- That's your future—
- You.

218
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,860
I can see you when I close my eyes.

219
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,140
No.

220
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:43,290
I can only see you.

221
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:06,790
Are you my future?

222
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:30,810
<i>The Great Shaman Ga Doo Shim</i>

223
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:33,540
<i>Il-nam went to school,
saying that he forgot something there.</i>

224
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:34,640
<i>This is a bust.</i>

225
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,310
<i>I should close up the shop here.</i>

226
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,540
<i>And you'll transfer again.</i>

227
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:40,000
<i>I got this far. I can't give up yet.</i>

228
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:42,560
<i>Even if I have to transfer,
I'll put an end to this first.</i>

229
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,270
<i>I'm going to school now. Don't come.</i>

230
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,420
<i>Il-nam is my friend.</i>

231
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,220
<i>You came, my friend.</i>

232
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:49,900
<i>It's not the students with good grades
that are dying.</i>

233
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:53,510
<i>- Doo-shim!
- Come out of Il-nam's body now. Leave!</i>

234
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,500
<i>Did you think you could stop me
like this?</i>

235
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,580
<i>Tell our class that this is what happens
when they get bad grades.</i>

236
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:00,900
<i>No!</i>

237
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:03,517
