- What is this?

4
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:08,250
Another exam?

5

6
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:22,990
Don't tell anyone about this.

7
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:25,360
I want to get the lowest scores
on the upcoming exam.

8
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:29,590
I'm starting to think
if being on the bottom is actually good.

9

Listen.

10
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:34,430
You must think getting
the lowest scores is easy, but it's not.

11
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:36,620
Yes, it is.
I'll just have to score lower than you.

12

13

15
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:46,480

as your effort to get them wrong?

16
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:50,000
I didn't think about that.

17
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:51,140
Forget it.

18

And you'd be up against an evil spirit.

21

What? An evil spirit?

22
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:06,320
He possesses the bodies of students
on the bottom and controls them.

23

with the lowest scores.

That's the rule.

29

Do you think I'll say yes to that?
You lunatic.

42

What on earth did you do to me?

47
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,350
I knew something was up
when you invited me to your house.

48
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:09,300
It felt as if something weird
was entering my body.

49
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,890

anything after that.

51
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,290
No, explain it to me now.

52
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:25,580
Did Doo-shim ask you to do this?
To bully me?

53
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,330
No.

54
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:38,770
So you went down to the basement
with the kids

55
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:40,180
and saw an evil spirit?

56
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:44,270
Yes. I didn't see it with my own eyes.
But I'm sure there was something.

57
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,640
I didn't believe it at first.

58

61
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,700
We must cancel the exam
and catch the evil spirit.

62
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:56,990
Even if we have to close down
the school. We can't let...

63
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:00,990
Fine. Let's say
that there is an evil spirit.

64

Then who is the better educator here?

- Sir.
- Who is it?

or the ones who don't want to study.

67

the students study on their own?

178
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:53,080
I'm giving Ga Doo-shim a chance.

179
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:56,690
A chance for her to prove
that there is an evil spirit at school.

180
00:14:57,610 --> 00:14:58,980
So switch them.

181
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:02,940
Sir, I beg of you.

182
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:10,720

Did you know that?

187
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:21,340
How many did you get right?

188
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:28,070
- Really?
- Did you know that?

189
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,390
You really did?

190
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,370
Come on. Have you been there?

191
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,600

Mr. Sa.

193
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:57,150
Did someone in our class get
the lowest scores?

194
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:06,830
Mr. Sa. Tell us.

195
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:12,010
Na Woo-soo.

196
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:16,380
Don't tell us who has the highest scores.
The one with the lowest scores.

197
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,300
What is this?

198
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:28,390
How come you have the lowest scores?

199
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:47,710
<i>I decided to get the lowest scores.</i>

200
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:50,520
<i>I'll face the evil spirit.</i>

201
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:53,600
<i>I might be able to catch
the evil spirit,</i>

202
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:56,640
<i>but I might end up like Il-nam.</i>

203
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,320

204
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,390

207
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:37,600
<i>Risking my life. I feel relieved now.</i>

208
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:39,140
<i>Then why did you do it?
Is this your rebellious act?</i>

209
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:41,430
<i>No, this was all I had planned.
So what will you do now?</i>

210
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:43,140
<i>My school has become a big mess.</i>

211
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:46,000
<i>I must get rid of this.
And it will go back to the way it was.</i>

212
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:48,070
<i>We have to wait
until all the kids leave.</i>

00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,960
<i>Na Woo-soo, do you think
I can't take over your body?</i>

217
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:58,720
<i>If the evil spirit possesses my body...</i>

218
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:00,300
<i>I'll hammer your head with an ax.</i>

219
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:02,460
<i>You are truly evil.</i>

220
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:04,570
