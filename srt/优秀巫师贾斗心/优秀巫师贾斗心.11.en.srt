2
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:05,690
Did you know that?

3
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:06,880
Really?

4
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:08,160
How many did you get right?

5
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,630
Mr. Sa. Did someone in our class get
the lowest scores?

6
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:53,960
Mr. Sa. Tell us.

7
00:00:58,050 --> 00:00:59,150
Na Woo-soo.

8
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,380
Don't tell us who has the highest scores.
The one with the lowest scores.

9
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:08,260
What is this?

10
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:11,380
<i>Na Woo-soo</i>

11
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:15,210
How come you have the lowest scores?

<i>The Great Shaman Ga Doo Shim</i>

13
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,760
I feel relieved now.

14
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:45,830
What?

15
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,220
I always felt guilty about how
my mother slapped your mother's cheek.

16
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:50,760
We're even now.

17
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,530
Do you have any idea what you've done?

18
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:55,950
Something I've never done
in my whole life.

19
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:57,760
Risking my life.

20
00:01:58,550 --> 00:01:59,870
Then why did you do it?

21
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,820
Are you going through puberty?
Is this your rebellious act?

22
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,620
- Why on earthâ€”
- Why did you do it then?

23
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:08,830
- What?
- Why did you try to get the lowest scores?

24
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,770
How did you know that?

25
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,100
Did Ae-kyung tell you that?

26
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:18,830
So it wasn't a dream.

27
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:26,970
Did you

28
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:30,930
get the lowest scores because of me?

29
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:40,080
This exam is invalid.

30
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:43,600
So there must have been an error.

31
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:46,420
This exam should never have happened.
Got that?

32
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,460
So explain that to the students,
parents, and teachers.

33
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,150
This exam won't count.

34
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,170
Did you get that? Okay?

35
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:59,970
Hey, you. You should have stopped me.
You're the vice principal.

36
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:02,830
Why won't you speak?

37
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,290
Go out there and
explain this whole thing!

38
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:07,140
Okay. I'm on it, sir.

39
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:08,860
This exam won't count.

40
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,640
Seriously.
What am I going to do with that wench?

41
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,130
What...

42
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:17,430
See? I would've gotten the lowest scores
if it weren't for you.

43
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:20,160
Goodness. You're something else.

44
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:22,230
You got everything wrong
except for one question.

45
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,290
No, that wasn't me.

46
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:26,540
- What?
- That's not mine.

47
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:28,700
- Someone rigged it.
- Who?

48
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:33,270
Someone who probably wants me
out of this school and this world.

49
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:36,520
He probably had no idea
that you would bomb your exam.

50
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,210
So I got him this time.

51
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,800
No, you ruined my plan.

52
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:42,820
What will you do now?

53
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:44,180
What do you mean?

54
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:46,820
You must have a plan
after getting the lowest scores.

55
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:49,070
No, this was all I had planned.

56
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,390
So what will you do now?
You'll protect me, right?

57
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:57,380
Come on!

58
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,420
Oh, no. Why is it moving?

59
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:17,090
No. You can't come out today.

60
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:20,030
You can't come out. Never!

61
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:22,070
<i>I have become stronger thanks to you.</i>

62
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:24,310

63
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,180
No.

- No. Don't come out.
<i>- Who had the lowest scores on this exam?</i>

65
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:33,150
Doo-shim.

66
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,490
I'll get her for you.

67
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:37,770
Just wait until she gets
the lowest scores.

68
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:39,350
<i>So it wasn't her this time?</i>

69
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:41,650
<i>I don't care.</i>

70
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,640
<i>I'll do whatever I want now.</i>

71
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:49,780
No.

72
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:55,720
- Seriously.
- I don't get it.

73
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:58,630
- What's wrong with her?
- What are you doing?

74
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:03,690
I think I forgot something at school.

75
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:05,540
What?

76
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,350
My friends.

77
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:11,830
- Ae-kyung.
- Where are you going?

78
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,190
Come on.

80
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:29,160
<i>Shouldn't we face him now?</i>

81
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,800
We have to wait
until all the kids leave.

82
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:33,960
We can't fight the evil spirit
with them here.

83
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:45,350
Doo-shim.

84
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:49,490
If the evil spirit possesses my body...

85
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:53,580
I'll hammer your head with an ax.
And I won't hesitate.

86
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,020
Put this on.

87
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:03,790
My mother made this with talismans.

88
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:06,780
The talismans will stop
the evil spirit from attacking you.

89
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,330
I don't know how effective this will be.

90
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,220
We're about to find out.

91
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,070
What are you two doing?

92
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,230
Were you two about to...

93
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,100
About to what?

94
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:32,470
Were you about to...

95
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,060
catch the evil spirit without me?

96
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,200
Leave. It's too dangerous.

97
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:44,350
Don't be a nuisance. Stay out of it.

98
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,470
I was supposed to get the lowest scores.

99
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:48,010
I should be there, not you.

100

Why are you here?

103
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:05,300
Ae-kyung told me everything.

104
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:08,820
And I owe it to Doo-shim.

105
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,340
Let's save Woo-soo.

106
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:16,380
Listen to someone
who's had a lot of fights.

107
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:18,980
We need to outnumber it
if we want to stand a chance.

108
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:20,780
I want to fight the evil spirit too.

109

Fine.

110
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:28,480
We do need your help.

111
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,310
All right. Listen very carefully.

112
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:34,420
Here's my plan.

113
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:39,920
<i>When Woo-soo shows himself,
the evil spirit will show up too.</i>

114
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:47,580
<i>Then I'll use a talisman
to keep him locked in one place.</i>

115
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:50,530
<i>He'll try to come out,
but he's already locked in.</i>

116
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:56,380
<i>That's when I need you two
to come out of the classroom.</i>

117
00:07:57,790 --> 00:08:00,470
<i>The moment he gets distracted
by the pain,</i>

118
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,700
<i>that's when...</i>

119
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:03,370
Be bound by my words and stop.
You got what you wanted.

120
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:05,220
You've had your fun in that body.
Now leave.

122
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,040
Perfect.

123
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:33,030
When did you put up the talismans?

124
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:35,350
I need you to do that now.

125
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:47,370
Will we be able to see the evil spirit?

126
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:56,920
Close your eyes.

127
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:17,070
Do me one favor. Don't get hurt.

- Don't worry.
- Don't worry.

What is it?

130
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,620
Nothing. It's nothing.

131
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:47,340
Doo-shim, don't leave my side.

132
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:50,070
You're the one with the lowest scores.

The ax. We must find the ax.

180
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:44,010
- I didn't want to believe it.
- Let go of me.

181
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,080
This is all your fault!

182
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,610
After you got here,
my school has become a big mess!

183
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:54,170
I must get rid of you.
And it will go back to the way it was.

184
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:57,120
You are truly evil.

185
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:59,100
What did you say?

186
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,400
Let go of me.

187
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,780
To keep you alive, I must hand her over.

188
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:07,070
You stupid child.

189
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:28,100
Don't move.

190
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:31,000
Do you have any idea

191
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:35,180
how hard I worked for this school?

192
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:42,920
Do you think they caught it?

193
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,300
I hope they are okay.

194
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:47,020
Go down if you're worried about them.

195
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,160
No.

196
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:10,470
Songyoung High School was hopeless
before I got here.

197
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:14,600
It was me who turned this school,
full of stupid students,

198
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:21,860
into the most prestigious
high school in Korea. I did that.

199
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:23,620
Who could dare

200
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:29,300
criticize me given everything
I've done for the school? No one!

201
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:30,570
Darn you!

202
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:34,490
Darn you!

203
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:38,270
I'm cursing at you in place of

204
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:42,500
all those kids who died because of you.

205
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,690
Let's find the evil spirit first.

206
00:16:58,380 --> 00:16:59,610
Darn you.

207
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:04,310
And that one is for my grandma.

208
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:11,040
It's on the rooftop.

209
00:17:14,090 --> 00:17:16,110
I have the highest scores in school.

210
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,870
I don't want to die!

211
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:19,370
Su-jeong!

212
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,920
Please help me!

213
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:24,770
I don't want to die!

214
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:27,060
Please save me!

215
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,570
Su-jeong, get a grip!

216
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:40,920
I got you now.

217
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:00,150
Do you see yourself dying?

218
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,510
Can you see it?

219
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:07,720
No.

220
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:10,970
Exactly.

221
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,570
Because I'm going to save you.

222
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,550
<i>The Great Shaman Ga Doo Shim</i>

223
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:35,350
<i>Apologize to the kids who have died.</i>

224
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,940
<i>No one is going to care
even if they die.</i>

225
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:39,000
<i>Woo-soo.</i>

226
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:41,460
<i>Doo-shim, I can see my death.</i>

227
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:42,740
<i>You're getting weak.</i>

228
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:45,340
<i>Kids died because of you.</i>

229
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:48,720
<i>These are poor kids who are in pain
because of the evil spirit.</i>

230
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:50,040
<i>Those poor kids.</i>

231
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:52,070
<i>Doo-shim, what will you do
when you graduate?</i>

232
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,260
<i>I want to leave.</i>

233
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:56,070
<i>Doo-shim, you have to make a choice now.</i>

234
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,740
<i>My grandma totally deceived me.</i>

235
00:18:57,830 --> 00:18:59,770
<i>Where are you, Il-nam?</i>

236
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:01,000
<i>This is too much.</i>

237
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:03,600
<i>I'll be living
a long and happy life, right?</i>

238
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,229
