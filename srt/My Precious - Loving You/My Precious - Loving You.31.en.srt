Well,

50
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,240
I'm leaving.

51
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,120
Let me walk you to the door.

52
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,360
Well,

53
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,424
I'm leaving.

54
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,744
Wait.

55
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,264
Well,

56
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,720
do you want to move back?

57
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:32,960
But

58
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,400
I just moved out.

59
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,720
If I need to move back,

60
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,840
there should be a reason.

61
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,672
Well,

62
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,340
tell your parents

63
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:44,400
that we are

64
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,640
really dating.

65
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,816
What do you think?

66
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,920
What are you doing, Shen Mi?

67
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,080
What are you doing?

68
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,160
- What are you doing?
- What do you think?

69
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,920
Do you really think he's a nice guy?

70
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,200
He only invested in Tianlin Hospital

71
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,520
for himself.

72
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,840
Once Tianlin gets

73
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,880
the qualification of the pilot hospital,

74
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,200
he will immediately return to Lvchuan

75
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,320
and become a CEO.

76
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,424
Understand?

77
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,056
And

78
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,960
I quit my job at Tianlin.

79
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,720
How do you know all this?

80
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,280
Tell her, how do I know all this?

81
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,120
I am his younger brother.

82
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,240
Is it true

83
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,120
what he said?

84
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,056
Yes.

85
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,600
My uncle, Shen Hongyuan,

86
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,880
who is Shen Chen's father,

87
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,200
was afraid that I would gain power

88
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,500
and control Lvchuan in the future,

89
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,080
so he deliberately made me trouble

90
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,360
in front of my grandpa

91
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,400
and asked me

92
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,520
to turn a hospital with serious losses
into profits in one year.

93
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,620
Then why did you help Shen Chen

94
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:37,640
lie to us?

95
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,600
If I expose him,

96
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,440
he will tell my family

97
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,800
you are not a real cardiologist.

98
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,720
I'm sorry.

99
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,120
I admit that

100
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,000
I was indeed

101
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,280
using you as a shield at first,

102
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,880
but later…

103
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,848
I…

104
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,840
W-What?

105
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,000
I don't want you to leave me.

106
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,920
But you lied to me once,

107
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,880
can I still trust you?

108
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,880
Whether I go back to Lvchuan or not,

109
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,800
I hope you will always be by my side.

110
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,168
I am sorry.

111
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,520
Where is Shen Chen?

112
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,220
Why haven't I seen him these past few days?

113
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:38,340
He stays in his room,

114
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:39,800
saying he had to study

115
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,840
some project

116
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,560
and told me not to bother him.

117
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,840
What can he study? Do you trust him?

118
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,520
Don't you understand

119
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,560
your son?

120
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,800
No one can stop him

121
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,960
from what he wants to do.

122
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:53,140
And he took a bunch of food and drinks in.

123
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:54,440
What can I do?

124
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,760
Forget it.

125
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,080
Let him be.

126
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,400
I don't want you two fighting

127
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,520
in the morning.

128
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,800
Shen, sit down. Let's eat.

129
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,740
This brat!

130
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,240
You've spoiled him.

131
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,360
You just know to blame me.

132
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,640
What? Shen Chen has quit?

133
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,240
He said it himself last night.

134
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,640
- Tian…
- Yuxian!

135
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,320
It's normal for a young man
to do something extreme

136
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,480
because of love.

137
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,104
Now what?

138
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,540
At the critical moment,

139
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:46,900
we are short of a person for the competition.

140
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,800
Right, I remember the final round

141
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,920
of that competition

142
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,080
requires three doctors.

143
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,520
Now we only have two.

144
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,640
What can we do?

145
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,440
What's the name of the guy
who gave us a volunteer clinic?

146
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,120
- Gu Mingze.
- Right.

147
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,720
Right. Isn't he your senior?

148
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,200
We helped him. Let's ask him to help us.

149
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,680
Aunt, why do you bring this up?

150
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,560
I won't let him come anyway.

151
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,640
He's very busy. He's really busy.

152
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,860
Listen.

153
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,520
The nature of the volunteer clinic

154
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,920
is completely different
from that of our competition.

155
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,320
Only official employees can participate.

156
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,960
And even if he's willing to resign,

157
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,840
my uncle won't let him go.

158
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,680
The main thing is we don't have much time.

159
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,200
But don't worry,

160
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,560
I will handle this.

161
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,280
You guys just focus on the competition.

162
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,560
I believe in Mr. Shen.

163
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,440
Let's just find someone.

164
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,660
Okay. I'll do the hard part.

165
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,760
I will handle it well.

166
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,440
Then you go prepare.

167
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,200
Wen Jing and I will
handle the preliminary round.

168
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,312
Then I will…

169
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,680
I will

170
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,760
handle the atmosphere of the competition.

171
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,360
The competition outfits are on me.

172
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,160
Will Yuxian be affected?

173
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,160
He's just a kid,

174
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,040
carefree, I believe he'll be fine.

175
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,832
What's wrong, Wen Jing?

176
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,520
Actually, last month,

177
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,120
I've graduated from open university

178
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,160
and got my license
to practice veterinary medicine.

179
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,760
- Really?
- Why didn't you tell us?

180
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,420
You should have told us.

181
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:24,200
I don't know why all the talk.

182
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,640
Then we're all set.

183
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,160
Okay, we can participate in
the competition then.

184
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,840
We hope to help you

185
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,880
raise pets scientifically,

186
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,520
instead of being blinded by
those irrational marketing methods.

187
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,240
Mr. Shen, what's the matter?

188
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,160
Delete all the fancy stuff

189
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,880
and all the crap.

190
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,680
[Dad]

191
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,120
Did you see the news?

192
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,144
Which one?

193
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,440
The one that Mr. Mi

194
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,620
kissed a girl.

195
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,520
I saw it. Mr. Mi

196
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,040
really looks good on camera.

197
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,000
- Yes.
- Where? Show me now.

198
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,952
See.

199
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,280
- Handsome, right?
- Yes.

200
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,560
Oh my, so handsome.

201
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,640
- So handsome.
- Is he really handsome?

202
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,680
Yes.

203
00:13:58,680 --> 00:13:59,680
So cool.

204
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,784
Let me take a look.

205
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,200
Director Han.

206
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,520
Shen Chen.

207
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,520
Shen Chen.

208
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,640
Shen.

209
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,800
I thought you were doing

210
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,440
some kind of tech behind closed doors.

211
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,760
You're just drinking to drown your sorrows?

212
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,740
Does it work?

213
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,120
If it works, why don't you

214
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,640
drown yourself in a wine tank?

215
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,760
I can't die.

216
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,960
I have to support you in your old age.

217
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,400
You!

218
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,560
You don't go to work at Tianlin,

219
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,640
don't they punish you?

220
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,100
I've quit.

221
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,320
I have nothing to do with Tianlin from now on.

222
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,640
- Why?
- I just don't want to work.

223
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,640
Take a look.

224
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,800
Because of this, right?

225
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,320
Are you that free, Shen?

226
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,160
You've ruined yourself

227
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,000
only because of a girl.

228
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,360
You!

229
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,520
How are you going to take over Lvchuan?

230
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,800
I never want to take over Lvchuan anyway.

231
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,480
I just want to be a rich loser.

232
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,180
You are already a loser.

233
00:15:58,180 --> 00:15:59,760
You can't win him on career,

234
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,280
and you can't win the girl,

235
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,480
why don't you let him spit on you?

236
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,040
Shen.

237
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,640
Close the door for me.

238
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,664
Thank you.

239
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:14,912
I…

240
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,560
I can't believe I've raised such a loser.

241
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,400
Just drink!

242
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,119
[Han Mengnan]
Do you get a minute? Come on out.

243
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:17,280
First of all,

244
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,800
I would like to apologize again

245
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,240
to the host.

246
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,920
We would like to take this valuable opportunity

247
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,560
for those of you who come to the event

248
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,328
to learn about the dangers

249
00:17:27,328 --> 00:17:29,600
of animal hair coloring

250
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,200
and pet grooming.

251
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,040
Mengnan, are you okay?

252
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,272
Have a seat.

253
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,560
- Mengnan.
- In fact, you already know

254
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:58,200
that Tian Tian is not a cardiologist, right?

255
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,920
You all know that,

256
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,560
except me.

257
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,340
I'm sorry, Mengnan.

258
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:09,400
I didn't expect it would go like this.

259
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,080
I didn't expect

260
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,200
I'm the one who didn't expect anything.

261
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,672
Mengnan.

262
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,620
When we were kids,

263
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:28,360
Shen Mi and I would often come here together.

264
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,720
But why are we

265
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,440
like this now?

266
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,600
Why?

267
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,080
Why would he do this to me?

268
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,160
Why has he changed

269
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,400
since he returned from overseas?

270
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,760
Returned from overseas?

271
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,320
Did he study abroad before?

272
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,040
Do you still remember

273
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,800
the tree I took you to see

274
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,480
at the Animal Medicine Summit?

275
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:00,608
Yes.

276
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,560
Buried under the tree

277
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,640
was a friend of his.

278
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,060
Many years ago,

279
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:09,000
Shen Mi was lost in Thailand,

280
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,160
the Shen family had searched
for him for eight years.

281
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,560
And then my dad found him,

282
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,880
and brought him back.

283
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,480
But I always feel that something is different.

284
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,720
When he came back,

285
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,560
everything has changed.

286
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,760
He acted

287
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,920
as if the past between him and me

288
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,960
had never happened.

289
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,760
He has forgotten

290
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,260
all our treasured memories.

291
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:38,240
Like there's nothing left

292
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,200
between us.

293
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,624
Mengnan,

294
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,544
no way.

295
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,184
Perhaps

296
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,080
you're just being too sensitive.

297
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,200
This is a beautiful violin.

298
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,080
Is it for me?

299
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,520
It's yours.

300
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,240
Right, that violin.

301
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,460
I remember it now.

302
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:06,720
No,

303
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,080
you did a great job renovating,

304
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,400
so I didn't recognize it.

305
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,280
The me who told you

306
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,000
that I liked you

307
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,800
has gone.

308
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:24,928
Are you okay?

309
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,880
I'm fine. I'm just a little tired.

310
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,000
I want to go home.

311
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,200
I'll take you home.

312
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,720
No, thanks.

313
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,920
Thanks for coming today.

314
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,216
Goodbye.

[Tianlin Animal Hospital]

316
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,760
Surgery for leg skin.

317
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,960
Tissue forceps, needle holder,

318
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,200
triangular needle and synthetic fiber thread.

319
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,240
Why?

320
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,480
The triangular needle can pierce

321
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,540
harder tissues,

322
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:35,780
which is often used in
skin ligaments and cartilage,

323
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:37,580
but not suitable for facial sutures.

324
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:39,000
The leg has a high range of motion,

325
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,720
so I should choose synthetic fiber thread
that has strong tension resistance

326
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,520
and causes minor tissue reaction.

327
00:22:04,992 --> 00:22:06,176
[Shen Chen]

328
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,680
Hello, the subscriber you dialed is power off.

329
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,720
Sorry.

330
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,680
Tian Yuxian, get out here.

331
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,280
Keep your head up and your chest out,

332
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,040
with full spirit, and turn right.

333
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,440
You're slower.

334
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,080
The whole competition will be live,

335
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,560
so the publicity effect would be huge.

336
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:46,180
If we don't even make it to the finals,

337
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:47,960
that would be a disgrace.

What are you talking about?

339
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,320
Don't say something like that. Line up.

340
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,600
Nonsense.

341
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,600
Aren't there any clothes left for Shen Chen?

342
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,080
Sister, you still haven't

343
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,560
approved his resignation, right?

344
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,240
So technically, he is still one of us.

345
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,520
Tian Yuxian, I can understand how you feel.

346
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,120
If you understand me, you should get him back.

347
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,360
Instead of ignoring him

348
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,760
like you are now,

349
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,400
as if this person doesn't ever exist.

350
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,840
Enough.

351
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,040
Forget about this guy.

352
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,200
I get angry just talking about him.

353
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,320
I'm not wrong.

354
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,440
You're wrong.

355
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,720
Perhaps Shen Chen

356
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,720
just does not want to affect

357
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,200
the entire state of Tianlin

358
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,320
because of him.

359
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,360
Perhaps he is afraid

360
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,360
that seeing him like that
would affect our preparation

361
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,560
and lead to a bad result.

362
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,320
Anyway, I think he's a grown man,

363
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,760
and he knows what he's doing.

364
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,440
So, as a friend,

365
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,760
I think we should respect his choice.

366
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,040
Let's move on to the next topic.

367
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,640
More?

368
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,680
Of course.

369
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:07,240
The next topic is also very important.

370
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,720
We need to figure out a slogan

371
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,500
for promotion.

372
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,640
A slogan, right?

Show our strength and style.

375
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,520
Win with unity and effort!

376
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,600
Old-fashioned.

377
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,680
Boring.

378
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,800
Listen.

379
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,080
Hidden tiger in the mountain,

380
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,380
crouching dragon in the water,

381
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:28,600
Tianlin Hospital

382
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,840
has them both!

383
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,380
Yours is not as good as mine.

384
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:33,360
Your slogan is a bit…

385
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,920
It's really crazy.

386
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:42,920
What are you guys here for?

387
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,080
What did you say?

388
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,200
There's a saying.

389
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,220
Knowing your enemy well,

390
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:50,720
battles would never fail.

391
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,680
We wanted to come

392
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,940
to see

393
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:55,520
how your preparation is.

394
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,680
Now all of you are so…

395
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,720
You're not welcome here.

396
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,400
What did you say?

397
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,860
It's really hurtful.

398
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:09,660
Pet hospitals are all about techniques,

399
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:12,520
medical ethics and conscience.

400
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,680
If you have to do these tricks,

401
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,360
then sorry,

402
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,880
we are not in.

403
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,280
- What did you say?
- Mu.

404
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,360
Calm down.

405
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,380
Keep your calm.

406
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:30,360
We'll know

407
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,400
in tomorrow's competition

408
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,920
who has the upper hand, right?

409
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,800
Let's leave.

410
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,720
Take care and so long.

411
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,400
Leave, you guys.

412
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,320
This bunch of scumbags.

413
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,880
It's really disgusting.

414
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,720
He's just trying to make us disgust.

415
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,000
Then we have to show our strength,

416
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
prepare well and beat them tomorrow.

417
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,960
Then do we still

418
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,280
need the slogan?

419
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,460
Of course.

420
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:00,920
Why not?

421
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,120
I think his is a good one.

422
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,720
See? It's so imposing.

423
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,680
- Let's make a pose.
- Say it again.

424
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,440
Hidden tiger in the mountain,

425
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,720
crouching dragon in the water,

426
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,920
Tianlin Hospital

427
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,160
has them both!

428
00:26:23,072 --> 00:26:24,480
[Pet Vet Competition]

429
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,680
Dear guests

430
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,080
and media friends,

431
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,840
please take your seats as soon as possible.

432
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,720
Our competition will officially begin

433
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,040
in five minutes.

434
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,560
Please look forward.

435
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:47,840
This venue is pretty close

436
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,000
to our hospital, isn't it?

437
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,800
We still walked for a while,

438
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,880
but Xichong arrived

439
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,040
with only one turn.

440
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,760
Let's shout our slogan again
before the competition.

441
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,280
- Come on, let's cheer up.
- Come on.

442
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,640
Come on.

443
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,360
One, two, three.

444
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:06,080
Tianlin, keep it up!

445
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,800
Go for the top one!

446
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:13,280
Xichong, Xichong, dare to compete.

447
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:16,000
Xichong, Xichong, create the greatness.

448
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,800
Xichong, Xichong, dare to compete.

449
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:21,360
No way. They even hired a cheerleading team.

450
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,200
That's a clear violation of the rules.

451
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,472
The rules don't say we can't
bring a cheerleading team.

452
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,640
However,

453
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,600
no matter the team's technique,

454
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,020
or professional quality,

455
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:32,680
especially our

456
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,400
medical ethics,

457
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,800
we definitely beat them.

458
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:37,840
Definitely.

459
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,440
Yes.

460
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,920
Then let's do our slogan

461
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,040
and cheer up again.

462
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,500
We've done it.

463
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:46,940
Come on.

464
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:48,160
Come on.

465
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,840
One, two, three.

466
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,320
Tianlin, keep it up!

467
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,160
Go for the top one!

468
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,080
Alright. Today,

469
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,680
the eight animal hospitals

470
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,800
that are here

471
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,320
to participate in the competition

472
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,440
were selected by rigorous screening process

473
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,340
by our organizing committee.

474
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:09,120
so, these eight hospitals

475
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,160
will go through

476
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,440
specialized skills competition,

477
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,720
including items of pet grooming,

478
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,840
single hand knot tying,

479
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,400
suturing and blood smear etc.

480
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,200
The two hospitals with the highest total scores

481
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,360
in these four items

482
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,680
will participate in tomorrow's final round.

483
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:22,720
Keep it up!

484
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,320
Xichong, you are great!

485
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,740
Xichong, you must win!

486
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:28,600
Dear audience,

487
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,640
I believe you must have noticed

488
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,680
there's a scorer around you

489
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,440
that can score.

490
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,640
Right, in the first grooming competition,

491
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,000
the final results

492
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,160
will be determined

493
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,000
based on the combined scores

494
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,200
of the six judges

495
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,120
and 200 live audiences.

496
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,520
Here's a reminder,

497
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,520
the time of this item competition

498
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,760
will be

499
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,180
30 minutes.

500
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:53,400
Alright, the first item
of the preliminary round

501
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,080
officially begins.

502
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:57,040
Go for it.

503
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,960
Xichong, hurry up.

504
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,720
Go for it, Yuxian.

505
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,320
Look, a dog ran away.

506
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,440
From which hospital?

507
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,760
[Pet Grooming]

508
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:28,360
Okay, let's all count down together.

509
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:31,000
Ten, nine,

510
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,720
eight, seven, six,

511
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:36,640
five, four, three,

512
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,280
two, one.

513
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,840
Time's up.

514
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,560
The competition is over.

515
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,120
Let's clarify for the audience on-site.

516
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,240
In the usual pet grooming competition,

517
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,760
if the fur is not thoroughly cleaned up,

518
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,160
the contestant will be immediately eliminated.

519
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,440
But today we have
a different scoring mechanism,

520
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,520
so

521
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,600
let the audience judge for themselves.

522
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,040
This lady looks

523
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,320
like she's difficult to deal with.

524
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,160
I hope she won't give Yuxian a hard time.

525
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,600
Don't talk nonsense.

526
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,240
Yuxian is okay.

527
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,528
No problem.

528
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,120
It's clean.

529
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,440
Nice.

530
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:33,984
This is…

531
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,260
I want to ask you something,

532
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:45,360
what's on the cotton swabs?

533
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:47,560
That is…

534
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,760
I-It's the dirt

535
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,820
in its ears.

536
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:52,928
I see.

537
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,480
Do you know that this item competition

538
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,120
is all about grooming,

539
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,620
not cleaning?

540
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:01,000
I know.

541
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,160
But I was afraid

542
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,320
that if I didn't clean it,

543
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,200
it would get infected,

544
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,560
so I cleaned it.

545
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,720
Meticulous. Nice.

546
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,800
He's quite serious.

547
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,880
Well done, you did well.

548
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,160
I hope other contestants

549
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,680
can learn from him.

550
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,280
The exciting moment

551
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,560
is coming soon.

552
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,000
We are about to reveal

553
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,280
the final results.

554
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:25,120
Let's hold our breath

555
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,840
and look at the big screen.

556
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:32,740
Pairuien Animal Hospital, 0.

557
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:34,480
Xichong International Animal Hospital,

558
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,560
96.8.

559
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:38,080
Xichong!

560
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,520
Xichong is the best!

561
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:42,800
Mengmeng Pet, 94.2.

562
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:43,880

00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:46,560

00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,760
Hongkang Animal Hospital,

565
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,400
90.6.

566
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:51,960
Ximei Pet Hospital,

567
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,640
32.2.

568
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,200
Anpai Pet Love,

569
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,920
88.4.

570
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:00,480
What's the score for Tianlin Animal Hospital

571
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,880
then?

572
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:16,000
98!

573
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,400
Let's give them a round of applause!

574
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,384
We won.

575
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,280
We won the first battle.

576
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:30,040
The next item

577
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,600
will be on Wen Jing.

578
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,600
The second item,

579
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:35,960
single hand knot tying,

580
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,640
officially begins.

581
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,800
Come on, let's count down together, okay?

582
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:01,000
Ten, nine, eight,

583
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,600
seven, six, five,

584
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:07,200
four, three, two, one.

585
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,719
Time's up.

586
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:10,320
The competition is over.

587
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,560
Now, we can see

588
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,080
Tianlin Hospital is tied for first with Xichong

589
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,840
with a score of 95.2

590
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:21,120
in a single item.

591
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,960
Let's give them a round of applause!

592
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,320
- Tian Tian.
- She's here.

593
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,976
Excellent!

594
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:30,120
Well done.

595
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:33,020
Thank you, Mr. Shen.

596
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:34,840
Have a drink. Come on.

597
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,760
Good work. Congratulations.

598
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,120
Good work.

599
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:39,760
Thank you, Mr. Shen.

600
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,040
Next up is

601
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,800
Director Tian's suturing

602
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:46,199
and my blood smear, right?

603
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:47,400
It looks like

604
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,560
we have the field in the bag.

605
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,740
Don't lose your item competition.

606
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:52,360
How is that possible?

607
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,800
Don't worry about it.

608
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,680
Why do we all have regular milk tea,

609
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,720
except my sister's?

610
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,200
She loves mangoes. Do you?

611
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:07,080
I like grapes.

612
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,080
If you do,

613
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,840
then go buy it yourself.

614
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,600
Okay, you go buy it yourself.

615
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,000
Don't…

616
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,720
bother your sister.

617
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:16,720
I won't.

618
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:17,920
She's that good.

619
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:19,720
Come on.

620
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,400
Get ready for the competition.

621
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,480
Get ready.

622
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:30,160
Wait. What are you doing?

623
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,080
You look a little nervous.

624
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,160
I…

625
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,940
I was fine,

626
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:45,080
but hearing they said so,

627
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,120
I'm slightly nervous now.

628
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,600
Is the milk tea good?

629
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,480
I'll have a taste.

630
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,600
Still nervous?

631
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:10,720
Not anymore.

632
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,760
The third item, suturing,

633
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,480
for six minutes.

634
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,520
The competition officially begins.

635
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,000
This item

636
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,560
is mainly to examine the contestant's

637
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,240
pet skin suturing technique.

638
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,520
During suturing,

639
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,720
make sure the edges are aligned,

640
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,520
the suturing thread must be at the same depth

641
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:38,560
to draw both sides
of the subcutaneous tissues together.

642
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,040
The suture holes on both sides
should be 0.5 to 1 centimeter

643
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,600
away from the wound edge,

644
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,720
the distances should be equal.

645
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,240
The entry and exit of the needle

646
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,180
should both be perpendicular
to the skin surface.

647
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:47,840
All the contestants,

648
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,040
good luck!

649
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,280
Now we still have

650
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,720
two minutes and thirty seconds left.

651
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,920
We can see that the completion
of our contestants

652
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,920
is good.

653
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,120
The contestant from Tianlin

654
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,840
has already finished first.

655
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:10,320
Great. Come on, let's applaud.

656
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,240
Thank you for bringing us

657
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,000
such an impressive performance.

658
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,840
She truly is my sister.

659
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,560
The fourth item,

660
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:27,720
the blood smear,

661
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:29,400
officially begins.

662
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:35,960
This item

663
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,160
is also the fourth part

664
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,280
of today's competition,

665
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,440
so please be sure

666
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,560
to operate steadily

667
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,480
and achieve a good result.

668
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:05,000
Count down 20 seconds.

669
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:07,900
Let's countdown.

670
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:10,240
Ten, nine, eight,

671
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,600
seven, six, five,

672
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:15,920
four, three, two, one.

673
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,080
Time's up.

674
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:18,280
The competition is over.

675
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,640
Friends, our four item competitions today

676
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,140
have been successfully completed.

677
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:27,120
Now we are about to witness

678
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:29,080
the most exciting moment.

679
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:30,800
Let's announce

680
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:31,920
the final results.

681
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,920
Let's hold our breaths

682
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,440
and look at the big screen.

683
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,200
We can see that Tianlin Animal Hospital

684
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,760
has successfully advanced

685
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:45,040
to tomorrow's final with 392.2.

686
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,800
Let's applaud.

687
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,800
Xichong International Animal Hospital

688
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,640
is qualified for the final

689
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:55,240
with a high score of 386.8

690
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:57,000
as a second today.

691
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,120
Just wait for tomorrow.

692
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,240
Cheer up, tomorrow!

693
00:39:06,468 --> 00:39:09,260
[Pet Vet Competition]

694
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:12,680
All good work pays off.

695
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:14,840
Strength will prevail

696
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,440
eventually.

697
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,440
However,

698
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,880
tomorrow is the real showdown.

699
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,200
We must show our strength

700
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:21,240
and beat them.

701
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:22,760
Of course.

702
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,920
But I find it odd

703
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,200
that those Xichong guys

704
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,560
could make it to the final round.

705
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:29,560
Let me tell you.

706
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:31,160
There must be someone

707
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:33,040
who did the tricks

708
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,160
for my uncle.

709
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,680
If so,

710
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:38,340
what about the competition tomorrow?

711
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:40,400
Tomorrow's final is live on network.

712
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,560
I don't believe they dare

713
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:43,648
to do tricks in public.

714
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,000
No matter what,

715
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,840
as long as we do our best,

716
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:53,120
Tianlin will never be defeated.

717
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:55,320
Right, Tianlin won't lose.

718
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,360
Tianlin must win!

719
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:58,600
To celebrate our victory
in today's competition,

720
00:39:58,600 --> 00:39:59,680
maybe we should

721
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:00,920
grab a late night snack.

722
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:02,480
I think it's a great idea.

723
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,640
To be honest, I'm kind of hungry.

724
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:04,760
I think we really

725
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:06,560
should go out for a meal

726
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,000
to celebrate

727
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,240
and relax a bit.

728
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,580
I think we should pass on the meal.

729
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:13,640
Tomorrow is the final, after all.

730
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:14,640
I'd be lying

731
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,640
if I say I am not nervous.

732
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:16,680
I want to go back early

733
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,680
and go over tomorrow's quiz questions again.

734
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,360
- Alright.
- Then I won't go either.

735
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,920
After all, part of the competition is

736
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,920
comprehensive grooming.
I also need to go back and practice.

737
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,640
Since Chen goes back to practice,

738
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,700
so do we.

739
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:30,600
Then I won't go either.

740
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,760
Alright, let's leave.

741
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,320
The two of you can go.

742
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:39,920
We're not eating?

743
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,024
Be reasonable.

744
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,440
- Let's go back.
- Goodbye.

745
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,480
I want to have a meal.

746
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:48,120
Looks like no one respects Mr. Shen.

747
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:50,360
Then do you?

748
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,640
I certainly do.

749
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:53,080
As the dean of Tianlin,

750
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,840
of course, I have to
show some respect to the investor.

751
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,160
Go. Let's eat together.

752
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,280
Tian Tian.

753
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:58,920
Mr. Zhao.

754
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:00,960
Long time no see.

755
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,144
Right.

756
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,440
Long time no see, Mr. Shen.

757
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:06,680
Have we met before?

758
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:10,920
Previously, Carlo was sick

759
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,320
and had the surgery
at the Agricultural University

760
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,600
by Mr. Zhao.

761
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,600
Your dog has ischemia

762
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,720
due to congenital heart disease.

763
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,380
It was already too late,

764
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:21,880
and we had done our best.

765
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:27,280
What a coincidence.

766
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,000
Do you have a meal around here?

767
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,080
Today is the preliminary round
of Pet Vet Competition,

768
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:33,280
I came to have a look.

769
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,120
And, Tian Tian,

770
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:37,340
we are peers from now on.

771
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:39,700
I don't work
at Agricultural University anymore.

772
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:40,960
Why?

773
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,400
I have officially accepted

774
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,880
the offer from Xichong

775
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,120
and become their

776
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:46,240
chief physician.

777
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:51,600
I will participate

778
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:52,640
in tomorrow's final.

779
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,200
I'll see you at the competition tomorrow.

780
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,224
Keep it up!

781
00:41:58,440 --> 00:41:59,488
See you tomorrow.

782
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:05,408
Oh no.

783
00:42:29,186 --> 00:42:32,706
♫ Your gaze is unwavering ♫

784
00:42:34,722 --> 00:42:39,266
♫ Only enough to accommodate me ♫

785
00:42:40,482 --> 00:42:45,154
♫ I have been melted by you countless times ♫

786
00:42:46,114 --> 00:42:49,666
♫ Yet I'm at a loss for what to do ♫

787
00:42:51,618 --> 00:42:54,562
♫ I can only hold on to you ♫

788
00:42:56,642 --> 00:43:00,546
♫ Now you are still with me ♫

789
00:43:02,210 --> 00:43:06,466
♫ Traveling through time together ♫

790
00:43:08,322 --> 00:43:16,258
♫ Someday, I'll be completely
forgotten by the world ♫

791
00:43:16,258 --> 00:43:19,458
♫ Leaving no trace ♫

792
00:43:19,458 --> 00:43:23,490
♫ Only you will still remember ♫

793
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:27,554
♫ My appearance ♫
