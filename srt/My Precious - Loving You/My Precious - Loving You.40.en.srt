Something happened to Lvchuan.

Grandpa had a cerebral hemorrhage and

To tell you the truth about everything.

Let me say something.

<i>[Lvchuan Group]</i>

44
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:35,808
Dear shareholders,

45
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,720
you all know

46
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,240
the state of Lvchuan Group now.

47
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,680
There are major personnel changes,

48
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,560
and a lot of social discussion.

49
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,560
The group is in turmoil.

50
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,760
At this time, the urgent task

51
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,580
is to select a new leader

52
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:56,400
to guide Lvchuan Group forward.

53
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,200
I won't beat around the bush.

54
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,960
I volunteer to be this leader.

55
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,160
Raise your hands if you agree.

56
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:10,120
I agree to Mr. Shen Hongyuan's
appointment as CEO.

57
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:36,440
Sister-in-law, any further
hesitation at this time

58
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,240
would have far-reaching affect to the group.

59
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,688
Shen Mi.

60
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,864
Shen Mi.

61
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:09,840
You two are not from Lvchuan, please leave.

62
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,920
I am still an employee of Lvchuan, right?

63
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,280
Mr. Shen, shareholders.

64
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,240
These two are my guests.

65
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,400
Mengnan, we are holding
a shareholders' meeting.

66
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,680
You're not a shareholder, please leave.

67
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,280
Because it is a shareholders' meeting,

68
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,600
so in my responsibility to the group

69
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,700
and to all shareholders,

70
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:39,400
I have to tell everyone the truth.

71
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,880
The truth? What is it?

72
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:46,200
The chairman's serious illness
and Shen Mi's resignation

73
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,160
are known only to you all.

74
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,600
Why would such a confidential matter

75
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,880
be reported by the media

76
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,480
and cause a huge stir
that harmed Lvchuan Group?

77
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,680
This is the secret of the group.

78
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,020
Why do the outsiders know?

79
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,100
Everyone,

80
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:03,280
I've done some research
through my friends in the media.

81
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,880
The one who revealed this confidential matter

82
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,160
is

83
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,040
Shen Hongyuan's assistant Wu Jie.

84
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,816
Him?

85
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,680
How could he do such a thing?

86
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,880
That's too much.

87
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,760
This is all the evidence I've gathered.

88
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Mr. Shen.

89
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,260
In order to achieve your own goal,

90
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:34,040
you were willing to harm the interests
of the group and all the shareholders.

91
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,280
How do you get to

92
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,920
be the leader of Lvchuan Group
when you do something like that?

93
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,040
Let me explain.

94
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,440
I did reveal the matter to the media,

95
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,440
in order to prevent this person

96
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,520
from remaining in the position of CEO.

97
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,360
So I have to drive him out

98
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,360
with the power of the group and the society.

99
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,160
We don't have that problem anymore.

100
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,780
I will make up for this loss

101
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,120
when Lvchuan Group gets back on track.

102
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,260
And Han Mengnan,

103
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:12,240
you are still an employee of Lvchuan.
Please mind your word.

104
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,760
Don't help the evil guy.

105
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,760
Gao Zhuo.

106
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,920
Use whatever tricks

107
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,480
you have.

108
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,520
G-Gao Zhuo?

109
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,440
What is going on?

110
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,680
I'm sorry, Tian Tian.

111
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,520
I have been concealing it for so long.

112
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,200
I am not Shen Mi,

113
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,320
the real Shen Mi

114
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,200
has been buried under that tree.

115
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,360

120
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,360
He is a fraud.

121
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,880
Tian Tian, everything Gao Zhuo said is true.

122
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,040
Just like you,

123
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,080
it's hard to accept when I found out the truth.

124
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,200
But things happen for a reason.

125
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,840
Gao Zhuo didn't mean to lie to you.

126
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,120
Regardless of my name,

127
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,360
regardless of who I am,

128
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,520
my love for you

129
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,440
is not a lie at all.

130
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:41,280
So please trust me

131
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,984
and let me explain, okay?

132
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,680
Shen Hongyuan.

133
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,280
I'm not here

134
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,880
to fight you for any position.

135
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,760
I just want to tell you

136
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,280
about what happened
to your elder brother Shen Hongyi.

137
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,280
What happened?

138
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,040
I met Shen Mi

139
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,640
when we were little.

140
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,000
We two

141
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,760
were the best friends.

142
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,280
He wanted to go home but couldn't.

143
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,720
And I

144
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,680
am a boy with no home.

145
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,000
I always remember

146
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,260
he had two wishes.

147
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:39,360
One was

148
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,600
to marry Mengnan,

149
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,608
and the other one was

150
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,760
to find out why his father, Shen Hongyi,

151
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,168
went abroad and

152
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,640
the real cause of his death.

153
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,760
To fulfil his wish
to investigate his father's death

154
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,400
is the only thing

155
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:08,040
that has kept me alive as Shen Mi.

156
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,680
When Shen Hongyi died in a foreign land,

157
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,400
Lvchuan was exposed
to the scandal of poor quality dog food.

158
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,520
That's where

159
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,560
the dog food was made.

160
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,000
Even if you falsified, concealed,

161
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
and destroyed all the evidence,

162
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,880
but I can

163
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,440
still find a way to prove

164
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,840
that dog food

165
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,720
was all managed by you.

166
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,200
Where did you get all this gossip?

167
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,520
Don't talk nonsense here.

168
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,840
This is the evidence I've spent years

169
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,640
sending people around the world to gather,

170
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,680
which can prove

171
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,560
what happened back then
was because of your negligence

172
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:12,560
and carelessness.
You did not manage the quality well

173
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,960
and led to irreversible consequences.

174
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,800
But the worst thing is

175
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:20,480
that you put all the blame

176
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,080
on Shen Hongyi

177
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,780
in front of all the media,

178
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:26,840
someone who is gone

179
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,240
and unable to defend himself.

180
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,200
Don't you feel guilty?

181
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,760
He should feel guilty first,

182
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,040
he is the one who owes me.

183
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,328
Everyone.

184
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,640
I was scammed

185
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,920
when I first went abroad,

186
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,680
I was going to make up for the loss.

187
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,680
But then he flew over,

188
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,720
what was he trying to prove?

189
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,960
To prove I'm a loser.

190
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,120
To prove that he's better than me

191
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,400
in everything.

192
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,600
He had to compete with me for the CEO position.

193
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,680
Hongyuan.

194
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:13,800
You've been wrong about
your brother all these years.

195
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,008
Grandpa.

196
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,560
Dad, why are you here?

197
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,840
Grandpa.

198
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,000
Your body…

199
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,720
I'm okay.

200
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,840
Dear shareholders

201
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:34,960
and directors.

202
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,800
Sorry about

203
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,920
what happened today.

204
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,440
Please give us a moment.

205
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,040
After all, this is a family matter
of the Shen family.

206
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,720
Chairman, take care.

207
00:12:53,092 --> 00:12:55,364
<i>[Conference Room]</i>

208
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,504
Dad, you said…

209
00:13:02,112 --> 00:13:03,400
Your elder brother

210
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,680
went abroad back then

211
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,120
was not to investigate you

212
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,880
and then report to me,

213
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,560
but to clean up your mess.

214
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,496
Back then,

215
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,520
your elder brother was the first to know

216
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,520
that there was a serious quality problem

217
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,400
with the dog food you were in charge of.

218
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,720
In order to protect you,

219
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,520
he decided

220
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:35,400
to go and fix your problems

221
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,520
secretly.

222
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,456
Guannian.

223
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,520
You know about it better than anyone else.

224
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,560
- Yes.
- You tell them for me.

225
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,720
After he arrived, he immediately stopped

226
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,240
the production line of the factory.

227
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,960
However, they refused to terminate the contract

228
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,920
on the grounds of discrepancies
in the quality control rules.

229
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,640
To avoid greater losses,

230
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,560
your elder brother used his own money

231
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,520
to pay the penalty

232
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,400
and plan to sue them when he returned home.

233
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,480
But unexpectedly…

234
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:17,560
Dad, why did Uncle Hongyi…

235
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,760
It was an accident.

236
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,480
Shen Mi told me,

237
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,860
he overheard Shen Hongyuan

238
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:32,280
with another man's conversation,

239
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,320
he misunderstood

240
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,160
that Shen Hongyuan
is the murderer of his father,

241
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,640
so he ran out of the hospital.

242
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,920
But he was wrong.

243
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,560
<i>After we returned,</i>

244
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,800
<i>I'll clear it with the chairman.</i>

245
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,680
<i>Han, my elder brother is gone.</i>

246
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,120
<i>That was an accident.</i>

247
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,040
<i>You knew there was something
wrong with that good.</i>

248
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,720
<i>You didn't tell my dad about it, right?</i>

249
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,600
<i>Help me out once more.</i>

250
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,320
<i>I covered it for you</i>

251
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,400
<i>and it caused the death of your elder brother.</i>

252
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,800
<i>I can't be wrong again.</i>

253
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,760
<i>Your brother is dead because of you.</i>

254
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,320
<i>I can't believe you haven't felt any guilt.</i>

255
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,500
<i>My brother is dead because of me?</i>

256
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,840
<i>Don't forget we're in this together.</i>

257
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,400
<i>We'll be doomed if you don't work with me.</i>

258
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,768
In fact, the person who talked
to Shen Hongyuan at that time was me.

259
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,720
When we found out about Hongyi's accident,

260
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,840
Mr. Shen got sick.

261
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:39,040
I went for him.

262
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:40,800
Uncle Han is right.

263
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,760
I found the local police file

264
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,760
and the report of his death,

265
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,280
showing that he died from an electric leak.

266
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,800
I also saw in the
local maintenance inspection report

267
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:54,920
that there would be

268
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,400
frequent leakage of electricity in that place.

269
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,520
So in that case,

270
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,640
Shen Mi indeed misunderstood

271
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,840
that his father's death

272
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,200
was because of his uncle.

273
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,408
Aunt.

274
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,568
I'm sorry.

275
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,280
I always thought

276
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,320
I could get justice for your son.

277
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,920
But I didn't realize that the truth

278
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,000
was a misunderstanding.

279
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,536
I'm sorry.

280
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,192
Kid.

281
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,080
Don't say so.

282
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,880
You must have had a hard time these years.

283
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,000
All these years,

284
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,640
it's hard for you to call a strange woman

285
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,760
mom, right?

286
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,800
Not at all.

287
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,359
I'm very happy.

288
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,560
It is you who let me

289
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,720
feel

290
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,880
the warmth of family

291
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,160
and the feeling of being loved.

292
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,560
Thank you for taking care of me.

293
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,040
I'm very happy.

294
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,600
Well.

295
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,280
I'd like to

296
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,720
hear you call me mom one more time,

297
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,800
okay?

298
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,704
Mom.

299
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,072
Dad.

300
00:18:40,352 --> 00:18:41,472
Did you know

301
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,456
all about these?

302
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,568
Yes.

303
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,800
Then why don't you blame me?

304
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,600
Hongyuan.

305
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,880
You and your brother

306
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:58,320
were both very smart and excellent
since you were kids.

307
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:02,760
Your brother is introverted and loves reading.

308
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,280
And you are lively and active,

309
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,000
a bit playful.

310
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,000
I thought

311
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,280
that one day in the future,

312
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,240
I'll give Lvchuan to you two.

313
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:19,400
So I wanted you to be like your brother,

314
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:24,120
steady and hardworking.

315
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:28,000
That's why I have been

316
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,520
so strict with you.

317
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,800
I was just trying

318
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,240
to motivate you

319
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,440
in these ways,

320
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,680
to encourage you to make progress.

321
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,960
But I was wrong.

322
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,800
I made you misunderstand.

323
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:50,520
I made you think you were
less capable than your brother.

324
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,640
I made you feel like you weren't
as important as your brother.

325
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,000
I made you

326
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,080
keep comparing yourself to your brother.

327
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,560
It's all my fault.

328
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:13,800
I didn't realize that until it was too late.

329
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,840
What you're doing now

330
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:24,040
is the result of what I did.

331
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:27,080
I have no right to blame you.

332
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:32,920
I-I have already lost a son.

333
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:36,720
I don't want to lose another.

334
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,440
Dad, I was wrong.

335
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,360
Dad.

336
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,760
I was wrong.

337
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,280
I was wrong.

338
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,320
Hongyuan.

339
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:05,480
Dad, I'm sorry for you.

340
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,424
Dad.

341
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,800
Gao Zhuo.

342
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,480
You survive on Shen Mi's behalf.

343
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,920
Since you came to the Shen family

344
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,080
and called me Grandpa.

345
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,120
From then on,

346
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,960
in my eyes,

347
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,280
you're just like Shen Chen,

348
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,520
a child of the Shen family,

349
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,560
a good grandson,

350
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:02,080
and an integral member of this family.

351
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,320
Shen Chen, come here.

352
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,320
You two

353
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,000
have no blood relationship,

354
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,920
but in my eyes,

355
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,520
you are real brothers.

356
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:28,160
I don't want what happened to your parents

357
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,480
to happen to you.

358
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,080
Do you understand?

359
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,280
Do you understand?

360
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,752
Yes.

361
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,760
Shen Chen understands.

362
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,960
What about you, Shen Mi?

363
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,960
Nodding doesn't count.

364
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,480
Say it like Shen Chen.

365
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,000
I need to hear it.

366
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,216
I understand, Grandpa.

367
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:04,928
Good.

368
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,040
Good.

369
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:13,920
Unity makes greatness.

370
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,040
If you two can work together,

371
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,440
I am relieved.

372
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,640
Today,

373
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:30,160
I have a favor to ask you both.

374
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,760
All directors and shareholders

375
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:37,920
know what Hongyuan has done.

376
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:42,640
They're not going to let him take over as CEO.

377
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:46,640
I am old,

378
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,520
and with bad health condition.

379
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,040
Tell me.

380
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,040
What should we do in the future?

381
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,272
Grandpa.

382
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,800
I think Shen Chen can succeed

383
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,928
as the CEO of Lvchuan Group.

384
00:24:05,568 --> 00:24:09,160
Grandpa, I have never managed Lvchuan.

385
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,280
I have no experience.

386
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,360
Let's have my…

387
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,080
Let him do it.

388
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,152
Grandpa.

389
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,040
At Tianlin Hospital,

390
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,080
Shen Chen actually made a lot of progress.

391
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,260
He handles

392
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:25,960
a lot of matters and relationship very well.

393
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,400
He's been humbler

394
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,680
than before at the company,

395
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,400
and his business capabilities
have also significantly improved.

396
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:35,800
So I think he's perfectly
qualified for the position,

397
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,300
and he still has a lot of room for improvement.

398
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,640
Alright.

399
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,160
Don't be so humble.

400
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,160
I know what to do.

401
00:25:10,564 --> 00:25:12,516
<i>[Signing Ceremony of Cooperation between
Lvchuan Group and WWF]</i>

402
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,440
Firstly, I would like to welcome

403
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,880
all the attendees today.

404
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:26,020
Today is the time to end the old
and usher in the new.

405
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:28,640
Lvchuan Group will officially partner with

406
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,840
the WWF for a formal collaboration.

407
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:35,300
In addition to enhancing
Lvchuan's support platform,

408
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,020
we will also work together

409
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:39,040
to vigorously promote

410
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,096
the rescue and care of stray pets.

411
00:25:40,672 --> 00:25:41,728
Our preliminary plan is

412
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,560
that in the first half of next year,

413
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:46,360
Lvchuan Group and the WWF

414
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,560
will jointly invest ten million

415
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:51,640
to firstly establish six large-scale modern

416
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:54,320
animal rescue stations equipped with
professional medical staff in Fu City.

417
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,000
In the second half of the year,

418
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:00,100
we will establish
corresponding aid organizations

419
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,840
in five cities centered around Fu City.

420
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,200
We hope our efforts

421
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,240
will be like a spark,

422
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:11,840
getting more people involved in activities

423
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,000
to care for stray animals.

424
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,760
Because every life,

425
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,080
every animal,

426
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,640
deserves our respect.

427
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,820
Now, please welcome Mr. Shen Chen,

428
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:33,240
the chairman of Lvchuan Group

429
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,820
and Mr. Ma Mingyuan,

430
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:43,640
the director of the WWF Great China region,

431
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,720
to complete the signing ceremony

432
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,000
as representatives of both sides.

433

436
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,520
Mr. Ma, please say something.

437
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,640
I believe the future prospects
of our cooperation

438
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,320
are very promising.

439
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,440
Lvchuan Group is a powerful

440
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,080
and caring company.

441
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,360
Your scared me.

442
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,780
You are the CEO of Lvchuan Group.

443
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:43,640
I can't believe you'd get scared.

444
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,720
You came to see me in spite of
your busy schedule at the hospital.

445
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,200
Do you miss me that much?

446
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,280
Don't flatter yourself. It's impossible.

447
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,680
I came to see Mr. Ma.

448
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,000
Dr. Tian.

449
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,020
Long time no see.

450
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:02,520
Long time no see.

451
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,840
Let me tell you, the reason I came this time

452
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,600
is not only to sign agreements

453
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,380
and handle official duties with Mr. Shen,

454
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:09,800
there is also another
important thing I have to do.

455
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,840
That is

456
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,600
to invite you to have hot pot together.

457
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,840
Weren't we supposed to have hot pot together?

458
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,080
It's not the same.

459
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,040
Old Shen is also here today.

460
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,520
It's not the same at all.

461
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:28,380
I just want to eat hot pot with you two alone.

462
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:29,400
No problem.

463
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,840
I have already done my research.

464
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,280
I'll take you to

465
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:34,320
all the best hot pot restaurants in Fu City.

466
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,640
No way.

467
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,720
It's of no fun eating out.

468
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,860
So messy.

469
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:41,440
Let's just eat at home

470
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,360
like we did last time.
It's much more comfortable.

471
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:47,320
Fine, don't peek at me. I get it.

472
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
I'll listen to you. We'll eat wherever you say.

473
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,920
Good, you kid.

474
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,080
Then we will ask Mr. Ma

475
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,960
to come to our home for hot pot this weekend.

476
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:04,600
So it's settled then,
we'll have hot pot this weekend.

477
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:09,040
By the way, that…

478
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,320
Do you have that pickled green mango?

479
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,420
Of course.

480
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:15,960
Alright, then it's settled.

481
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,360
- It's decided then.
- See you this weekend.

482
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,280
You should eat more too.

483
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:21,984
Absolutely not.

484
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,480
The Chairman is here.

485
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,260
Hello, Chairman.

486
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:29,760
Shen, how have you been lately?

487
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,800
No, Chairman.

488
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,120
I should show respect to you
in front of everyone else.

489
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,856
Give you all my respect.

490
00:29:37,856 --> 00:29:39,100
Okay.

491
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:40,360
You've worked hard, Chairman.

492
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,600
You two,

493
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,560
I guess I'm the only one who feels bad.

494
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,000
You are not.

495
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,840
You should show your usual spirit.

496
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,800
This position suits you quite well.

497
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,488
Okay, let's stop kidding him.

498
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:52,600
He knows

499
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,280
he'll make a good chairman.

500
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,760
Did you get the address I sent you?

501
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,060
Yes.

502
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:00,400
Don't be late then.

503
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:03,104
I'm sure I won't be late,
but my mom and dad can't make it.

504
00:30:03,648 --> 00:30:04,780
Why?

505
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:08,080
I don't know where they are traveling now,

506
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,152
I can't even find them.

507
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,240
Isn't that great?

508
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,440
Just let your parents relax.

509
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,420
It's good for their mental and physical health.

510
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:18,080
Right, they are happy and healthy.

511
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,400
But I'm tired out here.

512
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,940
Bro, I…

513
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:25,088
Impossible.

514
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:26,760
Let's leave.

515
00:30:28,192 --> 00:30:29,320
Don't be late.

516
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:31,140
I'm not in good mental
and physical health right now.

517
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:34,080
Wait. Let's switch it back.

518
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:41,732
<i>[Tianlin Animal Hospital]</i>

519
00:30:52,736 --> 00:30:53,800
Peilan.

520
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:54,960
Are you busy?

521
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,480
Be good.

522
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,440
- Peilan.
- Wen Jing.

523
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:09,800
You're the head of the department now.
Why are you still that busy?

524
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:12,040
There are too many people.
I really can't handle it.

525
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,640
Haven't I already hired you

526
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,960
four doctors and three nurses?

527
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,280
Why are you still so busy?

528
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:21,300
Dr. Chen just took up
a very complicated abdominal surgery,

529
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:24,000
those assistant physicians
are scrambling to be his assistant.

530
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,800
They all went to the operating room.

531
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:29,840
Be careful.

532
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,320
First, suture the mucosal layer
and muscle layer with nodular sutures.

533
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:36,040
Then use the Cushing's suture method
to suturing the serous layer.

534
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:40,520
This is the only way to prevent
abdominal adhesions after surgery.

535
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,980
Dr. Chen is really amazing.

536
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:44,960
I can't learn this technique in my life.

537
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,400
Medical skills cannot be learned by mouth.

538
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:50,360
As doctors,

539
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,600
we must be responsible for every life.

540
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,768
I guess Chen Yifan

541
00:31:56,768 --> 00:31:59,040
must have that big grin on his face.

542
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,480
Aunt, don't take any more
grooming order for now.

543
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,696
I have to go out.

544
00:32:05,696 --> 00:32:06,820
Okay.

545
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:07,920
Don't you have

546
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,640
a grooming assistant?

547
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:10,820
Ask him to do it for you.

548
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:12,520
- He quit.
- He quit.

549
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,760
Why?

550
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:18,200
He thought that our young master Tian
has high demands.

551
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,680
So he quit.

552
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,040
I am right.

553
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,520
The customers have spent
their money waiting for so long,

554
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,760
and we have to satisfy them

555
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,660
or even surprise them.

556
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:28,224
We can't ruin the trust

557
00:32:28,224 --> 00:32:29,320
they have in us.

558
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:31,424
It'd ruin Tianlin's reputation.

559
00:32:31,424 --> 00:32:32,480
Right.

560
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,540
Okay, enough talking, I have to go.

561
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:34,840
You didn't tell me where you are going.

562
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,080
Ms. Lin just called me,

563
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,060
saying that there is a big pet grooming order,

564
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:40,660
she asked me to accept it in person.

565
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:41,780
Big order?

566
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:43,280
How big?

567
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,992
I'm in a hurry. I'll message you.

568
00:32:44,992 --> 00:32:47,360
- Remember.
- Goodbye.

569
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,920
- I'll go get busy.
- Okay.

570
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,040
What are you looking for?

571
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:00,720
Where's the invitation from Mengnan?

572
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,520
I've kept it safe.

<i>[Wedding Invitation of
Gu Mingze and Han Mengnan]</i>

574
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:19,960
They're finally living the life they want

575
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:23,560
and being with the loved one forever. So happy.

576
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,720
Our happy life

577
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:30,920
is about to begin, too.

578
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,360
Are your feet okay?

579
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,840
No problem, look.

580
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,120
How's the hand doing?

581
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,680
You see, no problem at all.

582
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:08,040
That's great, then you better get back to work.

583
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:10,360
The daughter is capable now.

584
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:12,120
She doesn't need me anymore.

585
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,199
Besides,

586
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:15,960
doesn't our daughter have our son-in-law?

587
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:18,239
He can advise if there's a problem.

588
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:21,800
What did you say? Son-in-law?

589
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,480
Can't you keep your pride?

590
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:27,480
Don't make him look down on you.

591
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:34,480
<i>[Gao Zhuo]</i>
Look, who did we talk about?

592
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,120
Son-in-law.

593
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:46,040
I'm taking a walk with your mom.

594
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,440
Dinner?

595
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,520
Tian Tian has already informed us.

596
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,520
Don't worry.

597
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,360
See you tonight.

598
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,240
This won't happen again.

599
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,240
Who's coming tonight?

600
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:09,000
Of course, everyone is here for the New Year.

601
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,160
Great.

602
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,256
Let's go.

603
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,320
The two of you.

604
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,560
I wish you health and peace.

605
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:32,040
About the wedding,

606
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:34,420
if you need anything, feel free to tell us.

607
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:35,740
No.

608
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:38,640
As long as the two kids are doing well,
it's better than anything.

609
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,640
Aunt.

610
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,740
You should thank me.

611
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:50,320
Happy New Year.

612
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:55,060
If it wasn't for me keeping an eye on Shen Mi,

613
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:58,840
and telling him to seize the opportunity,

614
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:02,120
absolutely not to miss Dr. Tian,

615
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,800
they wouldn't be like this today.

616
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,320
It's me.

617
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:13,360
I was the one who managed
to get them to live together.

618
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,800
It has nothing to do with you.

619
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:20,120
Okay, you old Shen.

620
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:22,600
You evil elderly.

621
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,680
The two of you, today is New Year's Eve,

622
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:31,160
I wish you both good health and all the best.

623
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:33,040
- Happy New Year.
- Okay.

624
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,000
I'm in, I'm in.

625
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,440
Alright, let's do this together.

626
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,740
Together.

627
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:38,800
Okay. Okay.

628
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,140
Happy New Year.

629
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:41,408
Happy New Year.

630
00:36:41,408 --> 00:36:42,600
Happy New Year.

631

Happy New Year.

632
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,008
Alright.

633
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:49,640
Both of you, please enjoy.

634
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:52,760
Here, I'll fill it up for you.

635
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,920
I have it.

636
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,520
- Here you are.
- Come on.

637
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,540
You just want to fill it up.

638
00:36:57,540 --> 00:37:00,160
Yuxian, come on, let's have a drink.

639
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,440
Are you still mad about what happened earlier?

640
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:08,180
Can you be generous, like a man?

641
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:11,080
I dare not. You are currently
the chairman of Lvchuan,

642
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:13,000
we are merely a subsidiary.

643
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,400
I wouldn't dare to be mad at you.

644
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:19,720
Everyone makes mistakes.

645
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:23,560
Even if I was wrong before,

646
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:25,280
don't you allow me to change?

647
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,800
Are we playing the game or not?

648
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,720
Fine, I'll drink on my own.

649
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,760
Do you just drink on your own?

650
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:36,992
Cheers!

651
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,720
Grandpa, I also raise a toast to you.

652
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:46,300
No more crap.

653
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:48,960
I just want you to be healthy.

654
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:50,720
Okay.

655
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:54,160
How's your preparation?

656
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,360
Don't worry, Grandpa.

657
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,200
Uncle, aunt, I also toast to you.

658
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,560
Come on, let's drink.

659
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,400
Thank you.

660
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,840
And I wish you to be healthy.

661
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,140
Happy New Year.

662
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:12,160
Thank you.

663
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,160
Come on.

664
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,480
The shrimp is really good.

665
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,240
Right, have some.

666
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:23,296
Okay.

667
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,480
You've drunk a lot.

668
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,480
I am okay.

669
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:36,480
We tried our best to break them up before,

670
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,680
but look at them now, they're doing fine.

671
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:40,700
Thank you.

672
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:43,680
Bro, even without the two of us,

673
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,080
they would still be together.

674
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,160
It's all about destiny.

675
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,180
Yes.

676
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:49,320
Your sister and I are not meant to be.

677
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:52,340
Your sister and him are meant to be.

678
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:54,120
Bro, there's something I have to tell you.

679
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,700
I'm particularly upset

680
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:58,040
that your brother hasn't
proposed to my sister yet.

681
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,400
Not yet?

682
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,880
It's just a formality. It doesn't matter.

683
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:08,280
What? Of course it matters.

684
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,640
I think a proposal

685
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,000
is usually made when
the man is ready for marriage

686
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,200
and the woman is not.

687
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,160
But you're both ready.

688
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:16,440
So I think

689
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,600
it doesn't matter anyway.

690
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,240
Of course it matters!

691
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,800
Stop talking if you don't know how.

692
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:22,940
Fine. It matters.

693
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:24,960
Alright, I'll stop.

694
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,120
It matters.

695
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,704
Wait.

696
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:32,920
Actually,

697
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:34,976

Come on.

704
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:29,600

705
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,328
