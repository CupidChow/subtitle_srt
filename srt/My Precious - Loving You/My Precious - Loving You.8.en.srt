00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,480
Delicious

2
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,680
Tian Tian, what's wrong with you

3
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,560
Why don't you take a bite

4
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:53,880
Give it to me. Give it to me

5
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,840
I'm okay

6
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,760
I've worked for so many years

7
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,320
This is the first time I met this

8
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,360
What do you mean

9
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,680
What performance appraisal will pressure me

10
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,080
Right

11
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,440
I'm so busy now that I can only

12
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,000
You can play games when you eat

13
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:09,919
The segments are gone

14
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,600
It's a pity that my book

15
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,440
I've been painting for so many years

16
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,080
It's all painstaking efforts

17
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,360
Not everyone just

18
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,520
Understand, understand

19
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,880
There must have been pains before this reform

20
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,680
For Tian Lin

21
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,760
Long-term development in the future

22
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,480
We have to endure this pain

23
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,920
Besides, improve the performance

24
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:27,840
It's a good thing

25
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,160
Elder sister

26
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,160
You speak now

27
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,800
Why are you more and more like that guy

28
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,360
Is it

29
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,480
Comrade Oda

30
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,880
I have to say

31
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,360
You're not standing firm right now

32
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,200
Have you been

33
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,800
Be framed by those rules and regulations

34
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,120
Corrupt and depraved ideas

35
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:44,960
It's affected

36
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,160
What are you talking about

37
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,560
A few of us are not

38
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,840
Our ideological position

39
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,880
Isn't it the same

40
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:50,320
It's all for the sake of

41
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,040
Improve the performance of Tianlin

42
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,640
Isn't there a lot of customers recently

43
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,120
This goal has not been accomplished yet

44
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,480
It's still half finished

45
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,520
Half of it

46
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,760
What if you can't finish it?

47
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,680
If you can't finish it, you will be fired

48
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,360
I

49
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,720
That's okay

50
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,320
You guys are really good

51
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,120
Somebody help me

52
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,360
Our passenger flow

53
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,800
It has doubled so many times

54
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,240
That's right

55
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:31,880
Do you know that our

56
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,360
Promotional video

57
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,200
Now everyone is

58
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,920
Spontaneously forwarding

59
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,520
And I flipped through my cell phone the other day

60
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,680
Is the biggest one in our city

61
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,720
Public welfare network

62
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,080
Put our video

63
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,120
Put it on its official website

64
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,160
Really, let me see

65
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,120
You can look for it

66
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,240
I found it as soon as I searched it

67
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,440
Really

68
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,320
Isn't it

69
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,680
This is propaganda to us in disguise

70
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,520
That is

71
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,120
Slow down, slow down

72
00:03:59,120 --> 00:03:59,840
Aunt Guan

73
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,720
Why are you here again

74
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,480
I'm looking for Chen Yifan

75
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,200
Give Pippi a routine examination

76
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,000
Pippi didn't always

77
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,760
Did you just do the deworming two days ago

78
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,120
Check again

79
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,640
Idle is idle anyway

80
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,960
You guys are always doing

81
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,280
Compulsory public welfare

82
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,400
Who can stand this

83
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,200
This has been since you implemented it

84
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,480
Since a series of strategies,

85
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:30,680
This passenger flow

86
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,920
It has increased a lot

87
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,160
Work efficiency has also improved

88
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,000
At this rate

89
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,560
Less than three months

90
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,840
You can achieve performance

91
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,720
Don't be too happy

92
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,320
Although the traffic has increased,

93
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,240
But

94
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,400
The conversion rate has not yet

95
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,600
Meet my requirements

96
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,080
The 20% discount card is now saturated

97
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,560
It will go downhill soon

98
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,320
How can you say so

99
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,560
Words that hit people

100
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:49,600
And

101
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,680
So is the non-profit organization

102
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,320
The video will not hang for a few more days

103
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,320
If only it could hang all the time

104
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,280
I said, how can you be a man

105
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,000
So ungrateful

106
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,000
Those videos

107
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,320
How many time have I fought for you

108
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,480
Just hung it up

109
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,440
Every video is

110
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,480
Lvchuan endorsed it in the back

111
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,720
Then I still don't understand

112
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,280
That passenger flow

113
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,600
Why is it still falling

114
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,280
Why does the passenger flow drop

115
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,960
We fired the first shot

116
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,080
Now all the hospitals around

117
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,320
Are following our example

118
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,920
Where is the profit

119
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,040
They have all been diverted

120
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,920
How to make money

121
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,560
Have no money to earn

122
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,000
So many competitors

123
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,240
What then

124
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,200
You are the dean. I am the dean

125
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,880
What I should do anyway

126
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,760
It's all done

127
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,080
It's up to you next

128
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,280
Give full play to my dean

129
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,720
It's time for ability

130
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,720
Come

131
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,760
One for each person

132
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,800
There are leaflets all over here

133
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,080
And then there are two ah two models

134
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,720
Today's mission is

135
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,360
It must all be sent out

136
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,680
Then the slogan will be shouted

137
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,520
And there is the one above

138
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,360
That information

139
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,760
Be sure to read it to customers

140
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,520
Everyone who passes by

141
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,600
Don't miss it

142
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,080
Especially those who keep pets

143
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,120
Do you remember

144
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,560
Be full of enthusiasm

145
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,880
It's not what you're doing

146
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,840
Complete the performance

147
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,360
Performance

148
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,240
Performance

149
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,680
With this leaflet, you

150
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,640
Isn't that what you said

151
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,800
The coverage of our hospital is

152
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,400
Three kilometres

153
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,280
So we decided

154
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,480
Within these three kilometers

155
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,360
Give it a good publicity

156
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:37,720
You know

157
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,160
The area covered by three kilometers

158
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:39,920
How big is it

159
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,400
It's up to you

160
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,920
Everyone has these two legs

161
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,000
No problem, Mr. Shen

162
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,360
Back then, Mr. Tian and I

163
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,720
When practicing medicine in Shili Baxiang,

164
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,040
With these legs

165
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:47,760
One step at a time

166
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,600
For those who come out

167
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,280
What age is it now, Mr. Chen

168
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,400
You can rest assured that we are all in

169
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,840
Time off work and rest

170
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,400
Does not affect normal work at ordinary times

171
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,080
It's time for us to start

172
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:57,880
Let's go

173
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,320
Here we go

174
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,000
Otherwise, you can't finish your performance

175
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,840
We're leaving

176
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,960
Tianlin Animal Hospital to find out

177
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:11,760
No thanks

178
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,280
Find out about animal hospitals

179
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,120
No thanks

180
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,920
Tianlin Animal Hospital to find out

181
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,480
Would you take a good look

182
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:17,960
Thank you

183
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,960
Our pet hospital is very famous

184
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:19,720
No need

185
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,920
Tianlin Animal Hospital to find out

186
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:22,600
No, no, no

187
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,880
Membership card of Tianlin Zoological Institute

188
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,640
Get to know

189
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:25,640
Let me have a look

190
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,200
Little brother

191
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,320
No, don't you have any pets at home

192
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,160
Thank you

193
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:30,920
How do you do

194
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,440
How to send this

195
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,880
It can't be sent out

196
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,080
Blame you for not smiling well

197
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:37,960
You can't laugh

198
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:38,960
How can I laugh at you for teaching me

199
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:39,720
Expose one's teeth

200
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,960
Teeth have no teeth

201
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,200
Expose

202
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,840
Chen Yifan

203
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,680
Why are you tired

204
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,120
Is it just that little physical strength

205
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,600
This job is really not tiring

206
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,800
It's just a little shameful

207
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,440
I've been in this business for over twenty years

208
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,960
When were leaflets handed out

209
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,400
My mouth is almost stiff with laughter

210
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,160
I'm telling you

211
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,560
I have a knife in Tianlin

212
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,560
My battlefield should be the operating room

213
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:19,960
Look at that

214
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,240
Go back, go back to Tianlin

215
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,520
Isn't that a shame

216
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,160
I'm exhausted, aunt

217
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:27,800
Is there any water

218
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,960
Have

219
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:29,960
Have you finished sending it

220
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,480
How's it going

221
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,039
Hard work, hard work

222
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:33,840
Thank you

223
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,919
You have so much left

224
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,080
Tian Yuxian

225
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,159
Are you slacking off

226
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,040
None of them are willing to answer it

227
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,280
How about how about

228
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,480
How did your success go

229
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,720
I'm all done

230
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,400
Everyone should be positive

231
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,120
Be enthusiastic

232
00:08:59,120 --> 00:08:59,880
What water do you drink

233
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,840
Of course, we must also take care of it

234
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,760
Drink water

235
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,720
Thank you, aunt

236
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,240
And there are

237
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:06,560
And there are

238
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,280
See the dog walker

239
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,120
It is necessary to rush up

240
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,560
The success rate is very high

Come on. I'll keep coming. What are you doing

244
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,480
No

245
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,080
Where are you going when it's dark

246
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,440
I will definitely come back early

247
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,520
Then I'm going to a crowded place

248
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,320
Send it again

Why are you here

270
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,840
Tian Peilan said

271
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,360
This is a very formal matter

272
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,720
I have to wear high heels

273
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,280
Representing the image of our hospital

274
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,720
Know how to send out two hundred leaflets

275
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,200
Is it possible to make a single order

276
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,280
Then with my brain

277
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,080
You can only come up with this way

278
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,640
When you left Tianlin Hospital,

279
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,040
I already anticipated it

280
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,720
Thank you

281
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,400
All right

282
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,600

You said these hundreds of pictures

325
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,720
How did it get out so quickly

326
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,960
The key point of drainage is to draw

327
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,680
If I'm on the street

328
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,320
See a man

329
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,720
Carry another person on his back

330
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,960
If you hand out leaflets,

331
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,480
I might have seen it a few more times, too

332
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,680
Then we'll send it like this next time

333
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:31,760
Think beautifully

334
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,800
Where did you get little Teddy

335
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:53,960
This is

336
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,640
My name is Ah Q

337
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,160
Suffer from severe gastric ulcer

338
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,480
Please adopt me

339
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,400
You said people are really now

340
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,800
Abandon at every turn

341
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,920
Young people

342
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:23,960
Be more willful

343
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,400
How do you know it's a young man

344
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,600
Do you still have to think about it

345
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,920
A lot of people do

346
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,520
See friends and neighbors

347
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,480
Friends' cute pets are very cute

348
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,120
Thinking about spending money to buy one

349
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:34,840
It turns out that

350
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,400
Since the day I bought it,

351
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,080
Is every day

352
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,240
An endless heart

353
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,760
Can't walk the dog on time

354
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,920
Can't feed the cat on time

355
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,240
The pet got sick

356
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,600
You have to spend money to cure it

357
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,320
Go on a long journey

358
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,800
You have to spend money on foster care

359
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:46,840
Keeping it, keeping it

360
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,760
I feel tired and bored

361
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:49,840
Lost it

362
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,640
There are many such people

363
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,600
Ah Q, how's it going

364
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,440
Canine distemper and fineness are both negative

365
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,960
Blood routine is basically normal

366
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,480
It's just a little malnourished

367
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,400
It has a scar on its abdomen

368
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:03,680
It should be

369
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,320
It was left by surgery before

370
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,240
But now the situation is basically stable

371
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,640
I'll get it some prescription food

372
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,200
Chen Yifan

373
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,560
You prescribe some conditioning medicine for it

374
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,760
OK, I'll go right away

375
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,600
You all stand down

376
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,000
Leave the rest to me

377
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Then I'll leave it to you

378
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,440
Follow a decree

379
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,240
Qi Huo

380
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,160
Five rows are dark, but you are the only one

381
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:46,840
Get on the number quickly

382
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,440
How does your stomach hurt

383
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,120
No

384
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,120
Gotta go to the bathroom

385
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:00,840
I can't

386
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,079
Carlo, don't make trouble. Don't make trouble

387
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,880
Carlo, stop it

388
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,240
Don't make a fuss

389
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,880
Can you go out and stay by yourself

390
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,280
I'm working for a while

391
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,800
Go and go and fuck them to death

392
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,720
Come on, come on

393
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,520
Please wait for me

394
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,480
I was fainted

395
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,440
Please wait for me

396
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,640
Go up fast

397
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,320
Hit him quickly

398
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,040
Hit him quickly and don't let him get away

399
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:12,640
Tian Yuxian

400
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,400
You get out of here

401
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:18,760
Wait a minute, wait a minute

402
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,200
It shouldn't be

403
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,360
I'll just go to the bathroom for a while

404
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,400
Your bathroom

405
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,400
For an hour or so

406
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:27,880
You think I don't know

407
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:28,960
What are you doing in there

408
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:29,520
Come on, come on

409
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,640
Tian Yuxian must know that he was wrong

410
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,960
Is it wrong Tian Yuxian

411
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:32,640
Look at him like this

412
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,840
Do you like to know how to admit your mistake

413
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,240
This month's bonus is gone

414
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:37,800
You know what? That

415
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,280
Chen Yifan Tian Yuxian

416
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,880
You two go up to the second floor and look for it

417
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,040
Tian Tian and I are looking for it on the first floor

418
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,320
It's such a big pet hospital

419
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,520
The dog can't be found yet

420
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,320
Did I look for the second floor

421
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,240
Where are you going

422
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,320
I'll find it

423
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:50,960
You're out of the hospital

424
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,360
There are so many roads out there

425
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,080
How do you look in eight direction

426
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,320
I know you want to

427
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,160
Make amends for your mistakes

428
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,000
But before doing things,

429
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,040
Could you use your head, please

430
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,800
I'm sleeping on the street today

431
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,080
I want to find it, too

432
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,760
Do you have a picture of Ah Q

433
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,080
Photos are on file

434
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,080
Yeah

435
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,040
Tian Peilan

436
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,240
You send this photo to

437
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,000
All our Tianlin's

438
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:11,920
In the customer base,

439
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,880
Mobilize everyone to find it together

440
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,560
Not enough to accomplish things, but more than enough to lose things

441
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,640
Found it, found it

442
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:33,960
Small Q

443
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,280
Small Q

444
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,560
How did you sneak away

445
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,480
Little Q, where have you been

446
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,280
How's it going, Scampy

447
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,120
You just stay here tonight

448
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,080
You just stay here tonight

449
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,280
Don't go anywhere, you know

450
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,880
It will be fine after the adaptation period

451
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,280
I'll put it in your stocking box

452
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,960
Is there anything wrong with you

453
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,640
It's gone

454
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,200
My hands are uncomfortable

455
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,400
I'll get it for you. I'll get it for you

456
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,200
It won't feel bad if you tear it down. Come on

457
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,520
All right

458
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:25,600
It doesn't feel bad anymore

459
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,040
Be good and go in. Go in

460
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,760
Carlo

461
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,120
You watch TV

462
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,600
Why do you keep looking at me

463
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,160
How beautiful the scenery is

464
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,360
Okay, I know

465
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,360
In your heart

466
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,080
I am more beautiful than the scenery

467
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,080
How good

468
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,400
Row

469
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,400
It's okay

470
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,280
I'll see what's going on

471
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,400
Come back and report back to you

472
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,080
Stay here

473
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,280
Why are you here

474
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,280
Brought you some medicine

475
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,600
Carlo

476
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,280
Do you miss me

477
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I think you're running out of medicine

478
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,400
So I brought you two boxes

479
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,040
Have you taken your medicine on time

480
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:48,960
Don't worry about it

481
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:49,880
Eat on time

482
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,520
You didn't lie to me

483
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:10,840
Carlo

484
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,160
Is there anything good to eat today

485
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,200
Do you miss me

486
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:21,840
Have some water

487
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:22,600
Thank you

488
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,240
Did you walk it today

489
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,120
Walk

490
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,160
Feel it today

491
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,400
I'm in a good mood

492
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,280
Shen Mi

493
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,560
You and Tian Tian

494
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:38,320
What's it like at ordinary times

495
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,160
Working mode

496
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,760
I asked for Grandpa

497
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,200
He is very concerned about this matter

498
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,360
What about working hours? She will be there

499
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,760
In addition to taking medicine normally,

500
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,400
And some heart rate monitoring

501
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,800
It will also make me pay attention to some

502
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,040
Something about diet

503
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,680
Would she advise you to drink

504
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,520
What do you mean

505
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,040
I was near Bar Street the other day

506
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:03,920
I see you

507
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,040
So what

508
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,160
Don't you want to explain

509
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,040
There is no explanation for this

510
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,840
That's not necessary, is it

511
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,160
Shen Mi

512
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,120
You are really different from before

513
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,640
When I was a child

514
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,480
If I talk to other boys,

515
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,240
Play together

516
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,160
You will be unhappy

517
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,520
Will be awkward

518
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,120
It's completely changed now

519
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:41,720
Didn't you say so, too

520
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,960
That's when we were young

521
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,200
Now we are all grown up

522
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,160
I still have some work to do

523
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,400
Why don't you go first

524
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,200
Good

525
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,280
I won't bother you

526
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,720
But by the way, let me remind you

527
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,040
Although your current focus of work

528
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,160
At the pet hospital

529
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,400
But over there in Lvchuan

530
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,920
Don't give up completely

531
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,400
Shen Hongyuan has it now

532
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,720
Gu Mingze's assistance

533
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:09,520
He's probably using

534
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,800
The R&D department will turn over the plate

535
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:13,520
Take care of yourself

536
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,080
Good

537
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,320
I see

538
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,000
Thank you

539
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,240
I'm leaving

540
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:18,200
See you later

541
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,800
Go baby

542
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,160
See you later

543
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:25,960
Go away

544
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,800
Carlo, come here

545
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:35,720
Sit down

546
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,400
What are you doing

547
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:12,720
What are you doing

548
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,320
What are you doing

549
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,280
What are you doing

550
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,640
What are you doing

551
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,520
Just bought a whole

552
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,760
A laundry list of snacks

553
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,200
What is this? This is it

554
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,400
There are only three left for me

555
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,240
What about snacks

556
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,400
I didn't eat

557
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,720
You don't eat who eats it

558
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,080
You're getting fat, you know

559
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,280
Really

560
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,200
I'm not fat

561
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,880
Your waist is thick

562
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
I have a thick waist

563
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,760
I have a thick waist, you know

564
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,520
I didn't eat this snack

565
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:42,920
Besides

566
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,600
There are so many people in this whole hospital

567
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,800
Why should I eat

568
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:46,720
If you have the ability, you can adjust the monitoring

569
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,440
Look who ate it

570
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,200
I'm not fat

571
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,640
You're just fat. Short and fat

572
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,480
Adjustment and monitoring

573
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,400
This dog is a god

574
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,120
Why do you think it

575
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,800
Run out again and again

576
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:04,800
You see

577
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,160
I brought the thief

578
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,880
You can be a boy

579
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,400
Little villain

580
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,200
Where did you take the delicious food

581
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,720
Is it for your master

582
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,240
Tian Tian didn't say

583
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,040
This dog was put by someone

584
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,000
Is it at our door

585
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,040
Wait for me

586
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,560
Where did you put your stuff

587
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,480
Where did you put it? Tell me about it

588
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,560
My aunt said it wasn't for eating

589
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,680
Give it to the master

590
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,440
Come

591
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,240
Be good

592
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,320
Come and pick it up

593
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,240
The old dog knows the way. Let's follow it

594
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:41,360
Tian Yuxian

595
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,600
Look at your bad idea

596
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:43,560
You lost him

597
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:45,880
Wait a minute, wait a minute

598
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:47,560
We're both on two legs

599
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,200
How can you catch up

600
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,280
What about the four-legged one

601
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,160
Isn't it silly

602
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,080
Then let's split up

603
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,040
Mr. Chen, you and Tian Peilan

604
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:53,680
Look eastward

605
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,960
Tian Yuxian, look south

606
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,440
Mr. Shen and I continued to look west

607
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,160
Wait

608
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,920
Why are you all in pairs

609
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,160
I'm the only one alone

610
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,520
There are five of us

611
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,800
There must be a single one

612
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:03,680
Then my aunt and I

613
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,480
Stop

614
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,400
Your aunt has me, okay

615
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:06,920
Go

616
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,200
That little Q has stomach trouble

617
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,320
Should not run too far

618
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,280
We can catch up now

619
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,280
He has stomach trouble

620
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,440
When I examined it before,

621
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,160
It should have been done

622
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,240
Surgery for gastric ulcer

623
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,000
Do you have a picture of it

624
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:17,920
Show me

625
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,400
I just entered the hospital to keep a photo

626
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,280
This

627
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,040
What's the matter

628
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:32,520
Mr. Shen, where's my little book

629
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:33,800
At the hospital

630
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:35,400
I'll get it

631
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,880
What's Mr. Tian doing

632
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,320
Get something

633
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,480
September 3rd Chen Jing

634
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,200
I found it. I found it

635
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,440
Young Girls of October

636
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,880
Holding Teddy is a student

637
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,040
Wearing a blue and white school uniform

638
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,760
Clothes look old

639
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,080
October

640
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,160
Tian Tian, our

641
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,760
What about the October medical list

642
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,160
Iris

643
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:11,000
Carrying a Siyuan milk on the schoolbag

644
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:11,800
Found it

645
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,640
All right, it's right.

646
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,600
A Teddy

647
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,360
It was a perforated stomach

648
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,160
Your dad's surgery

649
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,720
It's a free clinic

650
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,040
You wrote it in great detail

651
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,360
Dressed in some rags

652
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:32,440
It means that this child

653
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,440
The family conditions are average

654
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,440
That's just knowing this

655
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,520
What's the use

656
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,760
Zheng Zong of Jin Lan Community

657
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,640
It is the general agent of Siyuan milk

658
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,560
The distribution scope of Siyuan milk is

659
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,240
Nanyuan Beili Songyu Home

660
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,520
Hao Jing Yue Ting

661
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,560
And Warwick District 3

662
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:48,640
Then we can do it at

663
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,200
Look for these residential areas

664
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,640
Then I'm sure I can find Ah Q.

665
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:56,800
Don't they all have addresses written on them

666
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,440
Change your clothes and let's find it

667
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,560
Don't you just do it

668
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:00,880
Go

669
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,160
Go and set off

670
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,080
I'll watch the hospital

671
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,400
You can rest assured

672
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,160
What's Mr. Tian doing

673
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:10,240
Why do you let me talk about everything

674
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,880
When will this wait

675
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,160
Small Q

676
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,400
No

677
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,880
Take it easy

678
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,280
The colors are all different

679
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,200
Much fatter

680
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,640
Still no

681
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,080
Now you know

682
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,240
Aunt, for so many years

683
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,880
Work conscientiously in Tianlin

684
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,280
Not to snoop on other people's privacy

685
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,800
Just recorded those things

686
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,000
She's just trying to treat her clients

687
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,600
Have a comprehensive understanding

688
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,360
Just let us Tian Lin

689
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,960
With more than half of it

690
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,760
They are all old customers for five years

691
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,960
What does this mean

692
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:54,640
Resources

693
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:57,040
Don't look at people so one-sidedly

694
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,480
Tian Yuxian searched everywhere

695
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,600
All the schools around here

696
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,360
This is the only room

697
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,040
Is wearing that school uniform

698
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,720
These are all in school uniforms

699
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,640
Who knows which one in school uniform

700
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,880
Is the owner of Little Q

701
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,080
Is

702
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,320
Where's Tian Yuxian

703
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,680
What about this? What about this

704
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,280
Look who I found

705
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,160
Small Q

706
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,160
Just now I saw it with potato chips in its mouth

707
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:31,320
Right next to the trash can at the school gate

708
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,480
I'll take advantage of it when it doesn't pay attention

709
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,440
It's been grabbed by it

710
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,200
Where is the trash can

711
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:34,840
Show me

712
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,840
Follow me over there

713
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,040
This is it

714
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:56,880
Little sister

715
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,400
Do you know this dog

716
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,200
Don't know

717
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,320
You wait a minute

718
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,800
Little sister, I know you

719
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,640
You take this dog

720
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,200
I went to Tianlin to see the disease

721
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:20,760
I'm sorry

722
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,080
I'm sorry

723
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,360
I'm sorry

724
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,320
I'm sorry I was wrong

725
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,960
I-I shouldn't have

726
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,040
Aunt

727
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,160
I'm sorry

728
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,560
These snacks

729
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,080
I didn't even move

730
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,040
Give it back to you

731
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:46,240
This is not necessary

732
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,800
It's not something important

733
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:48,960
I'll stay here

734
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,000
You eat slowly. It's okay

735
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:55,320
I also apologize for Ah Q

736
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,280
It wasn't intended to be stolen

737
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,840
It just knows

738
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,000
I like to eat snacks

739
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,760
Talent

740
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,240
Our little bamboo

741
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,120
I've caused you so much trouble

742
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,000
I'm really sorry

743
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,680
Small bamboo

744
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:16,120
Then what the hell is going on here

745
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,280
Xiaozhu

746
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,720
Don't be afraid. Come here quickly

747
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,000
Come

748
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,160
Sit here

749
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,280
Talk to the big brothers and sisters

750
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,400
What's going on

751
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:35,320
I was about a year ago

752
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:36,880
Meet Ah Q

753
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:48,480
What's wrong with you, dog

754
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,280
Where's your master

755
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,880
Are you ill

756
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,240
Since then

757
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,520
Ah Q will do it every day

758
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:58,680
In our first time

759
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,200
Where you see it

760
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,440
When I'm out of school

761
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:04,160
Then we'll go home together

762
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,640
And then what

763
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,440
Later

764
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,480
I delivered it

765
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,920
Tin Lam Animal Hospital

766
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,880
Dr. Tian said

767
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,560
It's a massive gastric ulcer

768
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,120
Causing a perforated stomach

769
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,159
Because the doctor was sent in time

770
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,040
Picked up a life and came back

771
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:26,800
But the cost of treatment

772
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,400
It costs more than a thousand pieces

773
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,120
May

774
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,920
But I have no money

775
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:36,440
Don't worry, children

776
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,600
It will be all right after the infusion

777
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:42,679
Doctor

778
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,239
This is all my money

779
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:51,239
Children put away the money

780
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:52,840
I'll give you free treatment

781
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:00,720
It's okay

782
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:01,440
Come

783
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,360
Take the kettle

784
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,520
It's okay to put on your clothes

785
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,040
Little Q is fine

786
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:08,880
So after Ah Q was discharged from hospital,

787
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,640
You will live together

788
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:16,400
Small bamboo

789
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,440
Look what I bought for you

790
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,640
It's potato chips

791
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,680
Chocolate and lollipops

792
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,640
Small Q Small Q

793
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,520
Lollipop

794
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,440
Little Q, look

795
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,960
Mom got paid today

796
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,120
Mom

797
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:39,480
Aunt

798
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,280
Your legs

799
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,240
Is it hurt

800
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,080
It's not hurt

801
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,760
It just doesn't work all of a sudden

802
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,360
Later, I went to the hospital to check

803
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:56,560
Said it was congenital

804
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:59,320
Congenital spinal disease

805
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,280
Spinal cord compression caused by

806
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:02,360
Right

807
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,360
I can't remember

808
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,120
Xiaozhu can remember

809
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,280
Then after you get sick,

810
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,080
What do you live on

811
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,480
The street heard about me

812
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,600
Not only on a regular basis

813
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,720
Send us some rice flour oil

814
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:20,680
And introduced me to some

815
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:21,800
Do odd jobs

816
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:24,120
Can still live

817
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,920
Our little bamboo is very sensible

818
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,640
Go home from school every day

819
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,160
I have to cook and serve me

820
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:35,960
Finish your homework

821
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,760
You can also help me paste the carton

822
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,920
I didn't fall behind in my homework

823
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,200
Why are you home

824
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,360
So many people

825
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,280
This is my sister

826
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,560
Come from my hometown today

827
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,120
Take us back

828
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,480
Juanzi

829
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,320
These are from the pet hospital

830
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:06,000
It is Xiaozhu with puppies

831
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,400
The hospital where you see a doctor

832
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:10,800
Second aunt

833
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,600
Or

834
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,520
Let's put little Q

835
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:15,880
Take it back

836
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,160
No, no, no

837
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,280
The dog is also sick

838
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,800
There is no money to treat it

839
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,520
Your mother is like this

840
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,920
It's hard to feed you

841
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,400
How can I have time to take care of it

842
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,040
This dog is following us

843
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,440
It's not good either

844
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,120
Or you throw it away

845
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,200
Or give it away

846
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:36,280
Xiaozhu, just listen to your second aunt

847
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,560
Elder sister

848
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:39,280
If you had listened to me,

849
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,840
How can it be like today

850
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,000
Crowded in such a place

851
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,040
Even the sun can't shine completely

852
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,120
In the basement

853
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,520
Go to school

854
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:47,680
This girl's house

855
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,320
What's the use of reading so many books

856
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,800
To the end

857
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,280
It's not the same as getting married

858
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:55,760
What happened to the girl

859
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,360
Girls also read

860
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,920
Xiaozhu studies so well

861
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:02,520
Small bamboo

862
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:03,960
How about this

863
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,360
Let's help you put little Q

864
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,640
Take it back to the pet hospital

865
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:07,640
We'll help you raise it

866
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,720
Do you think it's all right

867
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:25,600
Ah Q

868
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:26,560
Later

869
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,000
You should listen to your uncle and aunt

870
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,400
Be good

871
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:32,280
Don't make them angry

872
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,080
I'll take you

873
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,200
I entrusted it to them

874
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,600
Why do you trust us

875
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,680
Shen Mi

876
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,520
This is your dog

877
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:44,760
Now that you have chosen it,

878
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,320
You have an obligation

879
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,400
Take care of it all your life

880
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,280
Do you know

881
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:48,480
But

882
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,880
No one can help you plan

883
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,160
Your life belongs to you

884
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:52,680
And no one can

885
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:53,600
Tell you whatever you want

886
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,600
Life should be in the end

887
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,920
According to what standards have you been there

888
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,880
Even the people closest to you

889
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:58,560
Understand

890
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:03,800
How old are you

891
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:05,520
A lifetime is long

892
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,440
We can only help you temporarily

893
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,440
Take care of Ah Q

894
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,160
So you study hard

895
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,280
When you return to Fucheng in college,

896
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,000
At that time, we put Ah Q

897
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:13,760
Give it back to you

898
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,080
Okay

899
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:23,720
Let's go

900
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,240
Don't worry

901
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:31,400
Ah Q, you have to wait for me to come back

902
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,480
I will study hard

903
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,760
You have to wait for me to come back and pick you up

904
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:47,120
The chief's dog food is in it

905
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:47,480
Good

906
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,120
Then you got your ticket, too

907
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,160
Thank you, darling

908
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:51,600
The new canned dog over there

909
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:52,160
Not bad, too

910
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,200
You can try it next time

911
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:54,200
Okay, let's go

912
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,600
Good slow walk slow walk

913
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,520
Shen Zong

914
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,080
Take Carlo for a walk

915
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,080
Take it and give it back to you

916
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,640
Don't forget what you promised me

917
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:47,960
Go, go, go

918
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,040
Did you go out to play

919
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:49,960
Little by little

920
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,240
We went out for a dog walk

921
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,160
I went out to walk my dog

922
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,520
This sighs again

923
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,880
And frowning

924
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:01,280
It's like who owes you how much money

925
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:01,560
Come here

926
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:02,960
If someone really owes money,

927
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:03,720
I'm all right

928
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,000
You can ask for some accounts

929
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,760
Look at this report

930
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:07,480
We have three months

931
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:09,080
How to make a profit

932
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:12,320
But

933
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:14,200
I thought about one carefully

934
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:15,320
Maybe it can help us

935
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:17,080
Ways to improve performance

936
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:18,680
Talk about it

937
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:19,400
Do you remember the last time

938
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,800
When doing pet fundraising,

939
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:21,640
Shen Mi contacted those people

940
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:22,760
Public welfare organization

941
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:23,480
Remember

942
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:23,880
That's the same as us

943
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,000
It doesn't matter

944
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,560
If we are Tian Lin

945
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:27,880
Can you talk to these non-profit organizations

946
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:28,800
Achieve cooperation

947
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:30,400
The idea is good

948
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,480
But don't be too happy

949
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,440
Look at this time

950
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:38,040
The propaganda made by our hospital

951
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,320
It has some effect

952
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:40,640
But I found out

953
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:41,560
Is it coming in

954
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:43,400
Is to see more and ask more

955
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,480
But buy less

956
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,600
Think about it, it may be because

957
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:46,560
Our hospital

958
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:48,040
Take a look at this. Just this

959
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:49,840
Two and a half doctors'

960
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:51,640
As soon as everyone came in, they felt that

961
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:53,360
It's not very reliable

962
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:56,760
You said that even if it is a non-profit organization,

963
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:58,080
And gave it to us

964
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,160
Then the number of doctors in our hospital

965
00:41:59,160 --> 00:41:59,760
It's not enough

966
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,520
It's too late to do it

967
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,480
What did you say

968
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,160
Every day, it's just me and Mr. Chen

969
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:05,560
I'm almost exhausted

970
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,000
It's time to recruit some people

971
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:08,720
No

972
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:09,760
The key is the job advertisement

973
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:10,560
It's all on the Internet

974
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:11,840
No one came either

975
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:13,640
I see cats and dogs every day

976
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:15,760
Come on, I'm walking my dog

977
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:16,400
Go away

978
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:16,800
Go to play

979
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,200
Go

980
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:19,560
Go

981
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:20,360
How do you do

982
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:26,600
You this

983
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:28,240
Then take a look at it

984
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:29,200
You are

985
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,160
I'm here to apply for a job
