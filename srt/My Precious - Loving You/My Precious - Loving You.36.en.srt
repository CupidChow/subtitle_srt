00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,640
I am your daughter.

150
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,720
Why didn't you tell me?

151
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,700
You have been lying to me for so many years.

152
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:25,160
You clearly know that I love Shen Mi.

153
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,320
He's long gone.

154
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,960
Why didn't you tell me?

155
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,680
You took advantage of my feelings.

156
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,540
You want to make me marry Gao Zhuo

157
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:38,000
so that you can get the whole Lvchuan
into your hands.

158
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,440
This is your goal, right?

159
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,352
Mengnan,

160
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,920
how could you think of me this way?

161
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,840
What I did at that time

162
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,000
was for the Shen family

163
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,080
and for Mr. Shen.

164
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,640
His health at that time

165
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,920
was very poor.

166
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,020
If he knew that

167
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,440
Shen Mi died abroad,

168
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,720
it would have killed him.

169
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,040
If Mr. Shen was gone,

170
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,600
the Shen family would go down with him.

171
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,760
The Shen family and Mr. Shen

172
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,000
were very gracious to me.

173
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,880
I could not just watch that happen.

174
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,760
Mr. Shen has already lost his son.

175
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,840
He couldn't lose his grandson again.

176
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,160
But now you have lost your daughter.

No need to look. I've got a burst of shots.

There are 20 more.

280

How did you spot this particular moment?

Look.

is to see you two

have a grand wedding ceremony.

287
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,080
I can't imagine how romantic that would be!

288
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,260
It's too far in the future.
I haven't even thought about it yet.

289
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:35,360
What do you mean by too far? Tonight,

290
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,320
Shen Mi is taking you to meet his family.

291
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:40,000
You will be his rightful girlfriend.

292
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,240
Then you are the future daughter-in-law
of the Shen family.

293
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,640
Next, there will surely be the engagement.

294
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,720
And then the wedding.

295
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,560
You're thinking too far ahead.

296
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,080
You came quite quickly this time.

297
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,480
I've said it before.

298
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,640
Don't mention Gao Zhuo to me.

299
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,720
That's my bottom line.

300
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,080
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">[File bag]</font></font></i>
Aren't you curious about what's inside?

301
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:27,744
This is the report
of the DNA paternity test I had done

302
00:16:27,744 --> 00:16:29,640
using your grandfather's hair and your hair.

303
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,320
In this report,

304
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,920
it clearly states

305
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,440
that there is no blood relationship
between you two.

306
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,560
Just take a look.

307
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,400
Paternity tests can be easily faked.

308
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,560
I can also provide one
that shows we have a blood relationship.

309
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,440
Do you think anyone will believe what you say?

310
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,480
But my father has already

311
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,480
told me everything.

312
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:05,720
The real Shen Mi

313
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,720
died ten years ago

314
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,400
in a sea accident.

315
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,760
The person buried under that tree
is the real him.

316
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,640
And you

317
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,800
are nothing more than an impostor
who took his place.

318
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,640
What exactly do you want?

319
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,712
Marry me.

320
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,336
Impossible.

321
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,200
Then,
at your grandpa's birthday dinner tonight,

322
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,600
I will reveal your true identity

323
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,160
to everyone.

324
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,160
You may not care,

325
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,240
but what about Dr. Tian?

326
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:35,760
Lvchuan will definitely
withdraw all the investments in Tianlin.

327
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,680
By then,

328
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,800
she may not be able to keep her hospital.

329
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,040
Father, have a cup of tea.

330
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,800
Today

331
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,880
is your 80th birthday.

332
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,160
I will drink some more wine with you.

333
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,000
At my age,

334
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,260
I should strictly control

335
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:42,440
my drinking.

336
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,520
Father,

337
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,280
whether to drink has nothing to do with age.

338
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,800
It depends on the physical condition.

339
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,896
Okay.

340
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,720
Shen Chen,

341
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,440
what have you been up to lately?

342
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,200
Your grandpa is asking you.

343
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,640
Nothing.

344
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,080
You're not young anymore.

345
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,080
You can't just hang around all day.

346
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,240
In my opinion,

347
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,640
you

348
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,240
should go work in Lvchuan.

349
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,000
Just as your grandpa suggested,

350
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,720
go report tomorrow.

351
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,720
Father, you are the only one
who can handle him.

352
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,000
I'm of age now.

353
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,360
Sooner or later,

354
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,920
I have to let go of the business.

355
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,720
Your brother can't do it all by himself.

356
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,720
He needs a trustworthy family beside him.

357
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,960
You are his younger brother.

358
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,720
If you don't help him,

359
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,880
who will you help?

360
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:52,280
Father,

361
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:54,320
isn't the one year we agreed on not over yet?

362
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,360
What does it matter?

363
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,240
Everyone has seen

364
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,880
all of Shen Mi's performances.

365
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,880
The shareholders of the group

366
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,000
and the directors

367
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,600
are all very satisfied with him.

368
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,060
Aside from him, who else is more suitable

369
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:16,960
to be the CEO of Lvchuan Group?

370
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,120
What do you think about this wedding dress?

371
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,400
Don't you have any interest in

372
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,840
what I'm wearing for our wedding?

373
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,080
Whatever you like will be fine.

374
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,080
Let's go with this one, then.

375
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,800
I will go to the bridal shop tomorrow
to try it on.

376
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,440
You probably don't have time
to come with me, do you?

377
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,520
By the way,

378
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,600
I've had Vivienne book the wedding venue.

379
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,040
The date is in three days.

380
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,976
Do you have any objections?

381
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,120
Whatever you decide will be fine.

382
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,616
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">Give me your hand.</font></font></i>

383
00:22:31,616 --> 00:22:32,880

384
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,960

387
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,560
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">What is this thing?</font></font></i>

388
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,840
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">It's a tradition.</font></font></i>

389
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,032
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">A reward for your kindness.</font></font></i>

390
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,560
Father, Shen Mi and Mengnan are here.

391
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,120
Happy birthday, Grandpa.

392
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,240
How did you two come together?

393
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,560
Why hasn't

394
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,700
Dr. Tian come?

395
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:26,440
Dad, today is your 80th birthday.

396
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,280
Of course, everyone present is family.

397
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,360
It's not appropriate

398
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,000
for Dr. Tian to come
to such an event, isn't it?

399
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,560
Mengnan, don't you think I'm right?

400
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,200
Father, since everyone is here now,

401
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,600
let's go in.

402
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:43,240
Okay, let's go in.

403
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,360
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">Tonight,</font></font></i>

404
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,320

405

410
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,448
Great.

411
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,120
Grandpa,

412
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,680
this longevity peach was specially selected

413
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,240
by me and Shen Mi for you.

414
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,760
We wish you

415
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:39,800
a long and healthy life.

416
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,680
Thank you.

417
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,640
I appreciate it

418
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,480
a lot.

419
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,672
Okay.

420
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,232
Please enjoy.

421
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,320
Come on, everyone. Have a taste.

422
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,960
Hurry up and eat.

423
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,720
- Here.
- Okay.

424
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,280
I have something

425
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,200
to announce now.

426
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,640
At the board meeting next month,

427
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,920
I will propose

428
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:29,520
that Shen Mi succeed as the group's CEO.

429
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,000
Shen Mi,

430
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,240
I've already talked to your uncle.

431
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,160
You have no objections, right?

432
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,880
No.

433
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,120
Good.

434
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,720
Come on.

435
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,720
Let's have a toast.

436
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,136
Father.

437
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,888
Grandpa.

438
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,080
Father,

439
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,240
and everyone,

440
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,160
I also have something to announce today.

441
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,400
Shen Mi and I have decided

442
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,680
to hold our wedding in three days.

443
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,760
Mengnan,

444
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,260
it's inappropriate to make jokes

445
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,960
on such a day.

446
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,500
Why don't we ask Shen Mi

447
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:50,040
if what I said is true?

448
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,440
Shen Mi,

449
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,840
tell them whether I'm joking or not.

450
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,920
Tell everyone

451
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,120
whether what I said is true or not.

452
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,984
It's true.

453
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,160
Shen Mi,

454
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,400
marriage is by no means a trifling matter.

455
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,520
You must speak with sincerity.

456
00:28:14,614 --> 00:28:15,840
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">[Tian Tian]</font></font></i>

457
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,080
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">How was the dinner?</font></font></i>

458
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,920

459
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,520
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">Please say hello to him for me.</font></font></i>

460
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,720
Well,

461
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:26,360
there are several happy events today.

462
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,080
They are all good things.

463
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,400
How about

464
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,400
I make a round of toast

465
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,560
to liven up the atmosphere?

466
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,880
Father,

467
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,920
firstly,

468
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,380
it's your 80th birthday.

469
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:40,520
Happy birthday.

470
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,300
May your longevity outlast the heavens

471
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,840
and your blessings be as deep as the sea.

472
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,040
May you shine like the sun and moon,

473
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,040
and may your youth last forever.

474
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,540
Thank you, son.

475
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:52,928
Let's drink it down.

476
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,780
Sister-in-law,

477
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:56,080
the second toast is for you.

478
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,280
Okay.

479
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,800
May our family

480
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,920
always be harmonious and sweet.

481
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,616
Thank you.

482
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,680
The third toast

483
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,040
is for Shen Mi.

484
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,360
Congratulations on regaining
control of the Lvchuan Group.

485
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:18,000
Mr. Shen, you know that Shen Mi doesn't drink.

486
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,920
Well, he can have the soft drink instead.

487
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,960
By the way,

488
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,900
I should also wish you two

489
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:30,200
a happy marriage forever.

490
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,712
Thank you.

491
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,120
Eat more food if you don't drink.

492
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,840
This is really fresh.

493
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,240
That's okay. I can serve myself.

494
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,208
Okay.

495
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:54,040
Han, you've worked hard all these years.

496
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,080
Come on.

497
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,240
Let's eat.

498
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,360
Everyone, eat more.

499
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:10,320
These dishes are all your favorites.

500
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,480

501
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,680

510
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,840
It shouldn't be.

511
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,160
Why hasn't he replied to my messages?

512
00:31:58,800 --> 00:31:59,840
Look at you two.

513
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:00,960
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">[Tian Tian]</font></font></i>
Why didn't you tell me about such a huge event

514
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,720
as a wedding until now?

515
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,940
We're discussing your wedding.

516
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:08,000
Stop playing with your phone.

517
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,280
You know,

518
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,640
marriage is a big event.

519
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,080
Three days is not enough.

520
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,560
It's all too hasty.

521
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,200
You're getting married now,

522
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,160
and you're still shy
in front of your own mother?

523
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,400
Mrs. Shen, Shen Mi and I

524
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,760
don't want to make it grand.

525
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,080
We plan to invite some close friends

526
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,020
and family over as witnesses.

527
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:43,360
And you are still calling me Mrs. Shen?

528
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,552
Mom.

529
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,992
Shen Mi,

530
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,160
can I borrow you for a second?

531
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,040
Shen Mi,

532
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,600
what play

533
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,440
are you and Han Mengnan acting in?

534
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,320
It's not a play.

535
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:29,600
You are not really going to marry her, are you?

536
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,904
I am.

537
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,648
Then what about Tian Tian?

538
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,648
I'm asking you.

539
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,640
What about Tian Tian?

540
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,940
What will you do with Tian Tian?

541
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:50,120
Shen Mi!

542
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:52,440
Say something, Shen Mi!

543
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,728
I…

544
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,440
Shen Mi,

545
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,679
we are real brothers.

546
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,360
I thought

547
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,960
you could give Tian Tian happiness.

548
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,440
You've always let me win

549
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,520
since we were young,

550
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:29,560
so I let you win over her.

551
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,120
But you made me feel

552
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,580
that I was wrong.

553
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:39,120
I was really wrong.

554
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,880
Mom,

555
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:49,960
look at these wedding dresses.

556
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,040
Which one do you like?

557
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,400
As long as the dress is on you,

558
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,680
it will look good.

559
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:56,780
Thank you, mom.

560
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:59,000
Then I'm going to
get the wedding dress tomorrow.

561
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,960
Okay.

562
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,000
Mom, where is grandpa?

563
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,320
He just drank some wine,

564
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,680
and he's resting inside.

565
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,800
Then we're leaving now.

566
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,320
Aren't you going to say goodbye to him?

567
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,400
Let Grandpa rest well.

568
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,864
Okay.

569
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,740
Mom, we're leaving now.

570
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:21,280
Take care.

571
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,360
Are you leaving already?

572
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:27,240
Yes, there's a lot to do for the wedding.

573
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:29,160
So we need to go now
and discuss with each other.

574
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,240
Yeah, it won't be easy for you.

575
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:32,720
I'll see you off. Let's go.

576
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,460
Carlo!

577
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:47,160
I know you missed me.

578
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:49,760
Carlo, come here.
I'll get your food ready soon.

579
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,840
Carlo,

580
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,800
it will be ready soon. Just wait a second.

581
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,400
Here, Carlo.

582
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,192
Here.

583
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,320
Slow down,

584
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,920
you little greedy dog.

585
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,856
Take your time.

586
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,800
How's the food today? Do you like it?

587
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,456
It's pretty good.

588
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,640
Shen Mi,

589
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,320
do you feel uncomfortable anywhere?

590
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,780
What do you mean?

591
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:32,000
I just saw you eating some eel.

592
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,180
You couldn't eat eels when you were young.

593
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:35,520
It could give you an allergic reaction,

594
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,680
make your throat hurt,

595
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,200
and even put your life in danger.

596
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,800
Mr. Shen,

597
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,800
sometimes allergies

598
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,040
fade away naturally as one ages

599
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:46,060
and their body becomes more robust.

600
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:47,240
This is quite normal.

601
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,160
I'm glad if you're fine.

602
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,448
Mengnan.

603
00:37:52,448 --> 00:37:53,504
Mengnan,

604
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,240
I also have to go home.

605
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:58,320
Why don't you go with me?

606
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,840
No need.

607
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,520
Shen Mi will drive me home, right?

608
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,760
Take care, Han.

609
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:37,560
Carlo,

610
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,120
I've brought a gift for you.

611
00:38:40,544 --> 00:38:41,800
It's not food.

612
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,008
It is

613
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,360
a collar

614
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,440
used to monitor

615
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,600
your heart rate at any time.

616
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:49,880
Let me put it on you.

617
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,600
Done.

618
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,640
Let me pair it for you.

619
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,320
Okay, it's paired.

620
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,680
This can monitor your heart rate at any time

621
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:05,840
and let me know

622
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,360
about your health condition,

623
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,920
so I won't worry about you in the future.

624
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,160
You are such a good boy.

625
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,480
Did Shen Hongyuan discover something?

626
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:38,944
I don't know,

627
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,640
but thank you for helping me out today.

628
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,880
You're welcome.

629
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,720
I just want you

630
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,160
to fulfill our marriage contract as Shen Mi.

631
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,120
If you are exposed now,

632
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,760
then what's the point of what I did?

633
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:09,280
Gao Zhuo, don't forget

634
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,520
that everything you have now
was given to you by Shen Mi.

635
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:14,840
Does it bother you

636
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:16,920
to fulfill his unfulfilled wishes for him?

637
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,240
As long as you're happy.

638
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,280
Why isn't your owner

639
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,280
back yet?

640
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:00,992
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">[Tian Yuxian]</font></font></i>

641
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:06,720
What's up?

642
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:09,280
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">You tell me. It's so late.
Why aren't you home yet?</font></font></i>

644
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,520
I know.

645
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:14,740
I'm still at Shen Mi's place right now.

646
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:16,760
It's so late, and he hasn't come back yet.

647
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:18,080
I'll have to be with Carlo for a while.

648
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:20,160
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">Just come home in time. Oh, by the way,</font></font></i>

652
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:27,040
Okay, sure.

653
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,160
Carlo, Carlo.

654
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,840
Look. Isn't it beautiful?
