<i>[Episode 35]</i>

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,480
It's really serious.

27
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:47,240
It's unlikely to be completely cured.

28
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,960
Although the tumor is currently incurable,

29
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,800
if newly developed lymphoma
targeting drug is used,

30
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,480
it can continue
to inhibit the growth of cancer cells

31
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,520
and even reduce the diameter of tumors.

32
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,620
So, you mean…

33
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,039
It is possible

34
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:09,039
to survive with tumors.

35
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,360
To survive with tumors?

36
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,240
Then Champion can be saved, right?

37
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,480
If it survives with tumors,

38
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,040
can it have a normal-aged life?

39
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,320
I can't guarantee this.

40
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,960
But according to the current situation,

41
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,500
if it sticks to the medication,

42
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:24,240
its life can be extended
by at least five to six years.

43
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:27,000
- Dr. Gu.
- Mr. Yan.

44
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,520
Dr. Gu, thank you.

45
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,600
Thank you so much.

46
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,840
If it weren't for Mr. Shen and Tian Tian,

47
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,320
the new drug could not have been developed.

48
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,920
You should thank them.

49
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,160
Thank you, Mr. Shen.

50
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,000
Thank you, Dr. Tian.

51
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,160
This is what we should do.

52
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,560
But I have to remind you,

53
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,600
Champion

54
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,632
can't compete now.

55
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,160
I know.

56
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,640
Could you please take me to Champion?

57
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,280
In fact, I can feel

58
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,880
it's his last competition.

59
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,160
Champion's body

60
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,840
is long past the peak.

61
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,920
A lot of people told me

62
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,816
to replace it earlier

63
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,440
with a new pacemaker.

64
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,760
But I don't want to.

65
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,520
So I still let it accompany me to compete.

66
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,680
It accompanied me

67
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,600
to win trophies.

68
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:41,984
I know,

69
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,080
it doesn't want to leave me either.

70
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,460
But now I realize

71
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:52,140
I was being too selfish.

72
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:54,500
It must have felt

73
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,520
that this is its last competition with me.

74
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,520
So each time we trained,

75
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,600
it worked harder than usual

76
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,960
and didn't even show it was sick.

77
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,040
I want to thank you all

78
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,880
for saving Champion's life.

79
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,800
Although it can't accompany
me to the competition,

80
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,280
as long as it can survive,

81
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,440
as long as it can stay with me,

82
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,424
that's enough.

I have to go back to Lvchuan sooner or later.

101
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,920
In fact, we have experienced so many things

102
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,280
during the time spent in Tianlin,

103
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,560
no matter you, or others,

104
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,600
or even the whole Tianlin Hospital,

105
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,680
have slowly developed.

106
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,160
So I think it's time for me

107
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,600
to let you make your own decisions.

108
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,400

109
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,560

110
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:31,280
But as Miss Tian's boyfriend,

111
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,440
I can still give you some advice.

112
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,000
Okay, boyfriend.

113
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,704

You are here.

116
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,080
I came to tell you something.

117
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,400
There are two things.

118
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,800
One is that after Champion used
the lymphoma targeted drug,

119
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,400
so far all is well.

120
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,040
In the best case scenario,

121
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,480
its life can be extended
by at least five to six years.

122
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,560
That's really great.

123
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,580
And starting tomorrow,

124
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:06,080
the R&D department of Lvchuan

125
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,680
will send two new staff over

126
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,080
to guide you on the new drug

127
00:08:10,816 --> 00:08:11,904
for one month.

128
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,040
I believe, in this one month,

129
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,320
you guys could at least master it.

130
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,960
I thought you would come.

131
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,840
That's the second thing I want to tell you.

132
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,520
I have submitted my resignation application

133

So sudden?

136
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,500
All things must come to an end.

137
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,440
My mission in Lvchuan is already completed.

138
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,440
There's no point in staying any longer.

139
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,120
So, are you going back to the UK?

140
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,960
No, I'm going to Thailand.

141
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,760

142
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,120
we went to the Animal Medicine Summit together?

143
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,160
It wasn't perfect, though,

144
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,000
it left me

Fond memories?

147
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,960
So, is the person
you have such fond memories of

148
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,960

149
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,416

by the executive chef of the club.

That's just Duck Blood in Chili Sauce.

193
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,880
Isn't it good?

194
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,540
It's got shredded eel in it.

195
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:16,360
Do you forget that Shen Mi is allergic to eels?

196
00:11:17,792 --> 00:11:19,040
Is that so?

197
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,100
Of course.

198
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,400
Do you forget?

199
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,640
When Mi was three,

200
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,400
we had a meal with elder brother's family,

201
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,540
and there came a dish, Eel in Hot Oil,

202
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:27,712
Shen Mi just took a bite,

203
00:11:27,712 --> 00:11:31,260
his whole body was swollen
and he couldn't even breath.

204
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:33,240
We took him to the hospital together.

205
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,840

I miss you so much, Champion.

00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,180
I really miss you.

Remember, you have to take your medicine,

I'll take you home in a couple of days.

226
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,520
And we can start training together again.

227
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,200
Be good, Champion.

228
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:07,340
Thank you for taking care
of Champion during this time.

229
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:08,880
This is what we should do.

230
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,720
Mr. Yan, how's the competition?

231
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,120
Right, Mr. Yan.

232
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,040
Is everything going well?

233
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,960
I don't want to talk about it here,
in case Champion would hear it.

234
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,960
Let's go outside.

235
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,776
Be careful.

236
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:27,820
Congratulations to Mr. Yan
for another gold medal.

237
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:28,864
Give me, give me.

238
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,420
Sister, do I look like a champion?

239
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:34,480
No way! All you know is
playing games and being lazy.

240
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,560
This is what the gold medal looks like.

241
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,120
It is so beautiful.

242
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,560
It's so heavy, this gold medal.

243
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,080
Mr. Yan, here you are.

244
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,420
Without the participation of Champion,

245
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:48,960
it actually doesn't mean

246
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,720
much to me.

247
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,060
And I don't want to tell Champion.

248
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:00,080
Why?

249
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,400
Because I don't want it

250
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,920
to know that this gold medal

251
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,880
was won without it.

252
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,320
During this period of time,

253
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,960
thank you for taking care of Champion.

254
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,240
This is what we should do.

255
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,920
I'll come tomorrow.

256
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,920
It seems that Mr. Yan

257
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,240
is still disappointed
that Champion did not participate in

258
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,960
the retirement competition.

259
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,960
Look at him now,

260
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,000
he's not only disappointed.

261
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,040
I think it becomes a heart knot to him.

262
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,120
If it cannot be solved,

263
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,680
I'm really afraid he won't
have the courage to keep running.

264
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,000
Well, let's get him out of it.

265
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,040
How?

266
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,880
Let the champion run again.

267
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,640
This is the road map I designed.

268
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:24,120
Why does this route look like a circle?

269
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,640
Because it's a circle.

270
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,960
This is the road map to the park.

271
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,760
I've looked up this route.

272
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:35,480
The competition that Mr. Yan participated in
with Champion for the first time

273
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,440
actually wasn't a real marathon,

274
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,000
but a national event in this place.

275
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,960
Right. The circle represents
both the beginning and the end.

276
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,680
So for the Champion's last run,

277
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,680
it's meaningful to hold it

278
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:49,728
where its dream began.

279
00:15:50,656 --> 00:15:51,740
And then?

280
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:54,160
And then we have to make it feel like

281
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,840
it's actually in a competition
under limited conditions.

283

<i>[First Tianlin International Marathon,

284
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,560
Now the problem is,

285
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:52,704
how can Mr. Yan and Champion
participate in at the same time?

286
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,360
What should we do?

287
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,360
Let's use this.

288
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,720
That could work.

289
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,560
The challenge is

290
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,280
to find a balance

291
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,359
between pushing and pulling.

292
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:14,839
Also, we need to remind him
with words and body language

293
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:16,040
about changes in the road ahead,

294
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:19,319
like uphill, downhill, steps,
manhole covers and others,

295
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:20,359
in order to prevent accidents.

296
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,920
Also, the speed of the runners and Mr. Yan

297
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,420
should be as consistent as possible.

298
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:28,800
- Consistent?
- But,

299
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,440
we're all amateurs.

300
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,600
How can we keep up with the world champion?

301
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,000
So I arrange a relay run.

302
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,700
So there's not much running to do

303
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:40,720
for everyone.

304
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,080
How long will we be running?

305
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,220
Probably over ten kilometers.

306
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:46,560
Let's just call it ten kilometers.

307
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,880
So the six of us have to run

308
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,000
average 1.7 kilometers each.

309
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,080
Not six,

310
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,920
but five.

311
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,860
- Five?
- Five?

312
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:59,120
Who's not running?

313
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,840
Shen Mi had heart surgery before,

314
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,600
so I didn't let him participate this time.

315
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,480
I can't go with you, though,

316
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,520
I'll take care of

317
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,700
all the logistics, so don't worry.

318
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,000
So each of us

319
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,480
has to run more, right?

320
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,200
Mr. Chen, Peilan.

321
00:18:19,104 --> 00:18:20,120
I know this is

322
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:22,120
way above your job description.

323
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:24,840
Especially the hospital work
is so heavy these days.

324
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,240
- So--
- So,

325
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,080
we have to do this.

326
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,120
Well, it's not the first time

327
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,120
Tianlin has done something like this.

328
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:36,200
Aunt, come on and sit.

329
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,560
- Sit.
- Come here.

330
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,560
Aunt.

331
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,800
At your age,

332
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,760
it must be hard to run two kilometers at once.

333
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,360
Why don't you, Mr. Chen, run some for her?

334
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,640
I can take care of it for you.

335
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,440
I don't run for nothing.

336
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,320
I'll run three kilometers.

337
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,720
Tian, you're young.

338
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,680
Don't you want to run an extra kilometer

339
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,520
for Wen Jing and Tian Tian?

340
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,600
No need.

341
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,600
When I was at school,
I was the girls' 3km race champion.

342
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,740
Two kilometers shouldn't be a problem.

343
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:07,440
You are that great?
Why didn't you say it earlier?

344
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,240
Wen Jing, then you can run more for me.

345
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,480
Can you be a man?

346
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,800
- You're a man.
- Can you be a man?

347
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,720
You're the only young man.

348
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,880
You should run an extra two kilometers.

349
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:15,880
Chen Yifan, you push me.

350
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,280
Come on, I'll push you.

351
00:19:38,464 --> 00:19:39,488
Is it okay?

352
00:19:39,488 --> 00:19:40,576
Okay.

353
00:19:40,576 --> 00:19:41,720
Well done.

354
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:45,040
Let's try it for Mr. Yan and Champion.

355
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,440
Come on, okay.

356
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,000
Let's do it again.

357
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,200
Come here, this way.

358
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,440
Wheelchair!

359
00:19:59,616 --> 00:20:00,640
Come on.

360
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,640
Are you okay, Mr. Chen?

361
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,680
Are you okay?

362
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,600
Mr. Yan and Champion
are really having a hard time.

363
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,400
If you are okay, let's try again.

364
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,480
Let's try it again.

365
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,840
Okay, come on.

366
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,384
Let's go.

367
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,880
Director Zhang, thank you
for your support of this event.

368
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,840
Mr. Yan is the champion of our first

369
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,780
national long-distance running competition.

370
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:24,960
And you're trying to fulfil his wish.

371
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,840
We must fully support

372
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,880
such a meaningful event.

373
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,360
Thank you.

374
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,880
<i>[First Tianlin International Marathon,
Starting Point]</i>

375
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,000
Champion, you are doing well.

376
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,480
Today you're going to sit in your wheelchair

377
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,280
and race with everyone else.

378
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,000
This collar

379
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,600
can report your health to us at any time.

380
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,800
Mr. Yan, Champion is fine.

381
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,620
Today our car will follow you the whole way.

382
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:55,560
Don't worry, we have
necessary medicines in the car

383
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,040
to prevent emergencies.

384
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,720
And we'll be with you

385
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,200
on the last leg of the relay.

386
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,440
Thank you

387
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,880
for doing so much for Champion.

388
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,640
I'd like to say something to it
before the competition.

389
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,240
You used to run with me,

390
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,600
let me accompany you

391
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,840
to finish this last competition this time.

392
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,840
Are you ready?

393
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,200
Okay, I got it.

394
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,368
Ready.

It's Wen Jing's turn now.

410
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,120
Would you like some water, Mr. Yan?

411
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,688
No.

412
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,640
- I'll do it.
- It's fine.

413
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,640
I'll help you.

414
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,040
The slope ahead is too steep.

415
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,096
Let's do this together.

416
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,720
Be careful, we're going downhill, Mr. Yan.

417
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,680
- Okay.
- Be careful.

418
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,120
Champion, don't be afraid.

419
00:23:04,928 --> 00:23:05,952
Good work, brother.

420
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,120
- Well done!
- I'm exhausted.

421
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,920
Wen Jing, keep going!

422
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:31,680
Wen Jing, Tian Peilan is ahead, keep going!

423
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,472
Little train.

<i>♫ Only enough to accommodate me ♫</i>

425
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,360
We're running a marathon.

426

Hello, hello everyone!

427
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,600
Cheer them on.

428
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,000
Cheer them on.

429
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,080
We're running a marathon.

430
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:04,576
Good job, Champion.

431
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,912
Let's go.

432
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,480
I'll do it.

433
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,720
- You should rest in the car.
- Be careful.

Over here, Tian.

440
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,464
Tian.

441
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,960
Good work.

442
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,140
You're the best.

443
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:43,440
Keep going.

444
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,584
Mr. Yan, have a drink of water.

445
00:24:47,584 --> 00:24:48,704
Okay, thank you.

446
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,520
Aunt, I really envy you that you have water.

00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,920
Mr. Chen is getting slower.

451
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,880
He helped my aunt run a kilometer more.

452
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,520
So he has to run five kilometers in total.

453
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,760
He is the one running the most among us.

454
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,920
How many kilometers has he run now?

455
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,032
Not even four kilometers yet.

456
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,800
I don't think he can do it at his age.

457
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,880
What did you say?

458
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,040
Y-You are this young,

459
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:36,280
and you ran yourself out, didn't you?

460
00:25:39,136 --> 00:25:40,200
You did a good job in running.

461
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,216
Just shut up.

462
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,800
This is the last leg.

463
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,240
This is not going to work.

464
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,600
Stop. I'll replace him.

465
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,000
- Can you do it?
- Yes, I can.

466
00:25:57,376 --> 00:25:58,400
- I'll do it.
- Thank you.

467
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,520
You'd go rest.

468
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:03,040
Mr. Yan, you've worked hard. Keep going!

469
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,320
Champion, keep going!

470
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,000
Mr. Chen, good work.

471
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,340
- Good work.
- Have some water.

472
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:09,440
Hurry up.

473
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,240
- Are you okay?
- Hurry up, keep going!

474
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,304
I'm fine.

475
00:26:26,848 --> 00:26:28,040
Just so embarrassing.

476
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,680
As a grown man,

477
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,600
I feel embarrassing to let a girl run for me.

478
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,140
I don't think it's embarrassing.

479
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:35,680
You've been trying so hard, anyway.

480
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:39,200
I think you've already helped
Mr. Yan and Champion.

481
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,240
So, just try your best.

482
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,920
Mr. Yan, are you okay?

483
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:02,976
Yes.

484
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,740
Tian Tian.

485
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:08,840
- Tian Tian.
- Dr. Tian.

486
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,200
Tian Tian.

487
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,400
- How are you?
- I'm okay.

488
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,240
Are you okay?

489
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,520
- I'm okay.
- You go down first.

490
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,920
- You're bleeding.
- You need a sterilization.

491
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,280
Can you still run like this?

492
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,520
Definitely not.

493
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,800
It's hard for her to even walk now.

494
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:28,160
No, you can't run anymore,
replace with someone else.

495
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,360
Dr. Tian, you are injured. Let's stop running.

496
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,160
No, you've all done your job,

497
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,480
we must persist.

498
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,288
You should stop.

499
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,112
I'll do it.

500
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,600
But your heart…

501
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,680
Don't worry, I'll take care of it.

502
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,840
Yuxian, bring Champion up here.

503
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,640
Cover it, beware of infection.

504
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,800
Help me check, don't press on her wound.

505
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,480
Come on, leash it.

506
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,520
- Let's go.
- Are you seated properly?

507
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,040
- Let's go.
- Okay.

508
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,680
Go.

509
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,680
Be careful.

510
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,392
What about the car?

511
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,760
Can't you drive?

512
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:25,480
- Me? Tian.
- Don't look at me.

513
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,740
I-I can't drive at all.

514
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:27,840
I'll do it.

515
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,320
I just got my driver's license.

516
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:33,360
Wen Jing, you've learned a lot of skills.

517
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,960
Skills will never be burden.

518
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,336
Hang on.

519
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,600
How is your heart?

520
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,620
Do you have any chest discomfort or uneasiness?

521
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:07,560
I'm fine. Don't worry.

522
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,640
Mr. Yan, try to keep up and be careful.

523
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,704
Okay.

524
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,760
Champion, hang in there.

525
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,280
We are about to reach the finish line.

526
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,560
- Champion.
- What's wrong?

527
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,128
Champion.

528
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,824
Champion.

529
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:48,832
I got it.

530
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,220
You want to accompany me

531
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:52,680
to finish this last run.

532
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,480
Let Champion go.

533
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:08,200
Let Champion accompany
Mr. Yan to finish the last run.

534
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,760
So many of us have worked so hard

535
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,600
just to fulfil Champion's last wish,

536
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,440
right?

537
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,368
Champion.

538
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,520
Mr. Yan.

539
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,560
Let Champion accompany you to the last run.

540
00:30:29,952 --> 00:30:31,104
Mr. Yan.

541
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,736
Thank you.

542
00:30:32,736 --> 00:30:34,600
Champion, keep going!

543
00:30:37,184 --> 00:30:38,240
Old mate.

544
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:39,872
Let's get going.

545
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,696
Let's go.
