Shen, you're being unfair.

27
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:44,120
Why didn't you tell me about this earlier?

28
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,880
What's the use of telling you in advance?

29
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,200
He will find out sooner or later.

30

Hurry up.

Why didn't you tell me in advance?

34
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:02,180
Mr. Shen, this is the business situation
of Xichong in recent times.

35
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,232
Please have a look.

36
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,840
I don't care about this.

37
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,560
What's the situation with Tianlin?

38
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,720
Right now, they're

39
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,280
hanging on by a thread.

40
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,900
Not only is there no business,

41
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,580
their old customers

42
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:22,280
have also all been lured over by Xichong.

43
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,400
In my opinion, they won't last much longer
before closing.

44
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,320
Don't give them a chance to breathe.

45
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,520
If we're going to strike,
let's finish them off completely.

46
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,688
Understood.

47
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,880
Thanks to your foresight.

48
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,280
With your support,

49
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,520
Xichong will definitely
have them in a tight grip.

50
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,320
If Tianlin doesn't become a pilot hospital,

51
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,300
I'm the chairman.

52
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,520
Your return is just a matter of time.

53
00:02:50,944 --> 00:02:53,440
Understood.
If there's any situation in Tianlin,

54
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,960
I will report to you at any time.

55
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,280
If there's nothing else, I'll take my leave.

56
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,760
By the way, Mr. Shen,

57
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,504
there's a situation
I think I should report to you.

58
00:03:05,504 --> 00:03:06,592
Speak.

59
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,640
Yesterday, I heard Liu Shi'an say

60
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,100
he saw your son, Shen Chen,

61
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,920
with people from Tianlin.

<i>[Tianlin Animal Hospital]</i>

63
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:22,100
About what has happened recently, do you

64
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,680
have anything to say?

65
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,640
If you don't have anything to say,

66
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,480
let me say a few words.

67
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,660
Actually, I think now Xichong

68
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:41,320
is indeed our biggest competitor.

69
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,440
Are they worthy?

70
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,140
Whether they are worthy or not
is another matter,

71
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,760
but we shouldn't deny our opponent's strength.

72
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,840
The reason why the opponent is strong

73
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,940
is that they have their advantages
that can't be overlooked.

74
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:56,320
We can learn from their experiences

75
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,160
and patiently wait for the opportunity.

76
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,920
So, what should we do?

77
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,280
Stay calm and do nothing.

78
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,140
What's up, Old Shen?

79
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:13,520
You urgently called me.

80
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,560
Is our family going bankrupt?

81
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:22,496
Stop right there.

82
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,560
Did I speak? You're just leaving.

83
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,620

pursuing gains, and avoiding harm.

85
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,320
What's human nature?

86
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,600
Let me tell you, human nature
is that a son can't harm his father.

87
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,320
But I didn't harm you.

88
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,440
Go on talking?

89
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,440
You know it all?

It's fine if you don't go to Lvchuan,

93
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,880
but you go to work in Tianlin.

94
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,500
Want to confront me, don't you?

95
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,680
Let me tell you,

96
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,000
you'd better explain it clearly today,

97
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,400
or I'll break your leg.

98
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,800
Old Shen, how could you
misunderstand me like this?

99
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,360
I am your own son.

100
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,440
Don't you know how hard

101
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:07,440
it is for me to be undercover in Tianlin?

102
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,840
Being called and shouted at
by Shen Mi every day,

103
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:09,960
being ordered around.

104
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,680
Do you know how painful it is those days?

105
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,840
I didn't tell you
because I didn't want you to worry.

106
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,120
Under… under what?

107
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,240
Surviving through tough trials,

108
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:21,020
like a man loyal to Han
but trapped in Cao's camp.

109
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,460
Don't give me that nonsense.

110
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:24,440
The two of you have been together
since childhood.

111
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,880
You think I would believe you
with just a few words?

112
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,640
Let me tell you, no matter what you do,

113
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,160
stay home today and don't go anywhere.

114
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:32,040
Okay then, I'll listen to you.

115
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,680
After all, you're my father.

116
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,000
I'll do whatever you say.

117
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,360
Don't you really think that
with just spending money

118
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:43,240
and Old Zhao's capability,
you could bring down Tianlin?

119
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,520
That's impossible.

120
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,480
What's your plan?

121
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,520
Tell me clearly.

122
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,880
You'd like to hear? Sit down.

123
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,240

126
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:04,980
discuss calmly and amiably?

127
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,640
If you want to hear,

128
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,840
I'll tell you.

129
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:12,920
I stand on this neutral, objective
and rational standpoint

130
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,960
and help you analyze the situation.

131
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,520
Hurry up and tell me.

132
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,432
Come on, look at this.

133
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,920
Shen Mi has been in charge of Tianlin

134
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,260
for nearly half a year now.

135
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:26,336
It only started
to turn a profit recently, right?

136
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,760
Do you think Shen Mi lacks money? He doesn't.

137
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,680
Does he lack management skills?
He doesn't, either.

138
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,520
He can handle the huge Lvchuan Group well.

139
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,840
How could he not handle a small hospital?

140
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,640
Why is that?

141
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,120
It's because your son

142
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,000
is sabotaging it.

143
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,960
Can't they see you sabotaging?

144
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,600
Your son is a top-tier gamer.

145
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,000
He uses misdirection.

146
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,280
Your son gives them false guidance.

147
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,800
Whatever is not profitable,
your son lets them do it.

148
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,160
Over time,

149
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,280
the hospital will simply go bankrupt.

150
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,520
That's when they have to give up

151
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,960
and that's when we achieve our goal.

Is it credible?

157
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:27,240
Of course. Who else would you trust
if not your own son?

158
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,360

00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,640
I want to ask you something.

181
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,080
When is the latest I could have this operation?

182
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,344
What did you say?

183
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,260
I mean,

184
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:46,760
how late can I delay this operation?

185
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,860
Sir, you can't delay this operation anymore.

186
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:53,900
It would be troublesome
if the disease gets worse.

187
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,200
Don't worry, we will arrange it
for you as soon as possible.

188
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,816
Okay.

189
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:05,560
Doctor, I'm not in a hurry.
Really, I'm in no hurry.

190
00:09:08,032 --> 00:09:09,984
<i>[Tianlin Animal Hospital]</i>

191
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,720
Today, when I came to work,
I passed by Xichong.

192
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,080
They had two big loudspeakers
at their entrance,

193
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,800
repeatedly broadcasting
their promotional slogans.

194
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,780
Let them. Someday we'll also put up
big speakers at the entrance.

195
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:23,000
Who's afraid of them?

196
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,280
But Shen Mi just said

197
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,200
that we needed to respond flexibly to changes
without changing ourselves.

198
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,920
You can't be led astray by them.

199
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,160
I'll play music, is that okay?

200
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,840
Where is your aunt?

201
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,460
She seems to be missing these past two days.

202
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:34,592
Don't you know?

203
00:09:34,592 --> 00:09:35,840
What happened?

204
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,880
Ever since we sent her to be a spy,

205
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,680
she's been running to Xichong
every two to three days.

206
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,600
She even got some kind of top-up card

207
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,980
and was given ten beauty services for free.

208
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:45,000
She almost took all the stray dogs and cats

209
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,660
from our store there.

210
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:48,840
It seems like your aunt doesn't trust
your beauty skills at all,

211
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,240
not one bit.

212
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,720
Peilan, this is your sixth time

213
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,720
coming to our place to get the dog

214
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,960
cleaned and groomed, isn't it?

215
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,880
Don't you have grooming services at your place?

216
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,440
How did you know?

217
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,760
Tianlin and Xichong are only one street apart.

218
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,360
Many of our customers

219
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,800
often talk about Tianlin.

220
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,880
They also mention you, Peilan.

221
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,720
They even talked about me?

222
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,960
What are they saying?

223
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,880
They say that your service is warm and patient

224
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,560
and you have a good grasp
of customer information.

225
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,640
They also say that the reason Tianlin
has been able to operate for so many years

226
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,960
and maintain such a good reputation

227
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,160
is all thanks to you, Peilan.

228
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,600
No, no, no, you're flattering me.

229
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,200
Actually, I know why you

230
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,520
keep coming around lately.

231
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,160
You want to find out
some information about us, right?

232
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,840
To be honest,

233
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:11,440
I'm not particularly in agreement

234
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,240
with our store's business policies

235
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,336
or those flashy things.

236
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,600
But Mr. Liu always tells us

237
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,600
to sincerely treat each customer,

238
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,440
to understand their every need

239
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,400
and to be as urgent as the customers.

240
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:26,700
We must uphold the sacred duty
of the hospital and the doctor.

241
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,760
We must never put making money first.

242
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,280
Actually, you don't need to worry.

243
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,560
Although Tianlin and Xichong are competitors,

244
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,240
competition leads to progress.

245
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,480
That's how we can get better.

246
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,200
Mu,

247
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,460
you really speak so well.

248
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:44,800
Progress together, improve together.

249
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,480
Uphold the duty of the hospital and the doctor.

250
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,360
Then the reputation of our profession

251
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,040
will get better and better.

252
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,760
This is really a good thing.

253
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,000
You're so right, Peilan.

254
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,160
Chatting with you is really comfortable.

255
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,160
It's like chatting with a dear sister.

256
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,480
Peilan, can I take you as my sister?

257
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,980
Yes, you can absolutely.

258
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,480
I'll definitely see you as my brother.

259
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,208
Peilan.

260
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,980
You are so pretty, right?

261
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:21,960
Mr. Chen, Mr. Chen, someone's coming.

262
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,104
Hello.

263
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:26,240
Hello, welcome to Tianlin Animal Hospital.

264
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,320
Auntie, how can I address you?

265
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,120
My surname is Ge.

266
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,480
Auntie Ge.

267
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,000
Auntie Ge, your dog is so cute.

268
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,080
What's its name?

269
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,440
Its name is Dafu.

270
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,840
Dafu. Does it need a vaccine

271
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,360
or beauty care or physical examination?

272
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,200
I want to

273
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,008
euthanize Dafu.

274
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,920
Dafu, don't blame me.

275
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,920
if it weren't for things coming to this pass,

276
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,480
I would not have done this.

277
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,760
In your next life, reincarnate well.

278
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,320
In your next life,

279
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,440
don't be a beast again.

280
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,360
This lady is quite strange.

281
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,240
She won't say what's wrong with the dog.

282
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,260
She just wants to euthanize the dog.

283
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:28,080
She said she had been to Xichong before.

284
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,520
They charge 2,000 yuan there.

285
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,200
She only came to us because she thought
it was expensive.

286
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,280
What did you say then?

287
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,280
I surely couldn't agree.

288
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,120
But she said

289
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,780
that if we didn't do it,
she would go to Xichong.

290
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,160
"If it's 2000, so be it."

291
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,880
She seems to be determined.

292
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,880
Okay, I got it.

293
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,496
Leave it to me.

294
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,280
Aunt Ge, hello.

295
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,600
Dafu, hello.

296
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,840
Hello.

297
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,160
Doctor, how did you discuss it?

298
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,280
Can it be done or not?

299
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,240
I'll do a simple check-up for Dafu first.

300
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,560
- Alright.
- Dafu, be good.

301
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,480
Let me see.

302
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,304
How is it?

303
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,600
Auntie, Dafu doesn't seem to be old.

304
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,760
Around six years old.

305
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,280
Right, around six years old, not yet seven.

306
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,740
I took a rough look.

307
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:30,200
Its limbs are healthy and not a lot of issues.

308
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,800
Its age is not very old.

309
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,200
Its emotional state seems great.

310
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,580
It doesn't look like it's seriously ill.

311
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:36,080
It isn't ill.

312
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,520
Then why insist on euthanizing it?

313
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,480
Auntie, people are not emotionless
like grass or trees,

314
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,720
especially since you've been together

315
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,560
for more than six years.

316
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,320
Six years are not short.

317
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,720
If you send it on its way,

318
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,360
Dafu should at least know
why it's dying, right?

319
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:09,320
My husband was diagnosed
with liver cancer half a year ago.

320
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,960
At first, we were conservatively treating it.

321
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,960
But the cancer cells grew rapidly.

322
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:18,680
In the end, he could only have surgery.

323
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,520
What does this have to do

324
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:25,320
with insisting on euthanizing Dafu?

325
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,380
Ever since my husband was hospitalized,

326
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:31,800
strange things often happen at home.

327
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,320
<i>You scared me to death, Dafu.</i>

328
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,480
<i>What are you doing? Go away!</i>

329
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,720
<i>You scared me to death, you Dafu.</i>

330
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,800
Auntie,

331
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,720
has Dafu been like this before?

332
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,920
Never.

333
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,500
But it seems

334
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,600
since my husband was hospitalized,
it's been like this.

335
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,160
Now I'm with it,

336
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,640
but I'm always living in extreme fear.

337
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,380
It affects my eating and sleeping.

338
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:17,920
Since you think it

339
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,000
has already affected your normal life,

340
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,160
why don't you tie it up

341
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,720
or lock it up during normal times?

342
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,720
This dog is very smart.

343
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,240
No matter where you tie it,

344
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,480
it can break free.

345
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,600
If it's like this, I can give it away.

346
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,760
It wouldn't have to be euthanized.

347
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,440
<i>Does this dog really just always stare at you?</i>

348
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:43,080
<i>I dare not tell Old Jiang about this.</i>

349
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,440
<i>I live in fear all the time.</i>

350
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,200
<i>I can only talk to you.</i>

351
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,120
<i>You did the right thing by telling me.</i>

352
00:16:50,816 --> 00:16:51,840
<i>What's wrong?</i>

353
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,180
<i>In our rural hometown,</i>

354
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:56,560
<i>do you know what we call these creatures</i>

355
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,824
<i>that stare at people?</i>

356
00:16:57,824 --> 00:16:58,920
<i>What is it?</i>

357
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,440
<i>Soul Fetcher.</i>

358
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,560
<i>Hong, don't joke around.</i>

359
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,960
<i>Really.</i>

360
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,380
<i>Look at your Old Jiang.</i>

361
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:06,599
<i>He was fine before.</i>

362
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,340
<i>Suddenly he became uncomfortable.</i>

363
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:10,440
<i>Then a medical checkup
revealed an illness, correct?</i>

364
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,040
<i>After it was done fetching your husband's soul,</i>

365
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,800
<i>next it's going to fetch yours.</i>

366
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,000
<i>Then, what should I do?</i>

367
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,480
<i>We must solve it.</i>

368
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:25,420
Auntie, this is completely feudal superstition.

369
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:28,100
You can't be influenced
by these groundless talks

370
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,960
or let Dafu lose its life.

371
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,160
Better believe its existence.

372
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,440
Dare not believe its nonexistence.

373
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,920
My husband will have his surgery in a few days.

374
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,160
If we keep it

375
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:40,280
and my husband can't make it
through the surgery,

376
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,280
who can be held responsible?

377
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,960
Anyway, I must end its life today,
no matter what.

378
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,760
If you, Tianlin, won't do it,
I will do it in Xichong.

379
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,280
Is not it just two thousand yuan?

380
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,520
I'd rather lose the money
for me and my husband's lives.

381
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,680
No, Auntie.

382
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,328
We'll do it.

383
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:00,992
We will help you do it.

384
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,180
- Remember to apply the medicine.
- Okay.

385
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:07,520
Bring the dog over for a medicinal bath
next Tuesday.

386
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,160
Okay, thank you, Dr. Chen.

387
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,304
You're welcome.

388
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,384
Let me walk you out.

389
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,168
Slow down.

390
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,000
Tian, where is your aunt?

391
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,020
She went to Xichong.

392
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,320
Why hasn't she come back yet?

393
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,056
I don't know.

394
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,620
Tian Yuxian,

395
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:33,080
take Goody back to the foster area.

396
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,280
Come on, Goody.

397
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,520
I will carry you there.

398
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:40,420
I thought the people across
had a great skill level.

399
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:41,520
What kind of cut is this?

400
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,920
Such smart hairstyle.

401
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,900
He didn't even trim the ears.

402
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,200
You know nothing.

403
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,000
This is called the air bangs, right?

404
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,660
- We have air bangs.
- Not to brag.

405
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,040
Even if I cut with scissors,

406
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,960
it'll be better than whatever Mu cut.

407
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,320
Tian, you are still too young.

408
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,600
Your aunt is not really into dogs.

409
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,120
Chen Yifan, you got smart in a short time.

410
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,480
You can even see this.

411
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,560
Haven't you noticed
that I've always been smart?

412
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,440
Don't you think
that after your trip to Xichong,

413
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,200
your complexion improved a lot?

414
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,000
I suspect it's Mu

415
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,420
took the chance to beautify you too

416
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:20,840
while grooming Goody.

417
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,040
Do I look good?

418
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,080
Don't forget

419
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,480
you have a mission to complete.

420
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,520
Chen Yifan,

421
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,248
are you itching?

422
00:19:29,248 --> 00:19:30,368
- What are you doing?
- You are itching, aren't you?

423
00:19:30,368 --> 00:19:31,640
- Please use your words, not your hands.
- Itching?

424
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,000
What are you doing? What are you doing?

425
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,640
I'll go change my clothes.

426
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,040
How about that?

427
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,120
Get ready now.

428
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,744
Bring the medicine.

429
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:08,400
Madam, this is rometomidine.

430
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,680
Injecting a large amount
of rometomidine into Dafu

431
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,480
can make Dafu

432
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,000
die peacefully and quietly
in numbness and sleep.

433
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,544
Chen Yifan.

434
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:24,040
Chen Yifan, have you and Tian Tian gone mad?

435
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,600
Why would you euthanize such a fine dog?

436
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,700
Old Tian, listen to me.

437
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,000
Can I explain later?

438
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,720
- Please step back
- What do you want to explain?

439
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,800
This is feudal superstition.

440
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,840
You're going mad with others?

441
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,712
- Let me see.
- Old Tian, what are you doing, Old Tian.

442
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:40,080
I am the doctor here.
It's not your place to talk. Out!

443
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,208
Get out.

444
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,232
Madam,

445
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,680
are you sure you want to give Dafu this shot?

446
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,400
Well…

447
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,504
Yes.

448
00:21:51,168 --> 00:21:55,008
<i>[Tianlin Animal Hospital]</i>

449
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:59,400
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

450
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,040
Aunt,

451
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:19,620
we'll take care of Dafu's body
later on for you.

452
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:21,440
If you're going to handle it,

453
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,520
is there an additional fee?

454
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,320
No.

455
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,800
Then please help me handle it.

456
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,520
Thanks.

457
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,340
Okay, I'll leave first.

458
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:33,440
Thanks.

459
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,200
Thank you.

460
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,744
Aunt.

461
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,744
Auntie.

462
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,400
Don't talk to me.

463
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,960
I've watched you grow up since you were a kid.

464
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,040
How did you become like this?

465
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,720
What if we don't do it?

466
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,240
They will go to Xichong to do it.

467
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,480
The outcome Dafu faced will still be the same.

468
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,880
A pet hospital will not give

469
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,720
a healthy pet euthanasia.

470
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,480
Aunt Ge came to our Tianlin

471
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,760
because Xichong's price was too high.

472
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,120
You can ask Old Chen or Wen
if you don't believe it.

473
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,200
They both heard it.

474
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,840
Anyway, I can't control what others do,

475
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,400
but you can't do this.

476
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,760
I've watched you grow up.

477
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,420
I don't want to be mistaken.

478
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:25,280
You've been kind-hearted since you were a kid.

479
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,760
How can you earn this kind of money

480
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,280
against your conscience?

481
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,600
You've watched me grow up since I was a kid.

482
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,960
I'm so kind-hearted.

483
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,440
How could I betray the organization?

484
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:38,592
Come with me.

485
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,460
What's the matter?

486
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:54,160
I gave it an anesthesia shot,

487
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,440
or how else could I have deceived you all?

488
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,880
What will we do afterwards?

489
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,880
Afterwards, let's just keep it first.

490
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,200
Come here.

491
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,760

492
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,840
Please visit again next time.

493
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,792
Refund it.

494
00:24:13,792 --> 00:24:14,920
Stop talking nonsense to me.

495
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,120
No matter what you say, it's no use.

496
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,280
Just refund this for me quickly.

497
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,640
Peilan, why do you
insist on refunding this card?

498
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,320
if there's anything we didn't do well,

499
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,912
we can specially change it for you.

500
00:24:22,912 --> 00:24:24,032
- Also, a lot of things…
- Stop.

501
00:24:24,032 --> 00:24:25,640
Stop talking, just refund it for me.

502
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,680
Don't talk to me about anything today.

503
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:29,620
- Peilan, this…
- Peilan, what's the matter?

504
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:30,680
what happened?

505
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,200
I feel like I'm such a fool.

506
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:35,320
I really believed
in that life first customer first crap

507
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:37,520
and about upholding the responsibilities
of the hospital and doctors.

508
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,560
Okay, stop it.

509
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,640
- You refund it.
- No, Peilan.

510
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,940
We may really not be able to refund this.

511
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,120
You're not refunding it, right?

512
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,280
Okay, then I will report you
to the Consumers' Association.

513
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,320
Peilan.

514
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,560
- Peilan.
- It's okay.

515
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,280
<i>[Xichong International]</i>
Peilan, what's really going on?

516
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,800
No, you listen to me, Peilan.

517
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,080
Can't you tell me

518
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,280
what exactly happened?

519
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,400
Okay.

520
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,880
Wasn't there an old lady who brought a dog

521
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,920
to your pet clinic for euthanasia today?

522
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,380
Her surname seems to be Ge, right?

523
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:11,880
She came, didn't she?

524
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,080
Then what else is there to talk about?

525
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,360
No.

526
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,600
We didn't do it, though.

527
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,200
You didn't do it
because she couldn't afford it.

528
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,840
If she could really put down the cash,

529
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,240
that dog would have died.

530
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,280
Peilan,

531
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:26,440
we all know the euthanasia on the market

532
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,180
usually costs just a few hundred yuan.

533
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:29,400
We quoted two thousand all at once.

534
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,072
Do you think it's normal?

535
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,920
Right, it's certainly not normal.

536
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,560
We knew that Mrs. Ge

537
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,260
was confused by feudal superstitions.

538
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:40,400
So, we deliberately quoted such a high price
to discourage her

539
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,400
from this idea.

540
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,780
Are you telling the truth or not?

541
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:47,880
Totally true.

542
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,760
How do you know about this?

543
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,960
Yes, how do I know about this?

544
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,140
Did Mrs. Ge

545
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:02,560
also go to your store to ask about it?

546
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,680
Did you guys…?

547
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,680
You…

548
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,560
Why would us? This healthy dog.

549
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,040
We wouldn't do it.

550
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,360
No, I'm asking

551
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,680
if Mrs. Ge asked

552
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,840
about your euthanasia price.

553
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,840
She should have asked.

554
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:18,912
You told her?

555
00:26:18,912 --> 00:26:20,420
No, I wasn't there at the time.

556
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:23,720
It might have been quoted
at a regular price, I guess.

557
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,520
Oh no. Oh no.

558
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,580
What do you mean?

559
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:30,300
Nothing has been done, anyway.

560
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:32,360
If Mrs. Ge knows that the price is not high,

561
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,660
she will go to another store.

562
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:35,840
The little dog may already…

563
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,920
Okay, don't panic.

564
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:40,960
Don't panic, Mu, it's okay.

565
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,160
Well, Dafu.

566
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,780
No, that little dog

567
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:46,080
might be still happily hopping around.

568
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,168
It's fine.

569
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,800
Peilan,

570
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,000
don't you know something?

571
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,500
Tell me quickly.

572
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:52,840
Tell me quickly. I'm really anxious.

573
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,040
I really don't want such a life

574
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,320
to end like this.

575
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:56,960
Peilan.

576
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,280
Peilan, please tell me.

577
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:01,200
Okay, such a brother of mine.

578
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,520
How can a young man like you
be so tender-hearted?

579
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:08,120
Alright, the dog is fine.

580
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,400
We didn't do it.

581
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,464
Really?

582
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,280
Yes, we took it in.

583
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:17,240
But we used

584
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,240
something else.

585
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,440
You know what?

586
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,800
It isn't dead yet.

587
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,120
Make sure to keep it secret.

588
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,040
You must never let this out.

589
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,400
Oh my mouth. This is something

590
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:36,720
I definitely shouldn't tell you.

591
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,040
I'll definitely keep a secret.

592
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:41,720
Alright, don't be upset, don't worry.

593
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,440
I'm going back to our store first.

594
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,560
- Don't worry.
- Okay.

595
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,800
I'm leaving first.

596
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,120
- Keep the secret.
- Go back, go back.

597
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,000
- Rest assured, Peilan.
- Alright.

598
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:10,160
What should we do with Auntie Ge and Dafu?

599
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,960
Auntie Ge doesn't even want Dafu's ashes.

600
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,560
As someone who has been keeping a dog
for six years,

601
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,080
she shouldn't do this, right?

602
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:19,780
So, their feelings are not that deep.

603
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:22,040
I think Dafu's real owner is someone else.

604
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,400
That makes sense, we need to find

605
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,660
the real owner quickly then.

606
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:27,720
Finding the owner is not
the most important thing right now.

607
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,240
So what is the most important thing?

608
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,200
The most important thing is

609
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,880
not to let Dafu stay in the hospital.

610
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,040
Otherwise, when there are too many people,

611
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,560
it will be difficult to settle matters

612
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,672
if any information leaks out.

613
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:50,720
<i>[Tianlin Animal Hospital]</i>

614
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,360
Give Dafu to me. This is fraud.

615
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,720
I will report you!

616
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,120
Auntie,

617
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,240
we euthanized it yesterday.

618
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,400
You saw it with your own eyes.

619
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,360
Living to see the dog, dying to see the body.

620
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,180
Where is the dog's body? Auntie, right?

621
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:07,960
Right, let me see Dafu.

622
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,640
Stop filming, the dog is already dead.

623
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,040
And it's been cremated.

624
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,760
Even if you cremated it,
there should be ashes, right?

625
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,920
Also, which pet funeral company

626
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,420
did you guys use?

627
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:20,860
Can't you just find it and check?

628
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:22,016
Yes.

629
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,320
Why are you…?

630
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,720
You come at the right time. Come on.

631
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,460
Auntie Ge, everyone,

632
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:32,380
this woman admitted herself

633
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:33,760
they used sedatives on Dafu,

634
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,100
not euthanized it.

635
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,600
I'm telling you, don't fight.

636
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,160
What are you doing?

637
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,240
Don't touch us.

638
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,340
Why would you?

639
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:44,352
Touch us.

640
00:29:45,184 --> 00:29:46,300
Touch us.

641
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:47,320
This is going too far.

642
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:49,400
Auntie, don't be afraid.

643
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,400
We, Xichong, will back you up.

644
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:55,160
Don't worry, today we have to get Dafu

645
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,800
out of this unscrupulous store.

646
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,080
I promise you, once Dafu is in Xichong,

647
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,260
I guarantee you will see it die.

648
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:03,260
Mr. Liu,

649
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:05,000
don't you know she was brainwashed

650
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,120
by feudal superstitious ideas?

651
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,440
She said that Dafu

652
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,120
was possessed by ghosts. Do you believe it?

653
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,160
I know.

654
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,800
Then why would you euthanize it?

655
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:15,040
The consistent principle of our Xichong

656
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,360
is not to ask why customers do it,

657
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:17,700
but to see what customers want to do.

658
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:20,040
We exist to meet the needs of customers.

659
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,240
- Well, thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

660
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,620
But you have to hurry up.

661
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:25,960
My husband is having surgery tomorrow.

662
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,460
I have to go to the hospital later.

663
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:28,560
Or it will be too late.

664
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:31,480
Auntie, stand back so you don't get hurt.

665
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,200
I'm telling you, today,

666
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,720
Dafu must be handed over to us.

667
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,920
Don't blame us for seizing it. I tell you.

668
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,320
- Just try it.
- What are you doing?

669
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,400
- I'll try to seize it in this way.
- Go ahead and try it.

670
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,560
- Don't touch me.
- What are you doing?

671
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,800
Let Dafu go with them.

672
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,740
At least you're wise.

673
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:05,240
Hurry up, protect it. Protect it.

674
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,200
Why let Dafu go with them?

675
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,040
They will kill it. It will die.

676
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,680
Once Dafu is sent to Xichong, it can't get out.

677
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,080
- Don't you know that?
- I know.

678
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,840
So now we must take action.

679
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,400
Old Chen, Tian Peilan, Tian Yuxian.

680
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,400
You must bring something to defend yourselves.

681
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,240
No matter what, Dafu must be protected.

682
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,480
Understood.

683
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:28,760
Go get the tools.

684
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,312
No.

685
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,360
Then why did you just let it go?

686
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,120
To buy time to save Dafu.

687
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,280
Aunt, just rest assured.

688
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:43,000
We will definitely do better than them, right?

You guys have gone through a lot of trouble.

690
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,920
You're welcome. This is what we should do.

691

Alright, thank you.

- We'll get to work then.

Okay.

00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,600
I still have to accompany you
through the operation.

723
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:55,600
You stay with me.

724
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:59,720
Did you leave Dafu by itself at home?

725
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,600
Food, water.

726
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,320
Did you provide enough?

727
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,140
Enough, enough.

728
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:07,540
Stop worrying.

729
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:09,679
Don't I even handle this little thing well?

730
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,432
How are you today?

731
00:34:19,136 --> 00:34:20,280
Pretty good.

732
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:23,320
Doctor, the nurse said today

733
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:25,620
my blood pressure was a bit high.

734
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:28,760
But everything else is fine.

735
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:29,856
Alright.

736
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:31,880
It's okay to have high blood pressure.

737
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:34,400
If want to eat anything lately,

738
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,660
eat more.

739
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:37,700
If you want to drink anything, drink more.

740
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:39,560
If you want to say something,
say it as soon as possible.

741
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Come with me.

742
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,360
It's okay, don't worry.

743
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,800
Just to understand the situation.

744
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,280
Nothing, everything's fine.

745
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:12,000
Uncle, do you know Dafu?

746
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:15,712
Dafu?

747
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,280
Who are you?

748
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,440
Doctor, doctor.

749
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,160
Why are you walking so fast?

750
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,800
I have big strides, Aunt.

751
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:33,920
You…

752
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,360
Stop walking, will you?

753
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:37,040
I can hardly catch my breath.

754
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,640
Then you should stop chasing.
I'm pretty tired as well.

755
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,360
No, no, doctor.

756
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:45,520
What exactly is wrong with Old Jiang?

757
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:50,000
There's nothing wrong with Old Jiang.

758
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,400
I'm worried, how can I not be?

759
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,520
- Uncle, listen to me first.
- No.

760
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,200
I have to go back and fetch Dafu home.

761
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,640
You should lie down first.

762
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,720
Uncle, Uncle, you should lie down first.

763
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:02,700
Trust me, our colleagues
will protect Dafu well.

764
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:03,720
Don't worry, okay?

765
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,120
You need to rest well now.

766
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,040
Uncle Jiang,

767
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,240
I heard Aunt Ge say

768
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,280
when Dafu was home alone,

769
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,780
its behavior was very strange.

770
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:19,280
So she suspected that Dafu
was the calamity star.

771
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:23,260
Nonsense, it's really nonsense.

772
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:25,480
My wife is good in all aspects.

773
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:27,160
She is only soft at the ears.

774
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:29,160
She believes whatever others say.

775
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,600
Uncle Jiang,

776
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:35,320
perhaps she was worried about your surgery.

777
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:37,720
So she has doubts

778
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:38,840
and was deceived.

779
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:41,320
I know she is worried about me.

780
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,380
When you were home.

781
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:45,520
was Dafu's behavior also strange?

782
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,360
Well, Dafu.

783
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,520
I made it do so.

784
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,752
What?

785
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:00,240
No, you rushed me out alone

786
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,580
in a hurry.

787
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:02,640
He'll have surgery tomorrow.

788
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:03,720
Isn't this scaring people?

789
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:05,160
I'm not scaring you.

790
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,200
I'm just communicating in advance

791
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,300
with the patient's family members.

792
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:10,320
Then learn more about the patient's condition

793
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,720
and tell the patient's family
not to be too nervous.

794
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:13,720
Keep a calm mind.

795
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:16,000
You should believe in the capabilities
of our hospital and doctors.

796
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,240
We will definitely

797
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,560
do the operation well.

798
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,200
There was no issue at all.

799
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,200
Now, with your fuss,

800
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,340
I'm feeling nervous.

801
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:26,368
Don't be nervous.

802
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,032
I'm even more nervous.

803
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:32,600
Doctor, how come I've never seen you before?

804
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,360
<i>No,</i>

805
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,480
<i>you definitely can't have seen me before.</i>

806
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,720
<i>Let me see how to cheat you.</i>

807
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:40,200
I just transferred to this hospital.

808
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,520
So I am not very familiar
with the environment of the hospital

809
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:44,400
or the patients.

810
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,480
That's why I need to communicate with you,

811
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,020
the patient's family, in advance.

812
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:50,440
Then tell me what is the last name
of the doctor in charge?

813
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,552
The surname is Wang.

814
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,960
Look at me, suspicious and doubtful.

815
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,440
- Yes.
- I'm sorry, doctor.

816
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,552
It's okay.

817
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,640
Embarrassing, isn't it?

818
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:07,080
It's really you guys from Tianlin
making mischief.

819
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,200
We're being naughty, Auntie.

820
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:09,920
Stop there.

821
00:38:12,192 --> 00:38:14,720
<i>[Xichong International Animal Hospital]</i>

822
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,240
I'm telling you guys.

823
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,660
Give up resistance.

824
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:19,480
Don't struggle in vain.

825
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,800
Put down what you have in your hands.

826
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,760
- Give me the dog!
- Daydreaming.

827
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:34,880
Absolutely not giving you.

828
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:38,160
Everyone, this heartless

829
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,960
animal hospital, Xichong,

830
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:42,040
insist on euthanizing

831
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,760
a clearly healthy dog.

832
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,520
Is their practice right?

833
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,600
Wrong.

834
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,320
- Is there any justice?
- No.

835
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,780
Should we report them?

836
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:50,980
Yes.

837
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:52,720
What are you standing there for?
Snatch it for me!

838
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,600
Go.

839
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,280
- Chase!
- What are you doing?

840
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:10,976
Chase!

841
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,320
Actually,

842
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,720
how worried am I?

843
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,380
At my age,

844
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:22,360
to have such a big surgery.

845
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:25,440
Can I survive this surgery?

846
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:27,936
Who can guarantee?

847
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,200
I'm not afraid of death.

848
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,460
If I'm not around,

849
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:34,000
how will

850
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,360
my wife survive?

851
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,940
My wife

852
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:41,440
is also old now.

853
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,640
Very forgetful.

854
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,800
Became rash in doing things all of a sudden.

855
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,160
Half a year ago,

856
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,120
she had a fall.

857
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,120
This situation

858
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,280
got a lot worse.

859
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,360
<i>Dafu,</i>

860
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,680
<i>why are you barking?</i>

861
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,496
<i>Darling.</i>

862
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:15,560
<i>Go turn off the water.</i>

863
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,740
<i>- This…
- Are you okay?</i>

864
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:20,880
<i>Are you okay? Come on.</i>

865
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,600
<i>- No, be gentle.
- Come on.</i>

866
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:28,140
Just forgetting to turn off the faucet?

867
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:29,720
Just forgot to turn off.

868
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:31,600
Besides,

869
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,360
it was not just once or twice.

870
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:39,440
She's always forgetful.

871
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:43,680
Either forgot to put salt in the dish,

872
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:50,080
or something got burnt.

873
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,560
<i>- The wok!
- Let me handle this.</i>

874
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,740
No matter what she's doing,

875
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:02,880
I need to be by her side to look after her.

876
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,520
<i>Where are you going, darling?</i>

877
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:11,840
<i>I'm going to use the restroom.</i>

878
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:13,800
<i>Wait for me, darling.</i>

879
00:41:14,464 --> 00:41:15,520
<i>What's up?</i>

880
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,600
<i>I'll go with you.</i>

881
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:21,880
<i>- Alright.
- Go ahead.</i>

882
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:25,760
<i>I've changed my mind. I won't go.</i>

883
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:27,840
<i>Seriously.</i>

884
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,880
<i>Go slow. Luckily, I'm here with you.</i>

885
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:35,880
<i>I'm really aging.</i>

886
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,440
You know, your Auntie Ge,

887
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,960
her sense of self-worth is very strong.

888
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:49,060
I had an argument with her about this before.

889
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:50,160
What about her?

890
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:53,480
She acted like
it was a life-or-death situation.

891
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:55,760
She said that I despised her.

892
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:58,780
So, ever since then,

893
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:00,960
no matter where she goes or what she does,

894
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,600
I try to be with her as much as possible.

895
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:05,620
Old couple.

896
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:06,760
Old couple.

897
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:11,840
We support each other.

898
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:13,920
That's what it means to have a companion.

899
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:17,520
But who would have thought that I'd be the one

900
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:20,000
to fall ill before her.

901
00:42:48,192 --> 00:42:51,712
<i>♫ Your gaze is unwavering ♫</i>

902
00:42:53,728 --> 00:42:58,272
<i>♫ Only enough to accommodate me ♫</i>

903
00:42:59,488 --> 00:43:04,160
<i>♫ I have been melted by you countless times ♫</i>

904
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:08,672
<i>♫ Yet I'm at a loss for what to do ♫</i>

905
00:43:10,624 --> 00:43:13,568
<i>♫ I can only hold on to you ♫</i>

906
00:43:15,648 --> 00:43:19,552
<i>♫ Now you are still with me ♫</i>

907
00:43:21,216 --> 00:43:25,472
<i>♫ Traveling through time together ♫</i>

908
00:43:27,328 --> 00:43:35,264
<i>♫ Someday, I'll be completely
forgotten by the world ♫</i>

909
00:43:35,264 --> 00:43:38,464
<i>♫ Leaving no trace ♫</i>

910
00:43:38,464 --> 00:43:42,496
<i>♫ Only you will still remember ♫</i>

911
00:43:44,256 --> 00:43:46,560
<i>♫ My appearance ♫</i>
