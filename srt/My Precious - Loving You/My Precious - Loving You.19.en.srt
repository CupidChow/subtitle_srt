<i>[Episode 19]</i>

26
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,600
Our hometown is in a small town on the coast.

27
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,440
At that time,

28
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:50,240
because his father and I divorced,

29
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,160
Tao couldn't accept it

30
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,600
and had the thought of committing suicide.

31
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,760
He thought there's nothing left

32
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,240
in the world to miss,

33
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,640
so he went to the seaside alone.

34
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,800
Just when he was about to end his life,

35
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,880
a puppy suddenly appeared.

36
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,200
It jumped into the sea,

37
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,920
grabbed Tao's clothes

38
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,920
and pulled him to the shore desperately.

39
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,520
When several local fishermen

40
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,880
saw this,

41
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,040
they worked together

42
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,920
to pull Tao back to the shore.

43
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,240
Was this dog Sunny?

44
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,540
Sunny

45
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:37,240
grew up on that beach.

46
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:42,800
It managed to fill its stomach
with leftover food

47
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,400
by some local fishermen.

48
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,160
Tao, who had a brush with death,

49
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,520
rekindled his hope for life

50
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,160
and decided to adopt the dog,

51
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,920
and named it Sunny.

52
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,960
What happened next?

53
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:04,920
Later,

54
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,760
due to my job transfer

55
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,840
and

56
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,360
the desire to improve
the learning environment for Tao,

57
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,600
we moved to Fu City.

58
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,240
But Tao didn't want to
leave the hometown. For this…

59
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,140
<i>Tao, hurry up.</i>

60
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:23,280
he argued with me many times.

61
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,560
<i>Why are you still hesitating?</i>

62
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,120
<i>Are you feeling unwell?</i>

63
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,160
<i>Let me check. You are fine.</i>

64
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,240
<i>Hurry up.</i>

65
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,800
<i>It's going to rain. Come on.</i>

66
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,136
<i>Let's go.</i>

67
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,960
<i>Tao,</i>

68
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,760
<i>when we move to a new home,</i>

69
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,240
<i>you'll have new classmates and</i>

70
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,480
<i>new friends.</i>

71
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,760
<i>Chris, support me in the rear.</i>

72
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,060
<i>Push forward.</i>

73
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:12,860
<i>Take protection.</i>

74
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:14,560
<i>You guys play.</i>

75
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,880
<i>Sunny.</i>

76
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,264
<i>Sunny.</i>

77
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,784
<i>What's wrong?</i>

78
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,520
<i>Do you miss home?</i>

79
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,440
<i>Let's go.</i>

80
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,560
<i>Let's go back to hometown</i>

81
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,480
<i>together sometime, okay?</i>

82
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,480
Since then,

83
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:53,000
Tao has been planning

84
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,160
to take Sunny back to hometown

85
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,280
and return to the beach where they met.

86
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:02,120
But I never agreed.

87
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,720
This matter

88
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,000
has dragged on for years.

89
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,000
As Tao graduated from college

90
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,760
and made some money from the game,

91
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,800
he made a new plan to
take Sunny back to hometown.

92
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,520
But

93
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,960
just as he was getting ready to leave,

94
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,600
an accident happened.

95
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,560
<i>Sunny, don't worry.</i>

96
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,960
<i>We'll be there soon.</i>

97
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,064
<i>Leave it to me.</i>

98
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,440
<i>Mr. Xing.</i>

99
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,520
<i>Mr. Xing.</i>

100
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,680
<i>Are you alright, Mr. Xing?</i>

101
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,320
It's not that I don't want to go back hometown.

102
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,080
I was so busy with work.

103
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,520
I just wanted

104
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,920
to arrange for him and Sunny

105
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,520
to go back hometown

106
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,600
when I'm done my work

107
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,520
and free.

108
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,056
But

109
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,640
we can't go back anymore.

110
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,560
I can no longer

111
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,160
help Xiao Tao fulfill his wish.

112
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,960
Xing Tao's last wish was to
take Sunny to see the sea.

113
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,680
So we must get ahead of time

114
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,860
to make his wish come true.

115
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:20,280
There is no sea in Fu City.

116
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,168
Longfu Mountain.

117
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,160
Longfu Mountain

118
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,760
is over four hours from here.

119
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,760
And there's no plane available.

120
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,320
What should we do?

121
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,220
Put down your legs.

122
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:38,260
Which one?

123
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,880
Both.

124
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,760
Then we'll use magic to make a sea for him.

125
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,240
Buddies, work hard.

126
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,840
Victory lies ahead.

127
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,740
There are five bags left.

128
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:59,100
Here, be careful.

129
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,640
Put it here. It is missing a part here.

130
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,800
Take it easy.

131
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,360
Hello, where do I put the fan?

132
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,120
One over there, another over there.

133
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,680
- Alright.
- Both sides.

134
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,960
Why do I feel like

135
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:14,360
we are missing something?

136
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,040
We are missing the smell of the sea, of course.

137
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,520
This is an organic compound,

138
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,120
synthesized from fragrances.

139
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,240
That's interesting.

140
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,320
It smells fishy and salty.

141
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,680
Mom,

142
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,040
you said to take me and Sunny to see the sea.

143
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,520
You wouldn't lie to me, right?

144
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,880
Of course not.

145
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,320
Why would I lie to you?

146
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,600
What is this for?

147
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,960
It's going to be a tough flight later.

148
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,840
You'll be there in a nap.

149
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,736
Be good.

150
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,160
I'm back.

151
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,400
I'm really back.

152
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,400
Tao.

153
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,160
I'm here.

154
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,560
Take it easy.

155
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,280
Tao.

156
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,920
You can't go any further.

157
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,320
The sea water is too cold

158
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,120
for you.

159
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,520
Where's Sunny?

160
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,680
Sunny is playing in the water.

161
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,240
Mom,

162
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,360
I'm a little tired and I want to sit down.

163
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,600
Okay.

164
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,520
Be careful.

165
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,400
Be careful.

166
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,424
Thank you.

167
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:09,632
Mom,

168
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,200
there's something I want to tell you.

169
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,720
Tao, I'm listening.

170
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,920
I know

171
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,360
I used to be so headstrong

172
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,800
that broke your heart

173
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,560
and failed your expectations.

174
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,680
Mom, do you know?

175
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,680
Mom, do you know?

176
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:38,200
We've moved so many times from childhood,

177
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,680
every time I just familiarized
myself with my surroundings

178
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,120
and made new friends,

179
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,320
I had to say goodbye to them.

180
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,600
You may probably

181
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,080
get used to how it feels.

182
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,880
<i>What's wrong? Are you feeling unwell?</i>

183
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,600
But I was just a kid.

184
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,160
<i>- Come on, let me check.</i>
- I felt upset.

185
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,840
<i>You are fine. Let's go.</i>

186
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,900
<i>It's going to rain.</i>

187
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,080
I know.

188
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,240
It's my fault.

189
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,840
Then I started playing games

190
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,480
and making friends on the Internet

191
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,360
for nothing else,

192
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,240
but because in the virtual world,

193
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,960
we…

194
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,880
we will not be separated

195
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:30,200
by the real distance.

196
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,600
I know. I know it.

197
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,800
Do you forgive me?

198
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,744
Mom,

199
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,000
is Sunny back yet?

200
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,280
Let me hold it.

201
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,400
Sunny is here.

202
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,200
Sunny.

203
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,640
Sunny.

204
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:23,902
<i>♫ Let's go home after a walk ♫</i>

205
00:14:25,878 --> 00:14:29,632
<i>♫ I'm playful like you ♫</i>

206
00:14:31,574 --> 00:14:35,965
<i>♫ The evening wind always sways the buds ♫</i>

207
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,480
Little guy,

208
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,600
you're not Sunny.

209
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,680
But no matter what,

210
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:48,600
thank you

211
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,920
for being with me in my last moments.

212
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,232
Mom.

213
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,800
Sunny is gone.

214
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,320
It doesn't smell anything like Sunny.

215
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:13,960
Thank you, mom.

216
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,912
Buddies.

217
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,440
You guys are here, too.

218
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,184
Tell me.

219
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,080
These seas,

220
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,120
sands,

221
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,280
and this warmth,

222
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,840
who made them for me?

223
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,240
W-We all made them together.

224
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,880
Thank you all.

225
00:15:49,408 --> 00:15:54,624
<i>♫ Someday, I'll be completely
forgotten by the world ♫</i>

226
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,920
Tao.

227
00:16:06,454 --> 00:16:08,942
<i>♫ My appearance ♫</i>

228
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,600
For the first time,
I experienced the impermanence of life.

229
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,720
Yes.

230
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,960
I didn't expect our meeting again
to be a farewell.

231
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,620
Bro, you need to hurry up
and confess to my sister.

232
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:49,160
Can you say something good?

233
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,080
I have confessed to your sister too,

234
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,840
but she didn't respond at all.

235
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,600
I can't just go up there
and put her on the ground

236
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,600
and say I love you.

237
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,880
That definitely won't work.

238
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,840
She would definitely think
you're a pervert and fire you.

239
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,000
Exactly.

240
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:08,120
Alright, don't be depressed.

241
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,440
Tonight, I'll take you to meet my parents.

242
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,408
Really?

243
00:17:13,408 --> 00:17:15,000
Really?

244
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,380
Of course.

245
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:17,560
You took me to Xing Tao.

246
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,200
I have to keep my promise.

247
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,200
Yes.

248
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,640
Besides, I don't want that poker face
to be my brother-in-law.

249
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,319
Of course, I will make a good brother-in-law.

250
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:25,640
Tian Yuxian.

251
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:27,800
How much longer will it take?

252
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,000
Immediately. What's going on?

253
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,280
Mr. Shen is holding a meeting.

254
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,280
You two hurry up.

255
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,840
Another meeting?

256
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,232
What is it about?

257
00:17:35,232 --> 00:17:37,040
<i>[Tianlin Animal Hospital]</i>

258
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,520
Miss Tian, everyone is here.

259
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,936
Let's start.

260
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,000
The topic of today's meeting

261
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,940
should be known to all of you.

262
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:45,080
Three months ago,

263
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,120
I made an agreement

264
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,540
with Mr. Shen.

265
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:50,240
We must achieve the performance standards,

266
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,560
which is to profit

267
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,080
within three months.

268
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,880
But yesterday was the last day of the deadline,

269
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,380
the hospital is still not profitable.

270
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:01,920
- So as agreed--
- So according to the original plan,

271
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,640
everyone but Miss Tian

272
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,120
has to be fired.

273
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,480
Mr. Shen,

274
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,600
I am responsible for everything,

275
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,720
so I can take full responsibility.

276
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,160
Because I'm the director
and top administrator of the hospital,

277
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,520
I can't escape the blame.

278
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,800
Please fire me.

279
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,416
You don't have to be fired.

280
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,600
Mr. Shen, fire me.

281
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,600
I'm disobedient to management

282
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,800
and undisciplined,

283
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,120
I'm the one holding us back.

284
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,320
Fire me.

285
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,540
Tian Tian,

286
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,840
Shen Chen,

287
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:46,960
Wen Jing,

288
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,380
Chen Yifan.

289
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:51,200
They are either doctors or nurses.

290
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,640
If you fire anyone of them,

291
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,560
it will be a loss

292
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,100
to the medical resources of our hospital.

293
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:58,100
Even if you go to hire someone else,

294
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,700
it may not be suitable.

295
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:02,280
And the beauty department

296
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,080
is managed by Tian Yuxian.

297
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,640
So among them,

298
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,480
I am the most dispensable

299
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,760
and useless one.

300
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,440
Mr. Shen, fire me.

301
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,780
I should have left last time.

302
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:16,400
Fire me.

303
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,260
The pet beautician is not like a doctor,

304
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:19,560
easy to find.

305
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,600
Dr. Shen.

306
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,000
Dr. Shen.

307
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,400
Everyone has just expressed

308
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,580
their thoughts and wishes.

309
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:37,360
Don't you have anything to say?

310
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,600
Of course, I have something to say.

311
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,860
Me?

312
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:43,600
I came here for Tian Tian.

313
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,920
If Tian Tian is here, I am here.

314
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:45,960
If Tian Tian is not here, I am not.

315
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,200
I go wherever she goes.

316
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,704
Right, Tian Tian?

317
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,380
What are you talking about?

318
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:53,720
Can you be serious, please?

319
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,760
I am serious.

320
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,800
Alright.

321
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:05,700
Now that you've all spoken your minds,

322
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,320
let me just say something quick.

323
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,240
Dr. Chen,

324
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,680
you just said

325
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14,280
that you are disobedient
to management and undisciplined.

326
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,120
You're right.

327
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,260
I agreed.

328
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:18,780
But there is one more thing,

329
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:21,880
you were able to stand up

330
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:22,880
and take full responsibility

331
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,280
when the hospital's reputation was damaged.

332
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,320
Honesty, your attitude

333
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,560
truly surprised me.

334
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,320
And Peilan.

335
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,240
You just said the hospital
made no difference with or without you.

336
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,080
That's not true.

337
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:42,600
You're a very important part of this hospital.

338
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,520
The hospital couldn't function without you.

339
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,180
Without you,

340
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:50,520
it's like losing half of our customers.

341
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,240
So we all know

342
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,680
your significance

343
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,960
and your hard work

344
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:56,960
by heart.

345
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,360
And Wen Jing,

346
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,440
you went to night college

347
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,900
to improve your professional level and ability.

348
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,160
For the hospital,

349
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,440
you've put in hard work and effort.

350
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,080
Honestly,

351
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,640
I am truly touched.

352
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,800
And Tian Yuxian,

353
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:20,360
I always thought you were a slacker

354
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,700
doing nothing

355
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,940
in the hospital.

356
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:25,220
But

357
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:26,760
in the case of Xing Tao,

358
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,040
you handled it really,

359
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,680
really well.

360
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,360
Thanks for your work.

361
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,688
Finally,

362
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,520
I would like to say

363
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,060
thank you to Miss Tian for taking three months

364
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:47,260
to show me

365
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:49,160
the real reason why Tianlin Hospital

366
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,760
still stands

367
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,960
after more than ten years.

368
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,200
But that's not the most important thing.

369
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:56,960
Thank you for letting me know

370
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,600
what you mean by human touch.

371
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,720
Well,

372
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,400
let's forget about

373
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,080
this whole firing thing.

374
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,432
Forget it.

375
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,440
But I wish

376
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:19,360
every one of us

377
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,080
can show

378
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,280
your best side,

379
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,600
making us and Tianlin Hospital

380
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,240
better together.

381
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,880
Alright?

382
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,160
Let's see how you do.

383
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,040
Mr. Shen.

384
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,720
You reviewed all of us,

385
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,280
why didn't you review Shen Chen?

386
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,360
Right! I forgot it.

387
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,600
But I have nothing to say about Dr. Shen.

388
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,920
He just said he would
go wherever Miss Tian goes.

389
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:53,360
Which means his mind
isn't on the hospital at all.

390
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,080
People like him who don't know how to pay

391
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,160
or realize his self-worth,

392
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,240
except chasing the Miss Tian in the hospital,

393
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,520
I guess he won't make any other contribution.

394
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,720
Mr. Shen, listen.

395
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,840
Rest assured, starting from today,

396
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,360
I will work hard and diligently.

397
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,400
Under your leadership

398
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,600
and my assistance,

399
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,840
we will make Tianlin Hospital

400
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,160
thrive

401
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,560
and great even more.

402
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,120
I hope your efforts pay off.

403
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,616
No problem.

404
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,720
Mr. Shen.

405
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,280
On behalf of all staff from Tianlin Hospital,

406
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,960
I'd like to thank you for your great mercy.

407

From now on, all of us

408
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,920

409
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,640
We will do whatever you say.

410
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,920
Alright, enough.

411
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,480
Stop your insincere compliments.

412
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,600
What? I swear by my heart.

413
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,480
Everything I said is true and sincere.

414
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,960
I will follow you forever.

415
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,680
Follow me forever?

416
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,200
I mean I will always follow your lead.

00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,960
to cooperate with your publicity work,

449

doesn't harm the company

00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,940

00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,360
is just taking advantage of your position?

Are you still pretending?

457
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,800
Didn't you ask Shen Hongyuan

458
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,580
to arrange this whole thing?

But I've already rejected.

Really?

463
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,440

Dad,

470
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,040
what do you think
if we launch the drug next month?

471
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:05,160
Did the clinical trial go through?

472
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,760
Are there any other issues?

473
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,000
No problem.

474
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,680
If there's any issue,
Dr. Gu would have mentioned it.

475
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,660
No other issues, then it's good.

476
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:14,760
Here is your tea.

477
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,600
There are no issues with the drug,

478
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,620
but there's a little

479
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:24,280
personnel problem right now.

480
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,360
What is it?

481
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,360
The legal department isn't cooperating with us.

482
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,880
Wait. What do you mean?

483
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,880
The PR department

484
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,160
wants Dr. Gu

485
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,760
to cooperate with the media before the launch.

486
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,160
But Mengnan

487
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,720
doesn't want to work with Dr. Gu.

488
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,260
This puts me in a dilemma.

489
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:47,648
Hongyuan.

490
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,960
Why do you want Mengnan to work with Dr. Gu?

491
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,560
Dad.

492
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,740
You don't know the media today.

493
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:02,660
They ask everything during interviews.

494
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:03,960
Dr. Gu

495
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,080
doesn't have much experience.

496
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,540
If he says anything wrong,

497
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:09,000
that's when we need someone
from legal department

498
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,260
to fix.

499
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:12,340
There are so many people
in the legal department,

500
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:14,400
why do you want Mengnan to be there?

501
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,040
She has so much to deal with,

502
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,600
no time for this.

503
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,920
Doesn't she?

504
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,760
I heard she's free.

505
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,360
She's the one who brought up the idea

506
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:28,200
of going with Dr. Gu to
the Animal Medicine Summit.

507
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,680
Really?

508
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,980
So I don't really get it now.

509
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:34,360
Look.

510
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:35,880
Dr. Gu asked

511
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,400
that Mengnan should work with him.

512
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:40,040
Mengnan also said to go to
the Animal Medicine Summit with Dr. Gu.

513
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:43,240
But now she says
she doesn't want to work with Dr. Gu.

514
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,240
Well,

515
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,080
isn't it like

516
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,720
they are falling in love?

517
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,640
Nonsense.

518
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,840
Make up some love stories.

519
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,680
So, Mr. Han,

520
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,520
I don't think we can understand

521
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,040
young people now.

522
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,480
We have to focus on the bigger picture.

523
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,200
Wait, what do you want to say?

524
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,640
Just say it out.

525
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,024
Enough.

526
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,560
Let's not talk about that.

527
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:34,640
Aunt, you're indeed meticulous.

528
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,160
You keep all the plants in the house.

529
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,640
Each grows so well.

530
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,640
The Christmas cactus

531
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,960
is very easy to keep.

532
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,660
It grows easily.

533
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:45,800
Just fill up with soil,

534
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,080
and loosen,

535
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:49,480
it blooms in a few days and looks great.

536
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:52,760
Yes, and the flower is purple-red, so pretty.

537
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,600
I remember

538
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,960
there used to be lavender…

539
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,360
Sorry, aunt.

540
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,760
This yard

541
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,160
used to be full of lavender.

542
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:24,000
That's your Uncle Hongyi's favorite flower.

543
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,760
I never want to see that again.

544
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,200
Aunt.

545
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,576
It's okay.

546
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,320
It's all over.

547
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,712
It's all in the past.

548
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,464
You are finally here.

549
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,760
What takes you so long?

550
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,960
Wait, you cheated and took the shortcuts.

551
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,160
You lost,

552
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,400
just admit it.

553
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,140
For three days,

554
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:16,920
you are not allowed to talk to Tian Tian.

555
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:19,800

557
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,528

You are back.

560
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,280
You cheated.

561
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,224
Aunt, you are chatting
with my sister-in-law, right?

562
00:31:32,224 --> 00:31:33,440
Don't talk nonsense.

563
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,600
It's the truth.

564
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,000
It's not nonsense.

565
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,840
You and Mengnan are close
since you were little,

566
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,360
anyone would say so.

567
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,360
Childhood sweethearts.

568
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:43,920
You think so,

569
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,640
maybe Shen Mi doesn't think so.

570
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,420
Shen Mi.

571
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:55,840
Mengnan is such a nice girl.

572
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:56,960
What are you not satisfied with?

573
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,320
Exactly, bro.

574
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:01,040
Look how pretty my sister-in-law looks.

575
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,400
I'm not criticizing you.

576
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,920
You are playing around.

577
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:07,080
- What do you mean?
- You are a playboy.

578
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,920
- Are you sick?
- Do you have medicine?

579
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:13,920
In his eyes,

580
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,800
I'm not as good as Dr. Tian.

581
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,360
Who is Dr. Tian?

582
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,648
Let me explain.

583
00:32:23,648 --> 00:32:24,900
Let me explain.

584
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:26,460
Dr. Tian is

585
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:27,840
his personal doctor,

586
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,640
who's always hanging around with my brother.
You have seen her.

587
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,072
I have seen her?

588
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,160
Who is Dr. Tian?

589
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,000
She is my personal doctor, mom.

590
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:44,760
Thank you for your hard work, aunt.

591
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,296
Let's eat.

592
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,200
If you dare to talk nonsense again,

593
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,880
I am telling you,

594
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:55,600
I will tell Tian Tian
what your true identity is.

595
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,040
What?

596
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:59,800
I promised not to talk
to Tian Tian for three days,

597
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,760
but not Han Mengnan.

598
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,280
And you won't

599
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,440
do such dirty tricks.

600
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,560
You're my brother.

601
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,080
Right?

602
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,024
No problem.

603
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,960
Your mom says you got a job.

604
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,440
Yes.

605
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:19,660
In what industry?

606
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:20,960
Where do you work?

607
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,280
Have a seat.

608
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:25,720
It's the animal pet industry.

609
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,560
The company provides excellent benefits,

610
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,800
with social insurance
and one housing fund and paid leave.

611
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:30,800
Enough.

612
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:35,480
Dad, just convince him.

613
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,200
He doesn't come to manage
our large corporation,

614
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,680
but to work at other place.

615
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,720
What is that crappy place?

616
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,800
Uncle, I don't think you're right about that.

617
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:46,040
If he really wants to improve,

618
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,720
whether it's in a small business,

619
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,000
or a large corporation,

620
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,360
he can get good development everywhere.

621
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,940
You are right.

622
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:56,080
Being in a large corporation

623
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,880
just gets me a headache.

624
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,160
Headache?

625
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,560
A talent like me

626
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,680
will shine everywhere.

627
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,140
Right, mom?

628
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:05,680
Enough.

629
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:12,380
But,

630
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:14,400
Grandpa, I still think Shen Chen

631
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:17,239
should go back to work at Lvchuan.

632
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:18,592
What's wrong with you?

633
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,152
I agree with that.

634
00:34:21,152 --> 00:34:22,239
I'm not going.

635
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:23,400
Uncle Han, say something.

636
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,512
Mengnan.

637
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,880
Are you busy with work?

638
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,000
No, Grandpa.

639
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,159
That's good.

640
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:33,920
Here's the thing.

641
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:36,600
The development of the new drug

642
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,120
is now in its final stages.

643
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:41,400
It's going public next month.

644
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,439
Yes.

645
00:34:42,439 --> 00:34:44,640
Since you're not busy,

646
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:47,280
could you cooperate

647
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:50,520
with Dr. Gu Mingze

648
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,719
to do publicity work from tomorrow?

649
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:01,160
What? Any problem?

650
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,360
No problem, Grandpa.

651
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,576
Good.

652
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,040
Alright.

653
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,320
Let's eat.

654
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,584
Come on.

655
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,420
Grandpa.

656
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:14,920
Shen Chen has been
particularly disobedient recently.

657
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,720
Why don't you freeze all his accounts?

658
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,000
Let me tell you, Shen Mi,

659
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,600
don't go too far. Today…

660
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,000
He drives that box every day.

661
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,120
The price of oil has gone up.

662
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,560
That's all. Take it and go.

663
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,920
Okay, rest assured.

664
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,200
Mengnan.

665
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,400
What is this?

666
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,680
This is the material of
next week's press conference

667
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,200
and video promotion.

668
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,200
From now on,

669
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,440
I'm in charge of all your publicity.

670
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,800
What you can say

671
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:56,960
and you can't say,

672
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,840
what you can do and you can't do,

673
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,600
which are all clearly stated on it.

674
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,280
Why did you suddenly agree?

675
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,000
This has nothing to do with you.

676
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,392
Where are you going?

677
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,640
I'm going to ask Mr. Shen
to withdraw his decision.

678
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,200
I hate to see you do anything
that makes you unhappy.

679
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,704
No need.

680
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,200
Didn't you teach me?

681
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:35,168
It's pretty useful.

682
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,600
So from today on,

683
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,200
would you please cooperate with my work?

684
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,840
Okay.

685
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,720
Work hard!

686
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,520
Keep it up!

687
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:48,280
Do it for the future of Tianlin.

688
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,100
Keep it up!

689
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,640
Alright, go back to your work.

690
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,320
Dr. Shen, wait.

691
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,840
I need to talk to you alone.

692
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:02,000
Don't take to heart

693
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,160
what Shen Mi told you yesterday.

694
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:04,280
You're the one I chose.

695
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,280
I still have faith in you.

696
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,240
What's wrong? Are you feeling unwell?

697
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,360
Do you have a sore throat?

698
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,160
Maybe you should take a day off.

699
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,000
No?

700
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,280
Good.

701
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,560
Never give up easily.

702
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,840
You have Tianlin's spirit.

703
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,000
Impressive.

704
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,120
Go for your work then.

705
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,960
I knew it's you.

706
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:44,600
Let me tell you.

707
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:47,400
I can't work if you don't cancel the bet.

708
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,480
Grandpa is here.

709
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,800
Shen Chen is here?

710
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,760
Come on in.

711
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,480
No, I'm a deliver man.

712
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,960
Grandpa, Shen Chen is here.

713
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:06,060
Mom, I'm on my way home now.

714
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:07,800
What are we going to eat tonight?

715
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,680
Braised pork.

716
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,880
Great, I like this dish.

717
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,600
We'll talk when I get there.

718
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,320
Mom, I have a call here.

719
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,560
I have to hang up.

720
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:27,160
<i>Tian Tian, where are you? Why aren't you here?</i>

721
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:28,880
Shen Mi.

722
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,280
What do you mean?

723
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,520
What's wrong?

724
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,280
Hurry up to come.

725
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,080
I-I've been waiting for you for a while.

726
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,240
I mean, we're supposed

727
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,640
to do our check-up every day.

728
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:51,800
Sir, I need to change the address.

729
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,160
Grandpa, she's busy today.

730
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,400
She mentioned it to me before.

731
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,400
It is

732
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,200
understandable.

733
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,680
You kid.

734
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,960
Don't talk to her like that.

735
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,040
Exactly.

736
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,440
I wonder if you could learn something from me.

737
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,400
To be gentle and nice.

738
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,840
Grandpa, right?

739
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,400
And you,

740
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,680
how's your work going?

741
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,600
What are you busy at?

742
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,840
I miss my brother. I came to check on him.

743
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,840
Didn't you meet yesterday?

744
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:33,160
It's already like we haven't seen for years.

745
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:35,080
- You're really disgusting
- I know you miss me too.

746
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,140
I saw him and I'm leaving.

747
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:38,360
Since you are here,

748
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,560
stay with me a little longer.

749
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:11,040
What's the rush?

750
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,520
It wasn't clear on the phone.

751
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,040
Grandpa is here.

752
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,560
I just got you some extra warfarin
at the drugstore.

753
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:18,840
I didn't even get it when you pushed me.

754
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,400
Mr. Shen.

755
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:28,200
Why did you come?

756
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,360
Come on, Dr. Tian. Please sit down.

757
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,800
Have a seat.

758
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:35,400
I happen to be handling something around here,

759
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,360
so I came to check on him.

760
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:40,100
Shen Mi's younger brother also came.

761
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:41,920
I figured you two haven't met,

762
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,560
so you can get to know each other.

763
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,960
You have a younger brother?

764
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,000
Where is he?

765
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:50,080
He's fine just now,

766
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,960
but suddenly had diarrhea.

767
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,440
Why haven't I heard you
mention your younger brother?

768
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:00,280
This younger brother

769
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:03,040
is such a loafer, likes to slack off.

770
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:05,480
He doesn't often go to work,

771
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,440
so he's no different than air.

772
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,560
Brat!

773
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:11,640
Hurry up!

774
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,000
Your younger brother?

775
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,040
What's his name?

776
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:21,960
His name…

777
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,200
My younger brother is called Shen…

778
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,200
Carlo.

779
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:27,120
Long time no see.

780
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:28,400
What are you doing out here?

781
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,600
Dr. Tian.

782
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:39,560
Check it out for Mr. Shen.

783
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:40,720
It's getting late.

784
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,112
Alright.

785
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,000
Dr. Tian,

786
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,320
do you

787
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:53,000
do this with your bare hands?

788
00:41:53,792 --> 00:41:54,960
Grandpa.

789
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:57,000
carrying the stethoscope and
heart rate monitor around all the time

790
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,600
is too much of a hassle.

791
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:01,040
Therefore, it is convenient
to occasionally use this way

792
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,120
of Chinese medicine to feel the pulse.

793
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,080
What about the blood pressure?

794
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:10,440
Don't you use a tool

795
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,080
to take blood pressure?

796
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:13,280
Grandpa.

797
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,000
Of course.

798
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:16,720
The last time we measured

799
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:17,960
was in my room.

800
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:19,640
The tools are all there.

801
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:20,960
Shall we go back

802
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,680
to the room to measure it?

803
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:23,840
Go.

804
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:27,000
Grandpa, we'd go take a blood pressure.

805
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,180
Young people

806
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:33,480
don't stick to trifles.

807
00:43:00,294 --> 00:43:03,814
<i>♫ Your gaze is unwavering ♫</i>

808
00:43:05,830 --> 00:43:10,374
<i>♫ Only enough to accommodate me ♫</i>

809
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:16,262
<i>♫ I have been melted by you countless times ♫</i>

810
00:43:17,222 --> 00:43:20,774
<i>♫ Yet I'm at a loss for what to do ♫</i>

811
00:43:22,726 --> 00:43:25,670
<i>♫ I can only hold on to you ♫</i>

812
00:43:27,750 --> 00:43:31,654
<i>♫ Now you are still with me ♫</i>

813
00:43:33,318 --> 00:43:37,574
<i>♫ Traveling through time together ♫</i>

814
00:43:39,430 --> 00:43:47,366
<i>♫ Someday, I'll be completely
forgotten by the world ♫</i>

815
00:43:47,366 --> 00:43:50,566
<i>♫ Leaving no trace ♫</i>

816
00:43:50,566 --> 00:43:54,598
<i>♫ Only you will still remember ♫</i>

817
00:43:56,358 --> 00:43:58,662
<i>♫ My appearance ♫</i>
