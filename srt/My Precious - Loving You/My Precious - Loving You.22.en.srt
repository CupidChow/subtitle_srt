00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,920
Our Tianlin has finally turned a profit.

183
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:24,992
How much?

184
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,680
Just a little bit of profit.

185
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,340
But that's not important.

186
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:30,960
This little bit

187
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,700
is the result of everyone's joint efforts.

188
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:37,120
It's what all our staff earned

189
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,480
through a hundred days and nights of toil.

190
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,760
This small step we are taking today

191
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,000
may, in the future, be a giant leap towards

192
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,240
making Tianlin

193
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,860
a leading company in the veterinary industry.

194
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,720
So, should we celebrate?

195
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,480
Yes, let's celebrate.

196
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,080
Hold on.

197
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,200
Before that,

198
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,000
this tiny profit we've made

199
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,840
is not enough to pay two months' salary
for the employees.

200
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,120
But we should still encourage everyone, right?

201
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,200
Where should we go to celebrate?

202
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:07,240
Dinner. There seems to be a buffet
that opened nearby.

203
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,540
- How about five hundred per person?
- Okay.

204
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:11,200
Okay my foot.

205
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,200
We only made that tiny profit.

206
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,880
A meal that costs three thousand?

207
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:14,920
Three thousand, seven people.

208
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,040
Five hundred, three thousand.

209
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,080
No problem, three thousand it is.

210
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,840
I will pay out of my pocket. I will cover it.

211
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,660
It's not your turn, the big boss is here.

212
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:26,600
So, shouldn't the boss
be treating us to dinner?

213
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,280
No. What do you mean? Why whenever
there is anything related to money,

214
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,840
it's the big boss who should step up?

215
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:33,480
Why me? I… I'm not a bummer here.

216
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:38,000
Don't, don't frown
every time money is brought up.

217
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,080
Right?

218
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:41,900
Well, how about this?

219
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:44,340
I know a place
where we don't have to spend money

220
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:46,960
and where we can increase our team cohesion.

221
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,720
- I agree.
- Right.

222
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,120
Dear gamer friends,

223
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:04,320
welcome to this special operation.

224
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,000
You are about to face

225
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,800
an extremely confidential and urgent mission.

226
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,120
Three days ago, a group of unidentified
armed individuals

227
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,440
occupied the Nine Dragon Walled City

228
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,200
and intended to carry out a terrorist attack.

229
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,080
Our rescue personnel
have already been dispatched

230
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,760
to the Nine Dragon Walled City
for the rescue operation.

231
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,160
But unfortunately…

232
00:16:24,384 --> 00:16:25,420
<i>The mission failed.</i>

233
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:27,960
<i>The mission failed.
I repeat, the mission failed.</i>

234
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,320
<i>An unknown biochemical weapon has leaked.</i>

235
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,720
<i>Everyone has been infected.</i>

236
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,680
This is the last information we received.

237
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,440
Because of the weapon leak,
in the Nine Dragon Walled City,

238
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,560
everyone

239
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,440
has been infected by the biochemical weapon

240
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,640
and turned into a zombie.

241
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,740
Zombies.

242
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:46,280
What's there to be scared of?

243
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,640
If they dare to mess with you,
I'll thrash them.

244
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,200
You can't, comrade,

245
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,360
assault our staff.

246
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,240
Tian Tian, if you get scared, hide behind me.

247
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,480
I'll protect you.

248
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,560
So, your final task is to find

249
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,800
the gene code to neutralize
the biological weapon.

250
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,760
This code is stored in a USB drive.

251
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,319
Find it and bring it out.

252
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:10,160
Then you will be able to achieve
the final victory of the mission.

253
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,480
This…

254
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:19,079
What is this?

255
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,079
This is your life.

256
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,920
Once your number tag in the game

257
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,359
is ripped off by a zombie,

258
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:28,359
it means you have been attacked by a zombie.

259
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:29,920
At this time, the zombies will

260
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,240
lock you up in the detention room.

261
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,820
You will be detained for ten minutes.

262
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:36,080
Only after ten minutes can you respawn
with full health.

263
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,120
Now please turn around.

264
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,168
Back to me.

265
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,360
- Number eight.
- Let's start. Nine means unity.

266
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,280
Okay, six means lucky.

267
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,520
The boss said

268
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,200
everyone who came today was familiar with us.

269
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,040
Appearing in person might raise suspicion.

270
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,520
Everything's arranged, right?

271
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,960
As long as the number nine tag

272
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,840
is ripped off by us,

273
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,960
he won't be appearing for the entire game.

274
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:20,060
Shen Mi, are you scared?

275
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:21,440
It's just a game.

276
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,760
What's there to be scared of?

277
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,400
So

278
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,080
you only have three things to do.

279
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,000
Survive, survive,

280
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,840
and survive.

281
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,640
Charge.

282
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:38,600
Go, let's go, let's go.

283
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,480
You look like a fool.

284
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,400
So, what do we do now?

285
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:53,980
Listen to me,

286
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:56,680
to save time and increase efficiency,

287
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,880
we need to split up.

288
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,600
Mr. Chen, you team up with Peilan.

289
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,080
You explore the bathing center.

290
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:03,080
You, you team up with Wen Jing.

291
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,120
Explore anywhere you want.

292
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,920
Well, Tian Tian,

293
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:10,240
I'll be your partner. I'll protect you.

294
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,600
The most important one

295
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,120
is our Mr. Shen.

296
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,040
He's so tall and strong,
he could be in a team by himself.

297
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:22,100
- Let's go then.
- No, I object.

298
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:24,200
From my experience watching horror movies,

299
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,440
we absolutely can't split up.

300
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,960
Split up and there will be troubles.

301
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,280
So, we should stick together.

302
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,160
- Let's go.
- Together then.

303
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:32,720
Go.

304
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:42,040
No, we can't just recklessly move forward.

305
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,680
What if a zombie suddenly shows up?

306
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,800
What should we do?

307
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,880
Don't be scared.

308
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,640
I'll protect you.

309
00:19:49,408 --> 00:19:50,520
Alright, you protect her.

310
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,920
I'll protect her.

311
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,480
- You should protect her well then.
- I'll definitely protect her.

312
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,800
We should keep moving forward.

313
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,888
How reckless!

314
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,220
Your shoelace is untied.

315
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,360
You scared me.

316
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,800
Miss Wen.

317
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,480
Get up and see if there's anything.

318
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,560
Nothing.

319
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,520
Okay, there's no clue here.

320
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,800
Stop looking.

321
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,600
How do you know?
You seem very familiar with this.

322
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:40,240
Because it's just a traditional escape room.

323
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,200
It definitely has nothing.

324
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,560
Let's move on, let's find another place.

325
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,200
Go.

326
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,200
Wait for me.

327
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:51,456
<i>[Nine Dragon Walled City, Mahjong]</i>

328
00:20:52,032 --> 00:20:52,928
<i>[Mahjong Parlor]</i>

329
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,320
<i>The zombies are closing in.</i>

330
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,340
<i>Attention, this is not a drill.</i>

331
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:21,080
<i>The zombies are closing in.</i>

332
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,940
<i>You only have two minutes to find the clues.</i>

333
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:25,980
<i>Countdown starts.</i>

334
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:28,640
Only two minutes left, what should we do?

335
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,640
Don't be scared.

336
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,760
I'll protect you.

337
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,520
Does anyone know how to play Mahjong?

338
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,640
This place needs a Mahjong tile.

339
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,640
Mahjong.

340
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,960
I know, I know.

341
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:39,960
One tile missing.

342
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,024
Try it.

343
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,040
Four tiles do not match.

344
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,040
This is a tile with flowers.

345
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,400
This is Cantonese Mahjong.

346
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,240
East wind wins, South, South wind wins.

347
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,920
One to nine of circles, West wind wins.

348
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,680
Eight of bamboos, North wind wins, West.

349
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:02,280
But which of these four
corresponds to which side?

350
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,960
<i>Countdown thirty seconds.</i>

351
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,760
<i>Twenty-nine.</i>

352
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,000
No time to think, just pick one.

353
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,288
Try it anyhow.

354
00:22:08,288 --> 00:22:09,312
South.

355
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:10,880
Try this one.

356
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,560
It's open.

357
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,240
There need to be three numbers on it.

358
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,520
Which three numbers?

359
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,760
There are a total of ten numbers.

360
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,560
We don't have enough time to try one by one.

361
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,960
Big three dragons, four quads, only honors.

362
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:33,400
Four hidden triples, self-drawn winning tile,
miraculous revival.

363
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:36,160
Melded wind triplet, prevailing wind triplet,
plus flower tiles.

364
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,120
Eighty-eight fan, sixty-four fan.

365
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,480
Eighty-eight fan, sixty-four fan.

366
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,620
Three three two.

367
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:44,280
Pair, three three two.

368
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,080
Three three two.

369
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,600
Three three two.

370
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,960
Open.

371
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,200
There must be clues we need here.

372
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,160
- Let's go.
- You can't see me, hurry.

373
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,496
Hurry.

374
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,680
They probably didn't follow.

375
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,760
Don't touch me.

376
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,360
Come on, nine means unity.

377
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,800
Six means lucky.

378
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:40,200
Okay, there's no clue here.

379
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,760
- Stop looking.
- How would you know?

380
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,520
You are acting as if you've been here before.

381
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,880
Nine means unity.

382
00:23:52,288 --> 00:23:53,320
- Let's go.
- What are you doing?

383
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,360
Go.

384
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,480
I can't, I'm looking for clues here.

385
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,520
- Why are we leaving?
- Follow me quickly.

386
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,920
Looking for the password.

387
00:23:58,920 --> 00:23:59,920
What are you doing?

388
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,740
Give it to me, give it to me.

389
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,580
Give it to me. Paste it on me.

390
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:04,720
Hurry up.

391
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,824
Here they come.

392
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,152
Hurry.

393
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,460
Which way should we go?

394
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:13,720
Never mind, let's go this way first.

395
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,040
Hurry up.

396
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,520
Found number nine, but it's upside down.

397
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,896
No, Bro, I'm going first.

398
00:24:24,896 --> 00:24:26,480
Got the wrong person, caught the wrong one.

399
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,320
There's a vent here.

400
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,440
There are also three buttons.

401
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,120
It must be related to this.

402
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,360
Let me try.

403
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,640
Another decryption.

404
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,040
- I only recognize the number, not the person.
- We have already caught number nine.

405
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,640
Just keep him there, you guys withdraw.

406
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,720
Withdraw.

407
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,728
Got the wrong one.

408
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,816
It matches, it matches.

409
00:25:02,624 --> 00:25:03,640
Open.

410
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,672
Let me go in and have a look first.

411
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,040
Follow me.

412
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,200
This is so long.

413
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,920
- Did you find anything?
- No.

414
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:32,992
Let's split up and look.

415
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,768
Here.

416
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,600
Did you find any clues?

417
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,608
Won.

418
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,008
Won.

419
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,120
Finally, it's over.

420
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,480
Congratulations on completing the task.

421
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,040
Why are you one person short?

422
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:35,720
Open the door.

423
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,984
I know your boss. Open the door!

424
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,400
Pick up.

425
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,480
Come on.

426
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,400
Smile a little, okay.

427
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,640
Come on, lean this way a bit.

428
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,120
Good, look at me, here.

429
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,140
Dr. Gu, you worked hard today,
that's it for now.

430
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:18,360
Hard work, hard work.

431
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,120
Come on.

432
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,864
Mengnan.

433
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:30,480
Where have you been?

434
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,080
Mr. Shen just called me.

435
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,360
Added an interview at the last minute.

436
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:36,140
Change into a suit, we're leaving immediately.

437
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:37,184
Last minute?

438
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,160
Please, check this out.

439
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,240
The host will ask you
about the new drug's release date.

440
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,840
You can just answer according to this document.

441
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,520
Scheduled for next week.

442
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,240
Any question?

443
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,880
Can I not go to this interview?

444
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,752
Why?

445
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,980
The matter in between is quite complicated.

446
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:58,280
Could you contact them?

447
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,400
- Tell them we…
- Gu Mingze.

448
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,480
As an employee of Lvchuan,

449
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,120
you have the responsibility and obligation.

450
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,560
Please remember at all times

451
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,240
that there is no room for bargaining at work.

452
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,400
What happened to you today?

453
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:15,340
I'm just doing my job.

454
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:17,360
I also hope that you won't act impulsively.

455
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,280
I thought

456
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,120
after that night,
we could understand each other better.

457
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,160
Gu Mingze,

458
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,880
I've told you not to bring up this issue.

459
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,300
There's nothing.

460
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:31,760
Nothing happened.

461
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,400
Don't have any fantasies.

462
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,920
We can't even be considered friends.

463
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,160
We will only ever be work relations.

464
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:42,944
Do you understand?

465
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,216
I understand.

466
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,416
I know.

467
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:39,320
Okay, if there's nothing else,
I'll hang up first.

468
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,728
Sit down.

469
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,880
Mr. Shen, may I ask a bold question?

470
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,720
Did you get Professor Guo's patent?

471
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,520
I didn't get it,

472
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,200
but I've tried my best.

473
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,760
This man simply doesn't want
to cooperate with Lvchuan Group.

474
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,400
Since the patent isn't obtained,

475
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,840
there is a serious problem
with the targeted drug.

476
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,120
I hope you will honor your promise

477
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,400
and postpone the new drug's launch time.

478
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,320
Then you can talk
about the patent transfer issue

479
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,760
with Professor Guo.

480
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,000
Since the new drug is genuinely effective,

481
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,240
there's no need to waste time on minor details.

482
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,640
This is not a minor detail.

483
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,800
This concerns the quality of life
of animals in the future.

484
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,240
Mr. Shen, do you understand?

485
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,520
It appears that you're the one who doesn't.

486
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:32,480
The national media is tracking and reporting
on this new drug.

487
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,940
Lvchuan's stock is hitting the daily limit
every day.

488
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:37,440
It is supposed to be listed
on the day of the press conference.

489
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:40,680
Everyone is paying attention
to the new drug, Lvchuan, and me.

490
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,640
I won't allow any mishaps with this project.

491
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,816
So,

492
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:54,200
all this talk of charity and public welfare

493
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,720
is just a facade for luring me into the game.

494
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:00,640
I am merely a pawn

495
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,800
in your power play to bring down Shen Mi.

496
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:07,680
Yes, yes, I was too naive.

497
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,560
Young man, you've never run a business.

498
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,360
You've never considered the overall situation.

499
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:32,080
I admit, all this talk of charity,

500
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,760
for businesses, is a facade.

501
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,800
It's always been a facade.

502
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,480
But I didn't lie to you, did I?

503
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,620
Doesn't the new drug work for animals?

504
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:42,800
If there are issues or flaws,

505
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:45,580
we can slowly resolve them
after marketing, right?

506
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:48,240
These issues shouldn't affect
the progression of the group, should they?

507
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:50,784
Dr. Gu,

508
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,400
if you're not happy,

509
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,580
after the new drug launch,

510
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,920
I'll give you a break, okay?

511
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,880
No need for you to worry anymore.

512
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,120
I've decided to resign.

Everyone, halt your work.

515

I've got an announcement.

516
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,400
Starting from today,

517
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,880
the new drug development

518
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,520
will be led by Dr. Ren Fei.

519

You can report any related matters to him.

520
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,720
Understood?

521
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:45,952
Get back to work.

522
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,360
- Ren Fei.
- Mr. Shen.

523
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:53,080
The press conference will be held next week.

524
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,920
All the board members
and shareholders will be there.

525
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:57,480
You're supposed to speak.
Do you have confidence?

526
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,200
Absolutely, I do.

527
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,640
Mr. Shen, rest assured.

528
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,080
I'll certainly work hard.

529
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,600

00:33:04,448 --> 00:33:05,480
Okay.

531
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,160
- I'll go back to work now.
- Okay.

532
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,024
Mr. Shen,

533
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:14,120
why suddenly halt all the promotional work?

534
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:17,520
Please come to my office.

535
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,120
Why did Gu Mingze resign?

536
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:34,440
He said he's no longer suitable
for research and development work.

537
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,360
As for whether there are other reasons,

538
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,600
I don't know.

00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,040
Do you understand?

547
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,680
This Dr. Gu is such a man.

548
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,280
He left without finishing his work.

549
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,440
It really puts me in a difficult position.

550
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,608
I'm leaving.

551
00:34:17,344 --> 00:34:20,000
<i>[Han Mengnan]</i>

552
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:23,232
You won't answer the phone?

553
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,320
Hello, the number you dialed…

554
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,920
Dr. Gu,

555
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,240
why are you seeing me this time?

556
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,880
Do you still remember

557
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,000
what we talked about last time at Lvchuan?

558
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,440
You're not going to interfere
with my private life again, are you?

559
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,960
It's not personal this time.

560
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,840
What are you doing?

561
00:35:07,744 --> 00:35:08,760
What's wrong?

562
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:11,960
That person from Lvchuan, that…

563
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,240
Gu something is here.

564
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:15,320
Why didn't my senior tell me when he came?

565
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,600
Come back.

566
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,760
He didn't come to see you.

567
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,000
It's definitely not related to you.

568
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,640
They're discussing
the affairs of Lvchuan Group.

569
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,400
How does discussing
Lvchuan affairs relate to you?

570
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,400
Of course,

571
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,408
it doesn't.

572
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,360
So why are you eavesdropping?

573
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,120
I also want to listen in.

574
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,232
Let's listen together.

575
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:40,560
I'm afraid I can't help you with this issue.

576
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:44,320
You know that I'm no longer
in charge of the R&D department.

577
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:48,180
So just let the new drug be put on the market
without considering the consequences?

578
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:49,880
What if problems arise?

579
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,560
I understand your concern.

580
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:56,480
If you can provide conclusive evidence

581
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,720
that Shen Hongyuan knowingly
tried to launch the new drug

582
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:01,520
despite its quality issues,

583
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:02,560
I can help you.

584
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,680
I can even call a board meeting right now.

585
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,360
Even if they disagree,

586
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,800
I can expose all of their illegal behaviors

587
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,520
through the media.

588
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:13,860
But we don't have any evidence right now.

589
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:15,320
We can't do this.

590
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,920
No evidence? Find a way!

591
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,800
Is there anything I can do to help you?

592
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,936
Just say it.

593
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,840
Professor Guo has a patent
for box jellyfish toxin

594
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,520
separation and inhibition techniques.

595
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,020
Professor Guo?

596
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:37,440
Sounds familiar.

597
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,720
He previously gave a speech as a guest speaker

598
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:41,680
at a medical forum on neurotoxin polypeptide

599
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,040
application techniques.

600
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,440
It was after hearing this lecture

601
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,560
that I was inspired by some ideas.

602
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,820
If I can get Professor Guo's patent,

603
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:52,880
I can minimize

604
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,320
the toxic side effects of targeted drugs.

605
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:57,180
Obtain Professor Guo's patent.

606
00:36:57,180 --> 00:37:00,520
Mr. Shen, isn't Lvchuan exactly
in need of this patent?

607
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,040
Can we negotiate

608
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,800
and buy this patented technology?

609
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:08,740
If money could solve this issue,

610
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:10,240
wouldn't we have resolved it much earlier?

611
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,000
But Professor Guo simply refuses
to sell the patent to Lvchuan.

612
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:19,800
So, I want to ask Mr. Shen
to utilize his connections

613
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,992
to postpone the press conference.

614
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:24,160
Postponing the press conference
is a big movement.

615
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:27,200
Wouldn't it alarm the chairman?

616
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,288
No.

617
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:30,640
Before this matter is hundred percent

618
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,160
settled,

619
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,680
no one can surpass their rank to report,

620
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:34,880
inclusive of me.

621
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,960
But we can't just not help my senior.

622
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,580
Mr. Shen, you'll have to take the trouble.

623
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:47,968
I'll find a way for the rest.

624
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,820
I have a plan.

625
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:53,040
Since money can't solve the issue,

626
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,000
it implies that the problem lies with people.

627
00:37:58,840 --> 00:37:59,936
Leave it to me.

628
00:38:15,488 --> 00:38:16,560
Where are you going?

629
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,760
To see Professor Guo.

630
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,440
- Where to find him?
- To his home.

631
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,600
Are you acquainted with him?

632
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,560
I attended his class in university.

633
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,440
Fortunately, I have a classmate
working in the administration there.

634
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,640
- Tian Tian.
- Zhou Li.

635
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:32,760
Are you at school?

636
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:33,840
Yeah. What's up?

637
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:34,860
Inviting me for a meal again?

638
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:36,280
No.

639
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,240
Can I ask for your help?

640
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,700
Alright. Send it to me later.

641
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:40,768
Okay.

642
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:44,800
What are you doing?

643
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,280
Wait for me, I'll go with you.

644
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,392
I'm changing my clothes now.

645
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,600
Then hurry up.

646
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:01,160
We've arrived.

647
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,200
It's here.

648
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:05,920
Are you dumb?

649
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,680
Think of a way!

650
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,400
- How do we get in?
- Fly. Fly.

651
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,640
Think of a way.

652
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,376
Climb.

653
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,560
Hold it steady.

654
00:39:42,784 --> 00:39:43,820
How is it?

655
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:45,220
There's nothing here.

656
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:46,680
It's been a long time since someone lived here.

657
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,660
Moreover, there's a noticeable trace of fire.

658
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:51,040
It's all burnt wood.

659
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:19,720
Look at its neck.

660
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:31,392
Call someone.

661
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,480
Are you alright?

662
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,600
Why do you put the net on me?

663
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:08,840
No. You're too slow.

664
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,220
What do you mean I'm slow?

665
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:11,232
Chase!

666
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:13,632
Hurry!

667
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:20,760
I'm here to save you.

668
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:22,240
- Don't bite me.
- What should we do?

669
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,328
Take it back to the hospital.

670
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:25,880
Let's go.

671
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:26,880
Take our belongings.

672
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:27,920
Hold it up.

673
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:30,040
One, two, three, go!

674
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,200
Slow down, slow down.

675
00:41:33,248 --> 00:41:36,480
<i>[Tianlin Animal Hospital]</i>

676
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,320
Clean the wound, at the same time.

677
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,400
Stay still, don't move.

678
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,520
Okay, hold it up a bit.

679
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:17,728
Tian Yuxian, shave the fur here.

680
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:24,040
- Be careful with the wound.
- Be a little gentle.

681
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:25,088
Don't worry.

682
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:31,840
This is so cruel.

683
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,600
This collar has worn into its flesh.

684
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:37,940
It must have been wearing it for a long time.

685
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:40,960
So we need to do a blood test quickly,
clean the wound, and treat the wound.

686
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,720
Then check if there are any other issues.
