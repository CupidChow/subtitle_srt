26
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,960
It's not that you've gained weight.

27
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,080
You are…

28
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,560
You are pregnant.

29
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,400
Congratulations! You're going to be a mother.

30
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,280
You insisted Shen Mi

31
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,440
is great,

32
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,340
responsible,

33
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,920
and accountable.

34
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,240
Look at what he did

35
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,660
to our daughter.

36
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:22,000
That's because your daughter likes him.

37
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,040
As her parents, we should--

38
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:26,200
We should supervise them

39
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,760
on key issues.

40
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,620
I have always said

41
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:31,080
that those big families

42
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,220
have complex interpersonal relationships.

43
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,680
Even if Tian Tian

44
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,200
marries Shen Mi,

45
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,760
who knows what will happen in the future?

46
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,320
We never

47
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,080
wanted their money.

48
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,680
We just wanted stability.

49
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,860
If

50
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,920
she were with Shen Chen,

51
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,320
there wouldn't be any issues in the future.

52
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,080
Yuxian,

53
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,120
do you think I am right?

54
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,680
Mom, actually,

55
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,320
Shen Chen is Shen Mi's cousin.

56
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,940
Oh my goodness!

57
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,240
Why can't we get away

58
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,000
from the Shen family?

59
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,320
No, Shen Chen

60
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,860
and Shen Mi are different.

61
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:22,800
What's the difference?

62
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,400
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">Sir, how can I assist you?</font></font></i>

63
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,960
I have some things to send tomorrow.

64
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,720
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">Okay.</font></font></i>

65
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,760
When can you be here?

66
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,120
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">What is the item you want to send?</font></font></i>

67
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,360
A screen.

68
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,752
A white one.

69
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:19,800
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">How about this screen?</font></font></i>

70
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,152
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">Isn't it artistic?</font></font></i>

74

75
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,840
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">A floor lamp.</font></font></i>

76
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,920
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">Wait, what are you doing?
I recognize all these.</font></font></i>

77
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,920
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">Yes,</font></font></i>

78
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,160
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">you recognize everything here.</font></font></i>

79
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,440

80
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,800

81
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,960
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">are clear at a glance.</font></font></i>

82
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,360
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">And do you know why?</font></font></i>

83
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,520
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">Because they--</font></font></i>

84
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,920
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">Look at the thing you bought.</font></font></i>

85
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,320
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">If you said it's an air conditioner filter,
I'd believe it.</font></font></i>

86
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,000
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">But I live in the living room,</font></font></i>

87
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">and you keep coming in and out.</font></font></i>

88
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,260
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">I have to ensure my privacy and safety.</font></font></i>

89
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:57,640
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">I'm not against you buying a screen.</font></font></i>

90
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,480
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">I just think</font></font></i>

91
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,280
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">that in such an environment,</font></font></i>

92
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,920
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">this thing appears particularly abrupt,</font></font></i>

93
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,380
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">strange,</font></font></i>

94
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,200
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">and ugly. And most importantly--</font></font></i>

95
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,320
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">It's beautiful.</font></font></i>

96
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,560
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">It's beyond your aesthetic comprehension.</font></font></i>

97
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,816
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">I like it.</font></font></i>

98
00:05:11,584 --> 00:05:12,760

99
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,880

100
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,560
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">This area is mine now.</font></font></i>

101
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,720
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">It's my sleeping area.</font></font></i>

102
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,920
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">Go to the other side of the screen,</font></font></i>

103
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,280
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">and then turn off the light for me.</font></font></i>

104
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,288
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">Good night.</font></font></i>

105
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,240
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">Aren't you going to sleep yet?</font></font></i>

106
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,200
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">Sir, is there anything else?</font></font></i>

107
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,680
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">Sir, are you listening?</font></font></i>

108
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,840
No need for now.

109
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,880
- Thank you.
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">- Okay. Goodbye.</font></font></i>

110
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,000
Mr. Han,

111
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,120
Mengnan has been staying
in the hotel these days.

112
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,760
Please take some time to visit her.

113
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,000
Mengnan…

114
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,640
I thought the thing I did years ago

115
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,160
could bring happiness to everyone.

116
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,120
But now it seems

117
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,880
that the fate of everyone involved

118
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,520
has been forced to change.

119
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,920
I should be the one to bear this karma,

120
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,560
but I didn't expect it to be borne

121
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,640
by you in such a way.

122
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,680
I hurt Mengnan,

123
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,760
and I owe you.

124
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,320
If this matter

125
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,840
costs you and her a lifetime of happiness,

126
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,240
I can never

127
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,400
forgive myself.

128
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,040
Forgive?

129
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,048
Mr. Han,

130
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,440
do you think a person like me

131
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,620
still has the right to talk about forgiveness?

132
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,640
What happened is not your fault.

133
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,400
It was an accident.

134
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,680
And I know that.

135
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,120
Even if everyone knows,

136
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,320
so what?

137
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,680
Shen Mi is already dead.

138
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,680
The person buried under that tree

139
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,280
should have been me.

140
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,848
My identity,

141
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,856
my wealth,

142
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,760
and my family

143
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,040
were never mine.

144
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,120
They were all given to me

145
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,960
by Shen Mi,

146
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,240
including my name.

147
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,160
Mengnan is absolutely right.

148
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,520
A person like me

149
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,568
is indeed

150
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,240
not worthy of happiness.

151
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,240
If my death can solve everything,

152
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,720
I would rather die now.

153
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
But to fulfill Shen Mi's wish,

154
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,400
I have to live.

155
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,560
Are you still investigating

156
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,760
the incident from back then?

157
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,440
I've already told you

158
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,600
to stop investigating.

159
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,528
Mr. Han,

160
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,920
my wedding is the day after tomorrow.

161
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,640
I still have a lot to prepare.

162
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,200
You should go home and rest early.

163
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,720
This place is too small,

164
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,120
and there are only a few tables.

165
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,800
It's the wedding of the future CEO
of the Shen family.

166
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,140
If word gets out,

167
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:55,400
how would people see us?

168
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,320
Who says he's the CEO?

169
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,392
It's not decided.

170
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,400
We can have a grand ceremony

171
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,860
when my son gets married.

172
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,160
The glory of the Shen family

173
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,640
lies upon us.

174
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,800
Father,

175
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,160
how's the investigation going?

176
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,160
Be patient.

177
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,200
What's true won't be fake,

178
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,400
and what's fake can't be true.

179
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,448
Wait a bit more.

180
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,580
What are you two talking about?

181
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,800
What's real, and what's fake?

182
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,008
Carlo, follow me.

183
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,140
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">Can you let Lvchuan get one more?</font></font></i>

184
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,840
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">- For who?
- For you.</font></font></i>

185
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,880
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">What have you been thinking about?</font></font></i>

186
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,320
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">I have been thinking about you.</font></font></i>

187
00:10:28,384 --> 00:10:29,560
Grandpa.

188
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,200
Shen Mi.

189
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,200
What brings you here?

190
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,000
You are

191
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,360
about to step into a new stage of life.

192
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,600
As your grandfather,

193
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,780
I have to see

194
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:45,280
if you're really ready.

195
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:46,960
Do you remember

196
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,560
that night I asked you

197
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,080
what the hardest thing in life was?

198
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,456
It's peace of mind.

199
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,280
Is your mind

200
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,480
at peace now?

201
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,480
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">Do what you want</font></font></i>

202
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,600
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">in your heart,</font></font></i>

203
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,040
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">and don't care about what others say.</font></font></i>

204
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,760
Grandpa,

205
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,400
I really can't find peace.

206
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,920
I have no way to make myself feel at peace now.

207
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,720
I can only believe that what I'm doing now

208
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,720
is the right choice.

209
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:54,960
Shen Mi,

210
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,840
actually,

211
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,760
in this world,

212
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,800
there is no such thing as absolute right.

213
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,880
At my age,

214
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,320
when you look back,

215
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,240
you'll know that,

216
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,920
actually,

217
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,560
no matter which path you choose to take,

218
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:17,480
you can reach the end.

219
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,560
So, Shen Mi,

220
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,120
for humans,

221
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,880
their own sincerity
is the most important thing.

222
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,040
If

223
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,360
you live to the point
where you lose your sincerity,

224
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,600
your life

225
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,160
would be too pitiful.

226
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,000
Tian Tian,

227
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,840
you're not thinking
about that man again, are you?

228
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,200
No.

229
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,440
I just can't get my spirits up.

230
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,760
The event is about to start.

231
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,080
You need to pull yourself together.

232
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,120
I know. You don't have to tell me.

233
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,680
Where are Aunt and Chen?

234
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,700
Weren't they here just now?

235
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,800
Yeah, where did they go?

236
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,760
Do you think Shen Mi did this on purpose?

237
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,360
- His weeding site is next to us.
- Outrageous.

238
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,960
Excuse me. Please show me your invitation.

239
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,040
The invitation?

240
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,960
I forgot to bring it.

241
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:11,080
How could you not bring the invitation
to such an important event?

242
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,480
Honey, I forgot.

243
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,680
You forgot? But it's okay.

244
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,800
We know the Shen family. Let's go.

245
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,120
Sorry, you can't enter without an invitation.

246
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:23,440
Bro, we and Mr. Shen are old acquaintances.

247
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,960
Please let us in.

248
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:27,480
- No.
- Right. And if we go back to get it now,

249
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,880
we won't make it.

250
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,120
We can't miss this big, happy event.

251
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,480
- Thank you.
- Exactly.

252
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,920
I really can't let you in, sir.

253
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,180
Miss Han,

254
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:53,600
you're the most beautiful bride

255
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,000
I've ever seen.

256
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,480
Yes, Miss Han, you are really classy.

257
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,380
Thank you.

258
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:01,120
I'm almost done here.

259
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,496
Do you have any other requests?

260
00:15:02,496 --> 00:15:03,760
No.

261
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,480
Then we'll wait for you outside.

262
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,680
If you have any other requests,

263
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:07,840
feel free to tell us.

264
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,200
We wish you a happy wedding.

265
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,816
Happy wedding!

266
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,312
Please come in.

267
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,080
Mengnan,

268
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,600
I want to ask you something.

269
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,560
Father,

270
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,600
go ahead.

271
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,040
Have you really made up your mind?

272
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,272
Father,

273
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,120
how do you think about my wedding dress?

274
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,880
In half an hour,

275
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,680
I will be holding your hand

276
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,560
and walking down the red carpet

277
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,360
under everyone's gaze.

278
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,840
Amid solemn and sacred music,

279
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,320
you will place my hand

280
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,440
into the groom's hand.

281
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,640
Then you'll watch us

282
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,760
walk towards the stage step by step,

283
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,800
complete the final ceremony,

284
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,560
and accept everyone's blessings.

285
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,800
It will be an exciting moment.

286
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,119
Father,

287
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:05,640
aren't you happy for me?

288
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,839
You just asked me

289
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:14,079
if I had made up my mind.

290
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,079
I can answer you now.

291
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,000
I had already made up my mind

292
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,680
20 years ago.

293
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:48,920
Father,

294
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51,040
why do you look a little unhappy?

295
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,920
No,

296
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,400
I am happy.

297
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,560
Mr. Shen?

298
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,672
Mr. Shen?

299
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,760
It seems that our groom

300
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:43,760
must have been stunned by the bride's elegant,

301
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,440
sacred temperament

302
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,360
and her graceful beauty.

303
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,400
Let's give him some warm applause

304
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,944
to encourage him.

305
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,080
They're about to take their vows inside.

306
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,960
If I don't go in and make a fuss,

307
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,720
I just feel like
the fire in my heart is smoldering.

308
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,440
Don't worry. Watch me.

309
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,440
Bro, the truth is…

310
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,000
Mr. Shen!

311
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,680
What are you doing?

312
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,920
Go! Go!

313
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,760
- Get her!
- Stop!

314
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,160
- Let go!
- I won't.

315
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,360
Alright. So next,

316
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,720
we will enter the most sacred part
of our ceremony, the vow-taking.

317
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,320
Mr. Shen Mi,

318
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,880
Miss Han Mengnan,

319
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,680
whether in health or sickness,

320
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,580
wealth or poverty,

321
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:26,280
whether in the ups and downs of life,

322
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,480
for the rest of your lives,
are you willing to--

323
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,760
Shen Mi!

324
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,640
Shen Mi,

325
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,800
you bastard!

326
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,080
You ungrateful thing!

327
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,480
How dare you stand here!

328
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,640
Shen Mi, you--

329
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,800
- You have failed her!
- Come down.

330
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,760
What's going on? Get her out quickly.

331
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,180
No, let go of me!

332
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:45,860
Shen Mi, how can you--

333
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:47,400
You've failed her!

334
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,160
- Let go of me! Don't touch me!
- Get out!

335
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,360
You scumbag! Let me go.

336
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,960
Shen Mi, you bastard!

337
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,080
What a scene!

338
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,760
Let me go! Shen Mi, you bastard!

339
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,080
Get out!

340
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,440
Let me go!

341
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,440
- Let go of me!
- Get out!

342
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,760
Let go!

343
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,800
Are you crazy? You bit me.

344
00:22:07,008 --> 00:22:08,200
- Ladies and gentlemen,
- Stop! Stop!

345
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,820
it's a little interlude.

346
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:12,920
I believe it will definitely not
stop our two newlyweds

347
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:15,160
from spending the rest of their lives
hand in hand

348
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,600
and being bathed in the river of love.

349
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,580
Miss! Miss!

350
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:35,720
Would you like a flower?

351
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,080
I also have babysbreath.

352
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,160
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">I think babysbreath is good.</font></font></i>

353
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,320
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">They are simple, pure, and beautiful.</font></font></i>

354
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">They don't compete for attention,</font></font></i>

355
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,320
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">always giving quietly.</font></font></i>

356
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,080
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">I think, in the future,</font></font></i>

357
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,400
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">our home</font></font></i>

358
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,600
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">should be filled with babysbreath.</font></font></i>

359
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:58,912
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">Is that okay?</font></font></i>

360
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,320
They are so beautiful.

361
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:17,520
But I don't want them. Thank you.

362
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,200
So, next, let's continue

363
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,440
with our vow-taking segment.

364
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:04,760
Mr. Shen Mi,

365
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,360
Miss Han Mengnan,

366
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,300
whether in health or sickness,

367
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:10,440
poverty or wealth,

368
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:13,100
whether in the ups and downs of life,

369
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:15,320
are you both willing

370
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,600
to spend the rest of your lives together

371
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:17,920
and to never leave nor forsake each other

372
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,040
until forever?

373
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,720
- I'm not willing.
- I'm not willing.

374
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,680
I'm not willing.

375
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,880
Pass the microphone to me.

376
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,680
I have a few words

377
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,120
that I want to say to Mr. Shen Mi

378
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,920
and all the guests present.

379
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,140
I'm sorry

380
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:36,720
to end a wedding ceremony

381
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,840
that's supposed to be festive, peaceful,

382
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,960
sacred, and moving in this way.

383
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,400
At the same time,

384
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,480
I also feel extremely sorry

385
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,680
for the trouble I caused

386
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,480
the friends and family present.

387
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,520
I've known Shen Mi since I was three years old.

388
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,000
Now,

389
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,560
more than 20 years have passed.

390
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,720
I still remember

391
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,600
the first time I saw him.

392
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,280
It was in a small noodle shop.

393
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,400
At that time, he wasn't as tall as me.

394
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:32,120
He was spinning around me,

395
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,560
making noise without stopping.

396
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,880
It was so annoying.

397
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,280
Later, because our families were close,

398
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,240
we would often see each other.

399
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,520
Being the same age,

400
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,040
we could always play together.

401
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,040
As we spent a long time together,

402
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,200
I gradually fell for him.

403
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,560
Even though he was still noisy,

404
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,500
he was really nice to me.

405
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,640
He would often prepare surprises for me.

406
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,040
I don't know when

407
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,880
I started to care about him,

408
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,240
miss him,

409
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,600
and feel upset and sad

410
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,520
when separated from him.

411
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,480
At that time, I didn't know
what my feelings were.

412
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,520
It might be love, or it might not.

413
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,960
But this doesn't matter.

414
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,520
What's important

415
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,560
is that he liked me,

416
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,680
and I liked him.

417
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,760
We wanted to be with each other

418
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,280
forever.

419
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,320
Things changed
when Shen Mi had an accident abroad.

420
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:48,040
We were forced to be apart for eight years.

421
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,080
Then everything changed.

422
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,160
Today, when I stand here with Shen Mi,

423
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,800
I still remember

424
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:03,920
all the beautiful moments we had together.

425
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,920
He clumsily played the ukulele for me.

426
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,560
He made a ring out of flowers for me.

427
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,960
He even vowed to marry me

428
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,560
and to be with me forever.

429
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:24,160
These are the memories
I cherish most in my life.

430
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,600
They won't be taken away by time,

431
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:29,200
and I will never forget them.

432
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,440
But time is really scary.

433
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,960
It can make memories blurry.

434
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,840
It can change many things

435
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,560
that I thought were certain

436
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,840
and beyond doubt.

437
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,800
It can also make a person

438
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,224
become another person.

439
00:29:07,063 --> 00:29:10,460
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">♫ Let's go home after a walk ♫</font></font></i>

440

441
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:18,520
So today, when I look at Mr. Shen Mi,

442
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,920
I clearly know

443
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,040
that even though it's still us,

444
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,560
we are no longer who we used to be.

445

448
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,560
Shen Mi,

449
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,600
I don't love you anymore.

450
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,960
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">♫ Now you are still with me ♫</font></font></i>

451
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,700
The vow to be together
for the rest of our lives

452
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:07,080
is not something I can say.

453
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,200
Nor can I fulfill it.

454
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:13,440
Thank you
for fulfilling my childhood obsession.

455
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,640
Today, I can finally

456
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,360
wear a wedding dress

457
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:21,920
and walk down the red carpet with you.

458
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,160
I have no regrets.

459
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,944
Thank you.

460
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,080
Thank you, Mengnan.

00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:56,280
I'm going to find my own happiness.

466
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,480
You must be well.

467
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,320
Goodbye.

468
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,312

What's going on with those two?

475
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,840
Young people

476
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,680
are always making drama in various ways.

477
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,520
Yuxian!

478
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:17,960
- Yuxian!
- Thank you.

479
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,680
Where is your sister?
I can't reach her on the phone.

480
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,160
Don't call me that, okay?

481
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,560
I'm not familiar with you.

482
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,200
If there weren't so many people here,

483
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,760
I really want to give you a punch
for my sister.

484
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,840
It's okay for you to beat me to death.

485
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,240
Just tell me where your sister is,

486
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,760
and I'll leave immediately, okay?

487
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:34,960
I don't know.

488
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,200
Even if I do, I won't tell you.

489
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,440
Yuxian, tell me where she is.

490
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,400
Don't touch me.

491
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,048
Yuxian!

493
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,640
Mr. Mi, Carlo…

494
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,040
Carlo is missing.

495
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,320
That lake is not bad.

496
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,360
Let's go there later to play.

497
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,960
The view is good.

498
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:33,760
Look, there's a dog.

499
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,720
Let's go.

500
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,320
Catch it.

501
00:33:42,432 --> 00:33:43,640
It's not a stray dog.

502
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:46,120
- The owner is not here.
- Look, it has a collar around its neck.

503
00:33:51,296 --> 00:33:52,540
Don't move.

504
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:53,640
You stupid dog.

505
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,600
You want to bite me?

506
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,080
If you are so good, pick it up yourself.

507
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,392
Let's go.

508
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:08,840
Carlo?

509
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,344
Oh no.

510
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:20,480
Carlo?

511
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:27,840
Carlo?

512
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,464
Carlo?

513
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,152
Carlo?

514
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,600
Carlo!

515
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:49,239
Carlo!

516
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:51,040
I'm coming right away.

517
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,464
Carlo!

518
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,768
Help!

519
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,560
Tian Tian!

520
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,840
Tian Tian, wake up.

521
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,320
Wake up!

522
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,440
It's okay. You are fine.

523
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,800
It's okay.

524
00:35:34,816 --> 00:35:36,000
It's okay.

525
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,480
Shen Mi, don't touch me.

526
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,160
Instead of marrying Han Mengnan,

527
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,720
why are you bothering me?

528
00:35:42,848 --> 00:35:43,880
Listen to me, Tian Tian.

529
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,240
Let me go.

530
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,360
There's no wedding.

531
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,040
I didn't marry Mengnan.

532
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,760
What about Miss Han?

533
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,992
Where is she?

534
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,040
Mengnan

535
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:11,400
should be going to find Dr. Gu now.

536
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,208
Tian Tian,

537
00:36:20,576 --> 00:36:21,800
could you listen to my explanation?

538
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,280
Let me go! Don't touch me!

539
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,840
Why are you stopping me?

540
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,960
Miss Han left, so you came to find me, huh?

541
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,360
I'm just a rag to you.

542
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,640
You can throw me away when you want.

543
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:31,880
Listen to me, okay?

544
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,360
Let me go!

545
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,280
You, a big liar, and this little liar

546
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,800
teamed up to lie to me.

547
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,720
Carlo wouldn't take off its collar on its own.

548
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:39,760
There must be another reason.

549
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:41,824
Did I ask you?

550
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,300
We have no relationship at all.

551
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:47,560
Keep those explanations

552
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:49,160
and tell them to your fiancée.

553
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,000
I won't leave you again.

554
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,560
Can you give me another chance?

555
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:14,240
It was you who broke up with me.

556
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:17,280
And now, it's you
who want to get back together.

557
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,760
Why can you come

558
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,200
and go as you please?

559
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,840
Did you ever ask about my feelings?

560
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,280
I'm sorry.

561
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,320
I'm so sorry.

562
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,760
I know I have

563
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,960
caused you a lot of pain in the past.

564
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,160
I also know

565
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,960
that no matter how I explain it to you now,

566
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:43,360
it can't make up for the pain I've caused you.

567
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,120
No matter how you want

568
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:46,880
to scold me now,

569
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,120
I can accept it.

570
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,200
I don't dare ask you to forgive me now.

571
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,040
I just want to ask you

572
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,160
to give me another chance.

573
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,700
Let us be together

574
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:02,400
and never separate again,

575
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,808
okay, Tian Tian?

576
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,640
Carlo seems to be in a bad state.

577
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,720
- Carlo? Carlo?
- Carlo?

578
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,040
Carlo?

579
00:38:24,288 --> 00:38:25,320
Carlo.

580
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,600
His heart is failing.

581
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,600
He needs immediate surgery.

582
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,240
Hurry.

583
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,456
Carlo!

What's the current situation with Carlo?

586
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,360
I'm already in the operating room.

587
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,720
What preparations need to be made?

588
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:49,160
I can't hear his left heart sound clearly.

589
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,360
He's having abdominal breathing.
It could be pneumothorax.

590
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,920
Prepare for surgery immediately. I'm on my way.

591
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,400
Okay, I'll prepare immediately.

592
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,680
Also, has Chen arrived yet?

593
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:59,000
Dr. Chen hasn't arrived yet.

594
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,040
Hurry. Contact him now.

595
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,400
Alright.

596
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:05,920
Hold on a little longer, Carlo.

597
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,120
Shen Mi, drive faster.

598
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:13,520
Hang in there, Carlo.

599
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,920
- Where is Chen?
- Chen…

600
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:20,960
Hurry up and prepare for surgery.

601
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,368
He needs surgery.

603
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:32,520
Officer,

604
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,720
look at my head.

605
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:35,720
Look at this bump.

606
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,680
This isn't even a minor injury?

607
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,720
The report is out.

608
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,560
It's useless to talk to me about this now.

609
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,600
It's not a big deal anyway.

610
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:47,000
You can negotiate on your own
about how to handle it.

611
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,720
Alright.

612
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:49,740
Let's handle it.

613
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:50,880
Officer,

614
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:53,280
how should we handle this?

615
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,360
First, you need to apologize to them.

616
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,920
Guys,

617
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:02,000
I'm really sorry.

618
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,360
I apologize to you all.

619
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,940
I was impulsive.

620
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:06,560
It won't happen again.

621
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:07,880
I'm so sorry.

622
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,240
Officer, do you think

623
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:14,440
this is okay?

624
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:16,980
Do you think apologizing is enough?

625
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:18,680
So, I… I…

626
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:19,980
took a beating for nothing?

627
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:21,760
Alright, how about this?

628
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:24,400
You can punch me here and here.

629
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,000
You can punch me twice.

630
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
That should vent your anger, right?

631
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,520
You…

632
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:29,600
Officer,

633
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,000
take a look at this.

634
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,200
What's with this attitude?

635
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,600
Sir, how about

636
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,680
I apologize to all of you

637
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:38,360
on his behalf?

638
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,480
We are really sorry.

639
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,560
I'm sorry.

640
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,760
How about this?

641
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,320
You can name a price.

642
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,760
And we'll settle this matter

643
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:53,160
within the range we can accept.

644
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:56,360
