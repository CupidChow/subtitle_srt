26
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,760
Feifei, it would be nice
to have another child in the house.

27
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:45,184
He could play with you,
and you wouldn't be so lonely.

28
00:01:45,184 --> 00:01:47,480
No, not at all.

30
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:58,120
Why did Tian Peilan send me so many messages?

31
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,280
What's wrong?

32
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,672
Dad and mom

33
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,040
only care about the baby now,

34
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,919
don't care about me at all.

35
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,680
They abandon Blue now,

36
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,528
next,

37
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,160
they are going to abandon me.

38
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,960
How is that possible?

39
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,928
No parent would abandon

40
00:02:20,928 --> 00:02:24,040
their own child, right?

41
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,600
You don't have children. How do you know?

42
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,528
Well…

43
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,960
It moves. It moves again.

44
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,656
What is it?

45
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,880
The baby inside me moves.

46
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,904
Baby.

47
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,016
Baby.

48
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,660
The baby moves?

49
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,400
What's wrong with him? Did he kick you?

50
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,880
He just kicked me.

51
00:02:58,752 --> 00:03:00,480
- Does it hurt?
- A little.

52
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,280
But it's the pain of happiness.

53
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,400
Feifei, get that pillow in the back.

54
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,280
Thank you.
It's more comfortable for her to lean on.

55
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,680
Uncle, you're really nice to me.

56
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,340
Of course, it's a must.

<i>He is willing to indulge your capriciousness.</i>

You still dance while pregnant?

61
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,600
When my mom was pregnant with my sister,

62
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,200
her legs swelled up and she could hardly walk.

63
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,200
I was trying to make you happy.

64
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,140
My back was aching and my legs hurt too.

65
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:40,960
Right, she did so to make you happy.

66
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,048
I give you a massage.

67
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,040
It's okay.

68
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,820
It doesn't even hurt when you're here.

69
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,600
Really? That's good, then.

70
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,920
<i>That pinch is killing me.</i>

71
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,440
<i>You fool.</i>

72
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:01,600
Feifei, look, we are also having a baby.

73
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,800
<i>Why do you always have to</i>

74
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,320
<i>drag me into something so childish?</i>

75
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,640
No matter what happens to him,

76
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,400
we will treat him well.

77
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,080
Right, honey?

78
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,860
Of course.

79
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,340
<i>Honey?</i>

80
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:18,280
<i>Whatever, if you say so.</i>

81
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:21,420
Feifei, even I have
a lot of children in the future,

82
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,920
my love for them stays the same,

83
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,360
so how would I ever abandon them?

84
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,480
But your mom and dad are ordinary people too,

85
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,720
they may be too busy

86
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,880
to care about you sometimes.

87
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,640
<i>Your honey thinks it makes sense.</i>

88
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,840

89
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,240
run a pet hospital.

90
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,200
You let me meet your parents,

91
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,800
and I'll convince them

92
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,040
not to send away Blue, okay?

93
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:48,280
Really? Don't you lie to me?

94
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,080
We are all adults.

95
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,400
Why do we lie to a child, right?

96
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,120
Who is it?

97
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,208
It's so late.

98
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,480
It could be my delivery.

99
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,360
Could you check for me, honey?

100
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,920
<i>Okay, honey.</i>

101
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,700
Alright, I-I'll go get it now.

102
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:11,800
I'll go get it now.

103
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,200
<i>Let's see.</i>

104
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,520
Tian Tian, it's me.

105
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,720
<i>Tian Peilan, why is she here?</i>

106
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,960
Is it a delivery?

107
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,792
Honey.

108
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,760
<i>What, honey?</i>

109
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,320
<i>Honey.</i>

110
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,160
I've sent so many messages
and you didn't respond,

111
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,520
I thought something bad happened to you.

112
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,880
What's going on?

113
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:10,240
We just ran into him downstairs,

114
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,480
thought he ran away from home,
so we brought him back.

115
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,280
I'm not asking about this.

116
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,880
I'm asking,

117
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,720
what's going on with honey thing?

118
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,640
When did you two start?

119
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,688
Well,

120
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,800
about two months ago.

121
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,320
Two months ago?

122
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,120
<i>Shen Mi, you are good.</i>

123
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,440
Didn't you just move here?

124
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,680
<i>Amazing, Tian Tian.</i>

125
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,160
<i>You really can keep a secret.</i>

126
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,600
Is your morning sickness very bad?

127
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,840
<i>You brat.</i>

128
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,020
Kid, wait.

129
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:05,020
I-I-I need you to repeat what you just said.

130
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:07,160
I asked her if the morning sickness is bad.

131
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,480
I remember my mom throwing up a lot

132
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,840
when she's pregnant with my sister.

133
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,008
Are you pregnant?

134
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,240
Keep it down.

135
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,520
I-I am pregnant

136
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,680
for two months.

137
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,696
What's wrong?

138
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:38,340
Nothing.

139
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:41,360
Is this aunt all right?

140
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,616
I am not an aunt. I'm fine.

141
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,480
I have something to do,

142
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,040
or I'll leave now.

143
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,640
- I'm going to go.
- I'll send you off.

144
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,160
- I'll send you off.
- No, no.

145
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,320
Just take good care of Tian Tian.

146
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,560
You two should be together.

147
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,048
<i>I'm leaving.</i>

148
00:08:02,048 --> 00:08:04,720
<i>Brother, sister-in-law,
our Tian Tian has found her Mr. Right.</i>

149
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,960
It's already late.

150
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,920
Feifei, you should go to sleep.

151
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,880
Yes, it's so late.

152
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,240
You should go to bed.

153
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,200
Well…

154
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,039
Why don't you…

155
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:47,640
No, you can sleep on our bed.

156
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,520
Then where do you sleep?

157
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:51,168
I…

158
00:08:51,168 --> 00:08:52,400
You don't need to worry about us.

159
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,560
We…

160
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,460
Y-You just need to take care of yourself.

161
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:56,960
Go brush your teeth then go to sleep.

162
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,240
No.

163
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,520
Why not?

164
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,360
You are pregnant,
so you can't sleep on the sofa.

165
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,680
My mom is pregnant,

166
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,360
and my dad is really careful.

167
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,480
He would always tuck pillows

168
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,760
under my mother's calves at night.

169
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,680
I'll just sleep on the sofa today.

170
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,760
Are you sure?

171
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,480
You two

172
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,880
go back to your rooms and sleep.

173
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,520
Then you'd get a good night's sleep.
Good night.

174
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,520
- Good night.
- You're so considerate.

175
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,096
Sister,

176
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,840
could you stay until I fall asleep?

177
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,400
Why? Are you scared?

178
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:36,000
You're a grown boy.

179
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,120
I-I'm not scared at all.

180
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,000
I-It's the first time I sleep out.

181
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,480
I can't fall asleep.

182
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,580
You can't fall asleep. I have a solution.

183
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,680
He'd read you a bedtime story

184
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,920
to get you to sleep, how's that?

185
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,800
I've grown up.

186
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,080
I don't need the bedtime story.

187
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,000
Why not? It's very interesting.

188
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,536
I want to hear it. Right, honey?

189
00:10:01,536 --> 00:10:02,560
<i>Honey.</i>

190
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,520
I don't care what you want to hear.

191
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,840
I can only tell Pinocchio.
Do you want to hear it?

192
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,680
That's too childish.

193
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,800
Can you change another one?

194
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,960
Why are you so demanding?

195
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,440
I only know Pinocchio. Take it or leave it.

196
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,000
- You can sleep by yourself.
- No, no.

197
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,680
We'd like to hear this one.

198
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,440
F-Fine.

199
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,640
Don't you want it?

200
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,960
Don't argue with a child.

201
00:10:34,144 --> 00:10:35,200
A long time ago,

202
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,280
there was an old man
named Gepetto living in a village.

203
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,920
Mr. Gepetto was a craftsman,

204
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,840
who could carve

205
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,920
all kinds of wooden puppets.

206
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:12,280
So, they lived happily ever after.

207
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,120
I'm done with the story. You'd handle the rest.

208
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,880
You're such a hypnotic storyteller.

209
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,400
Could you tell more in the future?

210
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,280
You are perfect today.

211
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,480
If he doesn't give me information
about his family tomorrow,

212
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,980
I'll call the police.

213
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:13,360
Don't.

214
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,200
I think Feifei might
have misunderstood his parents.

215
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,720
He seems like a good boy.

216
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,120
We'll talk to him tomorrow,

217
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,280
and I'm sure he would tell.

218
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:26,080
He's not like someone to

219
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,380
bully her younger brother.

220
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:30,160
Why do you say so?

221
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,840
W-What are you doing?

222
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,360
Go to bed now.

223
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,280
I…

224
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,800
Okay, thank you.

225
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,040
Why don't you sleep?

226
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,600
You too.

227
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,000
I saw you peeking at me,

228
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,920
are you planning something against me?

229
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,960
What?

230
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,440
I didn't.

231
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,740
I've been thinking,

232
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:11,400
it's been a long time,

233
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,480
and I haven't

234
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,880
really said thank you.

235
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:32,340
Thank you for helping Tianlin
when it was in trouble,

236
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:34,040
helping the hospital through the crisis,

237
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,640
and saving Tianlin's reputation.

238
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,400
Anything else?

239
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,920
And thank you for your dedication

240
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,840
to the management of our hospital.

241
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,976
Indeed,

242
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,920
for all of you,

243
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,480
I am truly worried.

244
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,520
I just said something nice about you,

245
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,360
why can't you say something good back?

246
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,128
Nothing else?

247
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,720
And you've helped me a lot,

248
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,080
making me a qualified director and operator.

249
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,760
To tell you the truth,

250
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,864
I think

251
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,520
you're still a long way

252
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,120
from being qualified,

253
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,160
need to work harder.

254
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:20,160
If you say that, then I stop talking.

255
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,000
Didn't you just say to thank you?

256
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,180
Why do you stop?

257
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:25,200
Anyway,

258
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,080
I am still a long way from being qualified.

259
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,760
So let's talk about it when I am qualified.

260
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,840
Good night, I'm going to sleep first.

261
00:16:21,952 --> 00:16:25,728
<i>[Tianlin Animal Hospital]</i>

262
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,640
Sister, are you sure

263
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,960
my parents won't send Blue away?

264
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,880
Don't worry. I will convince your parents.

265
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,552
Right?

266
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,344
Of course.

267
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,040
Mirror, mirror on the wall,

268
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:47,120
tell me who the most handsome man
in Tianlin Hospital is.

269
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,560
You don't have to say, I know it must be me.

270
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,200
Then tell me,

271
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,840
does Tian Tian like the handsome me,

272
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:57,240
or that sarcastic Shen Mi?

273
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,880
I also know it must be me.

274
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,640
Bro,

275
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,839
since you fell in love with my sister,

276
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:08,680
what's the matter with your intelligence?

277
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,240
Have you ever been in love?

278
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,800
Intelligence doesn't matter at all in love.

279
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,480
What's important is love.

280
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,760
Understand?

281
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:19,400
When you're in love,

282
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,740
- the resistance--
- Must be strong.

283
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:25,088
Like me, the more setbacks, the more courage.

284
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,060
Wait. Why are you sighing?

285
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:31,520
Just say it.

286
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,000
Something big happened.

287
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,712
What happened?

288
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,480
Feifei, you silly boy.

289
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,320
How could you run away from home?

290
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,280
You scared me to death, do you know?

291
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,160
Feifei, you go out with mom first.

292
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,600
Dad might have something to talk to them.

293
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,160
Shall we go to the car first?

294
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,568
- Be good, let's go.
- I'm not leaving.

295
00:17:53,568 --> 00:17:54,600
Come on.

296
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,920
Feifei, be good and go out with mom.

297
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Mom can't stay here for long.

298
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,080
I'm not leaving. You all
just want to abandon Blue.

299
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,440
I want Blue to be with me.

300
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,760
What's wrong with you?

301
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,120
- Come here.
- I'm not leaving.

302
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,280
I'm sorry

303
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,680
to cause you so much trouble.

304
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,744
It's okay.

305
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,240
Actually, Feifei

306
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,340
told me something about your family.

307
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:18,480
Maybe there's been a lot of misunderstanding.

308
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,800
In fact, whether there is
a pregnant woman or a baby at home,

309
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,000
you can still keep pets,

310
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,060
especially animals like cats and dogs.

311
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:27,120
Really?

312
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,128
Yes.

313
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,880
I gave Blue a checkup

314
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,000
and it is very healthy.

315
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,520
And your defenses against Toxoplasma

316
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,880
may have gone too far.

317
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,880
Actually, I gave Blue a checkup yesterday

318
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,540
and it's not infected with Toxoplasma.

319
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:40,120
And as long as you get it vaccinated,

320
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,240
don't feed it raw meat,

321
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,320
and minimizes its contact
with the outside world,

322
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:46,000
you can prevent problems with parasites.

323
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,096
Well…

324
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,500
- Look.
- Yes, look.

325
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,360
Did Blue get this thing

326
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:53,720
on my wife?

327
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,120
This isn't ringworm,

328
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,600
should be some ordinary dermatitis.

329
00:19:01,184 --> 00:19:03,820
Don't worry, and Blue is very healthy.

330
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:05,280
It doesn't even have ringworm,

331
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,920
so it couldn't infect you.

332
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,080
But,

333
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,880
I wonder if Blue would hurt the baby

334
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,480
after she's born.

335
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,600
Well, cats are very sensitive

336
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,040
to human emotions.

337
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,320
As long as you don't attack it,

338
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,320
it won't actively attack humans.

339
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,880
And now domestic cats

340
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,480
are very close to humans,

341
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,720
even there are babies in the family,

342
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,160
they won't hurt them.

343
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,680
But…

344
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,880
Tian, bring Blue to them.

345
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,920
Feifei's parents,

346
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,780
actually, the main reason

347
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:45,000
why Feifei ran away from home

348
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,680
is you guys wanted to abandon Blue,

349
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,760
which broke his heart.

350
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,400
And he thinks you don't love
or care about him anymore

351
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,220
when he finds out mom's pregnant.

352
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:56,720
This might be the real reason.

353
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,520
Silly boy.

354
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,080
Do you know

355
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,200
you are the apple of my and your dad's eyes?

356
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,120
We really, really love you.

357
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,048
Feifei.

358
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,140
When your mom gave birth to you,

359
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,680
it took ten hours,

360
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,440
she even passed out a few times.

361
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,720
Feifei.

362
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,792
You should blame me.

363
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,640
It's my fault for not
taking good care of you for mom.

364
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,400
It's all my fault.

365
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,832
Feifei.

366
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,680
Boy, why are you so silly

367
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,520
to think that mom and dad would abandon you?

368
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,280
Feifei, you know what?

369
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,820
Whether it is you or the baby inside me,

370
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,320
you are all the most important children

371
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,200
for me and your dad,

372
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,520
and we can't lose any of you.

373
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,920
Do you know it, Feifei?

374
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,800
See, I didn't lie to you.

375
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,820
Your parents really love you.

376
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:01,280
Thank you for taking care of Feifei.

377
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,160
I will never think of

378
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,640
sending Blue away again.

379
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,400
- You can't think of that anymore.
- Thank you.

380
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,760
Tian Tian.

381
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,160
Are you pregnant?

382
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:21,960
Yes.

383
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,640
<i>[Tianlin Animal Hospital]</i>
Thank you.

384
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,640
I will miss you guys.

385
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,920
We will also miss you.

386
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,448
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

387
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,048
Let's go.

388
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,320
Thank you, Dr. Tian.

389
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,920
- It's okay.
- Goodbye.

390
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,880
Tian Tian, congratulations.

391
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,360
I heard you are pregnant with Shen Mi's child.

392
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,160
What? That's not true.

393
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,432
It's a lie.

394
00:21:50,432 --> 00:21:51,720
Pregnant? Really?

395
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,040
No, I'm not pregnant.

396
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,968
I can find it out if you are pregnant or not.

397
00:21:55,968 --> 00:21:57,056
Give me your hand.

398
00:21:57,056 --> 00:21:59,120
I've told you, it's a lie.

399
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,840
Why are you gossiping like my aunt?

400
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,280
- Go, go.
- Congratulations.

401
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,200
- Go, go. Don't make a mess.
- Okay.

402
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,640
Why are you all gossiping?

403
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,240
What's wrong? Oh my.

404
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,000
There are no outsiders now.

405
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,080
Just tell me,

406
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:22,440
are you pregnant with Shen Mi's child?

407
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,760
You are just being cautious,

408
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,080
so you don't tell them, right?

409
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,160
No. I've been very clear with you,

410
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,160
and repeated it several times.

411
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,600
I didn't have anything with him,

412
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,220
and I'm not carrying his child.

413
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:34,000
Can you trust me?

414
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:38,080
Tian Tian, since you two are in love,

415
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,240
getting pregnant before marriage

416
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,800
is not a disgrace.

417
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:43,360
And it can't be seen
within the first four months.

418
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,040
You guys set the date to marry now.

419
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:47,440
You can still wear wedding dress.

420
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,720
No. I swear,

421
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,600
if I, Tian Tian, am pregnant,

422
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,560
Tianlin Hospital will shut down.

423
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,740
That's a pretty poisonous swear.

424
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:02,912
You trust me now, right?

425
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,360
Oh, no. Oh my.

426
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,040
What are you doing?

427
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:14,280
About this matter,

428
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,000
I just…

429
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,760
I just told my sister-in-law.

430
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:21,520
W-Why did you tell my mom?

431
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,040
She said,

432
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,640
even if it's raining knives today,

433
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:29,280
you and Shen Mi have to go home together.

434
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:32,680
Go home together?

435
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,560
Go home together?

436
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,620
My aunt can't hide anything.

437
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:49,560
Don't worry about it. I have explained

438
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,580
to my parents already.

439
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:51,584
It's okay.

440
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,280
I might as well go.

441
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,220
I was a part of it, after all.

442
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:57,560
And I have never

443
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,440
visited the former director of the hospital

444
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,680
for so long.

445
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,480
This is a good time to visit him.

446
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,360
Then let me tell you,

447
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,440
my mom

448
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,920
might not like you,

449
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,880
so if she says something unpleasant,

450
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,880
do not take it personally.

451
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,700
I have a strong mind.

452
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,680
I'm going to go get dressed
and come back to pick you up.

453
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,400
Uncle and aunt, I am Shen Mi.

454
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,640
Hello, I am Shen Mi.

455
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,520
Uncle and aunt, I am Shen Mi.

456
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,840
Here are some gifts I brought for you.

457
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,000
Be natural and normal.

458
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,824
Hello.

459
00:25:07,232 --> 00:25:08,288
I am Shen Mi.

460
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,856
Yes…

461
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,640
What's there to be nervous about?

462
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:17,040
Hello, I am Shen Mi.

463
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,072
Nice to meet you.

464
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:44,960
What are you laughing at?

465
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,160
I've never seen Shen Mi from Lvchuan

466
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,020
so nervous before.

467
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:50,280
I hope you can understand

468
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,560
the importance of this visit

469
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,600
and the possible consequences.

470
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,688
Alright, boss.

471
00:25:55,232 --> 00:25:56,320
If this visit

472
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,440
ends up bad,

473
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,240
you won't be able to stay
at my house anymore, do you get it?

474
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:04,280
So you're worried you can't
spend time with me, right?

475
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,800
I'm just worry about grandpa…

476
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,944
You are worried that you can't
explain it to grandpa. I got it.

477
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:12,832
Let's go in.

478
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,040
Tian Tian is back.

479
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,760
- Mrs. Li.
- Long time no see.

480
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,400
Your boyfriend?

481
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,080
- Your boyfriend?
- Friend.

482
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,672
- Hello.
- He's quite handsome.

483
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,424
Mom.

484
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,112
Mr. Shen is here.

485
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:39,880
The boss is here.

486
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,560
Aunt.

487
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,800
This time I came in a hurry.

488
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,340
I don't know what you like,

489
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:45,520
please accept this.

490
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,580
Don't be that polite.

491
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:48,960
Where are Yuxian and my dad?

492
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:53,280
Tian. Come down now.

493
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,520
Tian Tian's boss is here.

494
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,280
Here come the delicious dishes.

495
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,680
Here they come.

496
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,704
Here.

497
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:32,960
Beggar's Chicken.

498
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,600
This Beggar's Chicken is incredible.

499
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:37,632
Just so-so.

500
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,480
Because we don't have all the equipment,

501
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,200
so I used our oven,

502
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,320
the taste might be a bit off.

503
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,680
Shen.

504
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,640
I have been cooking for a lifetime.

505
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,920
Compared to you,

506
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,400
I really feel ashamed.

507
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,440
Teach me when you have time.

508
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:57,320
Your uncle Tian always criticizes me

509
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:59,120
for making the same

510
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,800
few homemade dishes.

511
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:05,040
What? I never do so.

512
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,160
Aunt,

513
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,440
it's hardest to make the homemade dishes well.

514
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:13,500
The taste of homemade dishes

515
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,160
is the taste of mother.

516
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,240
Like when I was alone abroad,

517
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:19,080
I just wanted to eat some homemade dishes,

518
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,440
but I can't.

519
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,060
Until I got back to the country,

520
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:25,400
my parents were busy making ends meet

521
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,000
and I don't have any siblings.

522
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,480
I had an older brother before,

523
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,560
but unfortunately, we got separated later.

524
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,200
I want to eat homemade dishes,

525
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,320
but I can't.

526
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,840
Shen,

527
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,160
I feel so upset

528
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:43,360
hearing it.

529
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,344
Don't worry.

530
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,520
If you want to eat homemade dishes,

531
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,160
you are always welcome. Right, mom?

532
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:55,160
Yes, Shen, you can come anytime

533
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,480
when you're free.

534
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:59,480
Alright, aunt. Then I'll come more often.

535
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,340
Great, welcome.

536
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:03,680
I'm going to serve the food.

537
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,528
Mom.

538
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,608
Hurry up.

539
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:12,200
Mr. Shen, Tian, dinner is ready.

540
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,280
Come on, let's have the meal.

541
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,368
Please.

542
00:29:16,864 --> 00:29:17,880
Here.

543
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:18,960
Here, Uncle.

544
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,080
Eat a little less.

545
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,432
Here, Yuxian.

546
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,840
Aunt, here is a piece for you.

547
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:25,888
Thank you.

548
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,440
This piece is yours.

549
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,840
This piece is mine.

550
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,020
Mr. Shen, don't be shy and eat.

551
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:46,120
Make yourself at home.

552
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,320
This one tastes good.

553
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,640
Tian Tian, how do you know

554
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,720
it's my favorite?

555
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:58,520
Tian Tian, Shen worked so hard.

556
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,616
What are you doing?

557
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,400
You've been working hard, eat more.

558
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,000
You've been working hard.

559
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:10,700
Shen, I heard you said
your parents run a business.

560
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:12,200
What kind of business do they do?

561
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,680
Right, you've never told us about your family.

562
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,320
My family…

563
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:21,160
It's just an ordinary family,
running some small business.

564
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,280
Busy making ends meet.

565
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,760
Exactly,

566
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,240
all ordinary families

567
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:29,240
are busy making ends meet.

568
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,560
Like us,

569
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,240
we run a small pet hospital

570
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,020
and are terribly busy.

571
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:36,360
Right, mom.

572
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,420
And if Mr. Shen hadn't helped us this time,

573
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:39,960
our hospital would have shut down.

574
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,160
Mr. Shen, here, eat more meat

575
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,520
and this osmanthus lotus root.

576
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,584
It's really delicious.

577
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,280
- I'll help you.
- No.

578
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,440
You go out and take a break.

579
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,360
There's too much fire out there.
I'll take a rest here.

580
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,800
Too much fire?

581
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:33,720
Who told me this visit is important

582
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:34,880
and have to take it very seriously?

583
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,640
My mom, Shen Chen,

584
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:40,000
and Tian Yuxian got you scared, right?

585
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,760
How is that possible?

586
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,120
Come on.

587
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,000
How is it, uncle?

588
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,140
Pretty good.

589
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:07,280
You've worked hard.

590
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,040
- No problem.
- Shen.

591
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,580
Stop and take a break.

592
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:13,320
- Have an apple.
- No.

593
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:15,160
I-I'll eat it after massaging uncle.

594
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,336
Mr. Shen.

595
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:21,480
Since you're here, let me ask you

596
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,520
if this kid is doing nothing

597
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,400
and holding you back

598
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,160
at the hospital.

599
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,632
Aunt.

600
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,328
He is.

601
00:32:31,328 --> 00:32:34,440
<i>Shen Mi, remember this.</i>

602
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,280
<i>You brat, how dare you asked Shen Chen to come.</i>

603
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,280
When he first came into the hospital,

604
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:44,480
Yuxian indeed had a short temper,

605
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,880
and didn't follow management.

606
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,400
<i>Shen Mi, you don't want
to be with my sister, right?</i>

607
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,240
But then, as time goes by,

608
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,080
he has grown up a lot

609
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,760
and now he's getting better and better.

610
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,880
He takes special care of all the hospital pets,

611
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,720
especially when he grooms them.

612
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,720
<i>You're good.</i>

613
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,360
Aunt, all his progress now is for the hospital.

614
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,640
And he knows

615
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:12,040
he has put in a lot of effort.

616
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:15,320
I think he's really great now.

617
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:20,240
Mr. Shen, I have something to say.

618
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,840
It's just so late,

619
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:25,240
maybe you should go back with Tian Tian.

620
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,600
Is it okay for Carlo to be home alone?

621
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:32,280
Right, Shen reminded me.

622
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,540
Mr. Shen, look.

623
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:37,520
Tian Tian has been living with you

624
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,360
as Carlo's personal doctor

625
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,960
for quite some time.

626
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:44,080
But after all, it's not good for
a man and a woman living in the same house.

627
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,980
And this time there is a rumor of pregnancy.

628
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:50,300
Even though we already know
it was a misunderstanding,

629
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:54,040
it's not very convenient in the long run.

630
00:33:56,608 --> 00:33:57,696
Well,

631
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,480
I have a solution that works both ways.

632
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,240
Tell me about it.

633
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,680
I could replace Tian Tian

634
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,000
and move into Mr. Shen's house.

635
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,016
No way.

636
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,520
Why not?

637
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,600
I think it's a good idea.

638
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:18,360
Besides, Shen is a pet doctor

639
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,360
with excellent medical skills,

640
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,719
he could easily take care of a dog.

641
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:24,280
He…

642
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,440
I have one more thing to say.

643
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:32,280
Since uncle, aunt and brother are all here.

644
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,760
Tian Tian, I also want to
be a part of your family.

645
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,800
<i>Bro, you are so brave. Amazing.</i>

646
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,320
Uncle, Aunt.

647
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,320
In fact,

648
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,920
I have two things to clarify this time.

649
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:58,280
One is about the misunderstanding
about Tian Tian's pregnancy,

650
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,320
I wanted to come and apologize.

651
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,520
There's something more important

652
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,280
I'd like to tell you,

653
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,640
Tian Tian and I have been dating.

654
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,256
Dating?

655
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,760
<i>What? It's so dramatic.</i>

656
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:28,680
Shen, actually I really like you a lot

657
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:31,760
and I hope that Tian Tian could be with you.

658
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,520
But about the relationship thing,

659
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:36,000
no one can force it.

660
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,360
You're such a good boy.

661
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,160
I believe that you would definitely

662
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,960
find your own happiness in the future.

663
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,680
Aunt, you can go home.

664
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,320
- Okay.
- I'm leaving then.

665
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,400
Be careful.

666
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:56,640
Go home, Aunt.

667
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,200
Thank you today.

668
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,272
Thank you.

669
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:25,980
For what?

670
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:29,160
I know you just said so to my parents

671
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,280
to help me out.

672
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,312
Thank you.

673
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,200
<i>Tell me about you and Han Mengnan.</i>

674
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,320
<i>When I was little,</i>

675
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,320
<i>I always thought that when I grew up,</i>

676
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,000
<i>I must marry Mengnan.</i>

677
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,400
Right?

678
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:55,584
Yes.

679
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,520
If you're not around,

680
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,880
grandpa would be worried.

681
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:21,824
What are you thinking?

682
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:26,600
I feel

683
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,760
my parents are getting old.

684
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,920
My mom is a housewife,

685
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:37,600
a profession that is often overlooked

686
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,600
and hard to get recognized.

687
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:43,200
She has put all the best things in her life

688
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,920
into this family.

689
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:50,720
My dad was a real career freak.

690
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:54,480
But this illness has changed him a lot.

691
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:59,648
Don't worry, he'll get better.

692
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,920
You'd stay with your dad tonight.

693
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:07,936
Thank you.

694
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:12,800
Actually, I quite envy you

695
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,960
to have such a complete and happy family

696
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,200
and your parents love you so much.

697
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,800
It's something I'll never get in my life.

698
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:30,496
Shen Mi.

699
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,560
Happiness and completeness

700
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,680
are not equal.

701
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,640
A happy family

702
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,240
does not just fall from the sky

703
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,680
on anyone.

704
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,180
It also requires the family

705
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:46,700
to work hard little by little

706
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:50,160
in many years of getting along.

707
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,800
If you really want a happy family,

708
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,520
you can start

709
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,320
with yourself.

710
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,160
Mom.

711
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,360
What are you doing knitting
in the middle of the night?

712
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:52,160
You are back. Sit down.

713
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,200
What are you knitting?

714
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:57,056
I am knitting you gloves. Come on.

715
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,408
Try them on.

716
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:06,120
I told you knitting at night hurts your eyes.

717
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:08,000
And I can't use them anymore
when it gets warmer.

718
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:10,960
Well, wait till winter.

719
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:14,220
I have nothing to do at home alone anyway.

720
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:15,800
If I don't do something,

721
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,240
I would be so bored.

722
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:23,040
Have you been sleeping well lately, mom?

723
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,880
I'll take you to see
a Chinese medicine doctor some other day.

724
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,320
Why didn't Mengnan come back with you?

725
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,608
Mengnan…

726
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,800
She's busy,

727
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:39,800
couldn't come today.

728
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,480
You've all grown so big.

729
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,240
Look at this yard,

730
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:48,960
I think I can still hear

731
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,440
the sound of you and Mengnan

732
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:52,440
laughing and joking around here
when you were little.

733
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,280
In fact, about you and Mengnan,

734
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:58,820
it all started with your dad and secretary Han.

735
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:00,560
I didn't expect you guys
would actually be a couple.

736
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,920
In fact, my biggest wish now

737
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:09,120
is to see you two get married soon,

738
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,680
so I can have my grandchild.

739
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,112
Our family

740
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:15,980
hasn't been so lively

741
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:17,360
for many years.

742
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,008
Mom.

743
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:24,960
Actually,

744
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,200
Mengnan and I…

745
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,080
What happened? Is everything okay?

746
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:30,816
Nothing.

747
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,160
We're just

748
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:36,000
childhood friends.

749
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,800
We were so young

750
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,840
to know about love, right?

751
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:45,280
It's just some game.

752
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,720
What?

753
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,720
I saw clearly at that time

754
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,540
that you really like Mengnan,

755
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:52,120
and in my heart,

756
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:54,080
I've already considered Mengnan
as my daughter-in-law.

757
00:42:34,816 --> 00:42:38,336
<i>♫ Your gaze is unwavering ♫</i>

758
00:42:40,352 --> 00:42:44,896
<i>♫ Only enough to accommodate me ♫</i>

759
00:42:46,112 --> 00:42:50,784
<i>♫ I have been melted by you countless times ♫</i>

760
00:42:51,744 --> 00:42:55,296
<i>♫ Yet I'm at a loss for what to do ♫</i>

761
00:42:57,248 --> 00:43:00,192
<i>♫ I can only hold on to you ♫</i>

762
00:43:02,272 --> 00:43:06,176
<i>♫ Now you are still with me ♫</i>

763
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:12,096
<i>♫ Traveling through time together ♫</i>

764
00:43:13,952 --> 00:43:21,888
<i>♫ Someday, I'll be completely
forgotten by the world ♫</i>

765
00:43:21,888 --> 00:43:25,088
<i>♫ Leaving no trace ♫</i>

766
00:43:25,088 --> 00:43:29,120
<i>♫ Only you will still remember ♫</i>

767
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:33,184
<i>♫ My appearance ♫</i>
