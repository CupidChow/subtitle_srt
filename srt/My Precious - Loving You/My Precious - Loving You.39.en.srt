quote from some book?

103
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:03,540
I didn't.

104

00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:39,960
Do you think this is a good idea?

161
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,440
Are you serious about what you said?

162
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,560
Of course I'm serious.

163
00:11:52,768 --> 00:11:53,856
In the past,

164
00:11:53,856 --> 00:11:56,720
I had no right to
choose the life I wanted to live,

165
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,320
and I was not qualified

166
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,840
to love the one I wanted to love.

167
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:03,600
But now,

168
00:12:04,288 --> 00:12:05,800
I want to give it a try for you.

169
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,920
I want to try to let go of the past.

170
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,328
Everything you said

171
00:12:11,328 --> 00:12:13,240
and the reason you broke up with me,

172
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,360
are they all about the secret
you wanted to tell me?

173
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,056
Yes.

174
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,560
Can you

175
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,160
tell me now?

176
00:12:25,088 --> 00:12:26,320
Of course.

177
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,640
I won't keep anything from you anymore.
Actually, I…

178
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,720
Wait, are you really ready

179
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,320
to tell me?

180
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,080
Actually, I can wait…

181
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,440
until you're fully ready.

182
00:12:44,992 --> 00:12:46,048
Actually, I…

183
00:12:47,616 --> 00:12:48,896
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">[Han Guannian]</font></font></i>

184
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,048
I'll be right there.

185
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,280
What happened? What's wrong?

186
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,880
Grandpa has suddenly fainted.

187
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,840
I'll go with you.

188
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,640
Wen Jing, you are at the hospital, right?

189
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,800
Carlo's situation is relatively stable,

190
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,360
but you need to give it
the anti-inflammatories.

191
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,672
Thank you then.

192
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,560
Grandpa will be fine.

193
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,680
I will always be with you.

194
00:13:26,176 --> 00:13:28,832
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">[Quiet]</font></font></i>

195
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,480
Doctor, what's the situation now?
Does he need surgery?

196
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,960
The current patient's cerebral hemorrhage
is less than 20 milliliters.

197
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,440
Under angiography,

198
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,300
considering the patient's old age,

199
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,240
we'd recommend conservative treatment,

200
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,400
and wait for self-absorption.

201
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,520
Shen Mi.

202
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,560
Why is Grandpa suddenly like this?

203
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,720
He's mad about the wedding thing.

204
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:55,920
Actually,

205
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,360
he's known about this aneurysm for a long time.

206
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,200
Han, why didn't you tell us
about such an important situation earlier?

207
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,160
He didn't want you to worry,

208
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,200
so he didn't allow me to.

209
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,720
Sister-in-law, dad will surely be fine.

210
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,720
Don't cry.

211
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,600
I'm sorry, Grandpa.

212
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,240
It's all my fault.

213
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,600
I'm sorry.

214
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,520
I'm sorry.

215
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,472
I'm sorry.

216
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,840
Didn't they split up?

217
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,000
Why are they together now?

218
00:16:15,136 --> 00:16:16,160
Han,

219
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,080
since he knew his own condition,

220
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,720
did he leave anything in advance?

221
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,840
He did make a will,

222
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,120
and said

223
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,840
it can be announced to you all

224
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,360
when he loses his ability to act.

225
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,160
Well, doesn't it mean now?

226
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,120
The will is in the safe.

227
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,080
Let's go there.

228
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,240
This is the Shen family's own business,

229
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,880
outsiders don't come.

230
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:11,400
If you're listening to Han
read this will right now,

231
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:15,240
it means that my physical condition
is really terrible.

232
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,400
Therefore, the following

233
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,280
is the distribution and arrangement I have made

234
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,560
for the stock deposits
and real estate under my name

235
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,240
after careful consideration.

236
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,080
My daughter-in-law, Du Xinya,

237
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:38,160
who has been guarding the Shen family
and taking care of the eldest grandson.

238
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,060
All my shares in Lvchuan Group

239
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:44,400
would be given to her.

240
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,060
I have four other properties in my name.

241
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:49,640
Leave the old house to Xinya.

242
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,000
She's lived here for years
and she gets used to it.

243
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,000
As for the remaining three houses,

244
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,120
the house of the Qilin Palace

245
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,880
would be given to my eldest grandson Shen Mi,

246
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,600
the house of Hongchen River View
would be given to Shen Chen,

247
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,680
Shen Hongyuan,

248
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,720
the house of Yujing Bay

249
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,040
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">[Will]</font></font></i>
would be yours.

250
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,680
Finally, my savings

251
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:12,240
are divided equally to my two grandchildren,

252
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,840
Shen Mi and Shen Chen.

253
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,200
Testator, Shen Rongxian.

254
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,360
Executor, Han Guannian.

255
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:22,960
Is that it?

256
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,064
And

257
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,720
this is the equity transfer agreement

258
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,400
held by Mr. Shen.

259
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,480
He's already signed it.

260
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,040
As long as you sign it,

261
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,440
it can take effect immediately.

262
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,552
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">[Equity Transfer Agreement]</font></font></i>

263
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,520
There's one thing

264
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,880
I want to say.

265
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,680
The first thing,

266
00:18:58,208 --> 00:18:59,240
I'll give the property

267
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,760
to Han Mengnan.

268
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:03,920
The second thing,

269
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,880
I'll give Shen Chen all the savings

270
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,640
that Grandpa left me.

271
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,120
You handle it yourself.

272
00:19:21,728 --> 00:19:23,072
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">[Will]</font></font></i>

273
00:19:44,288 --> 00:19:45,408
Well…

274
00:19:49,184 --> 00:19:50,280
Let's go, mom.

275
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,880
It's okay, mom.

276
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,240
Dad, I'll take you home now.

277
00:20:03,776 --> 00:20:04,864
No.

278
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,496
Take me to the company.

279
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,600
How can your Grandpa

280
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,240
do so?

281
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,400
Even like this,

282
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,440
he still hid his illness

283
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,880
to buy more time for Shen Mi to take over.

284
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,640
That's what he did between me and my brother,

285
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:31,040
and he's still doing so to you,
his grandchildren.

286
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,560
He has not changed at all.

287
00:20:39,648 --> 00:20:40,736
Son,

288
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,440
I didn't do it for the money.

289
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,000
I just can't accept it.

290
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,680
If you don't want to acknowledge me
as your son, then I'll fight for it.

291
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,800
I have to take back whatever belongs to me.

292
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,200
I'll take it back myself even I am on my own.

293
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,560
Before he takes over,

294
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,640
we still have a chance. Go to the company.

And here is a package for you.

310
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,800
He holds a shareholders' meeting now,

311
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,320
I guess he's in a rush to
take over the company.

that

321
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,880
I would like to discuss with you all.

322
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,840
Mr. Shen Rongxian, the original chairman

323
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,240
and president of Lvchuan Group,

324
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,280
was supposed to

325
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:52,560
appoint me as the CEO this month.

326
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,560
But he

327
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,000
had a sudden brain hemorrhage.

328
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,440
Due to his physical condition,

329
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,800
he can't be here to
attend the meeting in person.

330
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,488
So I want

331
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,440
to discuss with

332
00:24:15,744 --> 00:24:16,760
you all…

No need.

00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,320
You seem to be very sad.

335
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,040
Stop your show.

336
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,480
Dear shareholders,

337
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,680
here is a document,

338
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,680
which is a report

339
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,040
on the kinship identification

340
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:52,064
of this man and Mr. Shen Rongxian.

341
00:24:52,064 --> 00:24:53,152
Take a look.

342
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,480
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">[Shen Mi and Shen Rongxian's Paternity Test]</font></font></i>
What's going on?

343
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,640
Is it true?

344
00:25:03,616 --> 00:25:04,680
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">[No kinship between Shen Mi and Shen Rongxian]</font></font></i>

345
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:07,160
Shen Mi is not Mr. Shen's grandson.

346
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:08,960
Sir.

347
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:13,480
What should I call you?

348
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,640
Call him a liar,

349
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,720
counterfeit,

350
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,440
whatever.

351
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,840
Anyway, this man

352
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,400
has nothing to do with the Shen family.

353
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,600
Even this person

354
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,560
has a lot to do

355
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,060
with the real missing Shen Mi.

356
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:30,040
Not only does he not deserve to be here,

357
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,960
he even has to be brought to the police.

358
00:25:33,472 --> 00:25:34,528
Security.

359
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,480
Why doesn't he deserve to be here?

360
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,600
Sister-in-law, you're just in time.

361
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,768
Please take a look.

362
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,400
Han, what's going on?

363
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,944
Shen Mi was brought back by you.

364
00:25:55,552 --> 00:25:56,660
How could this happen?

365
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:58,520
Don't ask Han.

366
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,560
He's been pretending

367
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,960
and lying to us for so many years,

368
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,440
just send him directly to the police.

369
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,200
Lies. They are all lies.

370
00:26:10,112 --> 00:26:11,168
Shen Hongyuan.

371
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,740
Shen Mi is your own nephew.

372
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:15,160
How can you do so?

373
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,400
Aren't you feeling guilty?

374
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,440
Sister-in-law.

375
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,640
This is an expert report
from a professional organization.

376
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,080
Go home if you have a temper.

377
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,240
We're in a shareholders' meeting right now.

378
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,320
Dear shareholders,

379
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:33,880
in view of major personnel changes
at the Group,

380
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,960
I propose

381
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:38,040
we collectively remove
this man from all positions.

382
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,920
Raise your hand if you agree.

383
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,720
Okay, all agreed.

384
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,600
I disagree.

385
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,360
All the shareholders have agreed.

386
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:07,840
I have already signed
the equity transfer agreement.

387
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,360
From now on,

388
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,480
I am Lvchuan's largest shareholder.

389
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,040
Without my consent,

390
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,240
no one can touch my son.

391
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:31,480
I resign.

392
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,840
I came here today

393
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,080
with the intention

394
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,360
of resigning from all my positions.

395
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,232
Son,

396
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,920
I know you were wronged.

397
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,600
They all want to set you up.

398
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,280
Don't worry, I am here.

399
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,120
I won't let anyone hurt you.

400
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,800
I won't let anyone hurt you.

401
00:28:07,744 --> 00:28:08,864
Mom.

402
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,320
What it says here

403
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,640
is true.

404
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,640
Lies, they are all lies.

405
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,460
I don't believe it. They are all lies.

406
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:25,880
Son, what's wrong with you?

407
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,000
Do you abandon me?

408
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,400
Don't you want me anymore?

409
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,360
You can like whoever you like.

410
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,600
You can marry Dr. Tian if you want to.

411
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,600
I won't stop you anymore.

412
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,672
I'm begging you.

413
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,480
Please don't abandon me.

414
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,880
Don't leave me.

415
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,200
Sorry, mom.

416
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:59,400
Shen Mi has gone.

417
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,160
Have you thought it all through?

418
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,040
So next…

419
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,120
Next,

420
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,960
I will live

421
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,400
as Gao Zhuo.

422
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:34,720
You know what?

423
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,400
In fact, I have been

424
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,840
very happy for so many years.

425
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,280
I'm the least qualified person

426
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:47,560
to be in this position.

427
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,640
Everything in this room,

428
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,200
every item,

429
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:56,000
everyone's feelings,

430
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,560
don't belong to me.

431
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,000
So I just

432
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:08,040
returned them to their rightful owner.

433
00:30:22,848 --> 00:30:23,936
Are you leaving?

434
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,800
Don't you have anything to explain to me?

435
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,440
It's not really over yet.

436
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,120
I will do it in the future.

437
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:48,146
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">[Executive Vice President]</font></font></i>

438
00:31:01,344 --> 00:31:02,520
Mr. Gu,

439
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:03,640
as per your request,

440
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,440
this is a three-story main building
facing south.

441
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,600
The east and west side buildings
and the main building

442
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,400
are connected by connecting corridors.

443
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,680
Do you have any problems?

444
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,560
Make sure the north window is wide open,

445
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:15,920
because the view on the north side is nice.

446
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,160
Others are fine.

447
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,520
When can we start construction?

448
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:25,520
The approval process takes about a week.

449
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,240
We can lay the foundations
as soon as we get through the paperwork.

450
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,168
Okay.

451
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:32,992
Go get busy then.

452
00:31:42,688 --> 00:31:43,712
Gu Mingze.

453
00:31:57,472 --> 00:31:58,560
Mengnan.

454
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,060
Are you really going to

455
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:11,720
build a house here on your own?

456
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,840
The view is really nice,

457
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,440
except for being a bit hot.

458
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,440
It's kind of livable.

459
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,220
Mengnan, why…

460
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:26,200
Did you really rent the land?

461
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,024
I found a local law firm

462
00:32:29,024 --> 00:32:30,200
to coordinate.

463
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,880
But the work efficiency here is…

464
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,160
I think

465
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:38,720
it's time for you to find a new lawyer.

466
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,776
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">[Are you done with things over there?]</font></font></i>

467
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,960
Chen Yifan, are you crazy?

468
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,080
Why do you give me a fire extinguisher?

469
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:35,200
Isn't it your birthday?

470
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,960
That's exactly what I'm asking.

471
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,680
You're giving me a fire extinguisher
for my birthday.

472
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,160
What do you mean?

473
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:43,160
It's considerate to give you
a fire extinguisher for your birthday.

474
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:45,520
Our community has been spreading
fire safety knowledge,

475
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:48,440
and I found those fire cases
particularly frightening.

476
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:51,120
However, I am so considerate.

477
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:54,180
As a single woman living alone,

478
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:55,880
you might have some accidents.

479
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,640
Screw you! Are you cursing me?

480
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:58,900
I didn't mean it.

481
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:00,000
Better safe than sorry.

482
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,040
You!

483
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:03,400
How about this? I can be with you.

484
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,680
With me around, I can protect you.

485
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,920
With you around, you…

486
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,760
You're not as good as this one.

487
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,639
Come on, it's your birthday. Don't get mad.

488
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:15,199
I have already chosen the place
to treat you to dinner.

489
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:16,320
No way.

490
00:34:17,344 --> 00:34:18,400
Why?

491
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,639
What are you going to treat me to?

492
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:21,199
Open-air food stall?

493
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:23,679
Today, no open-air food stall.

494
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,440
Eat anything you want.

495
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:28,460
No way, I don't believe it. Where's your money?

496
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:29,920
In order to treat you to this dinner,

497
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,488
I even sold a nice stock.

498
00:34:32,032 --> 00:34:33,040
Alright.

499
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,280
Show me how many stocks you bought.

500
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,679
- Okay, I'll show you.
- Show me here.

501
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:38,120
It's in your pocket, you have to take it out.

502
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,920
Let me see how much money you have.

I'm sorry, Grandpa.

505
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,760
Today I decided to leave Lvchuan.

506
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,560
Once

507
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,160
you gave me so much trust,

508
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:31,640
even entrusted the whole Lvchuan Group to me.

509
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,680
I'm afraid I have to fail you.

510
00:35:36,896 --> 00:35:38,016
Grandpa,

511
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,040
there's one thing

512
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,440
I should have told you.

513
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,840
Actually, I

514
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,120
am not the real Shen Mi.

515
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,120
I have no blood relation with you.

516
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,360
I should not

517
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,920
or cannot accept what you gave me.

518
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,600
You know what?

519
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:08,920
In fact, I don't regret to
make this decision at all.

520
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,160
Because

521
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,980
I don't have to pretend to

522
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:19,840
be someone else anymore.

523
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:23,840
I can

524
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,160
happily

525
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:30,080
pursue my happiness.

526
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,360
I can also live the life I want

527
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,920
with the one I love.

528
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,280
I'm so happy.

529
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:49,320
My heart is finally settled.

530
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,880
It's never been so settled.

531
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:10,440
Grandpa, there's one last thing
I need to do for Shen Mi.

532
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:15,800
I'll figure out

533
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,320
what happened to Shen Mi that year,

534
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,800
and I have to give him justice.

535
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,600
That's what I promised him.

536
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,600
So Grandpa,

537
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:34,560
you have to get better

538
00:37:36,576 --> 00:37:37,680
and wait for me to come back.

539
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,160
You have to get better soon

540
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,760
and wait for me, do you hear me?

541
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:11,648
Wait for me.

542
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:06,040
I brought you the violin.

543
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,480
I'm doing well now.

544
00:39:12,032 --> 00:39:13,120
There's someone

545
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,000
who loves me

546
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,640
and takes care of me for you.

547
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,680
Don't worry.

548
00:41:13,434 --> 00:41:16,320

549
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:29,000
Didn't you say you liked it here last time?

550
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,640
This might be a good place for a guesthouse.

551
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,240
With such a beautiful and smart boss lady,

552
00:41:34,848 --> 00:41:35,960
it's bound to be profitable.

553
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,360
If it is not, then it's on you.

554
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:40,120
Fine, it's on me.

555
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,120
Do you want me to spend money?

556
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:49,696
A call.

557
00:41:50,784 --> 00:41:51,840
Shen Mi.

558
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:53,536
Pick it up.

559
00:41:54,592 --> 00:41:55,660
What's up?

560
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:56,672
Mengnan.

561
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:58,680
Do you know some

562
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:00,180
friends in the media?

563
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:01,600
Yes, I do.

564
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,280
Can you find out something for me?

565
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:06,600
Okay, I'll check for you as soon as I can.
