why this new drug launch is being delayed.

138
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,040
The reason is simple,

139
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,820
because the drug in the clinical stage

140
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:45,160
still has a large toxic side effect.

141
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:53,640

142
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,360

I'm fine.

182
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:19,800
<i>I bumped my foot. It hurts. Hang on.</i>

183
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,000
I'm sorry.

184
00:12:21,536 --> 00:12:22,640
- Are you hurt?
- Never mind.

185
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,840
That's fine, nothing big.

186
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,560
Be careful the next time you carry things.

187
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,600
Can't you see that speed bump ahead?

188
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,720
I'm sorry.

189
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,120
I-I hope you're not hurt.

190
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,480
Yes.

191
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,480
It's okay. Just go.

192
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,520
Forget it.

193
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,584
We have work to do.

194
00:12:35,584 --> 00:12:36,640
It's good that you're okay.

195
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,696
Forget it.

196
00:12:37,696 --> 00:12:39,280
Bro, can you give me a hand?

197
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,864
Wait, I…

198
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,560
Turn the things around.

199
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,480
- Thank you.
- Not at all.

200
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,200
Wait. Can't you guys pass this

201
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,920
and still need my help?

202
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,160
Alright, come on.

203
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,960
<i>[75X45 Small Table]</i>

204
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,560
You really turned the thing around
and are quite attractive.

205
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,640
Kind of.

206
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,400
All right, let's adjust and get in there.

207
00:13:12,288 --> 00:13:13,312
Let's go.

208
00:13:13,312 --> 00:13:14,680
<i>It hurts so much.</i>

209
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,160
These are the reasons why we

210
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,380
are going to delay the press launch.

211
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:25,440
Next, please welcome Mr. Shen.

212
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,800
Thanks to Dr. Gu for his perfect speech.

213
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,120
Please give him another round of applause.

214
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,696
Okay, thank you.

215
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,560
Actually today,

216
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,760
except for the guests here,

217
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,280
I also want to thank someone sincerely.

218
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:04,680
If not for his great support and help,

219
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:07,240
our new drug wouldn't go so smoothly

220
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,480
into research and development.

221
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,320
Because of his strong support,

222
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,780
so we're where we are today.

223
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:13,856
And this is

224
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,680
Mr. Shen Hongyuan.

225
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,560
Actually, this new drug press launch

226
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,440
can be held under the effort

227
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,520
and insistence by Mr. Shen Hongyuan.

228
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,400
Because Mr. Shen Hongyuan

229
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,040
has always held a responsible attitude

230
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,480
towards all animal patients,

231
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,180
making the lymphoma targeting drug

232
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:00,640
to continue to improve.

233
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,920
He has put so much into
the research and development of this new drug.

234
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,360
Let's give a round of applause

235
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,152
to Mr. Shen Hongyuan again.

236
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,600
I have to go. You stay.

237
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,432
Mengnan.

238
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,160
Mengnan.

239
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,712
I thought…

240
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,700
I thought I was the reason you left Lvchuan.

241
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,160
I've been feeling guilty for a long time.

242
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,000
As a result, you and Shen Mi

243
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,680
have been preparing for such a big event,

244
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,000
and I was the only one in the dark.

245
00:15:58,944 --> 00:16:00,060
I'm sorry.

246
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,400
I don't accept.

247
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,256
Mengnan.

248
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,856
So

249
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,760
how can you accept?

250
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,880
Dr. Gu.

251
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,600
You could develop the drug,

252
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,720
but can't you figure this out?

253
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,272
I am not an expert in this.

254
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,600
But I'll do anything to keep your anger at bay.

255
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,960
Really? Anything?

256
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:44,992
Come here.

257
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,980
I used to let you mess around

258
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:53,200
because you were young.

259
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,560
But today, you have to explain clearly to me.

260
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,600
What are you going to do?
In front of so many people,

261
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,680
you're embarrassing me,

262
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,880
all shareholders,

263
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,080
and Lvchuan.

264
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,280
You said to postpone,

265
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,480
do you have any idea
how much it costs to the group?

266
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,960
I do.

267
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:12,608
Dad.

268
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:14,400
Why are you here?

269
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,488
What?

270
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:19,920
At least I'm still chairman of Lvchuan Group.

271
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,480
Why can't I be here

272
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,119
in such an important meeting?

273
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:28,640
Dad, I also want to develop the new drug.

274
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,840
But Guo Fan didn't sell me his patent.

275
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,960
Then how did Shen Mi get it?

276
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:36,320
Did they steal it or rob it?

277
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:40,320
You never try to solve problems.

278
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,640
If I were like you when I was your age,

279
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,400
then today's Lvchuan

280
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,400
was still that small pet hospital,

281
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:51,920
even couldn't keep running.

282
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:58,400
Shen Mi and others helped solve

283
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,840
the problems that you,
as the head of the R&D department,

284
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,120
should have resolved.

285
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,060
Not only did you not thank him,

286
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:07,640
but you blamed him.

287
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,200
What's wrong with you?

288
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:16,840
You should still focus on the audit department.

289
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,960
As for the R&D department,

290
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:26,560
I suggest Dr. Gu Mingze takes full charge.

291
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,160
He has resigned.

292
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,120
I haven't signed off on it yet.

293
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,160
Technically speaking,

294
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:36,060
he's still an employee of Lvchuan Group.

295
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:37,980
Grandpa, I have no problem with it.

296
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:40,340
I will go and communicate with Dr. Gu Mingze.

297
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:43,860
Moreover, the development
of the new drug is not yet complete.

298
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:46,240
So you can trust me with everything.

299
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,480
I think he will agree.

300
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,664
Okay.

301
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,360
Let's settle then.

302
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,096
Do the two of you

303
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,920
have any other opinions?

304
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,248
That's it.

305
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,168
Here you are.

306
00:19:31,168 --> 00:19:34,720
<i>[Championship]</i>

307
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,060
Why didn't you answer calls, reply to messages,

308
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:46,240
or explain for your resignation?

309
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:51,200
Actions speak louder than words.

310
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,000
So what's your plan after that?

311
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,800
I'm going to have a good time relaxing.

312
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,200
I've already submitted
my application for resignation anyway.

313
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,200
Then,

314
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,960
I'm going to open a B&B abroad.

315
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,000
What do you think?

316
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,640
Abroad?

317
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,240
For a high-tech talent like you,

318
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,960
don't you think it's a waste

319
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,880
to go to the tourism industry?

320
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:21,120
Well, people need to live happily.

321
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,720
If I take on too much,

322
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,600
it really will be tiring.

323
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,280
Then I'm afraid you'll have

324
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,040
to take on this responsibility
for a while longer.

325
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,200
Why?

326
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,320
Didn't you read the details

327
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,000
when you signed the contract with the group?

328
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,640
For a special talent like you,

329
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,760
can only be resigned by signing off

330
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,880
by the chairman himself.

331
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,760
I actually had a hunch

332
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,800
you'll be head of our R&D department
sooner or later.

333
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,380
I heard the list for the pilot hospitals
came out.

334
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:05,580
Yes.

335
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:06,920
It came out yesterday.

336
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:11,160
A total of more than 40 hospitals
in the city were selected this time.

337
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,440
Is Tianlin Animal Hospital included?

338
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,200
I didn't really notice it.

339
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,600
I'll go check right now.

340
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,900
I'll tell you when I get back.

341
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:19,936
Okay.

342
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,600
Do you know why I called you here?

343
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,960
Is Tian Lin already…

344
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,600
It's already selected.

345
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:34,000
Mr. Shen, rest assured, a week ago,

346
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,160
we have been already prepared

347
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,192
for today.

348
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,800
You've been with Zhao for years, right?

349
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,888
Yes.

350
00:21:41,888 --> 00:21:44,160
I have other tasks for Zhao.

351
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,640
I give you a chance this time.

352
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,840
- Okay.
- Do a good job.

353
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,840
I'll give you a promotion later.

354
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,032
Don't worry, Mr. Shen.

355
00:21:52,032 --> 00:21:53,960
I, Liu Shi'an, will spare no effort

356
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,080
to ensure the completion of this task.

357
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,440
Mr. Mi, I can

358
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,800
deliver the list myself.

359
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,480
Why do you have to make a trip yourself?

360
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:06,880
It's fine, I'd better deliver

361
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:07,936
such an important document myself.

362
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,400
Cheers.

363
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,880
This toast is mainly
to celebrate Tianlin Hospital

364
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,320
officially became a candidate pilot hospital

365
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,080
of Lvchuan Group today.

366
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:45,080
This is an important turning point
in the development of Tianlin Hospital.

367
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,520
To achieve such results,

368
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:49,480
thank you all for your hard work
during this period.

369
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,800
Now let's welcome Mr. Shen to say something.

370
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,848
Welcome.

371
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,616
Even though we made in the big list this time,

372
00:22:59,616 --> 00:23:00,704
I hope you all

373
00:23:00,704 --> 00:23:03,120
don't be self-contented
by this short-term success.

374
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,360
Because next,

375
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,960
we're competing for a spot

376
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,920
with over 40 hospitals across the city.

377
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,440
Among them,

378
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,440
there are chain hospitals,

379
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:15,360
and hospitals with decades of history like us.

380
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:19,540
So we have a long way to go,

381
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:21,040
don't take it lightly.

382
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,720
Yes, what Mr. Shen means is
that you can't get self-contented.

383
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,520
But today is a day to be proud,

384
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,040
a perfect day to celebrate.

385
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,920
Let's have a feast. Start eating.

I hope it's a clothing store,

394
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,760
so I can stop by when I'm free.

395
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,000
I mean, after work,

396
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,080
I can come and shop, Mr. Shen.

397
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,240
I wish it's a restaurant.

398
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,840
It's convenient for us
to eat in the future, isn't it?

399
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,800
I don't care what it's for,
as long as it's not a competitor.

00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:04,280
Tian Tian.

548
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:06,480
Come on, you agreed on this, right?

549
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:11,320
Well, in principle, I don't oppose this.

550
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,480
After all, pet healthcare
is a service industry,

551
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:18,160
needs packaging, uniformity

552
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,720
and change.

553
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,560
Shen, what about you?

554
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,640
Welcome.

555
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:30,000
I don't think there's any problem.
Look what he's wearing.

556
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,200
Mr. Chen, you do look good in this.

557
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,840
I'll change it now if you like.

558
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:36,640
You're going to grab a fairy stick later.

559
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,120
Let's do it again.

560
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,320
Stand properly.

561
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,980
Stand straight.

562
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:44,880
Ready, three, two, one.

563
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,880
Welcome!

564
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,520
I've been a doctor my whole life.

565
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:42,080
I only wear a white coat.

566
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,168
Right.

567
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:46,260
Right, my clothes are all worn out.

568
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:47,480
Sorry to hear that.

569
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,940
Here you are. Dr. Shen, Dr. Chen.

570
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:52,260
I'll mend your clothes later.

571
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:54,400
Everyone, just hang in there.

572
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:57,080
I'm sure it'll be over soon.

573
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,224
Trust me.

574
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,120
This is my favorite.

575
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,920
Right, look, there are eggs,

576
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,760
an electric fan, lipstick.

577
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,880
I love lipstick too.

578
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:10,320
Right, this electric fan
is really useful, indeed.

579
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,480
Mrs. Zhang, Mrs. Li.

580
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:14,520
You just came back from Xichong, right?

581
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,880
Don't get me wrong. I'm just curious

582
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,440
about what they gave you.

583
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,740
Look at all this stuff.

584
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:23,880
Eggs, lipstick.

585
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,880
Right, look at this small electric fan.

586
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,320
It's really useful in the summer.

587
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,440
Tian, don't get the wrong idea.

588
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,920
We just went to take a look.

589
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,080
Right, right.

590
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:37,040
Don't worry, we will definitely

592
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,448

It's okay.

594
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:45,200
I understand it's all for the sake of the pets.

595
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,400
I'll take my leave.

596
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,679
We're leaving, goodbye.

597
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:48,864
Goodbye.

598
00:34:48,864 --> 00:34:49,888
Okay.

599
00:34:49,888 --> 00:34:51,280

Xichong is giving away gifts.

606
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,020
I think we can follow suit.

607
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:48,200
They are giving the gift of lipsticks and eggs,

608
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,280
and we could give away this.

609
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,200
First, we can reduce costs by reusing waste.

610
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,600
Second, we can promote our Tianlin brand.

611

Do you also offer eggs here?

618
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,160
We definitely not.

619
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,160
Giving eggs is so tacky.

620
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,808

00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,080
- What? Made by dog hair?
- Right.

623
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,280
- Insane.
- There are cushions and dog hair pillows

624

00:42:40,416 --> 00:42:44,320
<i>♫ Now you are still with me ♫</i>

731
00:42:45,984 --> 00:42:50,240
<i>♫ Traveling through time together ♫</i>

732
00:42:52,096 --> 00:43:00,032
<i>♫ Someday, I'll be completely
forgotten by the world ♫</i>

733
00:43:00,032 --> 00:43:03,232
<i>♫ Leaving no trace ♫</i>

734
00:43:03,232 --> 00:43:07,264
<i>♫ Only you will still remember ♫</i>

735
00:43:09,024 --> 00:43:11,328
<i>♫ My appearance ♫</i>
