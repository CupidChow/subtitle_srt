1
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,600
It was originally given to it

2
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,360
What are you robbing

3
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:43,880
I'm telling you

4
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,360
In this matter

5
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,480
Before it was negotiated,

6
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,040
It can't eat this food

7
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:48,840
Do you know

8
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,720
Come on, come on, get it, Carlo

9
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:50,920
An adult's fault

10
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,000
Children are innocent

11
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:52,720
You give it

12
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,600
Give me what you robbed me

13
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,520
This is for it. It's for me

14
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,800
Shen Mi, I found it for you

15
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,440
What's the matter? What's the matter

16
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,880
I found your personal doctor

17
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,480
Let me introduce you

18
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,120
This is

19
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,600
Domestic cardiology experts

20
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,800
Dr. Li Hongnian Li

21
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,080
And my good friend for many years

22
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,200
Nice to meet you

23
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,160
I'm Li Hongnian

24
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,000
How do you do, Dr. Lee

25
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,880
But I'm afraid this time

26
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,800
You made a trip for nothing

27
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,000
Actually

28
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,880
I would have found mine

29
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,720
Personal doctor

30
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,280
Is the one in front of you

31
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,320
Dr. Tian

32
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,760
Yeah, she's been treating me

33
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,560
That's true

34
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,840
In that case

35
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,280
I won't bother much

36
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,040
My heart just

37
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,480
Is the frequency of jumping okay

38
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,200
There is no big problem

39
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,280
Right

40
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,240
Everything is normal

41
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,480
Now that you found a personal doctor,

42
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,080
That's just right

43
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,480
What does it mean to happen

44
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,280
Grandpa said it himself

45
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,680
Be sure to bring your personal doctor

46
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,640
Go to the old house

47
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,360
He wants to meet in person

48
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:47,600
You guys go on

49
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,720
I'll meet you at Grandpa's

50
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,360
What happened

51
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,360
When will I be you

52
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,200
Private doctor's

53
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,640
That won't do

54
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,240
I wasn't in front of them just now

55
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:28,920
Expose you

56
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,240
It's enough to give Carlo face

57
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,720
Will you listen to me

58
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,880
You listen to me

59
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,480
I'm a vet

60
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,040
I won't treat people

61
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:36,880
And I can't either

62
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,000
Take my professional ethics

63
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,400
Joke about your life and health

64
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,760
I'm not really asking you

65
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,240
Be my personal physician

66
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:43,920
You should accompany me

67
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,000
Is it all right to give a play

68
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,280
You can't act, either

69
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,520
In case your grandfather asks me

70
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,760
Questions about your heart

71
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,480
I can't answer

72
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,480
Isn't that a gang

73
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:54,560
Is it possible for me to

74
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,480
Cover for you

75
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:56,960
That won't work either

76
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,360
Isn't that a lie

77
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,080
I vouch for you on my personality

78
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,480
This scene won't

79
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,600
Hurt anyone

80
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,320
How about this

81
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,440
I promise you one thing

82
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,800
If you promise me

83
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,600
Tin Lam Animal Hospital

84
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,800
All future decisions

85
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,880
You have the right to participate

86
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,120
And all the things

87
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,640
You can negotiate and communicate with me

88
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,880
What if negotiation and communication fail

89
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,720
Then continue to communicate

90
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,400
Communicate after communication

91
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,800
Communicate after communication

92
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,800
Isn't this an infinite loop

93
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,240
Row

94
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,840
Then I'll give you the right to overlord

95
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,640
What kind of overlord method

96
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,320
If in the end we

97
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,360
Unable to reach an agreement

98
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,320
I quit unconditionally

99
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,200
No divestment

100
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:47,720
Is that all right

101
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,520
From today on

102
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,680
You can call me Dr. Oda

103
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,960
Don't go back on your word

104
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:30,680
Dr. Oda

105
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,160
Dr Tin

106
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,760
It's your first time at home

107
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,400
There's nothing to entertain you

108
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,480
Try our new tea

109
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,520
Newly picked

110
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:55,920
Thank you

111
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,080
Your favorite tea

112
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,360
It's all here

113
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,000
Grandpa

114
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,080
I've been waiting so long

115
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:11,880
Grandpa

116
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,600
Meng Nan

117
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,400
Grandpa

118
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,880
Let me introduce you

119
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,240
This is Dr. Tian Tian

120
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,640
Hello, Grandpa

121
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,720
Good, Dr. Oda. Good

122
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:28,840
Make yourself at home

123
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,120
Make yourself at home

124
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:32,840
Sit down, sit down

125
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:34,480
Grandpa

126
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:41,600
Dr Tin

127
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,000
I don't know yet

128
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:44,960
Which one did you belong to before

129
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,000
Graduate from medical school

130
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,800
Where did you work before

131
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:50,760
Grandpa

132
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,120
Where's Dr. Tian

133
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,760
Previously in

134
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,560
The local medical school

135
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,560
What about after learning

136
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,240
I've been in my own home all the time

137
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:58,920
Open a hospital

138
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,800
Work and study continuously

139
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,400
In this way

140
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,400
Private hospital

141
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,600
It's good, it's good

142
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,080
Grandpa

143
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,920
I found it for Shen Mi

144
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,640
Is a cardiologist

145
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,480
It is famous all over the country

146
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,440
And it's my friend

147
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,240
Very reliable

148
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,400
Grandpa

149
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,160
Actually

150
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,240
Such a scarce resource

151
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,440
Put it on me

152
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,480
It's really a little wasteful

153
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,880
If I have anything to do,

154
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,040
I can make a phone call myself

155
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,240
If you can't, just

156
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,240
Why don't you just go to a hospital

157
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,280
Right

158
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,799
What about real life

159
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:37,320
Actually

160
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:39,320
Dr. Tian can be by my side

161
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,600
Check it for me

162
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,440
Actually, it's enough

163
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:42,720
Right, Grandpa

164
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,440
Dr Tin

165
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,880
Dr. Lee said

166
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,360
If he takes over,

167
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,440
There will be two cardiologists

168
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,200
Real-time monitoring of Shen Mi

169
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,760
It was also strictly formulated for him

170
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,640
Diet plan and rest time

171
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:02,800
It will be reduced a little

172
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,760
Go out unnecessarily

173
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:04,840
I think

174
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,480
The arrangement is very

175
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,520
Rigorous and scientific

176
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,480
If you take over,

177
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,280
How would you handle it

178
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,360
I except

179
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,440
Remind him to take medicine every day

180
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,640
And then make some

181
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,360
In addition to basic heart rate detection,

182
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,360
I'm not very likely to restrict his freedom

183
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,520
Don't you think it's a little

184
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,560
Too hasty

185
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,520
Is it even irresponsible

186
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,360
Irresponsible

187
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,640
Mi Zong has a history of heart disease

188
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,120
But at present, his heart function

189
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,600
All indicators are no different from ordinary people

190
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,240
If we continue to

191
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,640
Tell him he's still a patient

192
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,120
Treat him like a patient

193
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,720
Compared with regulation and control

194
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,080
These are just the most basic

195
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,160
Means and methods

196
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,360
What do I think

197
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,640
Nursing of his heart

198
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,040
Is the best thing I should do

199
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,280
In daily life

200
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,880
I may pay more attention to it

201
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,800
Is Shen Zong in a happy mood

202
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,920
Are you happy today? Are you happy?

203
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,640
Instead of reminding you all the time

204
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,920
He is still a patient

205
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,200
Row

206
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,240
Dr. Oda speaks very well

207
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,480
You are quite thoughtful

208
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,440
I have one more question

209
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,360
Grandpa's tea will get cold for a while

210
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,480
Why don't you have a sip first

211
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,320
Meng Nan, how did you

212
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,280
So many questions

213
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,760
More questions are good

214
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,320
Think all the problems ahead

215
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,280
Isn't it

216
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,520
Yes yes yes

217
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,360
You're right about Grandpa

218
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:31,960
You, you ask

219
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,000
Then you ask

220
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,400
In case

221
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,200
I mean in case

222
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,720
If Shen Mi's heart

223
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,680
What unexpected situation has occurred

224
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,320
How would you handle it

225
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,080
Then I'll call 120 immediately

226
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,560
Then lay him flat

227
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,600
Take aspirin, etc

228
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,400
Emergency medicine

229
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,880
Put him on a ventilator again

230
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:52,920
Maintain sufficient oxygen

231
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,120
Then if you weren't at home at the time of the incident

232
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,360
Or the group doesn't have what you said

233
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,160
These situations

234
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,760
And the situation is so critical that

235
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,280
I can't wait for the ambulance

236
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,560
That's not easy

237
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,240
I'll give him CPR

238
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,360
First

239
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,680
Let his head and neck

240
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,480
In a straight line with the back

241
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,160
Lie flat

242
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,640
And then I

243
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,280
Overlapping hands and clasping fingers

244
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,720
Elbow straightening

245
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,880
Use the strength of the upper body

246
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,840
Vertical downward pressure

247
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,320
Keep this rate like this

248
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,840
What about the critical moment

249
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:23,960
And his nose

250
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,880
Blow continuously

251
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:25,720
Keep and so on

252
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,240
You said to do it for him

253
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,720
During cardiopulmonary resuscitation

254
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,880
Blow into his nose

255
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:36,640
Yeah

256
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,600
Don't you know the problem

257
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,000
Let me explain it to you

258
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:40,960
Is

259
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,600
Because when you have a heart attack,

260
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,600
The mouth will be blocked

261
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:44,800
So I can only pass

262
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,680
Nose blowing

263
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,920
Get his airway through

264
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,440
Right

265
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,760
Have you learned

266
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,560
And

267
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,520
If

268
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,240
The special circumstances you are talking about

269
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,960
Just extreme conditions

270
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,600
So what I think in my subconscious

271
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,680
It is also the most serious time

272
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,520
What should I do

273
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,360
His mouth

274
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,720
What if there is a foreign body blockage

275
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,080
I will also put Shen Zong's tongue

276
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,000
Pull it out

277
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,480
Pull your tongue out

278
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,040
You really won't do it too much

279
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,160
Meng Nan

280
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,880
I know you care about Shen Mi

281
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,200
But

282
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,960
Dr. Tian Tian is so professional

283
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,040
So responsible

284
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,920
I don't think there is any problem

285
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:25,680
What do you think

286
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,520
In this case

287
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,440
I'm relieved

288
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,720
Dr. Oda

289
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,680
My grandson's health in the future

290
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,000
Please give it to you

291
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,040
No problem Grandpa

292
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,280
Don't worry Grandpa

293
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:49,960
She can't really do it

294
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,120
Just change her

295
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,560
The one said by Meng Nan

296
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,080
Try again then

297
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:05,800
You can

298
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,480
Treat me like a dog, right

299
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,000
I'm sorry about that

300
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,920
Who made me a pet doctor

301
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,320
Professional habits can't help it

302
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:13,800
Forget it

303
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,800
What about this matter

304
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:16,880
It's finally over

305
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,400
Then don't forget

306
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,520
The commitment between us

307
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:20,960
Let's go

308
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,120
Shen Mi is back

309
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:23,640
Mom

310
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,240
Mi Zong is back

311
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,120
Aunt

312
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,600
Son

313
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,120
Didn't eat well again

314
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,360
Lose weight

315
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,640
Living outside alone

316
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,560
How inconvenient

317
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,560
Let's move back

318
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,640
How old is your son

319
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,800
Are you still so worried

320
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,240
It's okay, mom. Don't worry

321
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:45,480
This is

322
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,160
What about this one

323
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,200
It's my personal doctor

324
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,080
Dr Tin

325
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,040
Hello, aunt

326
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,440
Dr Tin

327
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,800
I always can't sleep well at night

328
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,280
Do you have any good ideas

329
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,040
This mom

330
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,880
What about doctors? They are specialized

331
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,160
Where's Dr. Tian

332
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,960
The main focus is cardiology

333
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:05,760
Yes

334
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:06,840
That

335
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,320
How did Dr. Tian

336
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,600
And we know Shen Mi

337
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,560
Introduced by a friend

338
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,880
Introduce to a friend

339
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,360
Which friend

340
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,280
Carlo, you are so good

341
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,360
Mom, why don't you go home first

342
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,920
We still have a little left in advance

343
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,120
I'm leaving now

344
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,040
Come back more often. Mom misses you

345
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,720
Don't worry, I'll come to see you some other time

346
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:38,760
Goodbye, aunt. Goodbye

347
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,400
Goodbye, aunt

348
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:39,920
See you later

349
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:40,480
Go Carlo

350
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,000
Aunt Gong

351
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,880
This always just left

352
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,080
You'll be back soon

353
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,440
Who is that girl my brother brought

354
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,160
That's looking for the chief personal doctor

355
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,680
Bring it back and meet the old man

356
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,120
I thought it was

357
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,440
Where's Carlo's personal doctor

358
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,800
You are really a child

359
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,280
This dog doctor

360
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,480
How is it worth the old man

361
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,560
What about palm eyes

362
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,920
Dog doctor is amazing. Dog doctor

363
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,640
Why lie to them

364
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,120
This has nothing to do with you

365
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,120
You don't say, do you

366
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,320
Then I'll go back now

367
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,200
Make it clear to Grandpa

368
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,400
My true identity

369
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:54,640
It's very simple

370
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,480
I just don't like it

371
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,320
A stranger

372
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,600
Be by my side anytime and anywhere

373
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,880
Watching my every move

374
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,160
I can understand this

375
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,600
But I'm not a doctor after all

376
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:05,680
I told you

377
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,720
My heart all these years

378
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,720
It's already stable

379
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,160
I just need to take my medicine on time

380
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,480
There won't be any problems

381
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,080
Then you can tell them boldly

382
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,400
Is there anything wrong with your heart

383
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,440
So they don't have to worry

384
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,520
Why lie to them

385
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,440
Sometimes

386
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,680
Deception is for everyone's good

387
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:22,760
I didn't get it

388
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:23,400
What do you mean by this sentence

389
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,480
You don't need to understand

390
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,480
You just have to remember

391
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,680
In front of my family

392
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:27,800
You are my personal doctor

393
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:28,400
That's enough

394
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:29,880
This is what we reached a cooperation

395
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:30,640
Prerequisite

396
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,080
Then I can only

397
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,240
I've wronged myself

398
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,000
Although I'm a vet

399
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,400
Deal

400
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:15,680
My heart hurts again

401
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,640
I'll get you some medicine

402
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:51,960
Dad

403
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,280
Pack up

404
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,000
Let me ask you something

405
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,240
What is it

406
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,200
You know

407
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,880
Is that Dr. Tian that Shen Mi is looking for

408
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:03,400
Know

409
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:04,440
Isn't it just for him

410
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,440
The one looking at the heart

411
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,160
Right

412
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,240
Do you know how he met

413
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,320
Is there anyone to introduce him

414
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,240
This specific situation

415
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,520
I don't really know

416
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,040
Anyway, Shen Mi

417
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,120
People have been chosen

418
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,480
Think she's good

419
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,560
Then respect his opinion

420
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:21,640
Right

421
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,960
Meng Nan, I like you so much

422
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:46,040
Shall we get married in the future

423
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,000
Good

424
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:49,880
Shen Mi

425
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:50,960
I'll help you find

426
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:58,920
I would have found it

427
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,160
My personal doctor

428
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,600
Is the one in front of you

429
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,240
Tian Tian

430
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,160
What do you look like

431
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:38,840
What are you looking at

432
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:39,800
What do I have to see

433
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,320
Heard

434
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,800
I found a personal doctor

435
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,960
And a woman

436
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,040
It deserves to be my brother

437
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,720
That's a tall move

438
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:01,160
Private affairs and business affairs are done together

439
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,720
Can you take your

440
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,960
Dirty thoughts

441
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,680
Collect and collect

442
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:09,920
What's her name

443
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,960
Which hospital do you work in

444
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,520
What does it have to do with you

445
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,480
Are you pretty

446
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,200
I never judge a book by its cover

447
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,560
That is beautiful

448
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:27,520
Have a crush on it

449
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:28,920
Are you nuts

450
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,160
Are you disgusting

451
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:31,840
That will do

452
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:32,840
What

453
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,080
It's not interesting

454
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,800
Your pet hospital plan

455
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,920
Where are we going

456
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,200
Do you have any ideas

457
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:38,800
Which hospital

458
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,440
To reveal

459
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:40,800
Secret

460
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:42,600
What about you

461
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,480
Me, me, what

462
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,200
How are you getting along with your job search

463
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,400
Work has

464
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,640
There is a general direction

465
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,560
What specific aspects

466
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,320
What do you mean

467
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,040
Can't open

468
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,120
Money is a little tight

469
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,000
Why don't I break it for you

470
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,480
It's remarkable for you

471
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,040
Give you a press

472
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,960
Drive well

473
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,200
Old man, how do you ride your bike?

474
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,360
Such a big car

475
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,080
You didn't see it

476
00:21:59,080 --> 00:21:59,800
What's going on? You

477
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:02,760
Girl

478
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:04,840
I'm riding well

479
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,280
Clearly you hit me

480
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:07,880
You also said that I

481
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,280
You are unreasonable

482
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:09,440
You are unreasonable

483
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,920
It's clearly you riding a bike

484
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:11,520
Grinding and chirping

485
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:12,880
Hit my car

486
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:13,520
What's the matter

487
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,320
Come on, come on

488
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,520
Reasonable? Reasonable

489
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,960
How dare a dog bite you

490
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,680
Don't don't don't

491
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,680
Husband, husband, don't, don't

492
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,600
I'll kill you and I

493
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,160
The wild dog bit

494
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,160
You're going to hit me

495
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:34,760
What about this one

496
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,480
It's a revised version

497
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,080
Would you please have a look

498
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:56,920
Shen Zong

499
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,600
Come for coffee

500
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,200
Thank you thank you

501
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,440
What kind of coffee do you have

502
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,080
So bitter

503
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,800
Please eat sugar

504
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,240
Come and put it here for you

505
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,440
Almost look at it.

506
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,840
A big boss like Mr. Shen

507
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,440
Isn't it

508
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,840
How can it be on the contract

509
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,080
Deceive us

510
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,960
You can sign it with confidence and boldness

511
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,720
Can you be quiet

512
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,280
I just saw the fifth one here

513
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,200
This child is serious

514
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,440
But being serious is a good thing

515
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:49,800
Of course

516
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:52,000
If you are serious, it is true

517
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,200
Shen Zong

518
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,480
Don't take it to heart

519
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,000
I said, will you or not

520
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:58,680
Look at the contract

521
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,680
This is a revised version

522
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,760
Just look at the revised part

523
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:02,440
That's enough

524
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,720
You mainly look at the seventh item

525
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:04,720
The first event

526
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,400
Party A and Party B

527
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,960
Conflict due to business philosophy

528
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:11,960
And both parties

529
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,440
In the case of uncoordinated

530
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,600
Party B has the right

531
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,680
Let Party A withdraw unconditionally

532
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,120
Not so much not so much

533
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,160
We will be a family in the future

534
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:20,520
Right

535
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,600
What are the contradictions in the family

536
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,440
Can't say clearly

537
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,280
Unsolvable

538
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,480
No need, no need, no need

539
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,400
Okay, you see, you see, you see

540
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,720
What have you two been muttering about

541
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,240
I really thought I couldn't hear you

542
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:36,960
That's enough

543
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,640
The plan has been given to you anyway

544
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:39,840
You take your time

545
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,200
If you have any doubts

546
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,880
Or is it a problem

547
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:43,760
You can find someone

548
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:44,760
A professional team of lawyers

549
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:45,560
Consult

550
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,800
I'll see for myself first

551
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,800
I'll sign it

552
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,840
What happened to Tian Tian

553
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:10,920
Emergency department is fast

554
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,000
Okay, come right away

555
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,760
You can rest assured

556
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,000
Huzi

557
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,280
In the hands of Tian Tian

558
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,240
What is there to worry about

559
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,520
Is this the wound

560
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,680
Stick it to you

561
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,720
You mustn't touch the water

562
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,440
These two days

563
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,680
Come and move

564
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,040
Look at your fingers

565
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,640
If you think there's anything

566
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,840
Bone-hurting

567
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,200
I still have to go to the hospital

568
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,800
I'll get you a glass of water

569
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:56,760
Good

570
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:57,840
Thank you

571
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,880
His wound is too serious

572
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,120
Prepare for inhalation anesthesia

573
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,240
Don't you need an injection of anesthesia

574
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,320
This is a sharp stroke

575
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,200
Trauma caused by

576
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,560
If you use injection anesthesia,

577
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,200
It is easy to increase the burden on its liver and kidney

578
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,760
Go on, get it

579
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,680
I'll take care of the aftermath here

580
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,320
Go and say hello to the host

581
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,320
I've worked hard for you

582
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,640
Dr. Oda

583
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,000
How's Huzi

584
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,680
Don't worry, uncle

585
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:47,680
Huzi is fine

586
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:52,640
Doctor Tin

587
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,040
Why is Huzi still

588
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,040
Grandpa, don't be nervous

589
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,920
What about Huzi? The anesthetic is not strong yet

590
00:26:58,960 --> 00:26:59,960
In half an hour

591
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,080
To regain consciousness

592
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,680
Thank you thank you

593
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,800
Don't be polite to us

594
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,800
I didn't have time to ask you just now

595
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,080
You and Huzi

596
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,800
How did you get this injury?

597
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:13,960
These slag

598
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,280
I should have called the police and arrested them at that time

599
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:17,960
Forget it, forget it

600
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,120
I don't want any trouble either

601
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,320
As long as Huzi is fine

602
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,960
My heart is steadfast

603
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,520
That's right

604
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:26,920
This tiger, it

605
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,640
How much does it cost to cure this disease

606
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:30,400
You see

607
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:35,280
Grandpa, these are enough

608
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,400
You keep the rest

609
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,440
That's all

610
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,320
Is it so cheap

611
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,400
You happen to

612
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,280
Catch up with our hospital

613
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:42,760
Preferential activities

614
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,280
We have a discount recently

615
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:44,800
Right

616
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:47,920
And grandpa

617
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:49,760
When you go back,

618
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,280
Observe the state of Huzi more

619
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,920
If it vomits,

620
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,560
The condition of drowsiness and loss of appetite

621
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:55,640
Bring it to the hospital as soon as possible

622
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,840
Make a comprehensive inspection

623
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:57,760
I'm worried

624
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,600
Its organs are subjected to

625
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,760
After the impact of external force,

626
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,600
There will be damage

627
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,120
You go to the pharmacy on the first floor later

628
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,280
Take some anti-inflammatory drugs directly

629
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:05,560
Use it in time

630
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,920
Think of it as we sent you

631
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:08,840
No, no, no

632
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,160
This can't be done. Really can't be done

633
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,520
It's all right, uncle

634
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,160
Last time we

635
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,200
The hospital gate is broken

636
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,560
Or did you fix it for us

637
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,200
Between our streets and neighborhoods

638
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,480
It is right to look after each other

639
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:18,640
Don't you think so

640
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:23,760
Uncle

641
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,360
Don't be polite to us

642
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,760
Uncle Zhou, you can rest assured

643
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:28,960
We will definitely do this to you

644
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,320
Call the police for you and find justice

645
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,000
I'm sorry

646
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:33,760
I just finished

647
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,040
You're done

648
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:36,800
It doesn't matter

649
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,440
Let's get on with it

650
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,040
You give me one more minute

651
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,440
I keep a medical record

652
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:57,840
All right

653
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:58,920
What is this thing

654
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,320
This is the tradition of our Tianlin

655
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,560
After every free clinic,

656
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:02,680
Have to stick a love

657
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:03,760
Free clinic

658
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:06,600
Can I have a look

659
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,200
To

660
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:08,800
This medical record

661
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:09,800
What's there to see

662
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,360
You gave that dog today

663
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,280
Put on hemp

664
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,320
The total cost is over

665
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,480
Fifteen hundred dollars

666
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,360
Not counting the others

667
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,280
Medical expenses

668
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,240
Yeah

669
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,760
I-I was in therapy just now

670
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:27,680
You see, right

671
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,960
Fortunately, I saw it

672
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,120
Uncle Zhou, the owner of the dog

673
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,280
He is an old scavenger

674
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,680
He lives by picking up garbage

675
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:35,880
Fifteen hundred bucks

676
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:36,560
You know he's gonna pick up

677
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,440
How many bottles

678
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,920
When he came today,

679
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,400
I didn't even bring enough money for one hundred dollars

680
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,640
I can't be from ruin, can I

681
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:42,360
Yes

682
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:43,720
I know

683
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,640
What about a situation like today

684
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,120
Of course to save

685
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,040
But these of you

686
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,320
What is this? What is this

687
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,040
You tell me Miss Liu

688
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,280
A rabbit

689
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:54,960
Two months you give it

690
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:55,480
How many times did you go to the free clinic

691
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,480
Four times

692
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,160
And this Miss Huang

693
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,520
And this Mr. Wen

694
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,480
These two add up

695
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,720
You've had a total of six free clinics

696
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
The scariest thing is this

697
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Miss Huang's Bomei

698
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:04,960
It's called Altman

699
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,600
One two three four five six seven eight

700
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,320
In just two months

701
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,760
You gave it a free clinic eight times

702
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,880
Are you kidding me

703
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,400
Your hospital is still closed

704
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,200
You're losing money

705
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,320
How do you make a hospital

706
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,400
My father taught me

707
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,160
Healer

708
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,360
With noble sentiments

709
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,600
Practice the art of benevolence

710
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,480
Be worthy of heaven and earth

711
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,560
Be worthy of the heart

712
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,400
This is the tradition of our Tian family

713
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,600
It is our Tianlin Hospital

714
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,440
Up and down

715
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,680
A belief that has always been adhered to

716
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,360
What's the matter

717
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,400
Row

718
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:33,920
Does your father have

719
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:34,960
I taught you a sentence

720
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,480
The simplest and simplest

721
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:40,440
Call for emergency instead of saving the poor

722
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,320
Do you know

723
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,040
You know you've been so

724
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:45,840
To help them

725
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,080
What are the consequences

726
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,320
You're gonna let these pet owners

727
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,840
Create a kind of inertia and dependence

728
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:51,520
You're gonna make them feel like

729
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,400
In this world

730
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,720
Everyone will unconditionally

731
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:54,760
To help them

732
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:55,640
Help them

733
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,360
And all these people know is that

734
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,200
Ask for it again and again

735
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,240
Unwilling to give

736
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,600
This kind of person doesn't deserve it at all

737
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,360
I don't have the ability to keep pets

738
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:04,640
When you stop going

739
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,760
The moment to help them

740
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,240
Pets only come to two ends

741
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,560
One is wandering the streets

742
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,480
The other is to wait for death

743
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:12,640
Do you understand

744
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,000
If you think

745
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,280
I have a point

746
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,200
The plan in front of you

747
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,760
Just sign it

748
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:22,920
Management of Tianlin in the future

749
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:23,880
I'm in charge

750
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,480
I think you're quite right

751
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,920
I should call a lawyer

752
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,200
And professionals

753
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,880
Come and help me with a good

754
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:34,800
Have a look at this contract

755
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,360
Mr. Shen, you don't understand very well

756
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:48,400
You're afraid of me

757
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,000
The mind is relatively simple, isn't it

758
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:51,600
Mr. Shen, you misunderstood

759
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,160
How could I possibly mean that

760
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,200
I was in charge of the R&D department this time

761
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,880
I want to give you a raise

762
00:31:58,960 --> 00:31:59,760
Han Zong

763
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,640
But you have to show your achievements

764
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,040
I want to know now

765
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,840
What factors affect R&D

766
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,320
What about Mr. Shen before

767
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:11,720
Mi Zong

768
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,200
What does he think of the current progress

769
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,160
I'm not satisfied either

770
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:16,400
A month ago

771
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:17,640
We're inside

772
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:18,960
And had a little meeting

773
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,560
What about research decisions

774
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,040
By the end of the year

775
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:22,960
If

776
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,360
There is still no progress in the project

777
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,520
Thank you

778
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,040
Does he have a specific candidate

779
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,160
Now

780
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,280
There is a man named

781
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:33,640
Dr. Gu Mingze

782
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,480
His research direction

783
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,120
How well it matches our project

784
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:37,680
Highest

785
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,480
Gu Mingze

786
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,280
What background

787
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,000
As far as I know,

788
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,000
This man

789
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,960
Undergraduate and master's degrees are in agricultural university

790
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:47,800
University of London

791
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,480
What about the Royal Veterinary College

792
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,520
Got the medical science

793
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,360
Doctor's degree

794
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,920
He was going to stay in school

795
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,040
But as soon as I heard about us

796
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,280
Lvchuan's new drug

797
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,920
It is related to his main subject

798
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,520
That's why I'm going back to China

799
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:07,600
Shen Mi

800
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:09,640
Meng Nan

801
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,160
What can I do for you

802
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:12,680
Shen Mi

803
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,080
I heard that Dr. Gu Mingze

804
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,600
I will be back from England soon

805
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:16,840
I know him

806
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:17,600
I've seen his before

807
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,720
Doctoral thesis

808
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,200
What he studied

809
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:21,880
It seems to be with

810
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,120
Technologies related to targeted drugs

811
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,160
I think it necessary for you to meet him

812
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,080
At least before Shen Hongyuan

813
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,680
I'm not here now

814
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,440
The research and development department, you know

815
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,320
Shen Mi

816
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:33,560
Are you going to

817
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,440
Developed over the years

818
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,160
Hard work and hard work

819
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,240
Give it all up

820
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,200
Meng Nan, I think

821
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,600
Let's be ourselves.

822
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,800
What you should do

823
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:46,600
What do you say

824
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,440
Dr Koo

825
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,560
You haven't been back to Fucheng for a long time, have you

826
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,040
Right

827
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,520
But Fucheng has changed

828
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:19,400
It's really big

829
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:20,719
Very large

830
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:21,920
That's right

831
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:22,960
I haven't asked yet

832
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,120
May I know your name

833
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,320
My name is Han Mengnan

834
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:27,520
Welcome back to China

835
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:29,040
Thank you

836
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,800
How do you get in touch

837
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,000
Contact is contact

838
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,040
But Mi always said

839
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,000
He still has important things to do

840
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:01,600
To process

841
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:02,400
And then what

842
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:03,880
And then he hung up

843
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,440
Give it to me

844
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:07,640
Thank you.

845
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:08,560
Help me keep in touch with him

846
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:10,200
Good

847
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:18,320
Miss Han

848
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:19,840
You're in the R&D department

849
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,200
What kind of work are you responsible for

850
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:24,840
Actually

851
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,600
I'm from the legal department of the group

852
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,200
Legal affairs

853
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:30,880
I thought

854
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:31,440
Dr Koo

855
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:32,680
The coffee is getting cold

856
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,320
Why don't I renew it for you

857
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:35,800
No need

858
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:37,840
I was wondering

859
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,440
When will Mr. Shen come back

860
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:40,960
I have another meeting this afternoon

861
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,400
Would you wait a little longer

862
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,360
He should be here soon

863
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:45,680
All right

864
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:48,720
I'll take this. Okay

865
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:52,200
Hello

866
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,600
How do you do? Is this Dr. Gu

867
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:54,440
Yes

868
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,880
When I picked you up that afternoon,

869
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:56,640
I didn't receive it

870
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:57,920
What's going on

871
00:35:59,000 --> 00:35:59,880
I've already arrived

872
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:01,680
It's here, isn't it

873
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,160
Well, we're in the research and development department

874
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,640
Okay, I see

875
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:05,400
I'm going over now

876
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:06,080
Good

877
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:09,160
Miss Han

878
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:10,800
Just from the R&D department

879
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:11,680
Call me later

880
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:12,840
Said he didn't get me

881
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,520
What the hell is going on here

882
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,120
Dr Koo

883
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:37,360
Research and Development Department

884
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:39,000
Shen Mi has been in charge before

885
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:39,640
It was later

886
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:40,760
It was handed over to Shen Hongyuan

887
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:41,800
So Shen Mi

888
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,320
Have a good understanding of the current situation

889
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:44,760
I think

890
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:45,720
You need to

891
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,200
Talk to Shen Mi first

892
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:50,040
I don't think it's necessary

893
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:06,760
Dr. Gu, what's wrong with you

894
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,520
Is there anything uncomfortable

895
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:10,680
No

896
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,400
What happened

897
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,560
What's going on

898
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,000
Let me out of here

899
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:26,720
Dr Koo

900
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,000
Dr. Gu, what's wrong with you

901
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:28,960
I'm going out

902
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,160
Dr. Gu, what's wrong with you

903
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:31,920
I'm going out

904
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:33,400
You wouldn't have

905
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,440
Claustrophobia

906
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:36,440
Don't

907
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,040
I'm going out

908
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:50,440
You listen to me

909
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,680
Relax and take a deep breath

910
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,480
I'm begging you to take me out of here

911
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,840
Don't be afraid. I'm going out with me

912
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:57,600
Take a deep breath

913
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,200
You can go out soon

914
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,160
You take a deep breath first

915
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,240
Don't be afraid

916
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,160
Take a deep breath

917
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,480
I can go out soon

918
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,560
Is anyone trapped in the elevator

919
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:13,560
Right, right, right

920
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:14,960
I'm stuck in the elevator

921
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:15,920
Come and save us quickly

922
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,160
Okay, just a minute. I'll be right there

923
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:18,560
Thank you

924
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:19,480
Hurry up

925
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:20,560
You see

926
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:21,960
We can go out soon

927
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:24,760
All right, all right

928
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:27,400
You see it's all right

929
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:29,880
All right

930
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:39,800
It's all right

931
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:43,640
Thank you

932
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,720
Thank you just now

933
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,000
No need

934
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,360
No wonder you entered the elevator before

935
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,720
They all seem to be hesitant

936
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,440
I thought I could pass

937
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,120
One's own exercise

938
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,000
Strive to overcome

939
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:58,560
By the way, Miss Han

940
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,240
I'll treat you to dinner if I'm free

941
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,320
As a token of gratitude

942
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:04,920
Dr Koo

943
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:07,760
Sorry, sorry

944
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:08,920
Just heard about this

945
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,440
It scares you

946
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:12,040
You are

947
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,880
This is Mr. Shen from our R&D department

948
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:15,880
Gu Mingze

949
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:18,120
I'm looking forward to your coming

950
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:19,720
Meng Nan

951
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,200
I sent someone who didn't receive it

952
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,560
So you did it for me

953
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:25,480
Are they all colleagues

954
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,880
Help each other should be

955
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:27,880
What's more

956
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:28,800
So is the research and development department

957
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,920
Will you do it for you

958
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,400
All right

959
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,400
Dr. Gu, I received

960
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,040
Are you busy

961
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,880
Dr. Gu, please

962
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,360
Excuse me, Dr. Gu

963
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,080
I didn't expect this Shen Mi

964
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,360
Would do such a thing

965
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:02,680
Actually, he's my nephew

966
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,240
But young people

967
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,960
Be overjoyed

968
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,200
Not down-to-earth

969
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:12,040
Or it won't make me

970
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,360
Be the director of this research and development department

971
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,000
Shen Zong

972
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:16,080
Actually about

973
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,320
Internal affairs of the company

974
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:18,840
I'm not very interested

975
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:20,840
I went back to China to enter Lvchuan

976
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:21,800
Exclusive purpose

977
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:22,640
Is

978
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,200
Study lymphoma targeting drugs

979
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:25,920
Then our purpose

980
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:26,600
Exactly consistent

981
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:29,520
You see

982
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,600
When will you report to the group

983
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,800
I haven't returned to Fucheng for a long time

984
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,360
There are some things I need to take care of

985
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:37,680
You see

986
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:39,600
Is it all right in three days

987
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:40,840
Three days is no problem

988
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,160
We will welcome you in three days

989
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:44,600
Good

990
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,440
Grandpa, what's going on

991
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:07,160
Are you all right

992
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:09,080
Grandpa, are you all right

993
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,480
Quick, call 120

994
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:11,440
Grandpa, are you all right

995
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:17,960
Call an ambulance. Where's the family
