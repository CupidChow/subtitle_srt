Carlo will be fine

6
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:00,480
Not good

7
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,960
Heart rate drops sharply again

8
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,600
The situation is not optimistic

9
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:08,960
Refueling

Your dog

00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,920
Because of congenital heart disease

13
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,040
Myocardial ischemia caused by

14
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,640
It was already late when it came

15
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,600
We are now

16
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,640
I can only try my best to treat it

17
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,840
Come on, come on

18
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,200
Shen Mi, please bless Carlo

19
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,200
If you have a spirit in heaven,

Please bless it and don't leave me

00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,280
Here you go

40
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,680
No, I'll give it to you

41
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,200
Thank you

42
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,640
My name is Tian Tian

43
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,760
Twenty-six years old this year

Animal medicine major

45
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,080
After graduating from Agricultural University,

I'll follow my dad

47
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,640
In Tianlin Animal Hospital

48
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,120
Became a pet doctor

00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,800
Tin Lam Animal Hospital

50
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,000
My dad came from a family

51
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,760
Small pet medical clinic

52
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,680
Operated step by step

53
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,320
Our Tianlin Hospital

54
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,920
It's a big friendly family

55
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,720
Although every member here

56
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,200
They all have different personalities

57
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,440
But everybody

58
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,920
They all have one thing in common

59
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:52,560
Is

60
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,640
A heart that loves small animals

61
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,000
And me

62
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,120
Every day I work here

63
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,920
Everyone feels that their lives

64
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,160
Full of meaning

65
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,320
Happy birthday girl

66
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,840
Thank you, aunt

67
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,840
The cake in this house is delicious

68
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,680
I don't know

69
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,160
Does he remember me

70
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,480
Then you here

71
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,280
I am obsessed with others

72
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,520
What does it mean

73
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,840
Look at your gossip expression

74
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,960
Of course because of the face

75
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,600
You are Yan Kong

76
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,440
You are greedy for people's face value, aren't you

77
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,840
Why did you puncture me

78
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,000
I am Yan Kong, don't you know

79
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:04,960
My stomach

80
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,560
My overnight meal

81
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,440
But aunt

82
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,200
Seriously, it's more than good-looking

83
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,640
Shen Mi is really a

84
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,120

Carlo Carlo

86
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,240
Play with me a little longer, Carlo

87
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,120
Let's have one this time

88
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,960
Is it difficult?

89
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,640
Have a three-piece one

90
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,120
Do you want to give grandpa a good performance

91
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,000
How good

92
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,680
Okay, don't move. Hold on

Come and eat

A very important link

117
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,720
Yes, you sent it to me right away

118
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,600
Come in the mailbox

It's here

124
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,920
Mr. Mi worked overtime last night

125
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:13,960
Haven't slept all night

126
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,960
I'm resting now

127
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,040
Then you have worked hard

128
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,480
Or don't bother him

129
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,120
That's right

130
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,360

Use it well

Chen Zong

135
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,160
Eat it, you snack

136
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,000
Are you just an eating machine

137
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,200
Only once did I practice successfully

138
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,240
What do you think of this dog

139
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,760
Much better than me

140
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,480
Seek

141
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,440
Are you obedient to Carlo

142
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:48,920
Sit down

143
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:50,960
What do you mean

144
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,440
I won't listen to you

145
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,920
I lay down

146
00:09:59,080 --> 00:09:59,760
Where did the waves go

147
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,400
What this says

148
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,800
I went to Hawaii for a holiday

149
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,360
Do you know

150
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,120
People with jobs

151
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,000
Going out to play is a holiday

152
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:11,800
Too lazy to talk to you

153
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,640
Let me tell you something

154
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,840
I pay out of my own pocket

155
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,000
Bought a present for you and grandpa

156
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,440
Battle for righteousness

157
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:22,720
Come

158
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,080
What is this

159
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,120
A gift back to you

160
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,840
I won't rob you of food

161
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:30,760
No

162
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,400
What you said I wanted

163
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,480
Is it your present

164
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,320
What I need is you

165
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,680
Go back to work in the company

166
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:36,840
I am a man with

167
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,360
People with congenital heart disease

168
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,200
In case I can't do it in the future

169
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,280
Who will the company give it to

170
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,800
As long as you don't give it to me, you can give it to anyone

171
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,040
You gave it to my dad

172
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,240
Old Shen Te likes this company. You

173
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,560
Which room is Shen Mi in

174
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,680
Cao Cao is here

175
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,120
Don't say the bag is mine

176
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,400
Shen Mi

177
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,160
Uncle, why are you here

178
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,680
Why is it not welcome

179
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:05,920
How dare you

180
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,240
Active file

181
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,600
I handed it over a week ago

182
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,440
Audit Department

183
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,800
You went east and west in the first half of the year

184
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,160
Expenses for company activities

185
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,200
It has long been overspent

186
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,240
Today's scene

187
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,040
Who spends money

188
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,400
You are mistaken, uncle

189
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:31,880
What about this event

190
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:33,960
A total of invitations

191
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,040
Forty-six media outlets

192
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,240
Now pet entry

193
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,040
Has risen to the top of hot search

194
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,840
More than 90% are all favorable comments

195
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,360
So this is a time

196
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,360
A very successful brand promotion

197
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,680
Of course, we have to go to the publicity fee

198
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,920
Don't understand your new tricks

199
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:49,960
I knew it

200
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,760
Personnel material

201
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,200
Rent a car and horse

202
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,720
It's all money

203
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,720
You young people

204
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,120
Be overjoyed

205
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,280
Look good on the face

206
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,240
Who will be responsible for the loss of the company

207
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,320
Uncle

208
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,400
You are mistaken again

209
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,560
This is not a public welfare adoption

210
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,320
It's a paid adoption

211
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,440
All the pets

212
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,720
Will be claimed in the form of auction

213
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,640
What about the estimated transaction price

214
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,680
It will also be higher than the market price

215
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,320
It's a paid adoption

216
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:19,680
Advance

217
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:21,760
Shen Zong

218
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,880
The general press conference is about to begin

219
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:24,800
You go over there

220
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,040
Then you take Carlo for me

221
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,200
Good come

222
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:28,840
Carlo came

223
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,160
The uncle

224
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,840
If there is no problem

225
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,680
End of press conference

226
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,480
Let's talk again

227
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,080
Dog hair in one hand

228
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,720
If you want to do it, do it well

229
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,960
What about the man I asked you to find

230
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,000
This is a paid adoption

231
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,200
Just make a fuss about this

232
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,480
Tian Tian is back

233
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,360
Zhang Bo is back

234
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,240
Tian Tian is back

235
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,200
Tian Tian is back

236
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,120
Tian Tian is back

237
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:39,920
Aunt Li

238
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,920
Why are you back so early today

239
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,040
Come back for dinner early today

240
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,520
I didn't see you on my birthday either

241
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,360
Be so attentive

242
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,680
What are you doing? You saw a ghost

243
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,400
What the hell

244
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,480
Tian Tian

245
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:10,920
How are you today

246
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,200
Get off work so early

247
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,280
I

248
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,800
Walk, walk

249
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,560
Why are you pushing me

250
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,120
Out

251
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,840
Don't you go to work

252
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,680
A nice surprise

253
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,760
You ruined it all

254
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:24,280
Where's Dad

255
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,560
Didn't you say yesterday

256
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,600
Would you like some mango

257
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:27,960
He said

258
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,880
The birthday girl's wish must come true

259
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:30,800
I bought it for you

260
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,000
You must be your own

261
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,800
You don't have to be

262
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:35,840
Rolling rolling

263
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,400
Stay where it's cool

264
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,240
There's more

265
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,360
Don't come back before dinner

266
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,520
Dad has prepared a surprise for you for a long time

267
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,560
You have to pretend you don't know

268
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:44,680
Do you hear me

269
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,600
Surprise surprise

270
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,240
Go and go

271
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,320
Shen Mi likes you very much

272
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,840
Shen Mi Shen Mi is so handsome

273
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,480
Shen Mi likes you so much

274
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,320
We know that Lvchuan Group

275
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,880
It is second to none in China

276
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,040
Pet supplies company

277
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,600
And you are Lvchuan Group

278
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,760
The future leader

279
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,680
And keen on public welfare undertakings

280
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,120
Harvested such a large number of

281
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:23,880
Cluster holder

282
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:24,920
I wonder if you have anything

283
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,000
What do you want to tell them

284
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,440
First of all

285
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,240
Special thanks

286
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,320
Everyone is interested in us

287
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,360
Green Chuan's support

288
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,160
And for myself

289
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,720
Attention and affection

290
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:36,240
I also hope

291
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,360
This concern and love

292
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,440
You can treat our

293
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,480
Pet public welfare undertakings

294
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,720
There are more

295
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,240
Understanding and support

296
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,680
Today's hero

297
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,480
It's actually our pets

298
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,600
So I hope everyone

299
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,640
You can put attention

300
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,440
Put it on these pets

301
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:52,560
In fact

302
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,160
My grandfather, Mr. Shen Rongxian

303
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,480
From a small hospital

304
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,840
Made today's Green River

305
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,280
And what about our service purpose

306
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,360
Is for all life

307
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,400
Provide equal love and value

308
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:04,720
So I think

309
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,080
Me and mine

310
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,760
What about Grandfather? Actually, he is still far from it

311
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:08,320
And

312
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,600
I'm not the boss either

313
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:11,680
I still have a lot more

314
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,720
Something to learn

315
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,280
I also hope that everyone can

316
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,760
There are more for Lvchuan

317
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:16,880
Understanding and inclusion

318
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:17,560
And support

319
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,080
Thank you.

320
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,120
I like you so much

321
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,480
Shen Mi is so handsome

322
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,080
Shen Mi likes you so much

323
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,920
You are really too modest

324
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
We saw today's event

325
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,760
It is a paid bidding adoption

326
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,480
Then why is it

327
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,800
What about such a form

328
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:37,840
Wait a minute

329
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:45,880
I have something to say

330
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,480
I'm going to represent today

331
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,760
All the caring people present here

332
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,840
Ask him a question

333
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,160
Why are you

334
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,520
Make money from stray animals

335
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,480
What are you doing

336
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:03,800
I am early in the morning

337
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,480
Drive from twenty kilometers away

338
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,080
It turns out that a good adoption

339
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:08,320
It became a bidding

340
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,240
Your heart is too dark, aren't you

341
00:17:12,679 --> 00:17:13,280
Security guard

342
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,240
The security guard came and took the man away

343
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:16,560
Sir

344
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,159
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Let go

345
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,120
Let him go

346
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:20,679
So this gentleman

347
00:17:20,679 --> 00:17:21,480
I also have a question

348
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,320
Want to ask you

349
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,800
We bid through the way

350
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,520
For these people

351
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,680
Abandoned stray animals

352
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,600
Find a warmer home

353
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,640
Love their owners more

354
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,960
Cherish their owners more

355
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,720
Is there anything wrong with this

356
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,000
Adoption through bidding

357
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,440
All the income

358
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,360
We can continue to help

359
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,680
More stray animals

360
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,400
Is there anything wrong with this

361
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,840
Every animal here today

362
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:46,640
All through

363
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,280

Get a new life

366
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:52,800
In this world

367
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,440
There are also 90 million stray dogs

368
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,640
50 million stray cats

369
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,600
Not saved

370
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,520
Not so lucky

371
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,120
If

372
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,280
You really don't want to

373
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,240
Spend money to adopt here

374
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,000
Don't mention it

375
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,080
There are so many out there

376
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:03,880
Stray animals

377
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,440
You could have saved them

378
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,480
No one has deprived you of it

379
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,400
The right to give love

380
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:07,920
Sir

381
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,720
You're sophistry

382
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:11,920
You profiteer

383
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,120
I won't let you sell it today

384
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:17,680
Sir

385
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,640
Get him out of here

386
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:19,240
Let go of me

387
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:21,960
Pull him out

388
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:24,600
Let go of me

389
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,320
Hold him and pull him away

390
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,000
Pull out

391
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,360
Come and save people. Come on

392
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,120
Quickly, quickly, quickly take him

393
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:40,920
Save it. Save it

394
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:44,760
Mi Zong

395
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:47,600
Shen Chen

396
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,440
No matter he goes to the hospital first

397
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,200
So fast

398
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,160
Shen Chen

399
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,400
Come and eat slowly

400
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,240
Eat slowly

401
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,560
There are also

00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,560
Blackie, where are you going

403
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,840
You also eat some

404
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:10,760
Come

405
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:19,680
Come

406
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,680
Something happened to my sister

407
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,560
Dad fell on the road

408
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,680
Why don't you hurry to the hospital

409
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,280
What

410
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,400
Me and Mom are already on our way

411
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,240
Hurry up

412
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,440
I'll be with you right away

413
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:34,960
I have to go

414
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:51,560
Slow down

415
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,600
You meet at the aftermath hospital

416
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,400
You can rest assured

417
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:47,840
Brother

418
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,080
What's the matter? Keep your voice down

419
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,360
Don't worry

420
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,720
The doctor says people are fine

421
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,640
Is excessive fatigue

422
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,360
Fell asleep

423
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,640
Okay, then keep your voice down

424
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,400
Don't disturb him to rest

425
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,160
Keep your voice down

426
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,720
Hurry up and get the list

427
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:00,960
I'll go through the formalities

428
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:01,680
Go and go

429
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,680
Don't wake your brother

430
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,080
I don't make a noise. I don't make a big noise

431
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,280
Go on, go on

432
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:05,960
Go away

433
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,080
See you later

434
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:22,960
Shen Zong

435
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:26,560
Mi Zong

436
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,080
Brother

437
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,000
I told you not to be so tired

438
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,400
Look at what you cook every day

439
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,600
Dark circles are coming out

440
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,640
Give you a hand when you are a younger brother

441
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,320
Rest in peace

442
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,000
Shen Chen, how dare you not answer my phone

443
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,280
Tian Yuxian, where are you

444
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:57,920
I'm here

445
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,000
Good good

446
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:20,440
How do you do

447
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,000
Which ward is Tian Dongqing in

448
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,640
Six two zero six two zero, right

449
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,480
Thank you thank you

450
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:25,960
Come here quickly

451
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,320
I told you

452
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,000
He is in six twenty

453
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,320
Six twenty zero

454
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:52,520
Dad

455
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:55,840
Dad

456
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,000
Dad

457
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,240
It was I who came late

458
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:03,840
Dad

459
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:05,840
How could you

460
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,600
So leave us alone

461
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:11,800
Dad

462
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:13,640
Dad

463
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,800
Who is noisy

464
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,520
I thought you said yes

465
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,160
To accompany us to the end

466
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,000
It's all my fault. If it weren't for me

467
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:20,640
I shouldn't have let you go

468
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,360
Buy that broken mango

469
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,120
Dad, wake up

470
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:24,840
Sleeping

471
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,720
You see if I'm okay

472
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:26,560
Stop arguing

473
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,640
Yes, it's you

474
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,280
Who are you

475
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,480
It's noisy

476
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,600
I'm sorry I

477
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,360
I may be mistaken for someone else

478
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:50,520
Tian Tian, your father is fine

479
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,320
Don't come over if you are busy

480
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:52,840
No

481
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,320
You're not in six twenty

482
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,560
At six zero two

483
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,840
No, I'm coming right away

484
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,880
Thank God it's okay

485
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,560
Are you all right, too

486
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,720
What do you say

487
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,240
I think it's all right

488
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:15,920
Not me

489
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:16,960
Let me explain to you

490
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,160
I didn't mean it just now

491
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,080
I went to the wrong ward

492
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,360
And then I took you for my dad

493
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,680
I'm not saying you're like my dad

494
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,560
Yes, there is a little

495
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,040
I didn't say you looked like my dad

496
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:30,760
Excuse me

497
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,520
One more question

498
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,480
Are you Shen Mi

499
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,160
Excuse me

500
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,280
You have a good rest

501
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,560
What I want is true love

502
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,320
You have a little at most

503
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:03,560
You

504
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:04,520
I'm sorry

505
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,520
Excuse me. Excuse me

506
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,200
Excuse me

507
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,560
Don't say it. I found true love

508
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,080
Tian Tian

509
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:35,520
Interesting

510
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,960
Mom, where's my dad

511
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:39,960
I'll check it out

512
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:40,800
Don't you go in there

513
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:41,400
No

514
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,360
What's the matter

515
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,240
He just fell asleep

516
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:45,840
The doctor said

517
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,120
Let's not go in there

518
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,000
Disturb his rest

519
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,440
What the hell is wrong with him

520
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,920
Why did you suddenly fall down

521
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,960
That is to say, it's a little hypoglycemic

522
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,680
I fainted at once

523
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,000
Hypoglycemia

524
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,640
How normal my dad usually has blood sugar

525
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,520
What the hell is wrong with him

526
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:04,960
How come all of a sudden

527
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,480
Mom was right

528
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,240
Listen to your aunt. You guys

529
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,600
What do you want to talk to us about

530
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:13,720
It's nothing

531
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,320
Sister, there you are

532
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,360
Why aren't you going

533
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,520
You're not staying with mom and dad

534
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,200
Why are you going

535
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,280
Dad's in the hospital

536
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,480
I'll buy him some daily necessities

537
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,400
Mom, isn't it hypoglycemia

538
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,560
Why are you still in hospital

539
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,720
Is hypoglycemia

540
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,600
But the doctor said

541
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,760
I have to be hospitalized for a few days to observe

542
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,520
See what the reason is

543
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:40,120
Tian Tian

544
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,720
Give it to your brother

545
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,720
That's enough

546
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,720
You take care of the hospital

547
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,480
Your father can rest at ease

548
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,120
Mom really doesn't need me

549
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,680
You really don't have to go back

550
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,840
Then Yu Xian, you stay with your parents

551
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,120
I'll go back to the hospital first

552
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,160
Mom

553
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,280
It's okay

554
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,240
Mom is really

555
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,200
I'm at the door

556
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,600
You won't let me go in and see Dad

557
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,440
Forget it, forget it

558
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,720
Let's listen to the doctor

559
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,080
I'll come back in the evening

560
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,000
What's wrong with you

561
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:17,840
Why don't we take a picture

562
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:18,680
Good

563
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,200
Wrong

564
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,800
There is something wrong with the dog's heartbeat

565
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,600
If you can't, you have to send it to the hospital quickly

566
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,040
Wen Jing Lai

567
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:40,880
This is this month's

568
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:41,760
Drug delivery document

569
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:42,520
You check it

570
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:43,280
Good

571
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,960
Wen Shizuta Peilan, come and help me

572
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,200
What's the matter

573
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:48,480
Quick, quick, quick

574
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,080
What's the matter? What's the matter

575
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,160
Nothing, nothing

576
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,480
One, two, three

577
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:53,840
Blood oxygen saturation is lower than

578
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:54,520
Eighty percent

579
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,720
Prepare for oxygen inhalation and surgery

580
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:08,960
Why are you up

581
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,440
The doctor said you had a concussion

582
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,160
You take an extra day off

583
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,360
Why don't you lie here for me all day

584
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:15,480
You'd better get back to work

585
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,560
Thank you for taking me to the hospital

586
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:21,520
Nothing

587
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:24,440
Brother

588
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,120
I know who did this

589
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:49,440
Brother

590
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,440
Although he is my father

591
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,160
But don't give me face

592
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,120
Hit him hard

593
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,280
See you later

594
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:19,880
Looking for the total, looking for the total

595
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,200
Just a moment, please. Just a moment

596
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,560
Looking for this review

597
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,280
I've already handed it in

598
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,920
I also took care of what should be taken care of

599
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,360
I also have difficulties

600
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:28,840
You're fine

601
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,040
It's all done, isn't it

602
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:31,560
So you are now

603
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,360
You can leave Lvchuan now

604
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,000
Looking for the total, looking for the total

605
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:34,360
Mi Zong

606
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:35,800
I thought you said

607
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:36,960
As long as I put this

608
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,360
The kickback was confessed

609
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,160
Will you be lenient with me

610
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:41,760
Dismiss you

611
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,200
It's already for you

612
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,440
The most lenient treatment

613
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:46,440
Do you understand

614
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,080
See you later

615
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,440
You can do it with Shen's surname

616
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:51,560
Your uncle and I

617
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,200
When we were together,

618
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,040
I haven't got you yet

619
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:54,440
What are you looking at

620
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,360
Mr. Tian cooperated happily

621
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,360
Happy cooperation

622
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,000
Happy cooperation

623
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,280
You're out of the hospital

624
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,320
Then I'm not afraid of you, uncle

625
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,240
Do you miss me

626
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,440
You can live if you are in poor health

627
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,520
I'll talk to Mr. Tian for you

628
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:19,400
Sign all the contracts

629
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,360
I'm sorry, Mr. Tian

630
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,360
This contract can't be signed

631
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:32,760
Shen Mi

632
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,240
What do you mean, Shen Mi

633
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,880
That batch of raw materials provided by your company

634
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:38,720
Sampling results

635
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:40,440
Does not meet the standards of Lvchuan

636
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,320
I'm sorry

637
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:46,600
Shen Mi

638
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,080
Shen Hongyuan

639
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:48,920
After me

640
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,200
Cooperate with you Lvchuan again

641
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,440
I write backwards in Tian Zi

642
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:52,800
Shen Mi

643
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,480
If you have any questions about your uncle, you can make them

644
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:58,880
Things that hurt Lvchuan's reputation

645
00:31:58,880 --> 00:31:59,600
Can't do

646
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:02,400
Uncle

647
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,120
That's what I want to tell you

648
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,320
If you are interested in me

649
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,520
Really if there's anything

650
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,080
Words of opinion

651
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,000
You can tell me directly

652
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,120
But please don't make any

653
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,160
Hurt Lvchuan Group

654
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,200
A matter of reputation

655
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,680
Who is hurting the interests of the group

656
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:20,680
Things in the afternoon

657
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,200
You don't want Grandpa to know, do you

658
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:24,600
What's going on this afternoon

659
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,320
Looking for the total, looking for the total

660
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,160
I have one thing

661
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,160
Don't be angry

662
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:38,960
It's all my fault

663
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:39,920
It's all my fault

664
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,160
What's the matter

665
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:42,880
I'm Carlo

666
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:45,480
What happened to Carlo

667
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,240
Carlo was killed by me

668
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:47,840
I lost it

669
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,160
Lost

670
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,000
This is his saliva towel

671
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:56,680
This, this, this

672
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:57,760
Saliva towel

673
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:58,800
It was found in front of the hospital

674
00:32:58,920 --> 00:32:59,840
This is at the gate of the hospital

675
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:00,560
Surveillance video

676
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:03,040
This dog thief is too arrogant

677
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:05,800
It's her

678
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,240
You always know her

679
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,240
I don't care about you

680
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,240
In what way

681
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,280
Find this woman

682
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,800
Good looking, always. I'll go right away

683
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:12,440
Right away

684
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,080
This Samoyed

685
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,000
He's eight years old

686
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:43,840
Have heart disease

687
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,760
Yeah it's too dangerous

688
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,120
It's a loss to meet you

689
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:47,960
That's right

690
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:49,960
Take a picture of it

691
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,880
Start everyone to find it

692
00:33:58,560 --> 00:33:59,760
Send it to our customer base

693
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,680
This is what I did this afternoon

694
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,640
At the entrance of the People's Hospital

695
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:03,239
Parking lot

696
00:34:03,239 --> 00:34:04,560
Found the white Samoye

697
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,080
Looking for the owner of the dog

698
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,520
Please help spread it

699
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:36,759
Wait

700
00:34:37,279 --> 00:34:38,279
It is always thought that

701
00:34:38,279 --> 00:34:39,960
Is a negative state

702
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,799
People try to fight for it with hard work

703
00:34:43,319 --> 00:34:45,400
To fill the gap of waiting

704
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:49,239
However

705
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,560
Waiting for family members

706
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,840
It is a family waiting

707
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:55,920
Waiting for hope

708
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:57,440
Waiting for him

709
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,440
The moment to regain faith

710
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,920
Waiting for the separated people

711
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,640
It's about the world

712
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,600
Blessings full of kindness

713
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:13,720
Empathy

714
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,320
Anxiety about others' separation

715
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,080
You can taste it

716
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,080
The joy of every meeting

717
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,960
May every waiting

718
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,520
Turn into a lighthouse

719
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,520
Bring light to the lost

720
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:35,280
Is anyone here

721
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:38,320
Is anyone here

722
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:40,880
Is anyone here

723
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:44,520
How do you do

724
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,160
What can I do for you

725
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:48,640
Yes

726
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:49,640
You found it

727
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:50,560
Has our family come to light yet

728
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,040
This is your dog

729
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:53,840
Right, right, right

730
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,000
Then you come with me

731
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,080
You really have to be careful next time

732
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,480
How dangerous it is today

733
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:02,920
Thank you

734
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,200
I have met a kind-hearted person

735
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:08,520
Big white

736
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,400
Dabai came back with Dad

737
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:14,240
Be angry

738
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,360
Blame me for losing it. This is

739
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,840
Dabai is fine

740
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:18,760
Go back with Dad

741
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,320
Big Brother

742
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,240
Are you sure this is your dog

743
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,400
Samoyed looks alike

744
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,520
You're not mistaken, are you

745
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,320
How can this, this, this be mistaken

746
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,280
When I look at the photos,

747
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,040
I recognized it

748
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,000
I brought all the dog certificates

749
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,280
This puppy is at least eight years old

750
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,200
Have heart disease

751
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:47,520
Big white

752
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,200
Come home with Dad

753
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,160
You're still making trouble

754
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:54,160
Big Brother

755
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,920
How big is this white

756
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:58,560
Three years old

757
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,000
Didn't it say on the dog license

758
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:01,760
I am now

759
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:02,920
Can you take it away now

760
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,240
This liquid is not finished yet

761
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,120
Otherwise

762
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:06,840
Wait for the liquid to be delivered

763
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,000
You can take it home again

764
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,480
No need

765
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:10,840
You see how strong it is

766
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:12,840
You don't have to lose this

767
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:13,720
On this point

768
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:14,880
It won't take long

769
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,600
Are you in a hurry

770
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,120
I'm in no hurry

771
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,360
What's my hurry

772
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,440
It's safe here

773
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,120
Why don't you have a cup of tea with me

774
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,040
Wait together for a while

775
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,880
It's over soon. Soon

776
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,440
All right, then

777
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:31,960
Come with me. Okay

778
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,000
Big Brother drinks tea first

779
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,040
Thank you thank you

780
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:51,880
Dabai is so cute

781
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,000
You must have photographed it at ordinary times

782
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Lots of photos

783
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:54,640
That is

784
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,760
I just changed my mobile phone recently

785
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,600
Otherwise, it's all their photos

786
00:37:58,800 --> 00:37:59,400
They

787
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:00,760
You got another dog

788
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:01,400
Keep it company

789
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:02,680
There are several

790
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:04,520
Me

791
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:05,360
Just love dogs

792
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,520
I can see that you love dogs

793
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:13,480
How much money can I only sell

794
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:17,760
No

795
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,520
What money to sell

796
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:22,400
Big Brother

797
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,480
Stop beating around the bush and make an offer

798
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,880
Okay, that's a showdown

799
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:37,880
Don't beat around the bush

800
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:39,440
This Samoyed

801
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,600
The appearance is very good

802
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,440
How can you sell it for 2,000 yuan?

803
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,680
They are all adult dogs and can't be sold

804
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:45,680
Can't sell

805
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:47,040
Then why do you need it

806
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,000
Send it to the dog meat restaurant

807
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:52,680
OK, then you make an offer

808
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,840
Three hundred and one boutique price

809
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,760
Three hundred is three hundred

810
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:58,560
But

811
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,400
You have to talk to me somewhere else

812
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,000
You

813
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:03,040
You

814
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,360
What are you doing? You give me

815
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:10,400
You come back here

816
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,040
No

817
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:12,640
What are you arresting me for

818
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,800
Where's the Samoyed you stole

819
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:15,880
It's infusing in the observation room

820
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:17,960
I didn't steal it

821
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,640
How did I steal it

822
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:21,200
Carlo

823
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:22,040
You got me wrong

824
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:23,080
No

825
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:23,600
Carlo

826
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,120
You really misunderstood Carlo

827
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,080
That's the dog thief

828
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,920
You hear me out

829
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:34,760
That man

830
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,160
Open a pet hospital

831
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,480
Stealing and selling dogs

832
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,320
Don't deserve to talk to me

833
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:50,480
Carlo

834
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:51,960
Carlo came

835
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:59,960
No, I have a cell phone

836
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,360
It's not my cell phone that can prove it

837
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,080
No, you wait a minute

838
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:13,760
Don't you go

839
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:14,920
Don't you go

840
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,240
You really misunderstood me

841
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,400
I'm not a dog dealer

842
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:18,640
That, that

843
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,240
The dog dealer is the one

844
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,280
Pretend to be a dog owner

845
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,400
And then I recorded it

846
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:23,400
I'll find it for you

847
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:24,880
If I were a dog dealer,

848
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,040
How could I possibly record it

849
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,600
Why is my mobile phone black screen

850
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:31,680
It's broken

851
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:32,280
Just now

852
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:34,720
Maybe it's broken

853
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:36,560
It's a good thing mine isn't broken

854
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:43,920
I

855
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:45,920
I'm here

856
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,320
It's not that you misunderstood

857
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,600
I was supposed to save

858
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:49,800
Don't show up in the future

859
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,000
In front of me and Carlo

860
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,280
Or I wouldn't be like today

861
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,160
So polite

862
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:04,000
You really misunderstood me
