1
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:42,960
What the hell is wrong with you

2
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,200
Can you tell me something about it

3
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:48,840
I'm okay

4
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,120
I used to

5
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,880
Had a dog

6
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,640
Is one

7
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,920
Abandoned small border herdsmen

8
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,360
Called Zaizai

9
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,320
When I first came home,

10
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,240
Less than three months

11
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:44,480
It's just this big, isn't it

12
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,960
Dad, is this for me

13
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:52,920
Do you like it

14
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:53,840
Like

15
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,960
Then give it a name

16
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,680
Then I'll call you Zaizai in the future

17
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,680
When I came, I was pitifully thin

18
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,760
Don't let touch or hold

19
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,880
It took me about half a year

20
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,800
Just let it gradually adapt

21
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,120
My new master

22
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,520
Intermediate process

23
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,120
It's really hard

24
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,280
Slow down

25
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:27,800
That's right

26
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,880
The one for Carlo now

27
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:32,920
Fresh grain

28
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,840
That's when I was

29
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,520
In order to make it grow up well,

30
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,920
Try it over and over again

31
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,160
Matched out

32
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,840
I really love it

33
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,400
It can be said that

34
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,360
When I was growing up,

35
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,400
It spent it with me

36
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,240
I thought we'd be

37
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,440
Like this all my life

38
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,280
Be happy and be happy

39
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,240
But I forgot

40
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,480
Man's life is for dogs

41
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,040
It's too long

42
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,880
Wake up Zaizai

43
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,640
Zaizai, wake up, wake up

44
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,120
Zaizai, wake up, wake up

45
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,800
Wake up Zaizai

46
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:18,760
Wen Jing, hurry up

47
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,480
Hemostasis, hemostasis

48
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,280
Get the gauze quickly

49
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,960
Wake up, wake up, wake up, boy

50
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,360
Since then

51
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,040
I can't afford it anymore

52
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,520
The scalpel is gone

53
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,040
Where's Tian Tian

54
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,880
How's Huzi

55
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,480
Massive hemorrhage of spleen

56
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,360
I couldn't save it either

57
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,080
Rupture of spleen

58
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,320
There are no symptoms in the early stage

59
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:34,400
And Huzi

60
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,760
Large area infection of whole body

61
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,120
It can last until now

62
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,400
It's not easy already

63
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,560
Even if your father is here today

64
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,200
He can't come back to heaven either

65
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,760
You didn't expect it, did you

66
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:38,600
I am a man

67
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,120
Such an unqualified doctor

68
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,120
No

69
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,400
You are

70
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,760
You don't have to comfort me

71
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,160
I didn't comfort you

72
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,640
The reason why heroes are heroes

73
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,560
Because they have

74
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,960
A high degree of professionalism

75
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,680
Self-esteem

76
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,920
An extraordinary sense of responsibility

77
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,000
You did your best about Huzi

78
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,320
You never gave up from beginning to end

79
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,080
Just like that one time

80
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,480
When everyone

81
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,160
When I gave up saving Carlo,

82
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,520
Just you

83
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,600
Be insisting

84
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,400
No, I can't give up

85
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:18,880
No, I can't give up

86
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,840
Carlo Carlo, come on

87
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,640
Carlo

88
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,080
Carlo got it back

89
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:24,680
Saved back

90
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,080
That's why Carlo survived

91
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,560
You gave it a second life

92
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,760
For Carlo,

93
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:36,440
You are its hero

94
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,919
Compared with those who left unfortunately,

95
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,039
The life you saved with your own hands

96
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,280
Isn't it more

97
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,200
Their owners are also good

98
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,000
And the ones you saved

99
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,200
Small animals are also good

100
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,880
Will remember you

101
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,400
So we

102
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,880
Can we reach a consensus

103
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,920
I thought

104
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,680
You don't think about cooperation anymore

105
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,600
You saw it, too

106
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:43,440
I am a man

107
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,320
Dean who can't get on the operating table

108
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,120
Will affect

109
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,560
Customer's judgment on Tian Lin

110
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,680
If you Lvchuan

111
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,600
Have concerns

112
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,600
These questions

113
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,400
It's not something you should think about

114
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,160
Fear and Difficulties

115
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,960
Aren't they all surmountable

116
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,640
Thank you for your trust

117
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,800
Happy cooperation

118
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,000
Happy cooperation

119
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,000
Han lawyer

120
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,160
Dr Koo

121
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:53,960
What a coincidence

122
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,200
It's really a coincidence

123
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,240
I met you on my first day at work

124
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,800
Welcome to Lvchuan. Let's go

125
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,360
Do you have a work card

126
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:23,720
Don't mention it

127
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,040
Some things

128
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:25,760
Not overnight

129
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,720
Can be changed

130
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,440
But it's okay

131
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,800
Lvchuan R&D Department is on the sixth floor

132
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,360
You're not too tired to get up

133
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,160
Dr Koo

134
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,320
Last time you said

135
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,720
Do you want to invite me to dinner

136
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:44,720
Of course

137
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,000
Any time

138
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,560
Carlo

139
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,000
Carlo, come here

140
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,320
Hug

141
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,440
How good

142
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,120
I miss you so much

143
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,280
Do you miss me

144
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:17,680
I'm sorry

145
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,200
I don't have that much time to spend with you

146
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,520
Or I'm not going anywhere today

147
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,400
How about accompanying you

148
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,840
Don't go, okay

149
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,040
Sit down

150
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,200
Sit Carlo

151
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,800
Good boy, sit down

152
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,120
You weren't at the company today

153
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,160
At home

154
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,640
Do you have any plans for the evening

155
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:55,920
At night

156
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,640
Uncle Zhou's side

157
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,560
I don't know

158
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,440
What should I tell him

159
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:05,680
Tonight

160
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,840
Let me go with you

161
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,640
I'm at night

162
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,760
There are some important things to do

163
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,320
Let's make it a little earlier in the afternoon

164
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,320
Let's meet for dinner

165
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,240
What's up

166
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,200
You forget that today is

167
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,240
What day is it

168
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,280
Okay, I got it

169
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,240
I'm sorry, Carlo

170
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,480
I still have something to go out

171
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,960
I can be at home alone

172
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,920
All right

173
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,320
Not wronged

174
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,680
I was wrong, okay

175
00:13:59,280 --> 00:13:59,960
I'm sorry

176
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,280
You have to practice if you don't want to be bullied

177
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,320
Understand

178
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,280
Come as soon as you start

179
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:22,920
My heart is dying

180
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:23,960
Take a break

181
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:24,400
Come

182
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:27,960
Get some water

183
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:28,560
Good

184
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:29,760
Then

185
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,520
Tell me about you and Han Mengnan

186
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,160
What do you want to hear

187
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,680
I can do whatever I want

188
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:45,640
Just talk about you two

189
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,760
When did you meet

190
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,080
January 10th

191
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:48,720
How nice

192
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,280
After going back,

193
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,080
You must introduce us both

194
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:52,920
Cognition

195
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:53,840
Of course

196
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,480
You are sure to become good friends

197
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,280
Let's do it again

198
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,360
Don't let me catch you

199
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,080
I

200
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,240
What the hell is this

201
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,640
Tradition of Tianlin Hospital

202
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,560
Reward love

203
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,680
This hasn't changed much

204
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,080
Yeah it hasn't changed at all

205
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:31,960
A little something

206
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,320
Wait a minute

207
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,280
I also made an appointment with someone else

208
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:35,400
Who is it

209
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,560
Gu Mingze

210
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,040
Did I ever tell you

211
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,040
About the R&D department

212
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,320
I don't want to get involved anymore

213
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:41,920
Why do you want to

214
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,080
Make decisions without authorization

215
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,880
Because I'm doing it for your own good

216
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,480
Gu Mingze's development of new drugs

217
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,720
And how important is the layout in the later period

218
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,840
It's not like you don't know

219
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,200
I can't just watch him

220
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,800
Fall into the hands of Shen Hongyuan

221
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,240
I thought

222
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:58,680
Before we

223
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,120
The place where we met for the first time

224
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,000
At this time of the year

225
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,119
Let's at least

226
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,000
You can have a good meal

227
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,800
Anyway, all these years

228
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,920
You are in a hurry

229
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,560
As if completing a task

230
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,640
Have dinner with me

231
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,520
Rather than this

232
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,880
We might as well talk about business

233
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,000
At least this meal is good

234
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,079
There are still some meanings

235
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,319
Miss Han

236
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,640
Dr Koo

237
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,240
Please sit down

238
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,280
Mi Zong

239
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,240
Dr Koo

240
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:53,880
Today

241
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,760
I'll welcome you on behalf of Lvchuan

242
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,440
By the way, I'll show you this one

243
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,200
I like the small shop for many years

244
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:00,880
You are welcome to be

245
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,160
A member of Green River

246
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,760
By the way

247
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,440
I also introduce you to Mr. Mi

248
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:06,600
After all, he used to

249
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,280
Is the head of the research and development department

250
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,680
For the whole workflow

251
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,720
And future deployment

252
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,880
It's very clear

253
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,640
So I'm today

254
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,320
Miss Han

255
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,280
In fact, before this,

256
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,240
Mi Zong and I

257
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,240
We've already met

258
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,440
It's just a face-to-face meeting

259
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,160
Although it was only once

260
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,560
But Mi Zong's actions that night

261
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,960
It's really impressive

262
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,360
You know I don't like it

263
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,680
Let's talk about business outside

264
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,040
If it's nothing, I'll go first

265
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:43,720
You eat slowly

266
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,320
I'm sorry, Dr. Gu

267
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,320
If you want to go after him

268
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:51,560
I don't mind

269
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,720
Huzi

270
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,760
Huzi

271
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:38,560
Huzi

272
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,200
Huzi

273
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,800
Huzi

274
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,560
Huzi

275
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,480
I'm okay

276
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,560
As soon as Hu Zi left

277
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:41,880
Uncle Zhou

278
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,040
I lost my only partner

279
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,160
At least in this world

280
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,440
And you think about him

281
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:50,960
Caring for him

282
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:52,360
Think of him

283
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,720
He's not alone

284
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:56,760
Isn't it

285
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,000
Small animals are just like humans

286
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,560
Life is too fragile

287
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:12,640
If

288
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,840
I can save Huzi today

289
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,000
You can definitely become with it

290
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,360
A very good friend

291
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,520
If he's still alive

292
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:27,640
It should be, too

293
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,360
Is it as sad as Tian Tian

294
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,760
Do you remember him

295
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,520
Don't you like mangoes

296
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,240
This bowl is for you

297
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,640
Delicious

298
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:50,880
It smells so good

299
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,440
Shen Mi

300
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,000
Are you homesick

301
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,160
I think

302
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,080
I miss my grandpa

303
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,520
I miss my dad

304
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,680
I miss my mother

305
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,360
I also miss Han Mengnan

306
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,520
Gao Zhuo, it seems to be pregnant

307
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,640
What are you going to do

308
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,360
None of us are enough by ourselves

309
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,280
You still feed it

310
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,000
She's pregnant

311
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,240
It's going to have a baby

312
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,200
That won't work either

313
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,120
When you first met me

314
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,760
Why do you share the food with me

315
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,080
You are a man and he is a dog

316
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:36,920
Can it be the same

317
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,520
It's all life

318
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,720
What's the difference

319
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,040
We eat less and we can't die of hunger

320
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,200
But it

321
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,280
I'm sure I can't hold on

322
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,280
Give it

323
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:55,960
Come

324
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,600
Carlo, do you know

325
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,240
The dog we saved at that time

326
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,600
Is your mother

327
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,400
It seems to be dying

328
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,240
Really

329
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,840
This little guy is still alive

330
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:31,040
Looks like you don't have a home either

331
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,360
Why don't you let it come with us

332
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,360
The last puppy alive

333
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:44,880
It's you

334
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:20,680
Dad

335
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,640
Are you feeling any better

336
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,600
Better

337
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,360
Tian Tian

338
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,640
I heard that

339
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,520
You cried today

340
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:44,480
Dad

341
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,840
Do you also think

342
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,600
I'm pretty vulnerable

343
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,080
Tian Tian

344
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,720
A truly vulnerable person

345
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:57,520
It won't be easily shown

346
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,600
Can you be frank

347
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,800
Express one's intense emotions

348
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,440
It's not easy

349
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:08,640
You can cry

350
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,520
Just shows that

351
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:14,400
You put the profession of doctor

352
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,280
Look very sacred

353
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,880
This shows that you

354
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,760
Be grateful for life

355
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,680
Heart of awe

356
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,440
These

357
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,360
It's just you

358
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:33,000
The driving force to keep moving forward

359
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,440
Got it, Dad

360
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,080
Dad believes in you

361
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,760
Come to Carlo and shake hands

362
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,160
How good

363
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,040
Coming

364
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,480
Go Carlo

365
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,880
Management plan of animal hospital

366
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,720
How are you getting ready

367
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,440
It's ready

368
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,400
Get ready right away

369
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,640
Signed a cooperation agreement

370
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,480
It's quite fast

371
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,600
Which hospital is it

372
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,280
Tin Lam Animal Hospital

373
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,160
Never heard of it

374
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,480
Is it bad

375
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,560
The situation is particularly bad

376
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,040
Now poor and white

377
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,880
Will soon face bankruptcy

378
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:15,840
Children

379
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,480
What you do to yourself

380
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:22,960
It's really ruthless

381
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,320
I can't help it, grandpa

382
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,320
Since this is a test,

383
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:29,800
I have to treat myself

384
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:30,720
Drop a hard hand

385
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,640
Prove my own ability

386
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:34,400
Otherwise

387
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,480
In the end, there was no one

388
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,680
Take out the results

389
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,720
How can we convince everyone

390
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,160
Not bad

391
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,080
You can have this persistence

392
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,040
That's what I want to see

393
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:47,600
Come on

394
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,760
As long as you can succeed this time

395
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,560
The way forward

396
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,800
It will be much easier to walk

397
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,080
Got it Grandpa

398
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,120
Then let's do this first

399
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,920
Take care, Grandpa. Bye

400
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,000
The audit department's money has been approved

401
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,600
It should not be enough

402
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,240
Definitely not enough

403
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,320
Shen Hongyuan

404
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,760
You won't lend me money easily

405
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:19,760
But it doesn't matter

406
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,000
I've already given up

407
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,400
From my personal

408
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,560
Out of savings

409
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,840
Your uncle is too difficult to deal with

410
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:28,560
Say it is to

411
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,640
See the return on investment in three months

412
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:32,480
Tian Tian is still

413
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,560
My personal doctor

414
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,160
I think it's necessary

415
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,360
Think of a way as soon as possible

416
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,400
Divert his attention

417
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Don't arrive at the time

418
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,440
Come to Tian Tian's hospital

419
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,040
Get in the way

420
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,760
Please sign, both of you

421
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,520
Do you need to be so formal

422
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,440
This is what Sister Perrin specially explained

423
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:15,560
The service is in place

424
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,000
All right

425
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,640
Shake hands and take a picture

426
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,560
It's not necessary, is it

427
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,480
This is Sister Perrin, too

428
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,520
Specially confessed

429
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,080
Said to hang in the hospital in the future

430
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,080
Look at me

431
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,480
Laugh, both of you

432
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,280
Wen Jing Wen Jing

433
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,640
What's the matter, Dr. Chen

434
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,480
Bring me the prescription food

435
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:52,720
Coming

436
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:58,120
Can't think of a signature

437
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:58,880
Take Tian Lin from

438
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,480
Saved from the fire pit

439
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,520
Now show me around

440
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,320
Row

441
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,240
Then I'll take you

442
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,240
Get to know each other formally

443
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,120
Tian Lin's employees

444
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,000
Walk

445
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,600
Come with me

446
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:12,880
Aunt

447
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,680
This is Tian Peilan

448
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,960
The front desk of the hospital

449
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:18,920
You've met before

450
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,040
Sister Perrin

451
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:21,800
Shen Zong Hao Shen Zong Hao

452
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,240
What about the big and small things in the hospital

453
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,080
You can all ask her

454
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:25,760
She knows all about it

455
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,120
Yes, I am a know-it-all

456
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,440
Ask me I know everything

457
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:29,840
I'll write it down later

458
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:30,880
I'm afraid I forgot

459
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,080
Gentle and quiet

460
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,480
Can you take a look at the front desk for me

461
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,760
I'll go out with Aunt Guo

462
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:39,680
You are busy first

463
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,320
This is Wen Jing

464
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,200
Shen Zonghao

465
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,120
What about our hospital

466
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,280
For these foster pets,

467
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,480
There is a walk service

468
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,120
What about this business

469
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,520
Tian Peilan is also responsible

470
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:50,960
You see

471
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:51,640
This piece is

472
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,800
All kinds of pet snacks sold

473
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:53,400
Are you nuts

474
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:53,880
Let you run

475
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:54,440
Sister help me

476
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,080
Run

477
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:56,840
Uncle Wang

478
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,840
I'll shave one for you today

479
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,080
Uncle Wang

480
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,360
We have something to discuss

481
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,680
You put down the fader first

482
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:03,960
Easy to discuss

483
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,280
That's easy for you to say

484
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,360
Go and see my dog

485
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,600
How did he shave it

486
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,440
Say

487
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:19,760
How to discuss

488
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,440
It will grow back in three months

489
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:24,000
I can't change my look next time

490
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,120
You have another time

491
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,400
Tian Yuxian, shut up

492
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,120
Uncle Wang

493
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:32,920
How about this

494
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,760
What about my trim this time? It's free

495
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,160
And then give it to you

496
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,200
Cleaning ear canal and cutting toenails

497
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,880
There are also three beauty 30% off cards

498
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:41,600
Is that all right with you

499
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:47,920
Oda

500
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,960
I'm doing it for your sake

501
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:50,600
Just promised

502
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,520
Yes yes yes

503
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,080
I'm so embarrassed

504
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,120
Gentle and quiet

505
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,240
Gentle and quiet

506
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:57,920
Coming

507
00:31:59,040 --> 00:31:59,360
Quickly

508
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,280
Do it for Uncle Wang

509
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:02,000
Three-time beauty 30% off card

510
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:02,920
Good

511
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:03,560
Uncle Wang

512
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,440
Really

513
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,720
Let's go, Uncle Wang

514
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,800
I'll shave you like this next time

515
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:15,720
Then take off your banner

516
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:16,480
Don't don't don't

517
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,040
It's hard to get it

518
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:19,640
You can't do this aesthetic either

519
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,000
You've been shaved

520
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:21,960
That's a unicorn

521
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:22,920
What do you know

522
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,640
You're young

523
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,240
Work experience

524
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,360
It's quite rich

525
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:43,040
Have worked in so many hospitals

526
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:43,800
Yeah

527
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:44,800
Because I grew up

528
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,800
I especially like small animals

529
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,480
Determined to engage in pet medicine

530
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:49,640
The reason

531
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,520
Working in so many hospitals

532
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,080
Also for the sake of

533
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,400
Learn from the strengths of many families

534
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,600
Dean Chen

535
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,960
Do you think I can do it or not

536
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,720
I think

537
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:08,280
Yes

538
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:09,440
In this way

539
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,280
You for a while

540
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,920
Go and find a nurse named Wen Jing

541
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,200
Just say

542
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,320
I told you to go through the entry formalities

543
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:23,800
Thank you, Dean Chen

544
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,080
You're welcome

545
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,240
This is Dr. Chen

546
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,760
Rich clinical experience

547
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,280
Work especially seriously and responsibly

548
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,400
You are busy first

549
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:49,720
Dean Chen

550
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,480
Then I'll go to the job

551
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:53,280
Sure

552
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:02,600
What about this way

553
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,800
Is the central disposal area

554
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:04,840
And the bathroom

555
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,000
Wait

556
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:10,280
Are you new here

557
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,800
Yeah, right away

558
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:13,800
Who are you

559
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,080
This is an investor in Shen General Hospital

560
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,440
The thermostatic fader is broken

561
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:18,800
Coming

562
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,880
Hurry up and fix it

563
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,639
You are Mr. Shen

564
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:22,920
Nice to meet you

565
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,120
Can I have a look at that

566
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,239
Of course

567
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,159
You were at Tintin Pet Hospital

568
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:43,800
How is Dean Liu recently

569
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:47,800
He's very nice

570
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,639
And we have a very good relationship

571
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:50,960
He sent me a message today

572
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,280
Want me to go back to work

573
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:52,920
Is it

574
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,239
Come on, it's okay

575
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,320
Then I'll go

576
00:34:59,320 --> 00:34:59,880
Go ahead

577
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,280
How enthusiastic

578
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,280
Your hospital recruits people

579
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,320
Is that so casual

580
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,320
The one named Yue Yue

581
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,920
My perfume smells so heavy

582
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:26,520
How can it be in

583
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,960
What about working in a pet hospital

584
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,480
Girls

585
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,480
The love of beauty is understandable

586
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,120
And she's today

587
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,240
First day at work

588
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:34,720
Should be attached great importance to

589
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:41,920
Let's get her out of here

590
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,480
Her resume is false

591
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:44,560
Tintin Hospital

592
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,680
There is no Dean Liu at all

593
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,960
There's one more thing I don't understand

594
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:49,800
As a hospital

595
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:50,960
Recruiting people even the most basic

596
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,360
Don't you even do back tune

597
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:53,880
That could be

598
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,560
Chen Yifan is busy forgetting it

599
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,320
My first day as dean

600
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,280
What about him? He's a little unconvinced

601
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,000
This is the decentralization

602
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,560
Let him take care of the recruitment

603
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,800
And he recruited all these people

604
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,720
It's not so good if I'm going to open it.

605
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:10,640
Or

606
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,840
Let's just stay and try it out

607
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:13,880
If something goes wrong again

608
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,240
Can you fire her again

609
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,720
You promised me

610
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,560
Things big and small in this field

611
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,480
It's all by the two of us

612
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,560
Joint consultation

613
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:27,560
You call them over

614
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,280
Let's have a meeting

615
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:29,360
And why

616
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,920
Say one question at a time

617
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:31,800
You always have so many

618
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,200
What about excuses and reasons

619
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:35,480
I

620
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,480
It really is

621
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:43,040
I endure

622
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:50,480
This way

623
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Shen Zonghao

624
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,720
My equipment here

625
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,160
Don't say Lvchuan

626
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,600
It is first-class in the whole country

627
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,080
It seems that Mr. Shen

628
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,440
It's really hard work

629
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,160
After all, the R&D department

630
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,800
It determines the future of the group

631
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:11,800
These people

632
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:13,120
From now on

633
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,200
At your command

634
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,000
Other departments of the group

635
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:16,680
If you need to

636
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:17,520
Will also cooperate with you

637
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:18,920
All right, Mr. Shen

638
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,240
After all, new drugs are on the market one day earlier

639
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,560
Small animals benefit one day earlier

640
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,200
You have a heavy burden

641
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,600
Mr. Shen, you can rest assured

642
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:30,960
What about recently

643
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,560
Tianlin has experienced many twists and turns

644
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,280
My father

645
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,160
That is, during the sick leave of the old dean

646
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:35,800
Where's Tian Lin

647
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,000
I also closed the store for a month

648
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,560
We lost a lot of customers

649
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,600
So this time it reopened

650
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,320
I hope everyone can struggle

651
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,400
Bring a new atmosphere to Tianlin

652
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,040
Today, I want to start from the business philosophy

653
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,960
As well as the scope of management and other aspects

654
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:48,880
Give it to everyone once

655
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:49,960
New rectification

656
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,240
I hope everyone can cooperate

657
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:51,920
Below

658
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,800
Please welcome Mr. Shen

659
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:54,920
Tian Lin's investors

660
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,160
Tell you two sentences

661
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,200
Actually

662
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,200
I don't have anything to say either

663
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Anyway, the next thing

664
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,160
What about all the work

665
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,720
I will fully cooperate with Dean Hao Tian

666
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,080
Then let's work together

667
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:28,960
Work together

668
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:29,840
For the construction of Tianlin

669
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,320
Contribute one's strength

670
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:33,160
OK, that's the end of the meeting today

671
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:34,640
Do you think I should

672
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:35,960
Stick a toughened film

673
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,080
What about you, Mr. Chen

674
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:37,840
I'll post it for you

675
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,720
Which one is easy to use when you go

676
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:45,240
How can you just say these two words

677
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,240
Dr Koo

678
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:03,480
Han lawyer

679
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,080
Haven't got off work yet

680
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:08,560
Stay up late together

681
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:11,280
Sure

682
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:23,960
Han lawyer

683
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,520
How long have you been with Green Chuan Company

684
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:28,800
Coming right after graduation

685
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,360
There is a problem I think

686
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,080
Ask you for advice

687
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:33,840
You ask

688
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,440
You're in the legal department

689
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,080
Why do you care so much

690
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:39,240
Progress of R&D Department

691
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,000
What is your relationship with Shen Mi

692
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,400
The two of us

693
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,800
Family is a family friend

694
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,080
I have known each other since I was a child

695
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,520
Because of the research and development

696
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,800
About the future of Lvchuan

697
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:56,680
So I will care about Shen Mi

698
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:59,280
Got it

699
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,040
Understand

700
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,240
I understand that you are concerned about him

701
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:07,080
But sometimes it is inevitable to misunderstand

702
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:07,920
Support wrong feelings

703
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,480
What do you mean

704
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:12,560
Han lawyer

705
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:14,640
I actually quite understand

706
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,480
What you do

707
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,000
I also know

708
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:17,760
Many companies have it

709
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,080
Complex interpersonal relationships

710
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:21,120
Family businesses like Lvchuan

711
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,040
Definitely more so

712
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:24,440
But my job requires

713
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:25,800
Study wholeheartedly

714
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,120
Can't have any distractions

715
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,720
I don't want to participate in the infighting of the company

716
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:30,960
I don't want to ask more inside information

717
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:32,760
Dr Koo

718
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:33,800
I don't think you are

719
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,280
What is the misunderstanding about Shen Mi

720
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:36,920
I can explain

721
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:37,440
Shen Mi, he is not

722
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,680
The kind of person you imagine

723
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:41,680
How about we

724
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,040
Let's talk about something else

725
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,360
You said there was a meeting during the day

726
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:58,640
I thought

727
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,240
You have a lot to say

728
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:01,880
It turned out to be me

729
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:03,400
Come on, come on, talk a lot

730
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,960
What was the sole purpose of the meeting

731
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,520
Is to establish your prestige

732
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:08,480
Look at Chen Yifan

733
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,400
I won't accept you

734
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,080
And the operation of an enterprise

735
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,560
It is better to have only one decision maker

736
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:14,880
There can only be one person talking

737
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:16,520
Otherwise, there are so many people talking

738
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:17,520
Who exactly should they listen to

739
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:18,200
Don't even know

740
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:19,960
As for what I have

741
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,360
What kind of ideas

742
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:22,600
I'll tell you in private

743
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,960
Then it's private now

744
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,240
Why don't you tell me something about it

745
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,520
Your management of Tianlin

746
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:29,600
Do you have any suggestions

747
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,640
There are a lot of suggestions

748
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,280
I'll talk to you slowly later

749
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:35,680
Where are we going to eat

750
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:36,720
Be right there

751
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:54,440
Thank you

752
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,280
Delicious

753
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:06,600
Where were you just now

754
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:07,720
Before your store

755
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:08,560
Recharge activity

756
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,880
It's a thousand for two hundred

757
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:10,960
But don't you think two hundred

758
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:11,560
For customers

759
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:12,680
Is the allure too low

760
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:13,600
So I think

761
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:14,440
Change it to fill 1000

762
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:16,280
It is more appropriate to send a 20% discount card

763
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:17,640
Although the essence of the two is the same,

764
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:18,320
But I think

765
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:20,360
What about 20% discount cards for customers

766
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:21,480
Theirs

767
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:23,200
There will be more room for imagination

768
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,160
And with preferential strength

769
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:26,760
You can also pull

770
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:28,120
Other aspects of consumption

771
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:29,000
I remember this

772
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:30,280
On top of this

773
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:31,800
I think adding another one

774
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:32,840
Charge eight hundred

775
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,120
Send a 10% discount card

776
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:36,400
Then who will choose a 10% discount card

777
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,560
Of course not

778
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:40,720
That is

779
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,040
Further, in order to set off

780
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:43,200
Charm of 20% off card

781
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,640
And pull the stored value strength

782
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,840
You are very resourceful

783
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:49,720
I didn't expect you to be interested in running a family

784
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:50,640
A small hospital

785
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,120
So hard work

786
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:53,280
Enterprises are big or small

787
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:54,920
What about the business philosophy

788
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:55,960
It is also interlinked

789
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:57,560
What is the idea

790
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:00,680
Is the framework or the constraint

791
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:01,800
But the most important thing

792
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:03,360
Do you know what it is

793
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:04,280
What

794
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:05,400
Is a talented person

795
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,120
Speaking of talents

796
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:08,640
Do you think

797
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,280
How is Tianlin's talent reserve

798
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:12,000
Are all of them unique

799
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:14,960
Actually, I was just about to tell you

800
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:15,840
This matter

801
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:17,200
Say it

802
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:20,760
What's the matter

803
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:22,600
Now Tian Lin

804
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:25,320
These employees may want to

805
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:27,880
Full dismissal

806
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:29,000
Leave none
