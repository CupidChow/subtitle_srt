00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,560
Grandpa, we'll go check the blood pressure.

27
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,420
Young people

28
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:49,720
are not very particular.

29
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,600
Measuring with bare hands?

30
00:01:58,144 --> 00:01:59,200
Good job.

31
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,240
You don't praise me for my quick reaction

32
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,600
but criticize me?

33
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,560
My brother and she have left?

34
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,880
They went to his room
to measure blood pressure.

35
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,240
Okay, the blood pressure measurement
is almost done.

36
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,080
- It's time to go out.
- Give me a number.

37
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,480
80, 120, all normal.

38
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,320
I'm going to see the dog.

39
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,680
Why seeing a dog?

40
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,160
Let me introduce Dr. Tian to you.

41
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,320
No introduction needed, Grandpa, I'm shy.

42
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,960
What are you shy about?

43
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,720
You always mess around.

44
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,720
Okay, let's go.

45
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,960
Grandpa, what's wrong? Are you feeling unwell?

46
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,600
My heart feels uncomfortable.

47
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,000
Mr. Han, get me the medicine.

48
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,960
I… I forgot to bring it.

49
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,880
I forgot, it's with me.

50
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,320
Then I'll pour you a glass of water.

51
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,760
- I'll do it.
- Okay.

52
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,880
Grandpa, here's your hot water.

53
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:30,520
Grandpa, you also have a bad heart?

54
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,640
Dr. Tian,

55
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,900
this has been an old problem
of mine for decades.

56
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,240
Old problem?

57
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,920
When did it begin? Why didn't I know it?

58
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,840
Shen Mi's father

59
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,840
also had heart problems.

60
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:52,060
He has had a bad heart since he was little.

61
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:54,040
I'm really worried

62
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,400
about his physical condition.

63
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:03,940
Dr. Tian, I have an unfair request,

64
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:07,040
but I hope you can understand.

65
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,520
Grandpa, please go ahead.

66
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,840
I hope

67
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,440
you and Shen Mi

68
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,079
can live together.

69
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,840
What happened to Carlo?
Should we go check on it?

70
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,120
Well, it's okay.

71
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,860
Carlo…

72
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,360
It's okay, it might be hungry.

73
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,800
You continue to listen to Grandpa's story.
Don't interrupt him.

74
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,880
Dr. Tian,

75
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,000
the heart problem

76
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,960
might lead to a heart attack.

77
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,000
Besides,

78
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,600
there are precedents.

79
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:48,040
Moreover, it's not convenient for you

80
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,200
to shuttle back and forth every night.

81
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,440
So I think,

82
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,640
why not just live here?

83
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,640
Grandpa,

84
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,360
actually I don't bother.

85
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,960
Moreover, living here is also not convenient.

86
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,048
Dr. Tian,

87
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,940
are you married?

88
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:04,960
Or

89
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,760
do you have a boyfriend?

90
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,560
That's me.

91
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,592
She has.

92
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,560
None of that.

93
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,600
Well then there's no problem.

94
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,240
Sir, wouldn't it be inappropriate?

95
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,000
Dr. Tian is still a young lady.

96
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,120
Living with Shen Mi,

97
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,480
I'm afraid it won't be appropriate.

98
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,360
That would definitely not be good.

99
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,640
Physicians have a benevolent heart.

100
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,920
They heal the sick and save lives.

101
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:37,240
Where is there a gender divide in that?

102
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,040
Don't overcomplicate it

103
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,460
in your minds.

104
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:44,140
This is very normal.

105
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:45,360
Yes.

106
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,160
Dr. Tian,

107
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,360
I beg you,

108
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,840
can you save my eldest grandson?

109
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,240
Save me, please.

110
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,840
There's also a younger grandson.

111
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:01,840
If anything really happened to Shen Mi,

112
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,000
I…

113
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,080
Grandpa, don't worry, don't get upset.

114
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,160
I…

115
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,760
I…

116
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,320
I promise you, is that okay?

117
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,440
Okay.

118
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,880
Then

119
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,400
it's settled.

120
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:28,280
You two must not deceive.

121
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,640
I might

122
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:34,640
come to check unannounced at any time.

123
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,888
Mr. Han,

124
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,960
let's go.

125
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,800
We won't disturb the young ones.

126
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,080
Uncle, Grandpa, let me see you out.

127
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,100
No need, we can walk on our own.

128
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,140
You two chat first, okay?

129
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:53,560
- Take care, see you.
- Goodbye, Grandpa.

130
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,760
Come on, take it slow.

131
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,080
Sir, we shouldn't meddle
with this love affair as old men.

132
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,120
It's not good.

133
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,200
Did I?

134
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,120
You are not suffering from heart disease.

135
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,760
That time at dinner,

136
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,640
you let Mengnan cooperate
with Gu Mingze at work.

137
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,520
You think I don't know what you're thinking of?

138
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,600
I can't hide anything from you.

139
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,160
Didn't you say it?

140
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,080
For young people's affairs,

141
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,120
let them solve them by themselves.

142
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,960
We should stop interfering.

143
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,640
The young people nowadays

144
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:41,344
care about face, think a lot, and do less.

145
00:07:42,144 --> 00:07:45,640
Can't we as elders help them out?

146
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,040
As for the road ahead,

147
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,240
they have to walk by themselves.

148
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,760
I don't care anymore.

149
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,976
Come on, please.

150
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:19,640
So this heart disease
is hereditary in your family.

151
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:22,976
Yes.

152
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,200
Oh yes, Grandpa just asked

153
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,760
me to live in your house.

154
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:34,020
I have to go back
and discuss it with my parents.

155
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:37,240
You must discuss it with your parents.

156
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,799
You must have their permission.

157
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:41,760
No need to discuss,
they definitely won't agree.

158
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,080
If they agree, I will

159
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,160
eat the door.

160
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,120
I'm leaving first.

161
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,320
See you in the hospital tomorrow.

162
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,168
Shen Mi,

163
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,680
how did you become like this?

164
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,688
Shen Mi,

165
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,440
you are quite something.

166
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,680
You used these dastardly, shameless
and despicable means.

167
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,960
Even in collusion with Grandpa
to deceive Tian Tian.

168
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,360
Grandpa doesn't have a heart disease.

169
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,080
Believe it or not, I'll report you tomorrow.

170
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,680
If I say it's not true, do you believe me?

171
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,712
I don't believe.

172
00:09:27,712 --> 00:09:29,160
Then do as you please, call her now

173
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,176
and explain everything to her.

174
00:09:30,176 --> 00:09:31,264
I will do it.

175
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,640
You think I dare not?

176
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,960
But you better think it through.

177
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,360
If Tian Tian asks you

178
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:41,560
what is the real relationship
between you and Grandpa,

179
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,360
how would you answer?

180
00:09:51,008 --> 00:09:53,824
<i>[Tianlin Animal Hospital]</i>

181
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,940
Your sister will live with Shen Mi.

182
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:02,120
No.

183
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,160
My sister will live with Shen Mi?

184
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,560
Shen Mi told me herself

185
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,560
with the most provocative expression.

186
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,840
He told me in person.

187
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,040
Let me tell you, from today on,

188
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,120
Tian Tian is my girlfriend.

189
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,720
Wherever Tian Tian goes, I'll go.

190
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,160
You better stay away from her in the future.

191
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,480
We absolutely cannot let such people
succeed in their schemes.

192
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,560
Exactly.

193
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,920
Don't worry, I have a plan.

194
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,120
The dog.

195
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,600
Oh no.

196
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,632
It's ruined.

197
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,640
Oh my god! God,

198
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,360
you have been so good to me.

199
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,920
Whatever I want comes true.

200
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,240
Thank you so much.

201
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,400
Mrs. Tian, can you stop blabbering?

202
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,440
It's been such a long time.

203
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,120
I'm really worried to death.

204
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,840
I've been begging to god.

205
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,160
You guys live together.

206
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,960
What have you got to worry about?

207
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:55,060
Can your mind be a little bit purer?

208
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:56,240
Live together?

209
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,560
What are you thinking about?

210
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,720
At that time, you didn't know
how urgent the situation was.

211
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,400
I agreed out of necessity.

212
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,680
Tian Tian.

213
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:05,920
Tian Tian,

214
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:09,280
your courageous actions deserve commendation.

215
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,280
Don't trash talk me here.

216
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,200
Quickly, help me think.

217
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,940
How should I explain to my parents?

218
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,080
If they ask,

219
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,320
should I just tell them directly

220
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,840
that I'm living with Shen Mi?

221
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,760
It seems like you can't tell the whole truth
to my sister-in-law.

222
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,200
Just tell them

223
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,880
you are going to night school
with Wen Jing to study further.

224
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,040
Every day,

225
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,520
it's too late, and you're too tired.

226
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,020
So you stay in the hospital.

227
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:37,160
They won't come to the hospital to find you.

228
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:39,936
Will this work?

229
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,360
Beg me.

230
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,880
I beg you.

231
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,560
Then I beg God.

232
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,168
God.

233
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,560
Not bad.

234
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,720
It's good, right?

235
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,720
Pretty good.

236
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,280
I'm back!

237
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,240
- So late.
- It smells so good.

238
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,800
What delicious food did you make today?

239
00:12:07,232 --> 00:12:08,384
Good. Good.

240
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,240
Speed it up a bit.

241
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,544
Dad,

242
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,600
what is this?

243
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,560
This is a special rehabilitation machine.

244
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,520
Faster.

245
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,520
Tian Tian, you're back.

246
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,720
- Okay.
- Everyone is here.

247
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,160
Who's cooking then?

248
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,128
Me.

249
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,640
Of course, it's me.

250
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,640
Mr. Shen, you've worked hard.

251
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,480
- Rest for a while.
- No need, Auntie.

252
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,080
I will serve everyone some rice

253
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,520
and we can start eating, Auntie.

254
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,920
You should go wash your hands, Tian Tian.

255
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,960
Go wash your hands quickly.
What are you standing there for?

256
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,640
- Let's eat.
- Let's eat.

257
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,840
Well,

258
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,280
it's Mr. Shen's first time
coming home for dinner

259
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,180
and he's cooking for us.

260
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:59,800
I feel really bad.

261
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,800
It's okay.

262
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,280
Did Tian Tian not tell you
that I have a chef certificate?

263
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,680
If you two enjoy the meal,

264
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,768
another day…

265
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,080
Another day…

266
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,100
Let's eat first.

267
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,120
Let's eat.

268
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,456
Let's eat.

269
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,960
Uncle, Yuxian told me

270
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,640
that this braised pork was your favorite.

271
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,600
It used to be my favorite.

272
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,560
But now, the doctor forbids me from eating it.

273
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,080
Dad, how does the rehabilitation device
that Shen Chen gave you work?

274
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,600
Is it comfortable?

275
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,340
It's quite good, quite good.

276
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:36,680
That's great. As long as it works well. Uncle,

277
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,360
you had to bring up this matter.

278
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,720
It's not that important.

279
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,320
I bought you the latest model

280
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,740
with voice control.

281
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:44,920
If you keep using it,

282
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,400
I am sure your health will be
even better than mine.

283
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,080
It's a good device,

284
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,080
but we can't let you spend the money.

285
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,240
That's right, that's right.

286
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,560
Well, Mr. Shen,

287
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,240
I appreciate

288
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,280
your kindness,

289
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,440
but we need to pay for this.

290
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,560
No, you mustn't pay for this.

291
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,240
Don't be too polite.

292
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,040
Normally, Tian Tian treats me like her family.

293
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,040
So I should be considered

294
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,240
as your family, shouldn't I?

295
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,560
If I buy something for my own family member,

296
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,720
you…

297
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,760
You shouldn't do this.
Isn't that right, Tian Tian?

298
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,840
We are family after all.

299
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,160
Yes.

300
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,480
Let's enjoy the meal before it gets cold.

301
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,800
Let's enjoy the meal, Dad. Eat up.

302
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:34,080
Tian Tian, have you packed your stuff yet?

303
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,920
Tian Tian, why are you packing up?

304
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,720
No, I haven't, I didn't.

305
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,160
My sister didn't tell you, Mom?

306
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,320
She is going to move to Shen Mi's house.

307
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,600
I am sorry, I didn't mean it.

308
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,720
I thought you talked to Mom about it.

309
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,820
Yuxian,

310
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,920
why would you bring up
such an upsetting subject during dinner?

311
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:08,640
Do you think it's safe for a man
and a woman to live together?

312
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,080
Auntie, here, have some lean meat.

313
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,720
The lean meat has good flavor.

314
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,280
Here, have a chili pepper.

315
00:15:28,992 --> 00:15:30,496
<i>[Auspicious, Good Luck]</i>

316
00:15:30,496 --> 00:15:31,936
<i>[Flowers bloom, every year is good]</i>

317
00:15:31,936 --> 00:15:33,320
<i>[Bamboo reports peace, every step is higher]</i>

318
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,540
Auntie, you don't have to send me off,
I am going home.

319
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:37,000
- Come visit often.
- Sure.

320
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,680
You can taste the food I cook in the future.

321
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,280
Okay, I am leaving now.

322
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,112
Take care.

323
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,032
Tian Tian,

324
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,696
sit down.

325
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,160
Mom, it's not what you think.

326
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,200
Let me ask you one thing.

327
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,000
Does Shen Chen like you?

328
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
He? I…

329
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,060
I don't know.

330
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:10,120
Well, Tian, how could you not know?

331
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,120
Shen Chen came

332
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,760
to our hospital for you.

333
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,320
What exactly is going on, Yuxian?

334
00:16:16,832 --> 00:16:17,920
Here's what happened.

335
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,480
Dr. Shen was returning from studying abroad.

336
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,920
Many hospitals have invited him.

337
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:26,540
But during our hospital's most difficult times,

338
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:28,120
he came specially to help my sister.

339
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,600
Why didn't you mention this earlier?

340
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,440
I felt that this child was good.

341
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,520
He is honest and considerate.

342
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,920
He likes you?

343
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,840
Of course he does.

344
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:42,020
He even set off fireworks for my sister.

345
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:43,960
Why do you talk so much?

346
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,240
He's quite romantic, not bad.

347
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,220
If you say that, Shen Mi is also considerate.

348
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,280
He's pretty romantic, too.

349
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,240
He also saved me.

350
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,540
Let me ask you,

351
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:58,920
does Shen Mi

352
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,200
like you, too?

353
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,880
Okay, no more questions.

354
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,760
Tian Tian, you're not a kid anymore.

355
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,040
So no matter what you do,

356
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,520
I will support you.

357
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,344
Go on.

358
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,079
Old Tian, what are you talking about?

359
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:20,480
Yeah, my sister is going to live
at another man's house.

360
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,520
Aren't you going to do something about it?

361
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,839
What can I do about it?

362
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,839
These are young people's issues.

363
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,119
Are we, as the older generation,

364
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,700
able to interfere?

365
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,400
Okay, Tian Tian,

366
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,360
go back to your room and pack up.

367
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,360
You, go back to your room and go to bed.

368
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,060
It's still early, Dad?

369
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:37,280
Are you going or not?

370
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,960
Alright, Dad, I'm going back.

371
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,920
- Tian Tian.
- Lin Zhi, Tian Tian.

372
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,040
Lin Zhi.

373
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,320
The young will take care of themselves.

374
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,320
We

375
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,560
shouldn't meddle.

376
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,520
You are spoiling them.

377
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,576
Good morning.

378
00:18:26,496 --> 00:18:27,520
It's quite early now.

379
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,440
Finish things early, I would like
to go to the hospital soon.

380
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,840
Two boxes of things.

381
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,280
Where do I put my luggage?

382
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,320
Carlo, good morning.

383
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,920
Please look after me in the coming days.

384
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,640
Where will I sleep?

385
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,560
You sleep here.

386
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,592
I…

387
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,920
Okay, I'll sleep on the sofa.

388
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,280
What's the big deal?

389
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,200
Okay, let me show you around.

390
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,288
This way.

391
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,140
This is Carlo's room.

392
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,520
You can't possibly be planning
to sleep here, can you?

393
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,400
No, it's not appropriate. It's not appropriate.

394
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,000
I won't fight with you for space. I won't.

395
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,000
You're so obedient.

396
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,928
You…

397
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,240
You, you can't seriously plan
to sleep here, right?

398
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:50,944
No way.

399
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,304
Come here.

400
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,920
And then this room.

401
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,920
Isn't this just the perfect room
for a guest to stay in?

402
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,400
Well, it is, but…

403
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,440
No one besides me ever comes to my place.

404
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,860
So, I didn't place a bed in here.

405
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:14,240
No bed, no problem.

406
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,920
I can just lay out a bedding
to sleep on the floor.

407
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,000
Are you sure?

408
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,400
Anyway, it's just for a few days.

409
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,760
That's still better than sleeping on the sofa.

410
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,360
No privacy at all, if you sleep out there.

411
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,960
What type of furniture
do you have in this room?

412
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,820
Why are they all covered in white cloth?

413
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:29,880
They're all antiques
that my grandfather gave me.

414
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,200
I felt like they didn't match the style
of the rest of the house,

415
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,360
so I didn't use them.

416
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,440
Antiques?

417
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,240
How old are they?

418
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,400
Qing Dynasty at the latest.

419
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,080
Qing Dynasty, and at the latest?

420
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,200
- What's wrong?
- No, nothing.

421
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,520
I just thought

422
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,240
that the scene looks a bit similar to one

423
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,400
I saw before.

424
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,760
It was in that horror film.

425
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,280
The one about the mirror.

426
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,520
I never watch horror movies.

427
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,840
If you're sure you're going to sleep here,

428
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,080
I'll set up a bed for you.

429
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,128
I…

430
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:12,480
No, I think the sofa is fine.

431
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,632
I'll sleep on it.

432
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,260
Then I guess there's no alternative
but to let you sleep on the sofa.

433
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:30,880
Oh well, since I promised your grandfather…

434
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,920
Okay, please take care in the following days.

435
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,080
Do you have a DVD player at home?

436
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,280
No, I don't.

437
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,860
Don't you watch movies?

438
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:03,340
So, you watch all your videos online?

439
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:05,720
I only watch the news.

440
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,760
Well, that's pretty boring of you.

441
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,800
However,

442
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,560
I have.

443
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,820
I did bring it.

444
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:22,000
I brought some discs with me.

445
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,720
I have another suitcase over there.

446
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,000
When you stay here,

447
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,200
do you plan to only have instant noodles?

448
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,440
These are what I'll eat.

449
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,000
Now, in my fridge,

450
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,280
there are vegetables, eggs, fruits, and milk.

451
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,640
Everything you want is inside.

452
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,640
If you want to eat anything,

453
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,856
just take it out and cook it.

454
00:23:13,856 --> 00:23:15,620
Do you have to eat these things?

455
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:18,320
I can't just eat yours.

456
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,320
Hurry up, don't be late.

457
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,600
What's going on?

458
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,120
Oh my god, when did it leak?

459
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,280
Do you have any empty bottles?

460
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,640
<i>[Tianlin Animal Hospital]</i>

461
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,760
Lan,

462
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,360
Tian Tian really moved into Mr. Shen's house?

463
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,360
I heard from Tian Yuxian

464
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,720
she went out early in the morning
with big and small bags.

465
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,720
I approve of this marriage.

466
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,960
What do you approve of?

467
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,620
What does it have to do with you?

468
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:38,480
Are you his father?

469
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,880
Let me tell you,

470
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,400
she moved into the Shen's house.

471
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,480
She must be forced.

472
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,240
She must be very painful and aggrieved now.

473
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,360
Very unhappy.

474
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,440
Pain, aggrieved.

475
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,520
Why didn't you wait for me and ate first?
Where's mine?

476
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,520
Here, sit here and eat.

477
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,240
No, I still have to place an order.

478
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,600
I'll go back to my room and eat by myself.

479
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,080
By the way, afternoon tea is on me.

480
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,520
What flavors do you all like?

481
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,540
Sour.

482
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:57,560
Passion fruit.

483
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,160
I'm looking for you to chat.

484
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,880
Dr. Shen,

485
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,080
it seems in this world,

486
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,840
the most painful, most aggrieved,
and unhappiest person

487
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,080
must be you.

488
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,880
If it's so sour and you can't eat it,
don't eat it.

489
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,560
So painful.

490
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,000
Eat, let's eat, let's eat.

491
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,320
Many pet owners like to shave their pets

492
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,680
in the summer,

493
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,620
believing that they will be cooler this way.

494
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:32,920
But in fact,

495
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,440
<i>[Rockefeller NEWS Live Room]</i>
dogs cool down through their paw pads

496
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,960
and breathing.

497
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,320
After shaving,

498
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,640
you will only make their skin allergic

499
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,720
due to ultraviolet rays,

500
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,080
even damaging the hair follicles.

501
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:43,080
So everyone's common sense in this area

502
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,200
is all wrong.

503
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,120
Dr. Gu is really professional.

504
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,160
Thank you.

505
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,680
These are all my fields of expertise.

506
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,200
By the way, I have a friend

507
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,440
who picked up a stray cat
and wanted to give it to me.

508
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,740
But this cat

509
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:57,780
always eats the plants in the house.

510
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:59,580
Let me see what's going on.

511
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:00,800
Stop for a moment.

512
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,480
Excuse me, I'm interrupting you for a while.

513
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,000
What's wrong? Why stop
when the filming was going well?

514
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,920
I hope you can inquire based

515
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,720
on the interview outline, if possible.

516
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,880
Because I just noticed

517
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,400
that the questions you asked
had no relation whatsoever

518
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,840
to our Lvchuan Group's new drug.

519
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:17,760
May I request for you to focus
your questions accordingly?

520
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,840
I'll ask Dr. Gu another question,

521
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:23,480
and then I'll quickly
move on to the main topic, okay?

522
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,440
Sounds good.

523
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:27,968
Let's begin.

524
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,480
I wonder if I can ask Dr. Gu
a personal question

525
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,880
that the vast majority of netizens
are deeply concerned about.

526
00:26:36,512 --> 00:26:37,620
What is it?

527
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:40,320
Do you have a girlfriend, Dr. Gu?

528
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,680
I like someone.

529
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:51,880
How did you two meet?

530
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,720
It was in an elevator.

531
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,520
I suffer from claustrophobia.

532
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,680
That time when the elevator malfunctioned,

533
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,400
both of us were trapped in a confined space.

534
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,680
While waiting for rescue,

535
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:11,320
her hand was tightly clutching mine.

536
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,480
She had a subtle aura around her

537
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,680
that made me feel at ease.

538
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,120
I'm sorry to interrupt.

539
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,240
What's the matter again?

540
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,520
Didn't we agree

541
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:24,200
to discuss your new drug immediately
after this question?

542
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,680
I hope you can respect

543
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,800
the profession of hosting

544
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,880
and also respect the interviewee.

545
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,760
Dr. Gu is a scientist.

546
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,320
He's here for science outreach interviews.

547
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,680
Please don't take a gossipy
or intrusive attitude

548
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,680
with your questions.

549
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,820
Okay?

550
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:38,240
If you understand things so well,

551
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,880
you should take this seat.

552
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,080
Come on.

553
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,440
You can be the host.

554
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,440
We stop filming. Let's go.

555
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,752
Dr. Gu.

556
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,320
Dr. Gu.

557
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,600
Sir, as usual at eight tomorrow morning.

558
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,360
At the entrance of the building.
You worked hard today.

559
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:29,640
Alright, Miss Han.

560
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,752
Goodbye.

561
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,640
Let's have dinner together.

562
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,880
Not today, too tired.

563
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,720
I have your interview manuscript
to check later.

564
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,080
What's wrong?

565
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,120
Follow me.

566
00:28:54,624 --> 00:28:56,416
<i>[Stunning Attack with a Sword]</i>

567
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:02,880
Mengnan,

568
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,980
you've been too tense lately.

569
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:06,160
Too strong will snap.

570
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:07,880
Today, you're here

571
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,640
to release all your stress.

572
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:15,000
So that's why you brought me here.

573
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:16,896
Exactly.

574
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,320
There are three types of swords.

575
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,360
This one is a broadsword.

576
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,500
Its weight is the heaviest
among the three kinds.

577
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:24,760
It's not quite suitable for girls.

578
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,020
This one is a foil.

579
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:30,900
Its rules are relatively complex.

580
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:31,968
It's not really suitable for you.

581
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,536
Really?

582
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,400
This one is a rapier.

583
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,720
Its weight is relatively lighter.

584
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,720
It's especially suitable
for beginners like you.

585
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,000
You try it.

586
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,140
How about having a bout?

587
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:55,440
Okay.

588
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,544
Let's do it.

589
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,520
I didn't expect that you have such talent.

590
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,840
I didn't expect you have such luck
in addition to talent.

591
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:20,896
Let's do it.

592
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,040
Okay, that's good. Let's do it again.

593
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,304
I'm going to get serious now.

594
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,440
How are you? Are you okay?

595
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,680
I didn't expect your sword techniques
to be so good.

596
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:21,856
How long have you been practicing?

597
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,720
Six years. I appreciate your guidance.

598
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,720
I have learned a lot.

599
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:33,888
Let's take a break.

600
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,400
Are you hungry?

601
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,280
These noodles with egg will take a while.

602
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:13,400
Don't you smell something strange in the house?

603
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,424
No, I don't.

604
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:28,920
What is this?

605
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,200
This is something I brought especially for you.

606
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,160
It's our home-made green mango pickle.

607
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,400
Throw it away.

608
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,360
What are you doing?
You shouldn't throw it away.

609
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:38,120
This is a good thing. My mom asked me
to bring this for you.

610
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,320
Why don't you taste it first? Try it.

611
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,980
No, I absolutely won't.

612
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:46,160
Please don't bring it
so close to my nose, okay?

613
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,720
You can feel free to insult me.

614
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,120
But you cannot ignore

615
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,880
my mom's kind intentions, right?

616
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:57,400
Before I left, she asked me
to bring two cans for you

617
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,020
to try.

618
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:00,400
She prepared it herself.

619
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:04,440
She just wanted you
to have a taste of our specialty.

620
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,472
Try it out.

621
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,240
How is it?

622
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,520
It smells a bit off.

623
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,000
But it tastes quite good
when you actually eat it.

624
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,000
Don't worry.

625
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,160
There's still more.

626
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,360
Don't be embarrassed if you don't have enough.

627
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,800
I can bring you more.

628
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:39,800
There's another can here.

629
00:33:44,672 --> 00:33:45,680
What is that?

630
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,360
This? Mold.

631
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:51,520
These pickles need to be marinated
for a long time.

632
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:52,800
Otherwise, they won't have a strong flavor.

633
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,560
Finding mold is quite normal.

634
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,960
Well…

635
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,280
So delicious.

636
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,760
Is it really that awful?

637
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,248
So delicious.

638
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,520
Tian Tian,

639
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,280
- what did you put in here?
- What's wrong?

640
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,400
Where did you put my mouthwash?

641
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,900
This is mine…

642
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:38,912
I…

643
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:43,560
My bottle broke when I came this morning.

644
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,639
Do you have any empty bottles?

645
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:55,679
There's only a little bit left in this one.

646
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:56,840
It should be okay if I pour it out.

647
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,624
Just right.

648
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,680
I forgot to tell you.

649
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,720
I'm sorry.

650
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,480
I'm all sweaty.

651
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,600
I feel so comfortable today.

652
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,420
Thank you just now.

653
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:24,520
You didn't slap my face.

654
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:26,760
I let you off the hook.

655
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:30,200
Of course, you have to film tomorrow.

656
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,640
It seems I was presumptuous.

657
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,520
Aren't you men always like this,

658
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,180
playing the teacher

659
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:39,440
and thinking we women can't do anything?

660
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,480
For this issue,

661
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,320
I reserve my opinion.

662
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,760
You listen to his music too?

663
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:57,760
Do you listen to it too?

664
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:00,680
I started listening a few years ago.

665
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:03,100
This is one of my favorite singers.

666
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:04,840
I have many of his records at home.

667
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,280
If you have time, we can listen together.

668
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:15,232
<i>♫ Through the darkness
and the fear in my heart ♫</i>

669
00:36:17,856 --> 00:36:22,176
<i>♫ If I could hear the whisper in the wind ♫</i>

670
00:36:24,416 --> 00:36:29,248
<i>♫ Perhaps it would surround me ♫</i>

671
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:33,952
<i>♫ Because I am prepared ♫</i>

672
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,512
What's wrong?

673
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,420
Well,

674
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:04,340
I poured out all the toner.

675
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:06,160
I also cleaned your bottle.

676
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,400
I noticed we ran out of mouthwash at home.

677
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,480
So I bought one online,
it will arrive tomorrow.

678
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,260
What else?

679
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:16,200
I also cleaned up all my stuff on the floor.

680
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,920
Are we not eating pickle in the future?

681
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:20,960
Pickle…

682
00:37:21,472 --> 00:37:24,120
Try not to eat pickle.

683
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:26,944
We won't eat it.

684
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,140
All right, I forgive you.

685
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:31,232
Wait a minute.

686
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,100
There's one more thing.

687
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:35,360
What is it?

688
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,000
Now that you're not angry anymore,

689
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:39,440
let's watch a movie together.

690
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,488
Okay.

691
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,360
No.

692
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,840
If you want to watch a movie, just watch it.

693
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,140
Why are you turning off the light?

694
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:57,800
For a horror movie,
the atmosphere is very important.

695
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,040
It's starting, it's starting.

696
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,680
I know it's starting.

697
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:32,120
I suddenly thought of

698
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,440
a grand business plan.

699
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:36,720
I feel that I must write it down.

700
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,200
This will concern

701
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,360
the life-and-death situation of my company.

702
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:42,912
Don't.

703
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,200
You were watching the movie just fine.

704
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,720
What's with the sudden plan writing?

705
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,560
Are you scared?

706
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,900
Are you kidding me?

707
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:59,340
How can I be scared?

708
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:00,416
Just…

709
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:06,640
Will I be scared?

710
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,440
Just don't be scared.

711
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,240
I can't, I'm scared.

712
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,220
Did you see that?

713
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:28,800
Yes, I saw it.

714
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,600
Well, why are you always looking at me?

715
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,120
Watch the movie, okay?

716
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:02,720
I'm just checking if you're really watching.

717
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,240
I've been watching all along.

718
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,520
There's nothing to be scared of, it's all fake.

719
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,360
I'm still scared.

720
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,660
You frightened me to death.

721
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:16,680
You scared me.

722
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,408
Carlo.

723
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,120
Gao Zhuo.

724
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:11,680
You're awake.

725
00:41:12,256 --> 00:41:13,280
A pot of tea, please.

726
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,360
Alright, please wait a moment.

727
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,760
Did you not sleep well?

728
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,272
Did not sleep much.

729
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,680
Has Miss Tian moved in yet?

730
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:32,400
Are you going to pick her up later?

731
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,400
No need, I've recorded her fingerprint for her.

732
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,080
Although the two of you have moved in together,

733
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,160
I still hope

734
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,160
that you can keep a certain distance.

735
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,320
If you get too close,

736
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:52,640
letting her know some things
she shouldn't know,

737
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,880
I'm afraid it will be difficult
to deal with in the future.

738
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:57,760
Okay, thank you.

739
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:01,632
Have some tea.

740
00:42:27,168 --> 00:42:30,688
<i>♫ Your gaze is unwavering ♫</i>

741
00:42:32,704 --> 00:42:37,248
<i>♫ Only enough to accommodate me ♫</i>

742
00:42:38,464 --> 00:42:43,136
<i>♫ I have been melted by you countless times ♫</i>

743
00:42:44,096 --> 00:42:47,648
<i>♫ Yet I'm at a loss for what to do ♫</i>

744
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:52,544
<i>♫ I can only hold on to you ♫</i>

745
00:42:54,624 --> 00:42:58,528
<i>♫ Now you are still with me ♫</i>

746
00:43:00,192 --> 00:43:04,448
<i>♫ Traveling through time together ♫</i>

747
00:43:06,304 --> 00:43:14,240
<i>♫ Someday, I'll be completely
forgotten by the world ♫</i>

748
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:17,440
<i>♫ Leaving no trace ♫</i>

749
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:21,472
<i>♫ Only you will still remember ♫</i>

750
00:43:23,232 --> 00:43:25,536
<i>♫ My appearance ♫</i>
