1
00:01:41,201 --> 00:01:42,836
Mouth should be sweeter

2
00:01:42,836 --> 00:01:44,270
Take the initiative to say hello

3
00:01:45,338 --> 00:01:46,306
Hello aunt

4
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,274
I am Tian Tian

5
00:01:55,381 --> 00:01:57,217
Silly girl, what are you doing there?

6
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:13,466
Give me back, give me back

7
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,034
How to tell the other parent

8
00:02:15,034 --> 00:02:16,536
leave a good impression

9
00:02:19,572 --> 00:02:20,306
Shen Mi wants to take you

10
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,541
Go see his mother

11
00:02:22,842 --> 00:02:24,210
He told me yesterday

12
00:02:24,277 --> 00:02:25,745
Okay, tell me quickly

13
00:02:27,013 --> 00:02:28,748
That's what he said last night

14
00:02:28,781 --> 00:02:29,883
Take me back today

15
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:31,117
Have a meal with his mother

16
00:02:33,553 --> 00:02:34,420
one more thing

17
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,993
How about I take you to my house tomorrow?

18
00:02:40,627 --> 00:02:41,594
meet my mom

19
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:48,401
good

20
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:52,472
However

21
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:54,174
I'm afraid that I'll be too sentimental

22
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:54,874
Thinking too much

23
00:02:54,874 --> 00:02:55,675
Maybe Shen Mi

24
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:56,976
It doesn't mean that at all

25
00:02:56,976 --> 00:02:59,145
Just have a normal meal

26
00:03:02,815 --> 00:03:03,783
what to do

27
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:06,186
Tian Tian, ​​your little brain

28
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:08,154
Can it be used in the right place?

29
00:03:08,154 --> 00:03:10,590
Just have a normal meal

30
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:11,791
Why can't I eat?

31
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:13,660
Why do you have to go to his house to eat?

32
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:14,794
Why take his mother

33
00:03:14,827 --> 00:03:15,895
Move out

34
00:03:16,262 --> 00:03:16,863
I remember

35
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:18,298
A few days ago, you took Shen Mi with you

36
00:03:18,298 --> 00:03:19,265
Went to your house

37
00:03:19,265 --> 00:03:21,834
Shen Mi asked you to go to his house today

38
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:23,903
As my aunt, I dominate the love scene

39
00:03:23,903 --> 00:03:25,171
Years of experience

40
00:03:25,171 --> 00:03:25,905
You two

41
00:03:25,905 --> 00:03:27,507
We'll be sitting together soon

42
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:28,041
Have a meal

43
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,642
Come to discuss something.

44
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:31,110
Really

45
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:31,811
you said so

46
00:03:31,811 --> 00:03:33,980
There's still some truth to that

47
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:36,015
So this meal is very important

48
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:37,517
Then I have to prepare well

49
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,185
What do you think his mother likes?

50
00:03:39,185 --> 00:03:40,186
I don't know either

51
00:03:40,186 --> 00:03:40,753
Don't worry Don't worry

52
00:03:40,753 --> 00:03:41,588
I have a lot of experience

53
00:03:41,588 --> 00:03:42,655
I'll do it for you

54
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:43,690
What's done?

55
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:48,027
You two are sneaking around here

56
00:03:48,027 --> 00:03:49,062
What are we talking about?

57
00:03:51,297 --> 00:03:52,265
Talking about you

58
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:53,499
chat with me

59
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:54,834
Why are you chatting with me?

60
00:03:56,636 --> 00:03:58,371
That's the one right away

61
00:03:58,438 --> 00:04:00,306
There's a pet doctor competition coming up.

62
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,507
It's just me and your sister, right?

63
00:04:01,507 --> 00:04:03,343
Just discuss your positioning

64
00:04:03,376 --> 00:04:05,178
very important

65
00:04:05,211 --> 00:04:07,614
Your sister and I were just discussing it.

66
00:04:07,614 --> 00:04:08,948
Before the game?

67
00:04:08,948 --> 00:04:10,383
want to do something to you

68
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:11,985
It's just intensive training

69
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:13,920
to ensure nothing goes wrong

70
00:04:15,054 --> 00:04:16,856
I think it's very ok

71
00:04:16,856 --> 00:04:18,258
Then you two start from today

72
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:19,892
How about just having a special training late at night?

73
00:04:21,694 --> 00:04:22,996
I have something to do tonight

74
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:26,266
What's the matter?

75
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:28,268
I

76
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:29,502
Varied

77
00:04:30,036 --> 00:04:32,238
What's going on

78
00:04:32,238 --> 00:04:34,240
Just don’t want it right away

79
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,175
Is that Chinese Valentine’s Day?

80
00:04:36,175 --> 00:04:37,577
Your sister and I need to give it to the hospital

81
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,379
buy something

82
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:41,014
Just have a good holiday

83
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:43,716
Create a bit of a festive atmosphere

84
00:04:43,716 --> 00:04:45,251
Also for the pet doctor competition

85
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:46,986
Let’s have a swearing-in ceremony

86
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,155
That’s unity from top to bottom

87
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:50,623
United as one

88
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:52,792
We must strive to win Midorikawa

89
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,360
Qualifications of pilot hospitals

90
00:04:58,431 --> 00:04:59,599
Any other questions?

91
00:05:00,099 --> 00:05:00,800
No more

92
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:02,302
Then go practice your skills quickly

93
00:05:02,535 --> 00:05:03,269
Wash your hands before going

94
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:04,070
Why are you washing your hands?

95
00:05:04,103 --> 00:05:05,171
How do you have time to wash your hands?

96
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:06,839
Hurry up and practice. Hurry up and practice.

97
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:07,440
Go practice

98
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,075
Go! Go! Go

99
00:05:10,777 --> 00:05:12,312
Really

100
00:05:18,551 --> 00:05:19,218
Oh my god

101
00:05:19,218 --> 00:05:22,021
Fortunately, this big mouth didn't hear it

102
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:23,389
If he knew

103
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:25,458
Then Shen Chen will definitely know

104
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:27,360
I'm afraid that this matter will get out of hand

105
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,395
We act like thieves

106
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:30,663
Is this necessary?

107
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:32,265
Of course it's necessary

108
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:33,633
That's it

109
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:34,534
This is Shen Mi

110
00:05:34,534 --> 00:05:35,668
This is Shen Chen

111
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:36,469
Choose one

112
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:39,739
I haven't let you choose yet

113
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:41,140
Isn’t this clear?

114
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:41,774
right?

115
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:45,411
It is better to do less than to do more

116
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:46,112
Say it again

117
00:05:46,145 --> 00:05:47,980
Madam Xiao Shen is pretty good

118
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,215
Good for you too

119
00:05:49,716 --> 00:05:51,718
We still have to take care of you

120
00:05:51,718 --> 00:05:52,552
his mood

121
00:05:52,552 --> 00:05:52,952
his mood

122
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:54,354
right

123
00:05:57,824 --> 00:05:58,558
Let's go

124
00:05:58,558 --> 00:05:59,759
Where to go?

125
00:05:59,792 --> 00:06:00,960
Didn't you say you wanted to

126
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,695
Please your future mother-in-law

127
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:04,464
To think about it, go to the mall

128
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:05,031
OK

129
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:05,798
Walk

130
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:10,670
What to do

131
00:06:11,938 --> 00:06:12,872
It's OK It's OK

132
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:13,840
Not yet

133
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,241
Substantial progress?

134
00:06:16,242 --> 00:06:16,776
younger brother

135
00:06:17,276 --> 00:06:18,277
You said this

136
00:06:18,277 --> 00:06:19,178
But something's wrong

137
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:21,381
You must never be prepared for danger in times of peace again

138
00:06:21,414 --> 00:06:22,749
Don’t plan ahead

139
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:23,616
That poker face

140
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,752
He really became your brother-in-law

141
00:06:29,522 --> 00:06:30,656
But our thirty-six strategies

142
00:06:30,656 --> 00:06:31,557
Used it all once

143
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:32,825
Nothing works

144
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:39,465
If you don't

145
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:41,000
You go home again

146
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:43,703
Say something nice to our parents again

147
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:45,738
Blow the wind

148
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:52,578
They are exactly the same

149
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:54,414
Children and grandchildren have their own blessings

150
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:55,715
Already given up

151
00:06:55,715 --> 00:06:56,582
Love so and so

152
00:07:00,787 --> 00:07:02,355
You can't force my sister to come here.

153
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:03,823
Let me marry you

154
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:06,626
Okay

155
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:09,996
elder brother

156
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:12,598
Although this love is blind

157
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:13,800
Even paranoid

158
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,001
But the road to illegal crime

159
00:07:15,034 --> 00:07:16,269
We can't go like this

160
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:17,570
You are not getting older every day

161
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:18,371
The head is quite big

162
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:19,772
What are you thinking about?

163
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:23,709
I mean

164
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:25,678
Instead of meditating here,

165
00:07:25,711 --> 00:07:26,345
scratching one's head

166
00:07:26,345 --> 00:07:27,947
Find a way to break them up

167
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:29,715
It’s better to take some practical actions

168
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:31,417
Get your sister over here

169
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:32,752
How do you rob

170
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:33,419
have no idea

171
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:36,355
Come over

172
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:52,738
I tell you

173
00:07:52,738 --> 00:07:54,373
First time giving gift to mother-in-law

174
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,142
particularly important

175
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,376
Not too cheap

176
00:07:57,376 --> 00:07:59,946
But it can’t be too expensive

177
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,482
This is very suitable

178
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:07,620
This is gentle

179
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:11,624
This

180
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:17,196
The pillows you selected

181
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:18,197
Neck support effect

182
00:08:18,197 --> 00:08:18,865
all good

183
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:21,300
Auntie, look quickly

184
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,068
Look at this pillow

185
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:23,469
Extremely comfortable and soft

186
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:24,337
This pillow

187
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:25,571
Not only has positive support

188
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:26,305
And there are also specialized

189
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:27,874
Side sleeping area for side sleepers

190
00:08:28,474 --> 00:08:30,610
Can adapt to various sleeping positions

191
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:31,344
How is it

192
00:08:33,579 --> 00:08:34,780
Pillows are pretty good

193
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:36,282
But it’s your first time at someone’s house

194
00:08:36,282 --> 00:08:37,383
Send this thing

195
00:08:37,383 --> 00:08:38,718
You can't give it away

196
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:39,652
You return the pillow to others

197
00:08:39,652 --> 00:08:40,453
You go there with me

198
00:08:40,453 --> 00:08:40,920
Go buy that bracelet

199
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:41,654
no

200
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:43,589
The last time I saw Shen Mi’s mother

201
00:08:43,623 --> 00:08:45,191
She said her sleep quality was not good

202
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:46,459
Then I'll just give her one

203
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:47,894
Comfortable sleeping pillow

204
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,395
Isn't this good?

205
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:50,062
Right, right, right

206
00:08:50,062 --> 00:08:51,731
Nothing is better than giving health.

207
00:08:52,398 --> 00:08:53,032
By the way ma'am

208
00:08:53,065 --> 00:08:54,300
In addition to the basic models, we have

209
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,034
also launched

210
00:08:55,067 --> 00:08:56,002
with various sleep

211
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:57,069
Limited edition fragrance

212
00:08:57,069 --> 00:08:57,503
Do you want to try

213
00:08:57,503 --> 00:08:58,471
There are also limited editions

214
00:08:58,504 --> 00:08:59,171
want want want

215
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:00,640
Take me to see it, come on

216
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,440
This way please

217
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:09,382
so expensive

218
00:09:09,415 --> 00:09:10,182
Tian Peilan

219
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:14,453
Do you think the one you chose is okay?

220
00:09:14,453 --> 00:09:15,187
I wear this

221
00:09:15,187 --> 00:09:15,721
Does it appear

222
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:17,256
A bit too old-fashioned

223
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:18,791
OK?

224
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:19,992
nice

225
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,295
You don't understand this

226
00:09:22,361 --> 00:09:24,430
Meeting my future mother-in-law for the first time

227
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:26,632
You must look grand

228
00:09:26,632 --> 00:09:28,467
dignified and steady

229
00:09:28,467 --> 00:09:29,635
That person dares

230
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:31,470
The son I have raised all my life

231
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:33,139
Put it in your hands carefully

232
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:33,906
right?

233
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:37,109
But you come here

234
00:09:37,109 --> 00:09:38,978
These clothes cost two to three thousand

235
00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:39,779
That's not cheap

236
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:40,913
Let's not buy it. Let's not buy it.

237
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:42,915
I really can’t bear to part with it

238
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:45,851
Two thousand eight hundred and ninety-nine

239
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:50,489
The tag was torn off

240
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:51,824
I'm sorry

241
00:09:51,857 --> 00:09:53,259
Now the label is off

242
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:55,261
Then I can only buy it

243
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:56,262
How do you

244
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:57,029
pretty lady

245
00:09:57,029 --> 00:09:58,197
Help us settle the bill

246
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:00,700
Tian Peilan, are you crazy?

247
00:10:12,578 --> 00:10:13,379
Don't be nervous

248
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:14,547
What's there to be nervous about?

249
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:16,182
I'm not nervous

250
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:20,720
you say

251
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,355
Will my clothes be okay?

252
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:23,723
A bit old-fashioned

253
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,825
No, I think it’s pretty good

254
00:10:25,825 --> 00:10:27,059
Wouldn't it be better to be more mature?

255
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:43,576
Are you still nervous?

256
00:10:45,544 --> 00:10:46,679
Don’t watch anymore. Don’t watch anymore.

257
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:00,993
elder brother

258
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,061
Otherwise we both

259
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:03,829
Take off Shen Mi's tires.

260
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:06,932
It took a while to unload

261
00:11:07,266 --> 00:11:08,534
He can't let go for the rest of his life

262
00:11:08,534 --> 00:11:10,202
This is the last resort

263
00:11:10,202 --> 00:11:11,470
Wouldn't he take a taxi?

264
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:13,339
Otherwise, you go too

265
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:13,973
You treat them as home

266
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:14,874
It's a street park

267
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:16,242
It can go as long as it's an animal

268
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:18,077
You can't just sit there like this

269
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:19,945
Can you tell me some tricks?

270
00:11:19,945 --> 00:11:21,580
Don’t you have to think about that?

271
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,615
Don't you think about this?

272
00:11:28,654 --> 00:11:29,255
Got it

273
00:11:29,822 --> 00:11:30,623
What's the trick?

274
00:11:30,956 --> 00:11:31,957
Kill with a borrowed knife

275
00:11:47,073 --> 00:11:47,940
Aunt Chen

276
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:03,389
You, why are you here?

277
00:12:04,957 --> 00:12:05,791
Please come in

278
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:31,984
Aunt

279
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:33,352
Not with you today

280
00:12:33,352 --> 00:12:34,820
Just say hello and come over

281
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,255
You won't blame me, will you?

282
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:37,356
How could it be?

283
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,391
This place is just like your own home

284
00:12:39,391 --> 00:12:40,826
Since when have you missed me and grandpa?

285
00:12:40,826 --> 00:12:41,560
Just come anytime

286
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,695
what hello

287
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:44,130
Right

288
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:45,498
Just now I asked Aunt Dong

289
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:46,265
Added two more

290
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:47,900
Shen Mi’s favorite dishes

291
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:50,202
You won't blame me for making the decision without permission, right?

292
00:12:50,402 --> 00:12:51,504
No way

293
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:53,439
I can rest assured about what you told me.

294
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:56,475
Dr. Oda

295
00:12:56,876 --> 00:12:57,743
eat some fruit

296
00:12:58,277 --> 00:12:59,478
No thanks

297
00:12:59,678 --> 00:13:01,147
Then drink some tea

298
00:13:02,314 --> 00:13:03,415
It's okay thank you

299
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:06,018
Aunt

300
00:13:06,018 --> 00:13:07,520
Have you met Dr. Oda?

301
00:13:10,823 --> 00:13:12,558
It seems to have some impression

302
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:15,394
Dr. Oda

303
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:16,996
How old are you this year

304
00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:19,031
Auntie, I am twenty-five this year

305
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,101
I see how you are dressed

306
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:22,935
Thought

307
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:25,571
It turns out Shen Mi is better than us

308
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:26,639
Still one year younger

309
00:13:27,706 --> 00:13:28,174
Mom

310
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:29,508
Aunt

311
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:31,677
Actually, I think Dr. Oda

312
00:13:31,677 --> 00:13:33,479
This outfit is quite prudent.

313
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:34,613
Where is she usually?

314
00:13:34,613 --> 00:13:35,948
Take care of your own hospital

315
00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:36,749
Have to take into account

316
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:38,217
Shen Mi's physical condition

317
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:39,518
It's more laborious

318
00:13:43,522 --> 00:13:44,056
that

319
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:45,291
Mom

320
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:46,759
Tian Tian specially gives it to you

321
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:47,827
brought some gifts

322
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,061
Do you want to take a look?

323
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:51,397
Aunt

324
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:52,998
I heard you say it last time

325
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:54,200
didn't sleep well at night

326
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:56,402
I just picked out a pillow for you

327
00:13:56,402 --> 00:13:58,037
This has the function of calming the mind and promoting sleep

328
00:13:58,037 --> 00:14:00,039
Specially choose the latest lavender

329
00:14:03,475 --> 00:14:04,376
take away

330
00:14:04,376 --> 00:14:04,777
Aunt

331
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:05,578
Take it away quickly

332
00:14:05,911 --> 00:14:06,912
It's okay It's okay

333
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:07,913
The meal is ready

334
00:14:07,913 --> 00:14:08,948
How about we eat first?

335
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:09,982
good

336
00:14:20,826 --> 00:14:23,262
Did I do something wrong?

337
00:14:23,896 --> 00:14:24,830
you did nothing wrong

338
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:26,699
I was negligent

339
00:14:27,733 --> 00:14:28,634
How could it be such a coincidence

340
00:14:28,634 --> 00:14:30,336
I bought a lavender pillow

341
00:14:34,974 --> 00:14:36,308
My dad's favorite when he was alive

342
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:37,676
It's lavender

343
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:39,478
after he left

344
00:14:41,113 --> 00:14:42,314
My mother loves lavender

345
00:14:42,314 --> 00:14:43,515
Very sensitive

346
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:45,251
She didn't do this to you on purpose

347
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:47,987
Don't take it to heart

348
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:50,155
I'm fine

349
00:14:55,961 --> 00:14:56,662
let's go

350
00:14:57,529 --> 00:14:58,397
I'll take you there

351
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:15,547
Come mom

352
00:15:15,781 --> 00:15:16,515
fresh fish

353
00:15:16,815 --> 00:15:17,549
Eat more

354
00:15:21,186 --> 00:15:21,854
Thank you

355
00:15:28,627 --> 00:15:29,194
Eat more

356
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:40,839
Aunt

357
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:41,473
I'll serve you the soup

358
00:15:41,473 --> 00:15:42,574
Meng Nan

359
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:45,144
Aunt

360
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:47,112
This American Ginseng Stewed Black-bone Chicken Soup

361
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:47,913
It's for us women

362
00:15:47,913 --> 00:15:49,148
Best soup ever

363
00:15:49,148 --> 00:15:50,482
You must drink more

364
00:15:50,482 --> 00:15:51,383
Aunt

365
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:52,952
Don't be polite to me

366
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,186
All a family

367
00:15:54,186 --> 00:15:55,154
I'll help you fill it

368
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:55,721
good

369
00:16:05,931 --> 00:16:06,799
Be careful when burning

370
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:07,800
So good

371
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:11,904
Slow down mom

372
00:16:18,277 --> 00:16:20,512
Girls have hands and feet

373
00:16:20,946 --> 00:16:22,581
Is it your turn to be courteous?

374
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:27,419
Shen Mi

375
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:28,120
I'll come

376
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,555
No, I'll help you

377
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:36,061
Thank you

378
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:38,931
Mengnan

379
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:40,466
You and Shen Mi

380
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:41,834
When will you get married?

381
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,716
We are well matched

382
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,421
Aunt

383
00:17:02,821 --> 00:17:03,922
marriage matters

384
00:17:03,922 --> 00:17:04,490
I think it's still

385
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,058
The elders decided it was better

386
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:08,627
Mom

387
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:11,864
Let's finish this meal first

388
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:13,298
Otherwise it will get cold after a while

389
00:17:13,632 --> 00:17:14,433
Not tasty

390
00:17:16,735 --> 00:17:17,536
Aunt

391
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,540
Maybe Dr. Oda is here today

392
00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:23,275
So Shen Mi

393
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:24,710
Don't want to talk about marriage

394
00:17:25,744 --> 00:17:26,979
Let’s talk about it some other time

395
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,181
own family

396
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:31,150
Tell me something about your own family.

397
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:33,152
What does it have to do with others?

398
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:39,458
Aunt

399
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:41,660
I'm going to the bathroom

400
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:43,028
You guys eat first and talk first

401
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:50,202
sit down

402
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,307
own family

403
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:56,742
Let's chat together

404
00:17:57,309 --> 00:17:57,976
It doesn’t matter

405
00:18:06,718 --> 00:18:07,553
I won't eat

406
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:52,931
sorry

407
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:56,535
I apologize to you on behalf of my mother

408
00:18:57,703 --> 00:18:58,437
It's OK

409
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:00,873
And you don’t need to apologize

410
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:01,940
It's okay

411
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:07,479
It's okay

412
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,057
look

413
00:19:19,057 --> 00:19:20,225
These were when you were a kid

414
00:19:20,225 --> 00:19:21,226
For Shen Mi

415
00:19:21,226 --> 00:19:22,828
He has kept it until now

416
00:19:23,562 --> 00:19:24,263
These are all him

417
00:19:24,263 --> 00:19:25,664
most cherished thing

418
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,002
How good it was then

419
00:19:34,973 --> 00:19:35,674
Right

420
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:36,875
When you two were kids

421
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:37,809
There is a group photo

422
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:38,343
Still grandpa

423
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:39,311
I took the photos for you personally

424
00:19:39,311 --> 00:19:40,312
Let me find it for you

425
00:19:40,312 --> 00:19:41,113
good

426
00:19:41,113 --> 00:19:42,114
I'll help you find auntie

427
00:19:42,114 --> 00:19:42,714
good

428
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,228
I'll go look over there

429
00:19:56,228 --> 00:19:56,828
good

430
00:20:32,464 --> 00:20:33,131
Finished

431
00:20:33,131 --> 00:20:34,633
This is someone my dad specially found

432
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:36,034
The piano made for me

433
00:20:36,034 --> 00:20:37,703
What should I do if I mess it up?

434
00:20:37,703 --> 00:20:39,338
I want to tell uncle to go

435
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:41,240
Just say you broke it

436
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:43,442
Don't don't don't

437
00:20:43,442 --> 00:20:44,243
I beg you

438
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:46,178
Don't tell my dad

439
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:47,980
Oh well

440
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:48,981
I see you give it to me

441
00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:50,015
singing face

442
00:20:50,015 --> 00:20:51,750
I won’t tell uncle

443
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:54,319
So do you think I sing well?

444
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:03,061
Mengnan

445
00:21:06,498 --> 00:21:07,299
Mengnan

446
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:10,602
What's wrong with you

447
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:13,338
I'm fine auntie

448
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,174
Is it that silly boy Shen Mi?

449
00:21:16,174 --> 00:21:17,342
I bullied you again

450
00:21:17,576 --> 00:21:18,910
no aunt

451
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:20,178
he didn't

452
00:21:20,178 --> 00:21:22,180
Don't put off the two of you.

453
00:21:22,547 --> 00:21:23,949
Call your dad here another day

454
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,751
Let's discuss it carefully

455
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:27,452
Let's settle things between you two.

456
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:31,690
You don't want to

457
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:34,626
That is

458
00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:38,263
Aunt

459
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:43,135
I'm afraid Shen Mi doesn't want to

460
00:21:45,704 --> 00:21:46,938
Don't think too much

461
00:21:46,938 --> 00:21:47,372
both of you

462
00:21:47,372 --> 00:21:48,940
There must be some misunderstanding

463
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:49,908
Auntie is here

464
00:21:49,908 --> 00:21:51,276
Auntie makes the decision for you

465
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:53,312
Say it again in my heart

466
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:54,980
You have been my daughter-in-law for a long time

467
00:21:58,383 --> 00:21:59,418
Thank you aunt

468
00:21:59,751 --> 00:22:01,053
All a family

469
00:22:32,451 --> 00:22:33,352
How is it

470
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:34,419
Did it go well?

471
00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:35,654
Is the date set?

472
00:22:35,654 --> 00:22:37,556
Should we get engaged first or

473
00:22:37,956 --> 00:22:39,558
Get the certificate directly

474
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:42,861
What news do you have?

475
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:43,995
None

476
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:21,580
Thank you

477
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,501
Take a look at this

478
00:26:47,973 --> 00:26:50,308
final of our competition

479
00:26:50,308 --> 00:26:50,942
Not that there is one

480
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:52,344
Is it part of a knowledge contest?

481
00:26:53,178 --> 00:26:55,280
I'm going to finish sorting these out

482
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,182
Send it to everyone as a surprise attack

483
00:27:01,553 --> 00:27:02,320
fine

484
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:20,105
actually

485
00:27:21,439 --> 00:27:22,140
My mother has been

486
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,475
After my dad left

487
00:27:24,376 --> 00:27:25,710
mental condition

488
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:27,278
Not particularly stable

489
00:27:27,579 --> 00:27:29,114
So what happened yesterday

490
00:27:29,547 --> 00:27:30,515
i apologize to you

491
00:27:32,517 --> 00:27:33,818
Hope it didn't hurt you

492
00:27:36,855 --> 00:27:37,555
no

493
00:27:37,922 --> 00:27:39,557
I didn't take it to heart

494
00:27:40,225 --> 00:27:41,393
I particularly understand

495
00:27:41,693 --> 00:27:42,627
And yesterday

496
00:27:42,627 --> 00:27:44,663
I do look too old in what I wear

497
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:46,464
gift

498
00:27:47,532 --> 00:27:49,200
The gift was not chosen well either.

499
00:27:54,939 --> 00:27:56,908
Actually, if I had asked you earlier

500
00:27:56,908 --> 00:27:58,677
Then nothing like this would happen.

501
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:01,012
Blame me

502
00:28:02,914 --> 00:28:04,115
not prepared

503
00:28:12,891 --> 00:28:13,658
Right

504
00:28:15,627 --> 00:28:16,861
I have to go on my rounds

505
00:28:17,295 --> 00:28:18,063
do not worry

506
00:28:18,329 --> 00:28:19,664
My Tiantian, why is there such a big storm?

507
00:28:19,664 --> 00:28:20,432
Never seen

508
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:21,599
don't worry about me

509
00:28:22,333 --> 00:28:23,201
I went there first

510
00:29:37,075 --> 00:29:37,709
Miss

511
00:29:38,309 --> 00:29:39,544
You just sent it now

512
00:29:39,811 --> 00:29:41,012
It will be fixed today

513
00:29:41,546 --> 00:29:42,580
It's really difficult

514
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:44,282
this piano

515
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:46,151
It's actually made of gut strings

516
00:29:46,584 --> 00:29:47,585
There are very few people now

517
00:29:47,585 --> 00:29:49,220
Use these strings to make a guitar

518
00:29:49,721 --> 00:29:51,456
Not to mention this ukulele

519
00:29:51,756 --> 00:29:53,291
And this piano case

520
00:29:53,825 --> 00:29:54,826
But use Brazilian

521
00:29:54,826 --> 00:29:56,027
Made of rosewood

522
00:29:56,427 --> 00:29:57,629
This was in 1992

523
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:59,230
logging has stopped

524
00:29:59,831 --> 00:30:02,033
Now we use roses from India

525
00:30:02,033 --> 00:30:02,667
boss

526
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:04,068
Can it be fixed?

527
00:30:06,171 --> 00:30:07,272
Can, can

528
00:30:07,539 --> 00:30:08,473
Not cheap

529
00:30:08,773 --> 00:30:10,041
As long as it can be fixed today

530
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:10,975
Any amount is fine

531
00:30:12,343 --> 00:30:12,877
good

532
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,721
It's all your fault

533
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:26,491
You have to let me dress so old-fashioned

534
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:27,492
His mother thought

535
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:29,594
I'm one year older than him

536
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:34,465
I'm so embarrassed

537
00:30:36,201 --> 00:30:37,468
And his mother

538
00:30:41,239 --> 00:30:44,142
Didn’t you give his mother as a gift?

539
00:30:44,776 --> 00:30:45,677
Gift?

540
00:30:45,977 --> 00:30:47,745
Such a nice lavender pillow

541
00:30:47,745 --> 00:30:49,214
His mother doesn't like it

542
00:30:50,315 --> 00:30:52,750
Stop talking about that pillow

543
00:30:52,784 --> 00:30:53,952
More embarrassing

544
00:30:54,385 --> 00:30:56,955
His mother hates lavender.

545
00:30:57,722 --> 00:30:59,457
I'm so stupid

546
00:31:12,837 --> 00:31:13,705
Actually I think

547
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:15,707
What you wear is not that important

548
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:17,041
What gift to give

549
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:18,476
Not that important

550
00:31:20,178 --> 00:31:21,412
Mainly

551
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:24,015
in his mother's heart

552
00:31:25,416 --> 00:31:26,584
I am one

553
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:29,354
little personal doctor

554
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:35,760
She thinks I'm not good enough for Shen Mi

555
00:31:38,296 --> 00:31:39,264
Moreover

556
00:31:40,498 --> 00:31:41,599
Moreover

557
00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:45,470
Besides what

558
00:31:46,104 --> 00:31:47,372
Besides, his mother

559
00:31:47,538 --> 00:31:48,473
seems to have

560
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,141
I've set a fiancée for him.

561
00:31:51,142 --> 00:31:52,777
He has a fiancée

562
00:31:54,512 --> 00:31:56,347
Scumbag, I'm going to find him now

563
00:31:56,347 --> 00:31:58,082
Aunt, don’t go

564
00:31:58,316 --> 00:31:59,150
He is not

565
00:31:59,450 --> 00:31:59,951
no

566
00:31:59,951 --> 00:32:00,818
Does he have

567
00:32:00,818 --> 00:32:02,153
Still no fiancée

568
00:32:02,553 --> 00:32:03,388
It seems to have

569
00:32:03,388 --> 00:32:04,522
Isn’t that still a scumbag?

570
00:32:04,822 --> 00:32:05,623
I don't know either

571
00:32:05,623 --> 00:32:07,492
Is that his fiancée?

572
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:10,428
The two of us grew up together.

573
00:32:11,229 --> 00:32:13,932
Then both of them are pretty good too.

574
00:32:14,666 --> 00:32:16,634
Both families have felt that since childhood

575
00:32:16,634 --> 00:32:17,902
when they grow up

576
00:32:17,902 --> 00:32:19,237
We should be together

577
00:32:20,505 --> 00:32:21,172
And the two of them

578
00:32:21,172 --> 00:32:22,307
watching together

579
00:32:22,307 --> 00:32:23,908
It's a good match indeed

580
00:32:23,908 --> 00:32:25,610
His mother is also very kind to her

581
00:32:28,513 --> 00:32:30,214
But I think Shen Mi

582
00:32:30,882 --> 00:32:32,650
That's probably not what you think

583
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:37,555
OK OK

584
00:32:37,722 --> 00:32:39,257
In this case

585
00:32:40,058 --> 00:32:41,626
Then they both belong to

586
00:32:42,026 --> 00:32:44,462
Falling flowers have feelings, flowing water has no intention

587
00:32:45,396 --> 00:32:46,898
So you don't have to worry anymore

588
00:32:47,865 --> 00:32:49,534
Why am I not worried?

589
00:32:50,268 --> 00:32:52,136
His mother doesn't accept me

590
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:56,107
Let's get married now

591
00:32:56,107 --> 00:32:58,076
It's a matter of two families

592
00:32:58,576 --> 00:33:00,211
But in the final analysis

593
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:01,579
this day

594
00:33:01,579 --> 00:33:03,348
It's just the two of you

595
00:33:04,515 --> 00:33:05,516
So don't care about others

596
00:33:05,516 --> 00:33:07,719
what to do what to say

597
00:33:07,719 --> 00:33:10,121
It mainly depends on you and Shen Mi

598
00:33:10,121 --> 00:33:11,990
What do you two think?

599
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:12,824
right?

600
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,061
Tian Tian

601
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:18,596
You say aunt

602
00:33:18,596 --> 00:33:20,665
He always talks about his amazing love scene

603
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:21,432
something

604
00:33:21,432 --> 00:33:22,900
That's all a joke

605
00:33:23,401 --> 00:33:25,303
But as a woman

606
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:27,905
I really think Shen Mi him

607
00:33:27,905 --> 00:33:31,042
care about you very very very much

608
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:33,611
So what about this matter?

609
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:35,780
You have to ask him

610
00:33:37,882 --> 00:33:39,650
He will give you an answer

611
00:33:47,392 --> 00:33:48,426
aunt

612
00:33:48,893 --> 00:33:50,495
It's okay, it's okay, don't cry

613
00:34:08,112 --> 00:34:09,280
It's me Shen Mi

614
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,214
Are you free tonight?

615
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:11,883
I want to talk to you

616
00:34:12,583 --> 00:34:13,184
What time

617
00:34:13,851 --> 00:34:14,652
seven o'clock

618
00:34:17,021 --> 00:34:17,822
Shen Mi

619
00:34:18,256 --> 00:34:19,157
are you listening

620
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:21,459
Is it okay at 7pm?

621
00:34:24,529 --> 00:34:25,296
that

622
00:34:27,665 --> 00:34:28,699
ok i got it

623
00:34:37,775 --> 00:34:38,376
at night i

624
00:34:38,376 --> 00:34:40,111
I happen to have something to do tonight

625
00:34:40,344 --> 00:34:41,079
You don't have to wait for me anymore

626
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:41,779
Go back first

627
00:35:13,744 --> 00:35:14,879
Tian Yuxian

628
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:15,913
Can you

629
00:35:15,913 --> 00:35:17,415
Don't always occupy my workspace

630
00:35:17,415 --> 00:35:18,516
How do I work?

631
00:35:18,516 --> 00:35:19,250
Immediately Immediately

632
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:20,451
Right away, aunt, right away

633
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:28,626
How was your chat just now?

634
00:35:33,231 --> 00:35:34,098
Tian Yuxian

635
00:35:34,532 --> 00:35:35,533
You don’t concentrate on preparing for the competition

636
00:35:35,533 --> 00:35:37,201
You came here to be lazy, right?

637
00:35:37,201 --> 00:35:38,336
Who is lazy

638
00:35:38,336 --> 00:35:40,037
Didn't you see me at work?

639
00:35:40,438 --> 00:35:41,439
what are you looking at

640
00:35:44,842 --> 00:35:46,177
Sister, what's wrong with your eyes?

641
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:48,279
I asked you a question first

642
00:35:48,279 --> 00:35:49,380
I ask you what you are looking at

643
00:35:50,014 --> 00:35:51,015
Beautiful as you like

644
00:35:51,015 --> 00:35:52,116
You don't even know this

645
00:35:52,416 --> 00:35:53,651
That black shop a few days ago

646
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:54,952
Just start this business

647
00:36:03,794 --> 00:36:05,062
How is it? Not bad, right?

648
00:36:05,596 --> 00:36:07,031
What's good?

649
00:36:07,398 --> 00:36:08,299
don't you know

650
00:36:08,299 --> 00:36:09,200
cat and dog skin

651
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,102
Much more fragile and sensitive than humans

652
00:36:11,469 --> 00:36:12,503
That layer of their hair

653
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:14,305
It's just for protection

654
00:36:14,305 --> 00:36:15,540
You put the dye directly like this

655
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:16,741
stained on skin

656
00:36:16,741 --> 00:36:17,775
for them

657
00:36:17,775 --> 00:36:18,776
Or allergic

658
00:36:18,776 --> 00:36:19,377
Either it's possible

659
00:36:19,377 --> 00:36:20,611
Skin problems may occur

660
00:36:20,611 --> 00:36:22,146
There is also the possibility of massive hair removal

661
00:36:22,146 --> 00:36:23,548
This is nonsense

662
00:36:23,548 --> 00:36:24,615
Dr. Oda

663
00:36:25,416 --> 00:36:27,919
Dr. Oda

664
00:36:27,919 --> 00:36:28,986
Lao Zheng, what's wrong?

665
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,755
Please help me take a look

666
00:36:30,755 --> 00:36:32,423
What's wrong with my big bear? This is

667
00:36:32,423 --> 00:36:33,257
Lao Zheng

668
00:36:33,257 --> 00:36:34,258
You raise a national treasure

669
00:36:34,258 --> 00:36:35,993
That's illegal

670
00:36:35,993 --> 00:36:36,827
Forget it

671
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:38,896
I hugged it and went out for a walk.

672
00:36:38,896 --> 00:36:40,798
You can be stopped and asked three times

673
00:36:40,798 --> 00:36:41,399
What's wrong with you?

674
00:36:41,399 --> 00:36:42,500
It’s hard to dye it back

675
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:43,935
How can that be done?

676
00:36:44,402 --> 00:36:45,236
This is my favor

677
00:36:45,236 --> 00:36:46,470
It cost more than three thousand to get it

678
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:47,438
dye back

679
00:36:47,438 --> 00:36:48,739
Isn’t that blind?

680
00:36:48,739 --> 00:36:49,707
More than three thousand

681
00:36:50,107 --> 00:36:51,309
Let’s not talk about this for now.

682
00:36:51,576 --> 00:36:53,010
Let me see what's going on

683
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:53,678
have a look

684
00:36:58,716 --> 00:36:59,584
some time ago

685
00:36:59,584 --> 00:37:00,785
Not eating much anymore

686
00:37:01,018 --> 00:37:02,119
last two days

687
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:03,454
Just don't eat anything

688
00:37:03,921 --> 00:37:05,256
I drank less water too.

689
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:08,092
Lao Zheng

690
00:37:08,092 --> 00:37:09,293
The smell of your dye

691
00:37:09,293 --> 00:37:10,294
Quite heavy

692
00:37:17,001 --> 00:37:18,202
Yes a little bit

693
00:37:18,469 --> 00:37:19,503
But I think

694
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:20,871
Not bad

695
00:37:20,871 --> 00:37:21,906
OK

696
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:22,506
dog's sense of smell

697
00:37:22,506 --> 00:37:24,075
One thousand two hundred times that of humans

698
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:25,109
We think it's okay

699
00:37:25,109 --> 00:37:25,943
But for it

700
00:37:25,943 --> 00:37:27,511
This is very pungent

701
00:37:27,511 --> 00:37:28,512
That's like putting a person

702
00:37:28,512 --> 00:37:29,614
Locked in a room full of formaldehyde

703
00:37:29,614 --> 00:37:31,082
and paint paint room

704
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:32,717
Can he eat well and sleep well?

705
00:37:32,717 --> 00:37:33,918
Not to mention dogs

706
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:35,853
This is really the truth

707
00:37:37,121 --> 00:37:38,155
What should I do?

708
00:37:38,155 --> 00:37:39,690
We can only remove this layer of hair first

709
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:40,458
Shave them all

710
00:37:41,192 --> 00:37:42,159
That can't be done

711
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:43,227
What if I shave it?

712
00:37:43,227 --> 00:37:44,895
Isn’t my money wasted?

713
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:46,998
Help me think again

714
00:37:46,998 --> 00:37:48,299
Is there any other way?

715
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,174
big bear

716
00:37:57,475 --> 00:37:58,442
Be obedient

717
00:37:58,442 --> 00:37:59,577
The doctor is treating you

718
00:38:02,546 --> 00:38:03,781
You take it to my clinic

719
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:05,216
I'll give it a good look

720
00:38:05,216 --> 00:38:06,050
big bear

721
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:07,852
There may be something wrong with his ears

722
00:38:08,419 --> 00:38:08,919
OK

723
00:38:08,919 --> 00:38:09,520
come on

724
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:14,425
Big Bear Be Good

725
00:38:14,425 --> 00:38:15,893
Let the doctor check it out

726
00:38:16,861 --> 00:38:17,295
Come

727
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:18,496
Be good

728
00:38:20,197 --> 00:38:21,632
Let me look at your ears

729
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:25,770
External auditory canal and auricle

730
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:27,305
There are varying degrees of redness and swelling

731
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:28,372
Discharge of pus

732
00:38:28,739 --> 00:38:29,940
It must be inflammation

733
00:38:36,547 --> 00:38:37,148
look

734
00:38:38,582 --> 00:38:39,150
This is definitely

735
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,451
when you dye it

736
00:38:40,451 --> 00:38:41,118
dye

737
00:38:41,118 --> 00:38:42,620
Accidentally got it in the ear

738
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:44,355
Allergy and inflammation

739
00:38:45,022 --> 00:38:46,490
Take this for testing

740
00:38:51,395 --> 00:38:52,229
in dye

741
00:38:52,229 --> 00:38:54,031
Contains a lot of chemical ingredients

742
00:38:54,031 --> 00:38:54,598
If directly

743
00:38:54,598 --> 00:38:55,900
Contact with pet's skin

744
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:57,902
will cause very serious harm

745
00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:00,504
I just saw the base of its ears

746
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:02,573
Just because it was touched by dye

747
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,475
Allergic burning sensation

748
00:39:04,475 --> 00:39:05,509
So when I touch it

749
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:06,477
It will hurt

750
00:39:06,477 --> 00:39:07,611
Have a stress reaction

751
00:39:07,611 --> 00:39:09,547
If my inference is correct

752
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:10,748
It should be there all over the body

753
00:39:10,748 --> 00:39:11,816
Festered in many places

754
00:39:11,816 --> 00:39:13,217
It’s just that the hair is too long

755
00:39:13,217 --> 00:39:14,151
All covered

756
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:18,823
Lao Zheng

757
00:39:19,423 --> 00:39:21,492
So how did you decide

758
00:39:26,063 --> 00:39:26,897
listen to you

759
00:39:27,331 --> 00:39:28,032
Shave it

760
00:39:30,501 --> 00:39:32,269
Wen Jing, please make arrangements

761
00:39:32,269 --> 00:39:32,770
good

762
00:39:45,116 --> 00:39:46,016
big bear

763
00:39:47,118 --> 00:39:49,220
You'll suffer this time

764
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,756
I wanted to make you look better

765
00:40:02,633 --> 00:40:04,335
Treat you well from now on, Big Bear

766
00:40:04,802 --> 00:40:06,070
I'll never dye you again

767
00:40:11,475 --> 00:40:12,676
Big Bear has to be in the hospital

768
00:40:12,676 --> 00:40:14,011
Observe the infusion for several days

769
00:40:14,378 --> 00:40:15,880
Fortunately, my ears were saved

770
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:18,282
Doctor Tian

771
00:40:18,716 --> 00:40:20,651
Thank you very much this time

772
00:40:21,318 --> 00:40:22,019
look

773
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:23,154
I do not even know

774
00:40:23,154 --> 00:40:24,355
What should I say?

775
00:40:24,655 --> 00:40:26,223
This is what our hospital should do

776
00:40:27,224 --> 00:40:30,161
It's just you as the owner of the bear

777
00:40:30,161 --> 00:40:30,995
should also be respected

778
00:40:30,995 --> 00:40:32,630
and cherish it for what it is

779
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:34,865
I can't go through such trouble next time.

780
00:40:35,132 --> 00:40:36,200
understand

781
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:15,906
one day

782
00:41:15,906 --> 00:41:17,741
I want you to be my bride

783
00:41:18,042 --> 00:41:19,543
If you don’t believe it, let’s hook up

784
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:22,079
Hook hanging

785
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:23,614
No change allowed for a hundred years

786
00:41:23,614 --> 00:41:25,583
Whoever becomes a little wild boar

787
00:41:35,259 --> 00:41:35,993
Coming

788
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:36,994
Coming

789
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:40,698
What's up

790
00:41:40,698 --> 00:41:41,932
What do you want from me?

791
00:41:48,706 --> 00:41:50,107
Look what I brought you

792
00:42:00,117 --> 00:42:01,385
This piano is so beautiful

793
00:42:01,952 --> 00:42:03,120
Are you giving it to me?

794
00:42:15,132 --> 00:42:16,734
Don’t you remember this piano?
