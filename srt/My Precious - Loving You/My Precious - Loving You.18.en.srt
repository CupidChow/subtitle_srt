26
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,040
By the way,

27
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,080
how are those two piglets doing?

28
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,440
I gave them medicine before I went to sleep.

29
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,720
They're not having diarrhea anymore.

30
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,928
It's good.

31
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,460
By the way,

32
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:13,960
the wound on my face

33
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,840
won't leave a scar, right?

34
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,480
It won't.

35
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,360
It's fine.

36
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,760
Don't worry.

37
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,000
Don't think too much.

38
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,920
- Good night.
- Good night.

39
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,160
Good night, Carlo.

40
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,648
Shen Mi.

41
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,168
Shen Mi.

42
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,080
I'm here.

43
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,840
Why did you come here?

44
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,680
I couldn't sleep,

45
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,160
so I came out for a while.

46
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,840
Are you not sleeping?

47
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,480
I can't sleep either.

48
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,520
Let me accompany you.

49
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,040
I haven't really looked at the night sky

50
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,480
for a long time.

51
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,000
At night,

52
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,880
it's so quiet in the countryside.

53
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,360
Actually,
this sort of life away from the bustling world

54
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,480
is really comforting.

55
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,440
But someone like you,

56
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,040
a workaholic wound up like a clock,

57
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,280
probably wouldn't understand

58
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,880
the joy of slow life.

59
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,080
I can.

60
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,260
When Gao Zhuo and I

61
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:35,640
were young,

62
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,000
it was like this for us.

63
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,240
At that time, we were carefree,

64
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,680
never thinking about

65
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,160
what might happen in the future.

66
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,960
We just focused on the moment.

67
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,400
The most we were thinking about

68
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,440
was how to fill

69
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,480
our stomachs.

70
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,640
In fact, I really envy

71
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,840
those elders.

72
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,600
They are happy every day.

73
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,920
Not like us.

74
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,600
As soon as we wake up,

75
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,400
it's all about reports

76
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,820
and proposals.

77
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:12,160
And performance.

78
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,800
Every day I wake up,

79
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,400
it's all about performance.

80
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,720
And profits.

81
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,520
It's been a long time since I saw you

82
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,920
so happy.

83
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,480
Actually, I can feel

84
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,200
that since you came back,

85
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,360
you haven't been really happy.

86
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,080
Everyone has got some emotional wounds,

87
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,480
more or less.

88
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,960
I'm no different.

89
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,120
It's like an old scar

90
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,240
that hurts from time to time

91
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,280
to remind you of it.

92
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,760
But that scar

93
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,200
has long healed.

94
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,120
It's just that we can't go easy on ourselves.

95
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,360
In front of Gao Zhuo's grave,

96
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,600
I told you

97
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,040
he certainly wouldn't want you

98
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,080
to be like this.

99
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,000
What about you?

100
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,120
When will you pick up the scalpel again?

101
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,280
I once read a comic.

102
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,920
It said

103
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,360
after a pet died,

104
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,400
it actually went to heaven

105
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,760
and stayed at the edge of a cloud,

106
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,680
watching its owner day and night,

107
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,860
hoping

108
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,040
and waiting

109
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,080
to, one day,

110
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,680
reunite with us in heaven.

111
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,840
What about the departed people?

112
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,160
Where's their final resting place?

113
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:26,280
They must also be in some not distant stars

114
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,000
watching us and waiting for us.

115
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,520
Shen Mi, let's make a bet.

116
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,000
Bet what?

117
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,200
Let's bet

118
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,400
who can let go of the past

119
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,480
and start over first.

120
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,840
Deal.

121
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,432
Pinkie promise.

122
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,320
Deal.

123
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,472
Does it still hurt?

124
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,360
Not as much as before.

125
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,704
Don't worry. It won't leave a scar.

126
00:09:35,424 --> 00:09:36,600
Dr. Tian,

127
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,000
Dr. Tian, time to eat.

128
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,600
Dr. Tian, come eat.

129
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,496
Okay.

130
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:14,520
You stayed up late last night, right?

131
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,640
I went to see you earlier in the morning,
and you were still sleeping,

132
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,800
so I didn't wake you up.

133
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,880
Where is Mr. Zhao?

134
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,920
He's gone to dig up some vegetables for you.

135
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,680
Later, we'll catch a few chickens

136
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,720
for you to take away.

137
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,720
You guys enjoy yourselves here.

138
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,600
Tonight, I will cook a nice meal for you.

139
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,100
You guys can stay a few more days
and have fun here.

140
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,520
Thank you.

141
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,080
We didn't come here for fun.

142
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,540
You didn't come for fun?

143
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:40,400
Then why did you come all the way from the city

144
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,280
to this countryside?

145
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,360
We came to find someone.

146
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,800
Our pet hospital

147
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,680
wanted to collaborate with a big kennel,

148
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,680
but the owner

149
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,860
turned us down, not even letting us in.

150
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:51,880
Recently, we've heard

151
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,880
the owner is often seen

152
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,160
near Xiangshui Mountain,

153
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,200
so we thought about trying our luck.

154
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,420
What kennel is it?

155
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:01,280
It's "Panghu Kennel".

156
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,600
Old man,

157
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,160
come over here now.

158
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,560
I'm coming.

159
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,360
Dr. Tian, look.

160
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,200
This is the vegetable,

161
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,620
and this is our raised chicken,

162
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:15,840
all grown and raised by ourselves.

163
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,480
Take them when you leave.

164
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,360
You are too kind. Thank you.

165
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,680
You put it down first.

166
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,280
- Call your son now.
- For what?

167
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:26,080
They came to seek collaboration with Panghu.
Now you know it.

168
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,760
Why didn't you tell me before?

169
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,080
- You call him now!
- Old woman.

170
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,640
Actually, the owner of the Panghu Kennel

171
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,920
is my son.

172
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,980
Really?

173
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:38,040
Exactly.

174
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,640
Listen, boy.

175
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,080
Dr. Tian

176
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,960
has healed

177
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,000
two sick piglets at home

178
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,360
and also checked on others that were unwell.

179
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:53,680
What's wrong with helping them out?

180
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,720
I don't care what you think. I'm telling you.

181
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,520
The matter is settled.

182
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,440
If you don't do them the favor,

183
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,600
never come back home again.

184
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,616
Yes.

185
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,840
Dr. Tian,

186
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,840
it's all settled.

187
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,880
Later,

188
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,240
go to the kennel to see him.

189
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,320
That brat

190
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,560
must help you.

191
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,360
- But
- But what?

192
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,520
Say thank you to them.

193
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,080
- Thank you.
- Thank you very much.

194
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,080
It's just a matter of saying a few words.

195
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,980
No need to say thank you. Come on, eat.

196
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,760
We don't have much here,

197
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,880
just some plain food.

198
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,440
- Mr. Shen
- How did the discussion with Guo Fan go?

199
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,200
I just wanted to report to you about it.

200
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,680
They didn't agree.

201
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,720
What's the reason?

202
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,960
You couldn't agree on a price?

203
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,540
It's not about money at all.

204
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:50,200
As soon as Professor Guo heard
it was for animal lymphoma targeted drugs,

205
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,320
he immediately said no.

206
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,240
Thank you.

207
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,680
You always eat the same thing with me.

208
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,720
Don't you get tired of that?

209
00:13:07,488 --> 00:13:08,980
Of course not.

210
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:10,320
Moreover, my favorite

211
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,020
is the taste of the food in this restaurant.

212
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:13,080
Enough.

213
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,160
It's a bit disingenuous.

214
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,880
It's true.

215
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,000
And I think

216
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,360
if we have more chances

217
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,660
to get to know each other,

218
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:23,040
you'll find that we have more in common.

219
00:13:32,264 --> 00:13:35,104
<i>[Tianlin Animal Hospital]</i>

220
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,280
Ms. Pelan,

221
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,920
so Tian Tian and Mr. Shen

222
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,600
really spent last night together?

223
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,800
That's right.

224
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,800
My sister-in-law personally told me.

225
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,520
Shen Mi was on a video call with my brother.

226
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,560
Think about how late it was.

227
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,520
Now that both
of them haven't come to the hospital,

228
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:57,000
maybe they stayed there last night?

229
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,880
You're quite gossipy.

230
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,784
Lower your voice.

231
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,440
Mr. Shen, the things are here. I'm leaving.

232
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,152
You've worked hard. Thank you.

233
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,180
Chen, this…

234
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:26,360
I'm sorry

235
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,720
for making your e-bike look like this.

236
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,400
No problem.

237
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,160
I'll get a cloth and some water

238
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,560
and just wipe it.

239
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,580
Let me help you wash it.

240
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:36,960
No need. I'll do it myself.

241
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,800
Alright, then I'll go park.

242
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,408
Shen Mi,

243
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,184
come here.

244
00:14:51,776 --> 00:14:53,120
Last night,

245
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,840
you were staying outside with Tian Tian, right?

246
00:14:56,096 --> 00:14:57,480
Yes.

247
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,848
Sleeping in one bed?

248
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,480
Good for you, Shen Mi!

249
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,240
Great.

250
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,520
Stop making a fuss,
and get your mind out of the gutter.

251
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,360
We just slept and didn't do anything else.

252
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,560
What do you think we did?

253
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,552
You didn't do anything?

254
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,520
No.

255
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,640
I thought as much.

256
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,760
Tian Tian is a good girl.

257
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,480
How could she consort with someone like you?

258
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,840
But she was chatting and watching the stars
with me at night.

259
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,360
Is this fun for you, bro?

260
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,640
Don't pick up this call--

261
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,928
Mr. Han.

262
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,960
What is so urgent that I have to return now?

263
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,136
Alright, I got it.

264
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,200
You come back. Where are you going?

265
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,680
I didn't finish talking! You come back.

266
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,080
- I'll return when I'm done with my work.
- Good.

267
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,968
Shen Mi,

268
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,900
open the door.

269
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,152
Shen Mi.

270
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,800
Shen Mi,
you've got such a poker face and a cold heart.

271
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,160
Are you still my brother?

272
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,040
It's infuriating. You cruel man.

273
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,520
Dr. Gu,

274
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,720
this meal should've been offered to you

275
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,000
a long time ago.

276
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,720
Mr. Shen, you are too kind.

277
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,040
Dr. Gu,

278
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,280
could you do me

279
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,360
a little favor?

280
00:16:32,096 --> 00:16:33,440
Please go ahead.

281
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,300
Before the new drug release,

282
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,440
the company will conduct a series
of promotional activities.

283
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,960
You're now famous

284
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,040
on the Internet.

285
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,080
We want you

286
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,200
to participate

287
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,640
in some promotional activities.

288
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,640
Mr. Shen,

289
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,880
I'm just a developer.

290
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,920
My main job should be product development.

291
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,300
As for the promotional matters,

292
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,760
I think I won't participate.

293
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,480
Dr. Gu,

294
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,600
from what I observed,

295
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:05,560
you're not the sort of person
who is focused solely on research.

296
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:08,620
What do you mean by that?

297
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:10,680
I saw it at the company.

298
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,480
You've been getting close to Mengnan.

299
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:15,720
I heard that after you guys went abroad,

300
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,180
you ate

301
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:18,560
and played by the seaside together.

302
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,520
You're in a good relationship.

303
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,480
Mr. Shen,

304
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,520
are you worried

305
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,760
that I will establish some kind of relationship

306
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,400
with Shen Mi through Miss Han?

307
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,720
I'm not worried about that.

308
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,560
Didn't you say when you entered the company

309
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,440
that you were not interested

310
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,560
in the complex interpersonal relationships?

311
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,000
I did say that before.

312
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,320
I'm still maintaining it now.

313
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,120
I just simply

314
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,240
admire Miss Han.

315
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,620
Mr. Shen, if there's nothing else,
I will go back to the company.

316
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:51,680
Thank you for your lunch.

317
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,040
<i>Compared to the number of lost lives,</i>

318
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,000
<i>you have saved more lives,</i>

319
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,920
<i>right?</i>

320
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,040
<i>Carlo has woken up.</i>

321
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,400
<i>That's why Carlo survived.</i>

322
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,540
<i>You gave him a second life.</i>

323
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:34,840
<i>To Carlo,</i>

324
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,680
<i>you are his hero.</i>

325
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,400
Cut in vertically,

326
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,720
and then cut horizontally.

327
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,940
<i>Zaizai, wake up.</i>

328
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:05,040
<i>Wake up, Zaizai.</i>

329
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,640
<i>Only through relentless trials</i>

330
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:12,200
<i>can one become truly strong.</i>

331
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,240
For every lie Pinocchio told,

332
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,820
his nose would grow an inch longer.

333
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:31,240
His nose got longer and longer.

334
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,820
Pinocchio cried from fear.

335
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,280
When Pinocchio told a lie,

336
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,780
his nose would grow longer.

337
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:37,440
The Blue Fairy called for a woodpecker

338
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,020
to peck at Pinocchio's nose.

339
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:40,680
Finally, they managed

340
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,400
to return his nose to its original state.

341
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,540
There's not a big issue.

342
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:00,480
Come back again for a follow-up next Tuesday.

343
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,080
Be good.

344
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,360
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

345
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,192
Tian.

346
00:20:22,144 --> 00:20:23,500
What's up?

347
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,600
Come close.

348
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,000
I know a huge secret in our hospital.

349
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,800
What secret?

350
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,280
It's about Shen Chen.

351
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,360
What happened to him?

352
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,440
He…

353
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:47,720
You two are always whispering sweet nothings.

354
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,840
We are discussing work.

355
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,040
You're not hiding it from others anymore.

356
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:55,600
I was telling the truth. Tian,
show me the patient records from last month.

357
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,560
Why are you staring at me?
I'm just here to get some water.

358
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,720
You guys carry on.

359
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,080
Come and tell me now.

360
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,760
Well,

361
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,600
Shen Chen is Shen Mi's younger brother.

362
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,080
Do you have any proof?

363
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,980
It's true. I overheard it at the door.

364
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:17,560
Shen Chen called Shen Mi "brother".

365
00:21:22,688 --> 00:21:23,960
Why?

366
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,240
What a stupid piece of gossip.

367
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,520
I'm telling the truth.

368
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,640
Shen Chen has no filter.

369
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:32,520
No matter who he meets,
he can shoehorn them into being family.

370
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,760
He calls everyone "brother".

371
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,480
I've heard him

372
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,040
calling Shen Mi "brother" several times.

373
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,060
Are Shen Mi and Shen Chen

374
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:41,960
pursuing our director?

375
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,240
They argue frequently.

376
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,080
So what?

377
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,800
Considering Shen Mi's position,

378
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,000
isn't it an easy thing for him

379
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,440
to fire such a rival in love?

380
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:54,280
That's because Shen Mi is generous.

381
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:55,960
Not like you,

382
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:58,320
niggling about every little thing with me.

383
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,400
Why are you involving me
when talking about someone else?

384
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,800
Fine, let's just talk about Shen Mi then.

385
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,520
I think

386
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,320
Shen Mi is the elite type.

387
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,440
As for Shen Chen,

388
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,760
he's always making light of life,

389
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,080
almost equal to Tian Yuxian.

390
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,040
I think

391
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,480
he and Tian Yuxian

392
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,560
can't be more like brothers.

393
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,832
Where is he?

394
00:22:21,344 --> 00:22:22,656
Boring.

395
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,960
Bro, what's going on with you?

396
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,400
You've lost five games in a row.

397
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,720
I don't want to either.

398
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,720
I'm not in the mood now,

399
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,720
so I can't fully focus on the game,

400
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,080
and I can't win.

401
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,420
Isn't it all because of my sister?

402
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:39,440
Exactly.

403
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,740
It's because of your sister.

404
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:41,800
Your sister even

405
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,640
stayed overnight with Shen Mi.

406
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,160
Of course.

407
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,320
I don't distrust Tian Tian.

408
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,760
But if things keep going

409
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,560
like this,

410
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,820
and their feelings develop over time,

411
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:54,160
your sister may not be able
to hold back anymore

412
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,700
and fall for his tricks.

413
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,520
He'll replace me

414
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,080
as your brother-in-law.

415
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,320
I don't want that poker face
to be my brother-in-law.

416
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,680
Yuxian, it's comforting to hear you say that.

417
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,640
When are you going to take me to our house

418
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,320
to see our father and mother?

419
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,800
- Stop, that's a different story.
- How can it be different?

420
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,960
It is really a different thing.

421
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,120
The day you take me to see Xing Tao

422
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,360
will be the day I take you to see my parents.

423
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,600
OK, Tian Yuxian.

424
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,080
If that's what you want.

425
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,120
Set up a meeting with Xing Tao for me.

426
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,096
<i>He left the group.</i>

427
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,500
When did he leave the group?

428
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,600
<i>You don't know it?</i>

429
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,480
I didn't know. Bye.

430
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,760
Why did he leave the group?

431
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,000
How would I know?

432
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,320
I have other ways to let you meet him.

433
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,800
<i>[Rebirth Birthday Party]</i>
Rebirth Birthday Party.

434
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,400
What does this mean?

435
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,600
Don't you know once you go to it?

436
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,360
- Can I go?
- Can I go to our house?

437
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,520
If you take me to the birthday party,
I will certainly take you to my house.

438
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,000
Of course I will if you take me--

439
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,680
Dr. Shen, emergency. Hurry up.

440
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,576
I'm coming.

441
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,560
Dr. Shen is here.

442
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,080
Dr. Shen.

443
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,320
Sit down and don't worry.

444
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,820
Chen, how's it?

445
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:33,000
Its blood pressure is already high. 180.

446
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,120
Its mouth smells of urine.

447
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,960
Abdominal fluid accumulation.

448
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,080
It might be uremia.

449
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,464
It's shivering.

450
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,800
Get it on oxygen now.

451
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,400
- Wen Jing, Valium.
- Okay.

452
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,240
It's shaking severely.

453
00:25:04,928 --> 00:25:06,200
Hurry.

454
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,320
Be good and hold on. Come on.

455
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,800
Here it is.

456
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,120
- Here you are.
- Hold it down.

457
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,760
Be good and hold on.

458
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,128
It's okay.

459
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,040
Doctor, how is Sunny doing now?

460
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,320
Look at this.

461
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,960
Bilateral renal echo enhancement,
renal parenchyma thinning.

462
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,400
Poor demarcation
between the cortex and the medulla,

463
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,320
which is to say

464
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,240
its kidneys

465
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,680
lack normal structural features.

466
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,640
W-What does it mean?

467
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,840
Preliminary diagnosis.

468
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,480
It's kidney failure.

469
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,840
Doctor, how is Sunny doing now?

470
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,040
Sunny is suffering from acute uremia

471
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,560
caused by kidney failure.

472
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,360
And there is a large amount of ascitic fluid
in the abdomen.

473
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,000
I have already given it two injections
of ethacrynic acid.

474
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,220
But its blood creatinine and potassium

475
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:19,600
far exceed the normal range.

476
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,360
Just tell me how to treat it.

477
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:23,680
We can only

478
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,360
try peritoneal dialysis and see how it goes.

479
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,760
But because the condition
of the kidneys is bad,

480
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,280
the results might not be good.

481
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,360
To tell you the truth,

482
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,800
Sunny is already 13.

483
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,400
Dialysis does have some effect,

484
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,560
but renal failure is irreversible.

485
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,240
Sunny also has multiple complications.

486
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,280
Continuing like this

487
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,720
will only increase its pain.

488
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,320
Dr. Shen is saying

489
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,880
that based on Sunny's current condition,

490
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:44,000
we can at most only prolong its life.

491
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,600
You mean to suggest

492
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,000
that I should give it up?

493
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,040
Euthanasia is the best option.

494
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,440
No.

495
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,080
I won't give it up.

496
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,440
No matter what the cost,

497
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,960
you have to help me save it.

498
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,320
Doctors, I beg you.

499
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,240
You must save it.

500
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,640
Let me tell you, there are so many of us.

501
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:36,140
- You're here.
- You came. Sit.

502
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:37,200
Shen Chen.

503
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,240
Take your time eating.

504
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,620
What's wrong with you?

505
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:41,760
You're always late.

506
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,880
Is it any of your business?

507
00:27:43,616 --> 00:27:45,200
This is…

508
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,700
Tian Yuxian, my little brother.

509
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:47,960
My good buddy, Shi Kai.

510
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,568
- Hello.
- Hello.

511
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,040
What's going on today?

512
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,440
He has been missing for four months.

513
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,160
He suddenly invited us to this party.
What is his intention?

514
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,680
Ice Blue Rose.

515
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,280
- Do you know?
- Beats me.

516
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,200
I've asked around and no one knows.

517
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,280
Do you know?

518
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:05,100
I don't know.

519
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,000
Ice Blue Rose is a man.

520
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,352
A man playing as a woman.

521
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,680
You two wait a moment.

522
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,752
Come.

523
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,160
Let me introduce her.

524
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,960
My girlfriend, Lulu.

525
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,600
- Nice to meet you.
- Hello.

526
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,608
Lulu?

527
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:30,760
<i>This is for me?</i>

528
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:33,940
<i>[Lulu, I love you]</i>
<i>This firework is specially prepared</i>

529
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:35,400
<i>for you.</i>

530
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:38,480
<i>Who is Lulu?</i>

531
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,280
The Lulu from "Lulu, I love you".

532
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,520
You don't have to say it out.

533
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,520
You are so lucky.

534
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,720
He is Jerk Kai.

535
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,240
He's a good guy.

536
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:53,240
If you don't know how to talk,
can you just shut up?

537
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,480
I wanted to. Never you mind.

538
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,840
- What?
- What's going on?

539
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,440
<i>Hello, everyone.</i>

540
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,880
- Xing Tao.
- What's going on?

541
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,800
- <i>Hello.</i>
- That is Xing Tao?

542
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,904
Yes.

543
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:09,920
Where are you?

544
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:12,420
<i>Do any of you miss me?</i>

545
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:14,240
You still didn't show up. Who would miss you?

546
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,240
<i>Take it easy.</i>

547
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,920
<i>Let me treat you to this meal, okay?</i>

548
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,600
Just a meal, huh?

549
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,800
I don't want to eat.

550
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,200
Where are you?

551
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,960
<i>I think I heard someone cursing me.</i>

552
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,880
- Yes, it is you.
- We are cursing you.

553
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,840
- Yes, we are cursing you.
- What's wrong with that?

554
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,560
<i>Let me tell you.</i>

555
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,080
<i>The food in this restaurant</i>

556
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,240
<i>is very delicious.</i>

557
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,700
<i>I ordered all your favorites.</i>

558
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:39,680
Bullshit. I hate cake the most.

559
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,840
<i>Shi Kai,</i>

560
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:43,360
<i>have you seen that little suckling pig?</i>

561
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:47,320
<i>I ordered it specially for you.</i>

562
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,000
Then you ordered it wrong.

563
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,560
You should have ordered oysters for him.

564
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,520
What Lulu or else?

565
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,720
- Thanks a lot.
- Don't mention it.

566
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,880
<i>Shen Chen,</i>

567
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,400
<i>you told me</i>

568
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,160
<i>you'd brought my fan.</i>

569
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,680
- <i>His name is…</i>
- Isn't this him?

570
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,760
<i>Tian Yuxian.</i>

571
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,640
I'm here!

572
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,560
<i>Did you bring him?</i>

573
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,640
<i>I believe you have done it.</i>

574
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,200
<i>Hi, Tian Yuxian.</i>

575
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,880
<i>Nice to meet you.</i>

576
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,880
<i>Sorry for the lack of care. Enjoy the food.</i>

577
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,820
- Where is he?
- What's going on?

578
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:27,480
- Where is he?
- He must be here. Let's call him out.

579
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:37,400
Out!

580
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:44,600
Out!

581
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,000
What?

582
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,280
- Xing Tao.
- What's going on?

583
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,400
What happened?

584
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,824
Yeah.

585
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,720
What's up? Can't you recognize me?

586
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,480
What happened to you?

587
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,280
What?

588
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:03,840
I'm fine. What can happen to me?

589
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,280
Four months ago,

590
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:15,400
Tao suddenly fainted at home.

591
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,680
They found out he had a late-stage brain tumor.

592
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:24,440
Now the tumor is compressing his optic nerve.

593
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:29,720
He can hardly see with his eyes.

594
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:32,120
Mom, it's not as serious as you said.

595
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,240
I'm fine. Don't listen to her.

596
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,480
Ma'am, if you need any help,

597
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,560
just tell us.

598
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,840
There are so many of us.

599
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,240
Yes, we are here.

600
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,560
That's so icky.

601
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,560
Enough.

602
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,600
It's my fault.

603
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,760
I shouldn't have kept it from you.

604
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,960
Okay, to express my apology.

605
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,160
Shi Kai,

606
00:31:57,160 --> 00:32:00,200
you've always wanted
my limited edition graphics card, right?

607
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,072
I'll give it to you.

608
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,624
Shen Chen,

609
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,000
I'll give you my game account.

610
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,840
There are still a lot of tickets and points

611
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,520
from the official competition left.

612
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:17,360
Can you redeem them for skins for everyone?

613
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,960
Luo Yun

614
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:22,160
and others, if you want any skins,

615
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,600
just tell Shen Chen.

616
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,440
Mom,

617
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,760
I have a few more words to say to them.

618
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,160
My buddies,

619
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:42,680
you have all had your meal

620
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,480
and got your outfits.

621
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,480
As the saying goes,

622
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,000
there's no such thing

623
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,720
as a free lunch.

624
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,280
So next,

625
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,720
you guys must do me

626
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,120
a favor.

627
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,400
After I'm gone,

628
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,640
take care of my mother.

629
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,640
Tao.

630
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,640
Mom,

631
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,640
ever since you divorced my dad,

632
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,120
you've never remarried.

633
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:30,040
You sacrificed too much for me.

634
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,720
Mom, but your love is too heavy.

635
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,920
I can't bear it.

636
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,160
I know you want me

637
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,480
to be a good child,

638
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,720
but I have let you down.

639
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,280
No.

640
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,320
Yes.

641
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:50,240
All these years,
I have been a burden in your life.

642
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,000
It's okay now.

643
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,880
I have to leave early.

644
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,440
What are you talking about?

645
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,280
I won't be a burden to you anymore.

646
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,240
In the future,

647
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,800
you won't worry about my future anymore.

648
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:10,040
You can live

649
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:12,800
your own life, okay?

650
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,080
What nonsense you are talking about?

651
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,760
Stop.

652
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,000
Go back with me.

653
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,880
Mom.

654
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:22,679
Tao.

655
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,280
Are you okay?

656
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,880
I heard

657
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,280
what the doctor told you.

658
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:33,479
Didn't the doctor say two months ago

659
00:34:33,479 --> 00:34:35,640
that I wouldn't survive for two months?

660
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,088
Mom,

661
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:40,199
it is the 61st day.

662
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,120
I got a bonus.

663
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,160
Please listen to me, Tao.

664
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,540
Let's go back to the hospital.

665
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:08,840
Mom, I don't want to go back.

666
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,040
Mom, don't.

667
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,000
Let's leave.

668
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,800
Tao.

669
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,280
Xing Tao.

670
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,680
Tao, are you okay?

671
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,592
Mom,

672
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,408
I…

673
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,040
I have one last wish.

674
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,720
Tell me.

675
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:34,320
I can do anything.

676
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,080
I can do everything for you.

677
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,480
I want to bring Sunny back.

678
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,520
Tao.

679
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:47,000
- Tao.
- Xing Tao.

680
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,880
Let's go back to the hospital.

681
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,360
- Go back to the hospital.
- Xing Tao.

682
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,440
So what he was referring to was that Sunny.

683
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,080
Now both of them are in a bad condition.

684
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,400
What should we do, Chen?

685
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,920
Aren't the man and the dog fine?

686
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,000
Stop nagging.

687
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:20,020
But Xing Tao said at the Rebirth Party

688
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:22,440
he wanted to take Sunny back to a place.

689
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,720
We have to figure out a solution for him,
don't we?

690
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,900
Even if the hospital agrees to bring Sunny in,

691
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:33,460
he can't take a step
without the dialysis machine right now.

692
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:34,800
What can we do?

693
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,240
Chen, I have a way.

694
00:37:41,179 --> 00:37:45,999
<i>[Tianlin Animal Hospital]</i>

695
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,720
Tian Tian, you go get some rest
and I'll keep an eye on it.

696
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:19,840
Okay, replace the dialysate in two hours.

697
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,344
Okay.

698
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:08,864
Chen,

699
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:12,420
make sure that you bring everything

700
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:13,720
Sunny needs for peritoneal dialysis.

701
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,840
Everything is packed up.

702
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:18,600
But not telling your sister about this

703
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,400
makes me feel uneasy.

704
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,240
My sister will definitely not agree.

705
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,160
But if we don't do this,

706
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,040
I'm afraid we won't get another chance.

707
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,240
Go for Xing Tao!

708
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,704
Go for Sunny.

709
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:34,920
Let's go.

710
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,728
What happened?

711
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,000
Sunny's dead.

712
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,760
No. You are kidding me, right?

713
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,560
Sunny,

714
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,160
Sunny, don't fall asleep.

715
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,800
Sunny.

716
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,400
There must be a way. It can't be.

717
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:10,920
It's not true. Check it again.

718
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,440
Could you please check again?

719
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,640
Could you do

720
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:14,800
cardiopulmonary resuscitation on it?

721
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:15,920
- Can you? I'm begging you.
- Yuxian,

722
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,840
it's really gone.

723
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,380
No, you're lying to me.

724
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:21,760
There must be a way.

725
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,840
Tian Tian,
Sunny no longer has any signs of life.

726
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,440
Chen, we must have a way.

727
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:49,440
Yuxian.

728
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,960
Sunny, wake up, please.

729
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,420
Don't fall asleep, Sunny.

730
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:53,920
That's enough.

731
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:00,960
Let me say thank you

732
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:02,880
for Xing Tao.

733
00:41:15,648 --> 00:41:17,180
Ma'am,

734
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:19,440
where exactly did Xing Tao want
to take Sunny back to?

735
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,360
Back to that sea.

736
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:29,760
Our old home was in a small town by the sea.

737
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,600
When his father and I chose

738
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:36,400
to get a divorce,

739
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,320
Tao couldn't accept it

740
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,760

<i>♫ Only enough to accommodate me ♫</i>

<i>♫ Only you will still remember ♫</i>

751
00:43:06,191 --> 00:43:08,495
<i>♫ My appearance ♫</i>
