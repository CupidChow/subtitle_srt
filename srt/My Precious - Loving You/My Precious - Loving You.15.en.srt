1
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,520
No, you're going too far

2
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,160
your dog died

3
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,360
Why don't you find a dog seller?

4
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,040
I already said

5
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,640
You guys are obviously in the same group

6
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,360
OK, close the door

7
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,040
what do you want to do

8
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,160
Do you want to hit someone?

9
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,240
Sister Ju

10
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,640
can you calm down a little

11
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,240
what do we have to say

12
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,360
Speak slowly now

13
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,120
speak slowly

14
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,560
I tell you

15
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,640
I'm not done with you

16
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:58,680
That's it

17
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,240
your mood

18
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,520
We all understand very well

19
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,600
things have happened

20
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,240
Are we now

21
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,480
We should find a way to solve it

22
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,360
you tell us

23
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,360
What is your request?

24
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,480
We are willing to do our best

25
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,400
to help you

26
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,120
solve

27
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,240
my appeal

28
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,040
Can you really help me solve it?

29
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,320
As long as it's a reasonable request

30
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,840
Let's help you solve it, okay?

31
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,760
OK

32
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,360
I want my babe

33
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,840
Give me back my babe

34
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,840
Sister Ju, Beibei has left

35
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:31,840
this matter

36
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,160
There's really nothing we can do

37
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,160
You lose your love for your dog

38
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,120
hit

39
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:37,440
we all

40
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,160
Very understanding and sympathetic

41
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:40,760
Otherwise

42
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,960
we are willing

43
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,760
for all losses suffered by you

44
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,600
Make compensation

45
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,920
compensation

46
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,600
Want to throw money at it

47
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,520
Then you really got me wrong

48
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,960
I really didn’t come here to extort money.

49
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,600
Well

50
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,080
How do you want to solve it

51
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,360
You looked familiar to me just now

52
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,360
Are you Shen Mi from Green River Group?

53
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,240
it's me

54
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,720
What did I say?

55
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,080
I said you Tian Lin is so tough

56
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,280
Be confident in doing things

57
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,080
It turns out there is someone behind me.

58
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,080
sister chrysanthemum sister chrysanthemum

59
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:17,760
We still solve it

60
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,080
The immediate issue is important

61
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,080
Now if both sides

62
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:20,920
The stalemate continues

63
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,120
Not good for anyone

64
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:22,600
What do you say?

65
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,400
good

66
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,640
solve

67
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,440
I'm not short of money

68
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,880
I also have plenty of time

69
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:35,760
Are you finished?

70
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:36,960
Finished

71
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,160
You destroyed Tian Lin

72
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,240
A few of us

73
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,160
Just take your dog

74
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,640
Resurrection from the dead?

75
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,040
I tell you

76
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,320
Now this matter

77
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,080
There is no solution

78
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:57,880
Of course

79
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,400
Hands are on your body

80
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,520
how do you want to write

81
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,080
Just write how you want

82
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:04,920
As long as you write the content

83
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:05,960
is true

84
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,840
We all admit it

85
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,600
but i warn you

86
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,360
If in the article you write

87
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,280
There is a false accusation

88
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,680
There is something false in it

89
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,000
I am fine too

90
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,279
Midorikawa is also good

91
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,760
Tian Lin is also good

92
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,600
Stay with me to the end

93
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,880
Did you hear that, Sister Ju?

94
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,480
We will stay with you until the end

95
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,680
Goodbye internet celebrity

96
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,600
Comfortable

97
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,160
Comfortable

98
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:48,600
no

99
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,920
Why are you so free-minded?

100
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,400
Also comb it

101
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,360
What are you in a hurry for?

102
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,400
Can I not be in a hurry?

103
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,040
It's good for you. You feel happy for a while.

104
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,040
What should Tian Lin do?

105
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:58,560
You're like this

106
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,160
Just start a war with her.

107
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,400
Go ahead and start a war

108
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:02,800
I tell you

109
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,080
Then let's go to war

110
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,600
What about since I entered Midorikawa?

111
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,160
until today

112
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,360
As far as I know

113
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,280
Our Midorikawa lawsuit

114
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,960
never lost a game

115
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,480
So what if I win?

116
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,040
Now is not the time to talk about this

117
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,000
Do you know what it means?

118
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,880
Spread rumors with one mouth

119
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,280
Refuting rumors and running into trouble

120
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,760
What will happen if we win the lawsuit?

121
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,400
That rumor is already flying everywhere

122
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,960
Tian Lin has worked hard for so many years

123
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:23,720
accumulated reputation

124
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,160
It will be destroyed in one day

125
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:25,960
That's right

126
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,960
What is right?

127
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:28,560
you this person

128
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,760
Why were you so impulsive just now?

129
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,760
You're not like this usually

130
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,800
can you speak before

131
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,280
Use your brain a little bit

132
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,040
you are talking about me now

133
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,600
Are you still talking about yourself?

134
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,400
Am I following you?

135
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,800
Staying together for too long

136
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,360
what do i think

137
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,720
I'm totally infected by you

138
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,120
I'm serious about this

139
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,200
I'm not kidding you

140
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,680
Because of this incident, Tian Lin

141
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,480
About to be destroyed

142
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,040
Fine

143
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,400
Come, you sit

144
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,920
You have to be more serious, right? Okay

145
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,520
why do you think

146
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,800
Chen Yifan and Sister Ju

147
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,400
in description

148
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,400
In the case of the same thing

149
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,520
Is there such a big difference?

150
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,360
You know in psychology

151
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,520
There is a saying called

152
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,920
Confirmation bias?

153
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,160
Then let me tell you about it

154
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:11,800
First

155
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,920
people just want to see

156
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,560
What you want to see

157
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,320
second

158
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,240
by oneself

159
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,200
Imagine what others see

160
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,520
I see

161
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,560
people only want

162
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,600
See what you want to see

163
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,280
That is to say

164
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,760
Chen Yifan has already told Sister Ju

165
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,800
There is an incubation period

166
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,160
But she said no

167
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,800
Because she just wants to see

168
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,840
Beibei’s test results

169
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,240
no problem

170
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,520
So it’s automatically masked

171
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,040
Hidden dangers during the incubation period

172
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,760
When Beibei gets sick

173
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,920
She took these grievances

174
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,640
All vented

175
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,480
On Tianlin and the kennel

176
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,280
then

177
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,080
when she bumped into

178
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,320
Boss Fei and Chen Yifan

179
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,960
When having a secret conversation in the office

180
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,640
She thought there was something wrong

181
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,360
what are they having

182
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,960
ulterior transaction

183
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,680
A meal of analysis is as fierce as a tiger

184
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,960
But everything is right

185
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,400
So smart

186
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,480
There is progress

187
00:06:58,840 --> 00:06:59,640
But

188
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,920
In our lives

189
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,440
There are many people who are willing to rely on

190
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,480
I think I think

191
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,480
to guess other people's thoughts

192
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,360
and the truth of the matter

193
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,360
Then what?

194
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,520
They will be very accustomed to it

195
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,680
imagine things

196
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,200
impose on others

197
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,480
that's why

198
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,080
Sister Ju will always think

199
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,040
She herself is one

200
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,320
Victim's Cause

201
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,600
That's why she

202
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,640
Find so many people

203
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,040
Come and cause trouble in our store

204
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,160
Because

205
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,840
She has put herself

206
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,480
On the moral high ground

207
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,960
Then isn’t this the keyboard warrior?

208
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,000
He's the keyboard warrior

209
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,200
So what are some tricks to deal with keyboard warriors?

210
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,200
tough

211
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,320
fuck her

212
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,160
no

213
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,240
What do you say?

214
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,960
I think it is necessary

215
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,200
What is necessary?

216
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,840
It's too late. See it for yourself.

217
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,120
Sister Ju has posted

218
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,520
That who

219
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,720
I'll give you twenty-four hours

220
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,880
Apologize in person

221
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,880
and publish it online

222
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,080
public apology letter

223
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,920
Otherwise, don't blame me for being rude

224
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,520
This guy is so quick to strike

225
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,360
What should I do?

226
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,280
Apologize

227
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,040
are you crazy

228
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:00,000
What should I do?

229
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,560
There is only one way

230
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,080
Tintin kennel

231
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,000
arrive

232
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,760
Shen Chen

233
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,040
Don't be nervous

234
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,200
As soon as you get in, follow my instructions.

235
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,680
Play it by ear

236
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,280
No matter what today

237
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,080
Tell him the truth

238
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:26,800
Walk

239
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:36,799
good

240
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,640
Lao Fei

241
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,920
It's not you, what are you doing?

242
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,000
Boss Fei

243
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,040
That not long ago

244
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,360
You go to our Tianlin Hospital

245
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,760
Follow us Dr. Chen

246
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,720
What specific business did you exchange?

247
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,680
Doctor Chen

248
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,400
Chen Yifan

249
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,160
Nothing to talk about

250
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,480
Lao Fei

251
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,240
I didn’t want to cooperate last time

252
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,560
Didn't the cooperation work?

253
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,920
Let’s talk this time

254
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:16,880
Seek cooperation

255
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,680
right

256
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,160
You see

257
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,560
I am the person in charge of Tianlin Hospital

258
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,440
what's the matter with you

259
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,680
You can chat with us directly

260
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,320
right

261
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,400
Director of Tianlin Hospital

262
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:25,880
i know you

263
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,680
cooperation pair

264
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,080
What cooperation are you talking about?

265
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,560
Why can’t I understand?

266
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,560
That Boss Fei

267
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,160
Didn't you say before

268
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,520
Is there a group of dogs with parvovirus?

269
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,280
right

270
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,560
Last time you talked to Chen Yifan

271
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,440
Not settled

272
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,840
I'll go tell him

273
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,040
Let him prescribe this for us

274
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,080
fake test report

275
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,080
We lie to customers

276
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,160
How to divide the money, how to divide the money

277
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,360
What to say

278
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,400
What's so small?

279
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,880
Dogs from our Tintin kennel

280
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,080
Still healthy

281
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,360
Stop talking nonsense here.

282
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,680
Lao Fei, you are like this

283
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,520
What you said as an old man

284
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,160
Why doesn't it count?

285
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,320
Okay

286
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,800
That shit about your Tianlin Hospital

287
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,520
I've seen it online

288
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,440
I am a serious businessman

289
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,840
Don't try to drag me down

290
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,360
Is there anything else?

291
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,560
Didn't let me out

292
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,360
No, Lao Fei

293
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,160
go out

294
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,080
Otherwise, I will let the dogs bite you.

295
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:22,600
believe it or not

296
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,080
go out

297
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:23,400
OK

298
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,800
go out go out go

299
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,240
See you next time

300
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,680
Do you dare to come another day?

301
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,440
Walk

302
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,000
Want to fool me

303
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,360
Still a little tender

304
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,440
What's wrong, Carlo?

305
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,440
Was it because of that woman today?

306
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,320
Scared

307
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,520
It doesn't matter, I'm here

308
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,480
No one can take you away

309
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,640
Why do you stink so much?

310
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,000
Take a bath, okay?

311
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,280
Carlo

312
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:03,760
good

313
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,320
Take you to take a bath

314
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,880
Come over here Carlo

315
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,400
Come to Carlo

316
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,720
Good baby

317
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,960
Come over

318
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,000
Take a shower Take a shower

319
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,200
So good

320
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:18,960
Come and sit

321
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,040
sit down

322
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,080
Carlo

323
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,120
So good

324
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,440
I tell you

325
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:24,680
I will definitely

326
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,280
Make you smell good

327
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,600
Just wait

328
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,760
Not allowed to go anywhere

329
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,080
Don't jump in yourself

330
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:34,520
Don't move

331
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,640
You have to wait for me to come back

332
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,200
good

333
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:39,760
Who?

334
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,760
Just got off the plane

335
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,120
Stop looking. Tian Tian is not here.

336
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,080
How did you know I was looking for her?

337
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:10,920
Are you guilty?

338
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,960
What am I guilty of?

339
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,080
I have something to ask you

340
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:16,800
What's going on

341
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,440
Who is Gao Zhuo?

342
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,320
how do you know

343
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,800
When you worship him

344
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,800
Have you brought Dr. Tian with you?

345
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,760
I asked you how you knew

346
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:40,720
answer me

347
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,480
I will give you something that day

348
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,400
Set up location sharing with you

349
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,680
How can you do such a thing?

350
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,240
I can do it all

351
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,160
don't you think

352
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,560
Is this too much?

353
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,280
are you crazy

354
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:27,560
this secret

355
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,400
You hid it from me for more than ten years

356
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,400
but can be shared with one

357
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,280
A woman I’ve known for less than three months

358
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,840
Am I going too far?

359
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,400
every time you go there

360
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,800
Is it all to pay homage to him?

361
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,280
You've touched my bottom line

362
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:54,920
bottom line

363
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,680
bottom line

364
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,440
Shen Mi

365
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,320
Since my eighteenth birthday

366
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,160
You start deliberately

367
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,320
alienate me, indifference to me

368
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,480
every day after this

369
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,320
You're all stepping on my bottom line

370
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,800
I've always wanted to know

371
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,280
What did I do wrong?

372
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,920
why do you do this to me

373
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,040
You go back and rest

374
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,360
Shen Mi

375
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,080
Shen Mi

376
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,560
you did nothing wrong

377
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,240
it's all my fault

378
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,360
I never liked you

379
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,160
Do you understand me?

380
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,440
sorry

381
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,360
You go

382
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,120
Tell us about you and Han Mengnan

383
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,120
what do you want to hear

384
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,160
Just talk about you two

385
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,200
When did we meet?

386
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,720
January 10th

387
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,560
Okay, I remember it so clearly

388
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,120
When I first met her

389
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,800
I was just thinking

390
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,040
How could there be

391
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,480
Such a beautiful little girl

392
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,120
And this time of year

393
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,400
we will all be together

394
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,280
very nice

395
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,960
Wait until you go back

396
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,320
Be sure to introduce the two of us

397
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,120
know know

398
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:07,960
Of course

399
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,800
Come and eat some shrimp

400
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,160
What are you thinking about?

401
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,160
Eat quickly. It's almost cold.

402
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,160
I'll give you another piece of meat

403
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:41,560
dad

404
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,320
Do you know who Gao Zhuo is?

405
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,360
Know

406
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,160
He is Shen Mi

407
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,760
Friends from Thailand

408
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,120
When I found Shen Mi

409
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,480
he has passed away

410
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,880
So Shen Mi goes to Thailand every year

411
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,560
Are they all in memory of him?

412
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,720
So to speak

413
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,079
Because Shen Mi was

414
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,079
while in Thailand

415
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,000
grew up with him

416
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,079
Two people depend on each other for life

417
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,200
The feelings are also very deep

418
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:12,640
Why before that?

419
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,240
Never heard you mention it

420
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:20,680
Everyone has been dead for so many years

421
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,720
Let’s talk about him again

422
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,040
It can only make Shen Mi's heart

423
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,079
It's more sad, isn't it?

424
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,280
Okay, let's eat quickly

425
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,200
Tianlin Hospital

426
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,600
collusion kennel

427
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,880
Sick dogs for sale

428
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,120
You are sneaky

429
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:52,960
What are you looking at?

430
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,040
You are a thief

431
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,280
no

432
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,840
It's so noisy outside now

433
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,200
In and out every day

434
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,200
Sneak through the back door

435
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,320
Like a thief

436
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:01,640
what are we afraid of

437
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,280
We walk and sit upright

438
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,760
I'm not afraid, I'm worried

439
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,080
I'm worried about public opinion

440
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:07,960
By these onlookers

441
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,240
The belt went astray

442
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,720
That's true

443
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,920
Sister Ju’s previous article on public account

444
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,240
After coming out

445
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,840
There is a lot of public opinion in our group

446
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,280
They were all led astray

447
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,360
Several people returned their cards

448
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,520
There are a lot more

449
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,800
You have to wait and see there.

450
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,680
Is there any news from Tian Tian?

451
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,360
What news can they have?

452
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,280
Last night she and Shen Chen

453
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,200
Went to Tintin Kennel

454
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,840
If you want to trick Boss Fei

455
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,360
That guy is cunning and cunning

456
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,200
watertight

457
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,640
I can't put it into words

458
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,280
this old guy

459
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,680
Is there no way to cure him?

460
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,840
What can I do?

461
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,600
Tian Tian and the others are young

462
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,600
Can you beat them?

463
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,680
Gu, where is my sister?

464
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,200
early in the morning

465
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,880
Just go out with Shen Chen

466
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,720
It's all at this point

467
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,280
She is still in the mood to go out

468
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,320
You know a big-headed ghost?

469
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,640
Didn't you think of a way to do it?

470
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:12,800
This is it

471
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:16,560
Sister Ju

472
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,040
Sister Ju

473
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,440
Sister Ju, can you open the door?

474
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,040
We'll explain it to you face to face

475
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,600
If you want to explain, let Shen Mi come.

476
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,200
Ask him to apologize to me

477
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,640
and in all media

478
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,400
Publish his apology letter

479
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:31,920
Mr. Shen

480
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:32,960
Sister Ju, like this

481
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:33,960
that

482
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,400
I am Shen Mi's biological brother

483
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,920
I apologize to you on his behalf

484
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,040
Let's lie to her first

485
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,800
Okay, Sister Ju?

486
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,960
How do you prove that you are his brother?

487
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,800
Look, my name is Shen Chen

488
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,800
My surname is Shen too

489
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:00,520
I can too

490
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,000
Talking to you on behalf of Midorikawa

491
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:03,320
Look

492
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,400
a bunch of liars

493
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,080
There is no Shen Chen in Green River at all

494
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,640
In my opinion

495
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,520
The only way now

496
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,480
It was Shen Mi who came forward to apologize.

497
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,880
You big-headed ghost

498
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,160
If Midorikawa knew about this,

499
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,800
It's because of our hospital

500
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,680
It affects their reputation

501
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,440
you guess

502
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,480
Will he let Shen Mi

503
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,800
divestment

504
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,000
that's really

505
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,520
Forty years of hard work

506
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,120
Once back before liberation

507
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:10,720
Hello

508
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,240
need something

509
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,400
This quality is pretty good

510
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,280
boss

511
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,360
I want this

512
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,560
Sister Ju

513
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,400
we looked for

514
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,120
Boss Fei from Tintin Kennel is here!

515
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,320
He wants to clear up the relationship

516
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,880
So even if I die, I won’t admit it.

517
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,680
Then there is nothing we can do

518
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,920
But you must believe us

519
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:51,800
We really don't have

520
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,920
Behind the scenes

521
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,800
Yes

522
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,120
Just open the door

523
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,000
let us in

524
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,240
we sit down

525
00:21:59,240 --> 00:21:59,920
drink some tea

526
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,800
Can we talk while drinking?

527
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,520
If you do this

528
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,560
Make things so big

529
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,000
You won't get any benefit either

530
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,240
Nothing good for us

531
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,760
You have to make a fuss all over the city.

532
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,400
What are you doing?

533
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,680
Have a better attitude

534
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:10,840
There is drama

535
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:11,640
who

536
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,520
Why are there so many things?

537
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:19,080
This way

538
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,240
I'm not allowed to take the elevator

539
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,360
Fifth floor, big brother

540
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,160
Why are you coming in with me?

541
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,080
Follow you

542
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,040
I'll follow you

543
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,640
I went to the underground garage to pick up the car

544
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,840
Pick up the car

545
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:33,320
What are you doing?

546
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,120
I don't look like someone with a car

547
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:34,920
A motorcycle is not a car

548
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:35,720
Don't

549
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,760
We'll leave immediately after picking up the car

550
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,200
OK

551
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,240
Then I'll believe you once

552
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,160
We'll wait here

553
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,240
If you dare to come back

554
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,760
We'll call the police immediately

555
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,520
You are still waiting here

556
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,880
Don't you work here?

557
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,680
You wait here

558
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,560
I warn you both

559
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,040
come back again

560
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,240
We called the police to arrest him.

561
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:55,200
I tell you

562
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,240
If you hadn't stopped me just now

563
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,680
I have to slap them both

564
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,960
You can just say it with your mouth

565
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,600
It would be nice if he has a strong mouth.

566
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,360
Only six hours left

567
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,440
It's already twelve o'clock

568
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:06,880
What should I do?

569
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,280
So there are six hours left?

570
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,040
There's enough time

571
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,000
There's enough time

572
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:12,120
There is no way to fly.

573
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,440
Then Shen Mi will definitely say

574
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,920
There's time, there's a way

575
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,640
If he has a way

576
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,680
I'll give him

577
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:19,920
four tires

578
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,680
Four wheels ate it

579
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:22,880
The wheel is coming

580
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,720
Why are you still haunted?

581
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,320
Open a small square box every day

582
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,560
The two of us were kicked out by Sister Ju

583
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,720
Six hours left

584
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,160
what to do

585
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,200
six hours left

586
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,240
Isn’t there still time?

587
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,440
Look what I'm saying

588
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,440
He just said

589
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,680
Okay, stop making trouble

590
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,800
What about this article?

591
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,120
It's Sister Ju three years ago

592
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,600
Published on the public account

593
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,360
I searched all night yesterday

594
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,200
Just found it

595
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,080
Then you look at this

596
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,680
This border collie is called Beibei.

597
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:47,360
Boss Fei

598
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,440
The one sold to Sister Ju

599
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,760
Regardless of body shape or color

600
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,080
Basically they are all the same

601
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:51,960
so

602
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,480
Sister Ju took care of the former border collie

603
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,240
all thoughts

604
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,160
Everything is pinned on

605
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,440
On this babe

606
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:57,720
so

607
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,360
Beibei died three years ago

608
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,560
It took her three years

609
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,000
Found a replacement

610
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,760
She doesn't want anything to go wrong with it

611
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,080
So subjectively she

612
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:05,840
Completely masked

613
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,160
Dr. Chen’s reminder

614
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:08,080
this is

615
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,400
confirmation bias

616
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:09,920
That's right

617
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,480
What's the mistake? Isn't this Bian Mu?

618
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:11,960
What should I do?

619
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,200
Just say it directly

620
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,360
The most important task now

621
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,400
We just want to follow this picture

622
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,840
Find an identical babe

623
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,240
That's exactly the same

624
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,680
Ride your motorcycle slowly.

625
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,360
You drive your

626
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,080
Little coffin box, slow down.

627
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:24,880
boss

628
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,840
There's one over there

629
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:27,880
Looks like I have dog plague

630
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:28,680
What to do

631
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,320
What to do

632
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,960
What should I do if I apply medicine?

633
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,280
Do you still need me to teach you about this?

634
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:34,120
Right

635
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,680
Then quickly hang it online

636
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:36,280
Get a discount

637
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,280
Deal with it as soon as possible

638
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,120
good

639
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:38,840
right

640
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,680
Go and lock that door for me

641
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:40,960
good

642
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:41,800
Wait a minute

643
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,200
Come over come over

644
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,280
Let me tell you two

645
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,000
There has been a lot of noise these past two days

646
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,800
Be careful in what you say and do

647
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,960
Don't be like

648
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,240
Like the two people who came yesterday

649
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,360
Let people fool you into telling the truth.

650
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,240
good

651
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:53,960
go

652
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,680
What are you doing? Who are you?

653
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:04,800
This gentleman

654
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,200
Lao Fei

655
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:05,960
Can't enter

656
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:06,920
Hello

657
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:07,280
boss

658
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,080
Boss Fei

659
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,360
Why is the door closed in broad daylight?

660
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,360
What's up Chen Yifan

661
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,160
You're here to trick me too

662
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,160
It depends on what you said

663
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,440
Chen Yifan

664
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:20,880
I tell you

665
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,920
This friendship is friendship

666
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,560
Business is business

667
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,800
What happened to your Tianlin Hospital?

668
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,840
Follow us at Tintin Kennels

669
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:29,120
But it doesn't matter at all

670
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,120
Stop making trouble

671
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:31,560
Who has friendship with you?

672
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,440
There’s no point in recording a sound.

673
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,040
Throw it to the judge

674
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:34,960
The judge didn't recognize it either

675
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,680
real

676
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,760
Then you're not here to trick me.

677
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,240
Then what are you here for?

678
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,640
Okay, go ahead and do whatever you have to do.

679
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,240
I'm here to trick you

680
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:52,760
I'm here to trick you

681
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:53,680
Chen Yifan

682
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,720
what do you mean

683
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,080
What are you doing?

684
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,000
what to do

685
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:57,960
Come with me to see Sister Ju

686
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:58,800
See Sister Ju

687
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,400
Brother Chen Chen

688
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:00,880
Brother Chen Brother Chen

689
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:01,520
you listen to me

690
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,440
Listen to me Listen to me

691
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,880
Why are you meeting Sister Ju?

692
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:04,440
This way

693
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,040
Tell me the number

694
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,400
Can I give you any amount of money?

695
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,400
I don't want money

696
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:07,880
That

697
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,240
What I want is the truth

698
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:09,880
what

699
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,200
What truth is this?

700
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,720
Chen Yifan, who’s here?

701
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,400
black merchant

702
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,560
Let go. Let me go.

703
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,360
loosen

704
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,080
Sir, what dog do you want to buy?

705
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,800
Me I'll take a look

706
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,000
found it

707
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:54,480
Very good

708
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,480
How long will it take for us to get there?

709
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,480
I'm looking at the navigation now

710
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,520
Probably around half past six

711
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,440
What took so long?

712
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:02,720
No way

713
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,920
Traffic jam during rush hours

714
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:04,600
it's common sense

715
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,800
Don’t you even know?

716
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,720
traffic jam

717
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,040
I have a way

718
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,200
Comrade Shen Chen

719
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,280
The organization gives you something

720
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,840
Glorious and arduous task

721
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:17,840
Anyway

722
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:18,960
Must be before eight o'clock

723
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:19,880
Rushed to Sister Ju’s house

724
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:22,000
and stopped her from posting the article

725
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:45,480
Who?

726
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:46,600
Express

727
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,160
Express

728
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,120
I haven't bought anything in the past two days

729
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,200
Are you mistaken?

730
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,160
I don't care about that

731
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,600
I'm only responsible for delivering it

732
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,360
something

733
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,120
Hello your express delivery

734
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:10,840
Zhao Ju, right?

735
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,640
Give it to me

736
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,640
What's going on

737
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:14,600
to you

738
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:16,840
Sister Ju

739
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,160
Why is it still you?

740
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:20,920
it's me

741
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:21,960
You do this again and again

742
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,040
Harassment again and again

743
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,160
No, I don’t want to be with you

744
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,160
Shall we discuss it carefully?

745
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,760
Believe it or not, I’m calling the police now

746
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:27,440
letter

747
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,120
Just wait and discuss it with the police.

748
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,520
Don't call the police. Let's talk it over.

749
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,680
Don't think I don't dare

750
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,200
There's no need to discuss it

751
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,840
There's nothing to discuss with you

752
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:35,640
OK

753
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,640
what are you doing

754
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,600
Give me back my computer

755
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,720
Stop

756
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,040
Give me back my computer

757
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:53,040
Not to pay back

758
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:53,840
Give me back my computer

759
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,320
Give it back to me

760
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,320
I read

761
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,560
You really don’t want to live anymore

762
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,440
Sister Ju

763
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:00,840
you can

764
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,960
Can't call, grab my computer

765
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,120
Can't call, grab my computer

766
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:06,360
Sister Ju

767
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,480
little bastard

768
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,240
Give me back

769
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,120
Give me back

770
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,000
No, no, no

771
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:10,400
Give me back

772
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,320
Stop grabbing it, Sister Ju

773
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,240
Not you. Give it to you. Give it to you.

774
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,920
Let go, let go

775
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,360
Just stop grabbing it

776
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,440
Sister Ju, just ten minutes

777
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,320
What ten minutes?

778
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,240
Just ten minutes

779
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:32,760
Beibei

780
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:42,880
Beibei

781
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,400
Beibei

782
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,720
Beibei

783
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,520
Really my babe

784
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,560
Mom misses you so much

785
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,280
Miss you so much

786
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,480
Mom misses you so much

787
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,960
mommy's baby

788
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,960
Where have you been all these years?

789
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,320
Beibei

790
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,560
computer

791
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,760
Please return it to Sister Ju quickly

792
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,680
Come early, brother

793
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,120
later

794
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,560
I'm so cold

795
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:13,160
Time is too hasty

796
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,280
Waiting for mom to get paid

797
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,720
I'll give you a new nest

798
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,640
Look who is that

799
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:19,840
Who is that?

800
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,720
It's also Beibei

801
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,600
Originally last month

802
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,920
I should buy it for you

803
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,440
I had just arrived in Fucheng at that time

804
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,320
one for me

805
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,760
A very strange city

806
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,640
I don't have any friends

807
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,120
I still remember

808
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,720
The first house I rented

809
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,040
It's a place far away from work

810
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:47,720
every day

811
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,840
I am my home unit

812
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,720
unit home

813
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,240
Two points and one line

814
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,440
I was very confused at that time

815
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,520
I even think

816
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,880
Life has no direction

817
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,440
Until I had Beibei

818
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,120
After I had Beibei

819
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,680
I think my life

820
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,280
My whole life is different.

821
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,640
Why are you so handsome?

822
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,640
Mommy started a business

823
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,760
I knew you would support me

824
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,040
Come and kiss me

825
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:28,440
I remember

826
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:31,200
The day after this video was shot

827
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,840
I resigned bravely

828
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,680
Become a self-media person

829
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:39,960
It's Beibei who accompanies me

830
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,960
Passed through those not understood by others

831
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,960
Ridicule the confused days

832
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:45,760
How is it

833
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,160
Give me an affirmative look

834
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,600
I knew you would support me

835
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,960
What's going on with you?

836
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,200
Have you been caught?

837
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:05,440
Miss Zhao

838
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,560
We have everything done

839
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,679
Thank you so much

840
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:09,800
Okay, let's go first then

841
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:10,520
OK

842
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,159
I'll trouble you next time

843
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:12,840
OK

844
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,040
Do you like our new home?

845
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:23,880
Beibei, it’s time to eat

846
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,600
Beibei

847
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,480
What's the matter

848
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:34,760
Thank you

849
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,719
I walked through me

850
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:57,480
Sentimental youth

851
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,240
sweet love

852
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,920
failed marriage

853
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,200
And my warm family

854
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,200
Since I was nineteen

855
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,400
to thirty-four

856
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,520
A full fifteen years

857
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,440
More than five thousand days and nights

858
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,200
It's Beibei who accompanies me

859
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,200
support me

860
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:38,880
Thank you

861
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,480
I really want to thank you

862
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:46,840
Helped me find Beibei again

863
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,320
Sister Ju

864
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,480
Then you won’t publish your article, right?

865
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,200
I will definitely not post it

866
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,240
Sister Ju

867
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:05,520
Then can you

868
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,720
Write us another clarification article

869
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:10,040
Just explain what happened before

870
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,720
Because of the previous article

871
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:12,760
to our hospital

872
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,560
Indeed, the impact is quite large.

873
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:16,640
Excuse me

874
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,680
Yes, I am Unit 4, 502

875
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,120
what

876
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,640
Two men tied together

877
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,560
Find me

878
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,520
Doctor Chen, I'm here now

879
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:37,560
Please let me go

880
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,640
Shut up and wait.

881
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,080
Look at this shame

882
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,000
Come, come, aren't you embarrassed?

883
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,280
Do you still feel embarrassed?

884
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,040
you feel ashamed

885
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:46,600
sister chrysanthemum sister chrysanthemum

886
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,920
Doctor Chen

887
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,000
Lao Chen, what's going on?

888
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,240
how how

889
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:51,800
Excuse me

890
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:52,720
this is my friend

891
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:53,840
My friend is here

892
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:54,640
OK

893
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:55,440
say

894
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:57,680
Say it

895
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:58,920
say

896
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,280
Sister Ju

897
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,000
I'm here to apologize to you

898
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,320
When the dog comes out of the den

899
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,360
Really sick

900
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,080
Me too because

901
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,240
Momentary obsession with money

902
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,200
I won’t dare next time

903
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,600
You have a lot

904
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,200
What's wrong with you?

905
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:09,920
Just come to me alone

906
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:10,520
Ok

907
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,080
i was wrong

908
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:12,960
Go on

909
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,760
Dr. Chen’s high integrity and integrity

910
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,040
Breeze on both sleeves, doctor’s kindness

911
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,600
Rescue the dying, heal the wounded, bring the dead back to life

912
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:19,560
speak human language

913
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:20,920
yes

914
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:23,520
Sister Ju

915
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,400
Doctor Chen

916
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:27,400
You really didn't mess with me

917
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:28,560
When I gave him a gift

918
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,160
he does

919
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:31,040
Rejected me righteously

920
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:31,720
this matter

921
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:32,720
Indeed, Dr. Chen

922
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:33,920
It doesn't matter at all

923
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,640
Doctor Chen, it's a misunderstanding

924
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,400
you forgive me

925
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,280
misunderstanding

926
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:49,880
Sister Ju

927
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:50,760
because of you

928
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,320
It caused losses to our Tianlin

929
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,320
How to make up for it

930
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,120
I don't accept your apology

931
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,400
accept it

932
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,320
Lao Chen, please stop saying a few words.

933
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:06,280
OK

934
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,360
As an adult, I don’t care about the faults of villains.

935
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:09,640
Lao Chen

936
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,560
I just want to know about you

937
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:12,560
Wound a thousand enemies

938
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,360
This trick will cost you eight hundred dollars

939
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,720
How did you come up with it?

940
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,360
obedient

941
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,360
I

942
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,640
There are so many tricks

943
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:20,800
Do you care?

944
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,120
Brother Chen

945
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,640
What about me?

946
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:27,080
can you

947
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:27,960
Untie it for me

948
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:28,880
How to solve it?

949
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,160
Solved with key

950
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:31,920
What's the meaning

951
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:32,720
Didn't you say I'm coming?

952
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:33,400
As long as I tell the truth

953
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,520
Just untie it for me?

954
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:35,800
I threw away my key

955
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:36,480
Throw

956
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,000
Throw it where? Throw it away

957
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:38,760
Throw your kennel away

958
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,520
Throw my dog

959
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,080
Then what should we do?

960
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,200
No, you can't be tied up for life.

961
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,160
This, you

962
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,600
the

963
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:46,280
the

964
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,200
Although this matter

965
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,400
Already solved

966
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,360
But what about Tian Lin?

967
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,920
There is still a huge negative impact

968
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,080
But it's okay

969
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,080
Sister Ju has agreed

970
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:04,640
Write us a clarification

971
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:06,880
This matter about Sister Ju

972
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,080
Is there any inspiration for you?

973
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:11,560
have

974
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,320
Talk about it

975
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,680
First of all, what about me?

976
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:15,560
through this matter

977
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:16,720
Saw our Tian Lin

978
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,640
All colleagues are united as never before

979
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,440
Working together to the outside world

980
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:22,200
Solving crises together

981
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,440
Especially that old Chen

982
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,160
He used his wisdom and tenacity

983
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:25,800
what problem

984
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:26,640
stop stop stop

985
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,840
That's not what I'm talking about

986
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:29,280
what i said is

987
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,280
in this process

988
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,960
Did you find any problems?

989
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,880
what problem

990
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,200
Once the group is leaderless,

991
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,080
they face

992
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,800
Emergency handling capabilities

993
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:41,000
And the reaction speed is not enough

994
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:42,640
That is to say, many things

995
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:43,880
at the first time

996
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:44,560
could have put it

997
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,640
Deal with it cleanly

998
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:46,680
without any consequences

999
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:47,720
but

1000
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,200
they always miss

1001
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,120
best time

1002
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:52,480
so

1003
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,240
we have to need

1004
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:54,680
You dragon head

1005
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,640
Right Carlo

1006
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,320
But I have no choice

1007
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,640
Always grow with you

1008
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,160
What's up

1009
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,680
I just heard what you said just now

1010
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:21,280
suddenly felt

1011
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:23,720
a little sad

1012
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:26,760
I also thought of Sister Ju and Beibei

1013
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,520
And me and Zai Zai

1014
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,400
Zai Zai, do you still remember?

1015
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,000
your first pet

1016
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,200
Cats and dogs only live a dozen years

1017
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,120
I won’t stay with you forever

1018
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,000
Their lives are so short

1019
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:48,520
so bring us

1020
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:49,720
happy at the same time

1021
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,040
How great is this happiness

1022
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,160
when leaving

1023
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:58,240
How much sadness it leaves people

1024
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:06,160
Your father too

1025
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:08,960
My grandpa too

1026
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:11,880
They initially chose

1027
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,120
In the pet medical industry

1028
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,240
That's probably what I think

1029
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:18,320
Use your best efforts

1030
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,000
To protect the happiness of others

1031
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,520
Make every day better
