00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,200
Dear friends

2
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,240
Small world, isn't it

3
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,720
Let's talk about it today

4
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,040
People are getting old

5
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,440
You have to eat more coarse grains

6
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,680
Let's take a look, let's take a look

7
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,920
This corn and sweet potatoes

8
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,400
I planted them all with my own hands

9
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,800
Organic food

10
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,480
Particularly healthy

11
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,039
So here

12
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,080
I suggest my old friends

13
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,680
Eat more coarse grains

14
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,000
Grandpa, you will broadcast live

15
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,120
How trendy

16
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,160
Is there

17
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:22,800
Grandpa

18
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,880
How can I eat it

19
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,000
The melons and fruits you planted with your own hands

20
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,800
Want to eat the fruit planted by Grandpa himself

21
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,800
It had to be his grandson's daughter-in-law

22
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,160
What about grandchildren? He has two

23
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,800
Lack of a grandson's wife

24
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,320
I'll be a minute

25
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,400
Just put this contact information

26
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,240
Paste below

27
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,560
After a while, I want to be a grandson's wife

28
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,720
Just come and sign up directly

29
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,840
You look at it, you look at it

30
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,640
You said you and I broadcast well

31
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,960
What kind of mess are you adding

32
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,720
I want my daughter-in-law without adding chaos

33
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,000
Look at your promise

34
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,640
Fans who just watched my live broadcast

35
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,480
There are more than 10,000

36
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:54,880
Your nonsense

37
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,720
There are seven thousand left

38
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,920
You are the grandson of a pit master

39
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,560
Nothing

40
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,520
Grandpa, if you like it

41
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,840
I'll buy you some zombie powder

42
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,080
I don't want zombie fans

43
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:06,720
I am Shen Rongxian

44
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,040
Honesty is the foundation all one's life

45
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,840
You boy, you are young

46
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,760
Just resort to deceit

47
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,640
Can't hit Grandpa

48
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,680
Grandpa, have some tea. Have some tea

49
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,440
This boy pisses me off

50
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,360
Hit him

51
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,120
The eldest grandson is back

52
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,120
Shen Mi is back

53
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:25,920
Grandpa

54
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,840
Carlo

55
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,440
Did you go for a beauty treatment today

56
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,840
Why are you so beautiful

57
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,200
Next

58
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,040
Let's go

59
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,680
We went to Grandpa

60
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,400
Carlo Carlo

61
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,160
Come back, come back

62
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,600
He went to play chess

63
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,240
Let's go cook

64
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,000
General

65
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,280
Branch

66
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:51,960
Dead chess

67
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:55,080
Will go this way and be eaten by the car

68
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,240
Study what you study

69
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:57,920
Don't play

70
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,080
Why are you so old

71
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,080
You play Lai, you

72
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,880
All right, I'll be honest with you

73
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,200
Although it is said that

74
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,760
On Company Management

75
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,240
You are really good

76
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,320
But what about playing chess

77
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,480
You're not as good as me

78
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,400
I play small

79
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,560
Just play chess with grandpa

80
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,120
What about that time

81
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,640
You're still young

82
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,840
I like to listen to your bragging quietly

83
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,320
Mi always found out

84
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,720
This Tianlin Animal Hospital

85
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,000
The legal person is Tian Dongqing

86
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,280
He is also the director of the hospital

87
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,080
I was hospitalized for a stroke recently

88
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,800
Hu Changde, an investor in the hospital

89
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,200
On the grounds of Tian Dongqing's breach of contract

90
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,200
Prepare for divestment

91
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,680
And froze the hospital's

92
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,440
Corporate account number

93
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,040
Are you still listening, Mr. Mi

94
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,000
I see

95
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,480
Men and women

96
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:45,680
One more game

97
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,320
Come on, okay

98
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,440
You can't play for nothing

99
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,440
You have to bet a little

100
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,040
You said

101
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,000
I would like to get a new motorcycle

102
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,680
I'll change your motorcycle

103
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,880
Do what you like in the future

104
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,680
Don't care about you, okay

105
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,080
Do you mean what you say? Do you mean what you say

106
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,200
I'll listen to you after I lose

107
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,520
You said it

108
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,120
Come on, come on, come on

109
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:16,880
Dad

110
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,960
The old tree tea brought to you by the trustee

111
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:20,840
You try it

112
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,760
You come over today

113
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,400
Is to talk to me

114
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,080
About Shen Mi

115
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,840
About becoming the president of the group

116
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,320
Although I am not in the front line,

117
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:38,000
But the big and small things of the group

118
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,360
You can't hide it from me

119
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,640
You think

120
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,720
The farce at yesterday's event

121
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,120
I don't know who did it

122
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,800
And there is today's meeting

123
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,800
You let the boy named Zhao

124
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,800
Like a buffoon

125
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,040
Make a scene

126
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,720
Young is not naive

127
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,120
Dad

128
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,720
I did use some methods

129
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,800
Tested Shen Mi

130
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:19,840
But

131
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:20,760
But it's not all

132
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,800
My personal meaning

133
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,640
You tell me to listen

134
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,680
Look at the animal hospital you worked in that year

135
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,920
That's from the first line

136
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,360
It started little by little

137
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,760
What about me and my brother

138
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,880
I am also following you

139
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:36,680
Put the company

140
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,240
It started from scratch

141
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,480
Now the company has such a big plate

142
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,920
So many shareholders are real money and silver

143
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,640
Cast in

144
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,520
That's trust in us

145
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,400
I don't think many shareholders

146
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,280
Can you trust a little boy

147
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,080
Can you take the group well

148
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,640
I see what you mean

149
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,520
I will

150
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,240
You're useless anywhere

151
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,920
You have no choice but to throw in the towel

152
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:08,920
I haven't lost yet

153
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,800
I've come out

154
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,680
Pull the car and you lose

155
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,160
Do you think I lost

156
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,120
That's not it

157
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:19,720
It is impossible

158
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,280
I have one last step

159
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,040
Which step

160
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,160
Don't play

161
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:25,960
Play Lai

162
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:27,720
Depend on

163
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,560
Anyway

164
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,440
I'll tell you this game of chess

165
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,520
How about you two

166
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,440
How was the result

167
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:33,720
I won

168
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,320
You lose

169
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:35,960
It is impossible

170
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:36,680
I didn't lose

171
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,600
It's almost cheating

172
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,240
Dinner is ready. Let's go to dinner

173
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,880
All right, we'll go down when we're done talking

174
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,120
Okay, don't keep grandpa waiting

175
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:43,680
You go first

176
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,600
What about this game of chess

177
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,120
You have to recognize it or not

178
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,360
So

179
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,680
Starting tomorrow

180
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,600
You are looking for a formal job

181
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,760
Wage plus five insurances and one gold

182
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:58,920
And then what

183
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,520
Calculated from the day you joined the company

184
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,600
Can't you just

185
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,000
Use another Alipay

186
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,080
With the money in WeChat

187
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,360
You can't move your bank card either

188
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,280
You can't tell your family either

189
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,000
Borrow a penny

190
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,840
Especially your ones

191
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:09,440
Friends of foxes and dogs

192
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,280
Of course, you have good conditions and high vision

193
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,600
Many companies can't get into your eyes

194
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,320
Don't mention it

195
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,280
The treatment in our group

196
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,680
You can stop both welfare and welfare

197
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,520
Group ah

198
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,880
I'm sure I won't go

199
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,880
What am I doing in Lvchuan

200
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,160
Sandwiched between you and my dad

201
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,360
Subjected to plywood gas

202
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,360
I'm not going

203
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,400
Remember

204
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:26,560
One month

205
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,320
Dude, the first game let you

206
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,960
You are still too young to play chess

207
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,120
Study hard

208
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,159
OK, you set me up

209
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:38,679
Childish

210
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:39,760
You wait a minute

211
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,000
You set me up

212
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,240
It means you can't beat me at all

213
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,720
What about the dishes on the table tonight

214
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,040
It's all me

215
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,040
I planted it myself and picked it myself

216
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,800
I'm about to taste it

217
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,520
Come and eat, eat

218
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,520
Eat, eat, eat

219
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,400
Eat it

220
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:07,720
Shen Mi

221
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,240
Does your head still hurt

222
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,480
Have you done it

223
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,240
Computed tomography

224
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,520
Check it out

225
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,120
I'm fine, Grandpa. Don't worry

226
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,040
It's good to be okay

227
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,560
Your body

228
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,800
Grandpa is most worried about

229
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,160
Dad

230
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,840
Doctor Zhou told me

231
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,200
Shen Mi this heart

232
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,680
It takes twenty-four hours

233
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,880
A close-fitting nurse

234
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,280
I'll find him one tomorrow

235
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,640
That's a good suggestion

236
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,720
It's really long overdue

237
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:34,720
Do it tomorrow

238
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:36,560
Grandpa

239
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,120
Leave this matter to me

240
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:39,960
I know a man

241
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,600
Cardiology experts are especially famous

242
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,480
Take it back to Shen Mi

243
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:45,960
Yes

244
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,680
Mengnan has always been safe in doing things

245
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:55,920
Dad

246
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,440
Didn't you just say

247
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,480
Do you have anything to announce

248
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,600
You're in such a hurry

249
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,160
Or

250
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,480
You make the announcement

251
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,440
Why am I in such a hurry

252
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,400
OK, I'll speak for you

253
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,320
Shen Mi

254
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,360
Tomorrow

255
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,840
You, the vice president, stopped

256
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,200
Your grandfather ordered it

257
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,040
Shen Mi

258
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,880
I'm going to let you down the line

259
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,640
Experience and experience

260
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:32,920
Find a family

261
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,040
Poor business conditions

262
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:35,920
Pet hospital

263
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:37,760
For a period of one year

264
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,280
Put its

265
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,280
Word-of-mouth performance goes up

266
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,080
Can you do it

267
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:43,960
Can be done

268
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,120
What if you do well

269
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,640
Position of Group President

270
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:49,960
It's yours

271
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,120
If it fails

272
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,000
You're going to talk to your uncle

273
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,000
Competition for posts

274
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,360
As for your vacant position

275
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,320
Your uncle works part-time

276
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:01,960
Do you have a problem

277
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,160
No problem

278
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,120
I know a lot about pet hospitals

279
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,160
Let me introduce you to one

280
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,080
This

281
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,120
Don't bother, uncle.

282
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,640
I happen to know

283
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,480
There is a hospital

284
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,600
Is in a state of dying

285
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,400
I think this hospital

286
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,560
Especially, especially suitable

287
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,720
This test

288
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,200
You don't have to worry about it

289
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,360
Try my vegetables

290
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,360
Come

291
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,720
Eat more vegetables and eat more vegetables

292
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,160
Eat more

293
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:43,960
Everybody calm down

294
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,080
Say it one by one

295
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,160
Row

296
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,120
I've just been killed by you

297
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,160
Fool and charge the value

298
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,600
Now you're closing up

299
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,120
Isn't it obvious to cheat money

300
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,240
Isn't it

301
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:52,960
Right

302
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,400
You can't run away with money

303
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,120
I just want to roll up money and run away

304
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,280
Everyone misunderstood

305
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,600
Where did you hear that

306
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,560
We're not closing

307
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,520
I can't run away.

308
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,280
Cut the crap

309
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:01,960
I want it now

310
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,960
Pick up our Feier and go

311
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:03,760
It's not treated by you anymore

312
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:04,440
Give me my money back

313
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:04,720
No, no, no

314
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,040
Ladies can refund money

315
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,160
But Feier just got out of surgery

316
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,680
It's dangerous to take it back now

317
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,400
What's the matter

318
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,760
You still want to keep our dog

319
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,440
Don't give it, do you

320
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:12,760
Get out of the way is not

321
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,080
All right

322
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:27,800
OK

323
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,000
Excuse me

324
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:29,360
Nothing

325
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,160
Su Qiang

326
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,840
I'm giving you trouble

327
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,680
Our Dabao tofu flower

328
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,720
Thank you. Excuse me

329
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:10,320
All right

330
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,360
I'm really sorry

331
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,040
Feier

332
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,120
When Feier's operation is over,

333
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,040
I'll inform you as soon as possible

334
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:18,640
Pick it up

335
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,840
Well, thank you for taking the trouble

336
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,920
Thank you so much for today

337
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:28,640
I'll check it out

338
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,960
How much will be returned to you

339
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,200
You won't have to pay back the money

340
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:33,960
You saved Carlo

341
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,560
We're even

342
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,000
These are two different things

343
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,560
I didn't save Carlo for money

344
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,280
This money is too much today

345
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,160
I can't stand it either

346
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:49,920
This is

347
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,440
I thought you wanted to pay back the money

348
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,080
You pay back the money without a cell phone

349
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,800
Why are you still holding it

350
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:55,800
This

351
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,680
Hospitals are now hard to protect themselves

352
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,560
See for yourself

353
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,600
I happen to have a plan

354
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,120
Can help your hospital

355
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,040
If you're interested

356
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:15,840
Call me

357
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,760
This grain, this texture

358
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,680
This luxurious white

359
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,840
This rich man's thing

360
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,800
Sure enough, it's just different

361
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,040
This man is really

362
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,360
It's just a broken piece of paper

363
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,080
As for

364
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,320
Why is this a piece of paper

365
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:45,520
This is us

366
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,520
A sword that overcomes difficulties and thorns

367
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,880
It is we who open the door to wealth

368
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,560
Password key Comrade Tian Tian

369
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,400
Keys What keys

370
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,160
Tian Peilan

371
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,040
Stop looking and call quickly

372
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:02,840
What are you waiting for

373
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,080
There are some things I haven't figured out yet

374
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,040
Green Chuan

375
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,400
Such a large group

376
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,560
Why invest

377
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,320
Our family

378
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,800
Little pet hospital

379
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,000
There is fraud here

380
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,120
As far as his investment plan is concerned

381
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,080
Definitely not simple

382
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,800
What if

383
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:24,360
In case someone else finds it

384
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,480
That's because I have a crush on you

385
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,080
I knew you

386
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,160
Can't say anything nice

387
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,200
I don't want to get caught up in this

388
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,080
Profit-seeking profiteers are attracted to it

389
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,200
Look at how you open your mouth

390
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,960
Shut up is a profiteer

391
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:35,760
Comrade Tian Tian

392
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,600
You must correct your attitude first

393
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,520
Running a business in pursuit of profit

394
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,520
Is he wrong

395
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,800
He is not wrong

396
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,640
So kind-hearted

397
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,080
A boss who is also an atmosphere

398
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,360
How can you tell

399
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,600
He's a profiteer

400
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,080
Are you left eye or right eye

401
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,480
I can see that he is a profiteer

402
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,760
Two eyes

403
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,440
It's not you

404
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:56,880
Are you

405
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,000
What did you get from him

406
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,360
Why do you keep saying good things to him

407
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,640
Really

408
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:06,840
Tian Tian

409
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,240
Let's now

410
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,800
What time is it

411
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,960
What about our present Tianlin

412
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:12,920
It's like a

413
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,280
People who can't swim

414
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,600
It plopped and

415
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,720
Fell into the water

416
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,680
This water

417
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:18,560
This is rambling

418
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,240
It's almost over the tip of the nose

419
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,240
Suddenly there is a pair of hands

420
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,120
Reach out to save you

421
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,480
Just grab it quickly

422
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,680
You don't care if he is a good man

423
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,720
Or bad hands

424
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,840
It matters whether you save your life or not

425
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:28,920
Besides

426
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,560
If someone else is a bad person,

427
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,000
Why should he save you

428
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,080
What are you doing

429
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:40,160
You are kind-hearted and stupid

430
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,560
Who are you talking about

431
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:42,960
No

432
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,200
Think about it, you

433
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,440
Breaking my heart hurts my brain

434
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,520
You go, go, go

435
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,079
Party A has the right to refuse

436
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:16,640
Not in conformity with the provisions of the contract

437
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,400
Poor storage and maintenance

438
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,760
Result in quality under quality

439
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:25,720
What's the matter

440
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:26,960
This is the legal department

441
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,000
A contract that has just been reviewed

442
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:28,880
Just sign it

443
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,320
Okay, I see

444
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,520
It's almost noon

445
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:34,760
Have dinner together

446
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,840
I still have too many contracts to sign here

447
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,000
Why don't you go first

448
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:41,480
That's right

449
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,640
About your personal physician

450
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,360
I have several suitable candidates

451
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,680
I'll arrange for you to meet later

452
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,840
Actually, this matter doesn't need to be done

453
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,520
Don't worry too much

454
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,800
You, you can choose slowly

455
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:54,720
Seek

456
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,120
Someone

457
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,000
You

458
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,400
Why are you here every day

459
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,880
I'm at work

460
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:03,840
Go to work

461
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,040
Do you like my brother

462
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,760
Don't talk nonsense

463
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:11,600
What's the trouble

464
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,840
Are you here to work for the company

465
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,440
I missed you and came to see you

466
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,000
It is impossible to go to work

467
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,960
We still have an appointment

468
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:20,600
Don't you forget

469
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,920
You don't have much time then

470
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:22,560
Brother

471
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,080
I'm young

472
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,520
There is still a lot of time

473
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:28,520
Have a candy

474
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,640
You put it away for half a year

475
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,400
Your pet hospital

476
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,200
How's it going

477
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:38,760
Now

478
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,640
I'm Tian Tian

479
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,600
I thought you said in the morning

480
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,280
Help me solve it

481
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,480
The problem of farmland forest management

482
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,480
Is it still working

483
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:49,640
Tonight

484
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,360
At eight o'clock this evening

485
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,000
Let's meet

486
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,120
I'll send you a location

487
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,920
Be there or be square goodbye

488
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,320
Who is it

489
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,280
One colleague

490
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,040
From the opposite company

491
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:07,680
Eight o'clock

492
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:08,640
Talk about contracts

493
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,680
Contract

494
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:11,800
Woman, right

495
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,480
Let's go colleague

496
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,520
At eight o'clock in the evening

497
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:19,960
Brother

498
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,120
That

499
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,400
Meng Nan hasn't eaten yet

500
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,160
Or

501
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,560
My kidney hurts

502
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,000
The girl on the phone just now

503
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,920
My relationship with my brother must be unusual

504
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,520
You see that look on his face

505
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,560
Come on, I'm kidding you

506
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,120
Who is my brother

507
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,240
It's not like you don't understand

508
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,120
Anisotropic insulator

509
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,040
Raise it a little

510
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,520
Don't pout. How can I draw?

511
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,480
Just be normal, okay, sister

512
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,400
How long is it going to be

513
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,720
My neck is sore

514
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,440
With the volume of Lvchuan,

515
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,000
I can't give it to you

516
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,840
Do you have a good job

517
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:39,720
Right

518
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,240
Go back, you little shrimp

519
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,640
Was by others

520
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,160
I ate it in one bite

521
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,320
It's so scary

522
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,160
You finish like this

523
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,120
I can't even go

524
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,000
What about your momentum

525
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:52,760
What is it

526
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,480
Take back your strength and look up

527
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,120
You know

528
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,120
What is the most important thing in negotiation

529
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:00,800
Don't move

530
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,760
It's momentum

531
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:09,680
What about us? If we lose, we won't lose

532
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,920
On this momentum,

533
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,120
Will overwhelm them

534
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,880
I just haven't painted for a long time

535
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,440
Hands are a little born to see

536
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,080
Why is it so gorgeous

537
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,760
Why am I painting like this

538
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,040
Falling fish and wild geese

539
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,760
You believe your aunt

540
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,240
I have been in love for many years

541
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,440
There's nothing I don't know

542
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,880
Come on, come on, see

543
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:37,360
Battle suit

544
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,000
And

545
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,120
War

546
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:42,920
Boots

547
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:45,960
My Imperial Sword

548
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,400
It's all ready for you

549
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,680
Today, I'll see you put Shen Mi in one fell swoop

550
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:50,680
Take down

551
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,000
Aunt aunt

552
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,240
Can your mind

553
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,120
Be simple

554
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,720
Look at your words

555
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,840
And take him down

556
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,440
I went to talk about cooperation with him

557
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,520
What are you thinking

558
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,320
Let you go to his place at eight o'clock in the evening

559
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,920
Then we'll have dinner

560
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:09,080
Look back at the little candle a little

561
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,440
As soon as the little music is played,

562
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,160
Small emotional appeal together

563
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,080
When you wear a miniskirt,

564
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,040
Long legs are exposed

565
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,240
You're disgusting. I don't want it

566
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,360
How beautiful it is

567
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,200
Look how beautiful it is

568
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,760
This little waist and this calf are exposed

569
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,080
I'm not even willing to wear it myself

570
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,160
It's new. I'll wear it for you

571
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,040
My God, aunt

572
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,280
Really, when you were young

573
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,280
Dress so brightly

574
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,720
Am I not young now

575
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,040
No wonder you never got married

576
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,280
I was wrong

577
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:02,880
Send red wine

578
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,440
It won't be too grand

579
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,760
It seems that you have taste again

580
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,400
Once the negotiation is successful,

581
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,640
Then celebrate with the wine we sent

582
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,760
That feeling

583
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:11,960
That atmosphere, that face

584
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,720
Didn't you just get it all back at once

585
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:19,520
All right

586
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,640
Why are you dressed like this

587
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,200
What happened to me dressed like this

588
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,160
What about me in private

589
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,360
Just wear it like this

590
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:45,800
Come on in

591
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,600
Tian Peilan

592
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,280
Your home is quite beautiful

593
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,120
Come for the first time

594
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,280
You can't be empty-handed

595
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:02,560
What about this one

596
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,840
Think of it as a meeting ceremony

597
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,200
This wine tastes good

598
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:08,680
I don't drink

599
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,240
Feel free to sit down

600
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,400
I forgot

601
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,720
He has a heart attack

602
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,880
Let Tian Peilan be right

603
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,320
You really came to invite me to dinner

604
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,440
You don't have to bother

605
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,320
I'm not very hungry

606
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,760
This is for Carlo

607
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,280
It's not for you

608
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:38,720
That

609
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,160
I prepared for nothing

610
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:43,880
What do you mean

611
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,120
I brought this

612
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:50,240
It

613
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,160
Why doesn't it eat mine?

614
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,720
Are you sure, Carlo

615
00:24:58,920 --> 00:24:59,960
Other people's meals are so delicious

616
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,720
Is Carlo delicious

617
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:06,800
I love it so much

618
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,160
You see, right

619
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:10,920
It smells so good

620
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:13,240
Carlo, can you have some ambition

621
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,040
What a loser

622
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,800
Eat and sign a contract to drink

623
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,400
Embrace each other deeply

624
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,920
Where have we come from

625
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,320
Really

626
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,320
What's the matter

627
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,000
Nothing

628
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,320
I just want to say

629
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,760
This decoration layout of your home

630
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:15,600
It's really quite

631
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,360
It's quite simple

632
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,400
I don't like complicated things

633
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,360
Carlo

634
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,040
Do you think

635
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:31,920
I'm here alone

636
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:32,760
It's so boring

637
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,640
Come and stay with me

638
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:35,600
You brought it for your sister

639
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,640
What good stuff

640
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:37,640
Is it a new toy

641
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,920
Come and I'll play with you

642
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,600
It's stuck

643
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,440
I thought you wanted me to play with you

644
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,120
Give it to me

645
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,080
Give it to me

646
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,520
Don't think too much

647
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,160
It doesn't want you to play with it

648
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,480
It's just trying to show off

649
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,520
It's just a toy in his mouth

650
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,920
It's really your dog

651
00:26:58,760 --> 00:26:59,280
Carlo

652
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:02,520
All right

653
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,240
Take a look at this

654
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,040
Tin Lam Animal Hospital

655
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,720
Investment plan book

656
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,200
Why do you want

657
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,120
Invest in Tianlin

658
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,000
Actually

659
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,520
I can invest in a lot of hospitals

660
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,280
It just happens that your hospital

661
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,560
There has been a serious

662
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:32,840
Financial crisis

663
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:34,600
So you can help me

664
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:35,840
Save a lot of time

665
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,480
I will buy Hu Zong's hands

666
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,520
All shares

667
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,000
And buy holly

668
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,680
Twenty percent of the equity in one's hand

669
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,560
To say so

670
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,120
After you inject capital,

671
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,560
We make up 30%

672
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,160
You make up 70%

673
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,840
And I want to be the dean of Tianlin

674
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,840
Grasp absolute control

675
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,560
There is also the right to make business decisions

676
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,000
But if there is no decision-making power,

677
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,680
What did Tianlin become after that

678
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,160
You are the one who has the final say

679
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,080
In theory, it's like this

680
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:04,920
But

681
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,920
On Management, Decision-making and Management

682
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,160
Are you more professional than me

683
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,440
Do you know what you call this

684
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,680
You call this fishing in troubled waters

685
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:15,760
I also want Tian Lin

686
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,120
Become a tool for you to make money

687
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:17,720
No way

688
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,360
As a business

689
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:20,920
It was meant to be

690
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,480
Profit maximization

691
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,520
You run a pet hospital

692
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:25,640
Don't

693
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,520
Is it just a cover for charity

694
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,360
That's better than you

695
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:29,640
Under the banner of charity

696
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,320
Earn black money without conscience

697
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,400
Everything is needed

698
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,280
Paying the price

699
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:37,320
For you now

700
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,440
The state of the hospital

701
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,680
You have no choice

702
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,640
Of course I have a choice

703
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,600
I choose not to accept

704
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:45,960
Tian Lin is my father

705
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,200
Most of my life's hard work

706
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,400
I can't sell it to you

707
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,240
Suit yourself

708
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:51,760
Don't mention it

709
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:53,800
If I don't take over,

710
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,360
Tian Lin will become someone else's

711
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,720
All roads are made by people

712
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,320
I'll put my words here today

713
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,000
I don't need your help

714
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,360
Second, I don't need your charity

715
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,800
I Tian Tian will never do this for you

716
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,000
Five buckets of rice bent

717
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:08,760
See you later

718
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:16,920
Never see again

719
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,720
Is that what Xiao Hu is doing

720
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,160
I can't be the master either

721
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:51,120
Why don't you wait for Tian Tian to come back

722
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:51,920
Let's talk about it again

723
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,400
She doesn't show up all day long

724
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,400
When shall we wait

725
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,880
She's not in front

726
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,240
Hard work

727
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:01,760
In fact, you are like this

728
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,920
Pay from the bottom

729
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,120
It's not so good, is it

730
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,240
Is

731
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:07,640
Now the final result

732
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,680
It hasn't come out yet

733
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,560
You do this

734
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,640
Isn't it too impersonal

735
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,400
Knowing that this ship is going to sink

736
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,920
What else to put in here

737
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,800
Help each other in the same boat and live and die together

738
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:22,040
This is not an application either

739
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,440
This is the notice

740
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,240
Let me have a look

741
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,920
Dr Chan Chan

742
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,240
I've already found a home over there

743
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,640
Do you want to go with me

744
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,520
Good luck to you

745
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:42,760
Easy to go or not to send

746
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,800
We can't help it either. This

747
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:52,920
Walk, walk, walk

748
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,280
Tian Jie

749
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,520
I'm sorry

750
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,120
The situation now is that

751
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,320
I rejected Shen Mi

752
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:20,920
The bank turned me down

753
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,040
I've been to so many banks

754
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,280
Made a quick phone call

755
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,440
None of them

756
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,000
Can help us solve the money problem

757
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:35,720
Aunt, as our hospital

758
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,280
Most enthusiastic

759
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,560
The most intelligent and intelligent

760
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,200
Excellent employees with the most connections

761
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:43,080
Do something for us

762
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:44,600
Methods

763
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,680
There is

764
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,120
It depends on whether you want it or not

765
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,280
I will

766
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,760
Restart negotiations with Shen Mi

767
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,360
Accept all his demands

768
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,080
No

769
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,040
Anything

770
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,360
There is a price to pay

771
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,400
For you now

772
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,320
The state of the hospital

773
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:06,560
You have no choice

774
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,560
All roads are made by people

775
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,160
I'll put my words here today

776
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,960
I don't need your help

777
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,320
Second, I don't need your charity

778
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,480
I Tian Tian will never be

779
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,760
You five buckets of rice are bent

780
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:18,920
This is not the only thing that can do

781
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,120
Brother Wang

782
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,320
I was just about to make a phone call

783
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,320
Discuss with you

784
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:38,400
The money thing

785
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,600
We're all working it out

786
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,640
But can you

787
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:42,680
Would you please

788
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:43,960
Give us a few more days

789
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,760
My side has done its utmost

790
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:46,600
You can't

791
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:47,880
Push your luck, girl

792
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,040
No no no

793
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,120
I-we're all trying to find a way

794
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,480
I'm sure I'll find a way

795
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:53,360
Row

796
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,160
You think about it first

797
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,000
I'll come to the store in a couple of days

798
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,080
Good good

799
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:03,640
Tian Tian

800
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,120
I don't care if you're with

801
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,120
Competing by yourself

802
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,840
Or compete with Shen Mi

803
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:09,760
It's not you now

804
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,000
When you can be willful

805
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,400
Shen Mi

806
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:16,040
He is a bit overbearing

807
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,720
But he at least gave us

808
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,360
Leave 30% of the shares

809
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,960
At least the brand of Tianlin

810
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,800
It's still in our hands

811
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,120
If you give that Hu

812
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:33,680
Then you really are

813
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,880
There's nothing left

814
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,400
Dad

815
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,320
The way to try

816
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,400
I've tried everything

817
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:05,640
I might

818
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,159
I can't save Tian Lin

819
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:11,960
I'm really useless

820
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,159
My daughter

821
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,679
How can it be useless

822
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:31,560
What are you doing, Dad

823
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:34,920
I'll do it. I'll do it

824
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:35,639
I'll do it

825
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,080
I'll do it, Dad

826
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,960
You let Dad try

827
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,239
How do you try

828
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,120
Let me try

829
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:52,679
Slow down

830
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:57,520
Slow down

831
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:18,840
Look

832
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,640
Dad made it

833
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,080
Tian Tian

834
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,320
Do you remember

835
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:38,240
You

836
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,680
At the age of six

837
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,320
Shall I take you to the farm

838
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:49,680
Are you saying

839
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,160
What's the situation of Dr. Tian now

840
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:07,480
This wire

841
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,040
Temporarily stuck in the laryngeal chamber

842
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,320
But I'm afraid it will take a long time

843
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,120
Fall into the esophagus

844
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:12,840
Can you take this out

845
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,120
I tried. No

846
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:14,840
Dad

847
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,240
If the wire falls into the esophagus,

848
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,240
What will happen

849
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,320
Will cut the esophageal wall

850
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,320
Enter the thoracic cavity

851
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,840
Pneumothorax can suffocate

852
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,920
It is more likely to cut the great blood vessels

853
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,360
That's even more dangerous

854
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,520
Dad, my hands are small. Let me try

855
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,280
No, it's too dangerous

856
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,440
Dad, I want to save the pony

857
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,840
Just let me try

858
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,320
OK, then you must

859
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:36,960
Listen to Dad

860
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:50,560
Come

861
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,120
Slow down, slow down

862
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,480
Don't be afraid, pony

863
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,040
I'll save you right away

864
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,760
Slowly, slowly, slowly

865
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:04,320
Reach in

866
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:05,240
Be careful

867
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:09,600
Slow down

868
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,480
Don't be afraid, pony

869
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,440
I seem to feel it

870
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,040
Really smoke back slowly

871
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:32,760
Dad, I took it out

872
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:33,880
I took it out

873
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:35,640
Tian Tian is awesome

874
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,200
I was at that time

875
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,200
I feel like

876
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,760
You can take my place

877
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:48,840
And your medical skills

878
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:52,400
Will definitely surpass me

879
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:56,960
Tian Tian

880
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:00,240
Can you protect the fields and forests

881
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:02,720
Not important

882
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,360
People's whole life

883
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,640
It's a long way

884
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,440
As long as we

885
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:16,040
On the way forward

886
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,280
Raise one's head

887
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,280
That's enough

888
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,640
I will definitely keep Tian Lin

889
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,960
Dad believes in you

890
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:38,960
Dad

891
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,640
Don't cry, don't cry

892
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:59,520
This mango

893
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,480
Are you still eating

894
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:03,560
Eat

895
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:12,280
Or

896
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:13,920
Let's change something else tomorrow

897
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:15,960
Forget it. Let's do this first

898
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:16,840
Why don't you get busy first

899
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,240
OK, I'll go out first

900
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,200
There is always one

901
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,520
A lady named Tian Tian wants to see you

902
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:29,520
Give Carlo a return visit

903
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:39,600
Carlo

904
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:42,040
Your master is really bad to you

905
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,400
I didn't even know to bring you back to the clinic

906
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:44,680
You miss your sister

907
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,600
Carlo, let me see

908
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,400
Let me look at the teeth

909
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:55,960
Everything is fine

910
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:56,880
It's just the feeling

911
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,000
I haven't eaten well recently

912
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:58,960
Lost a lot of weight

913
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,120
Carlo's appetite

914
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,000
It's always been good

915
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,120
Are you worrying too much

916
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:04,840
I kindly remind you

917
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,320
Dogs can't eat these

918
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,360
Unfixed grain

919
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,120
It is best to give them fixed rations

920
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,200
Otherwise, it will be changed

921
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:11,840
It's not good for it

922
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,040
I brought your favorite

923
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,000
Carlo

924
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:23,880
Eat slowly

925
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,200
No, no, I'll give it to you

926
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:32,960
I won't give it to you

927
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:38,800
Come and see you another day

928
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:40,480
Wait a minute

929
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,000
Sell me the recipe for fresh food

930
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,120
I can reconsider

931
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,200
The plan to acquire Tian Lin

932
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:52,920
The recipe is for you

933
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:53,880
The management right belongs to me

934
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:54,920
I can continue to let you

935
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:55,480
Be Dean

936
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:56,920
The recipe is for you

937
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:58,320
The management right belongs to me

938
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:59,200
Transfer you again free of charge

939
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,320
5% equity

940
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,080
Don't push your luck, will you

941
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:04,920
Carlo

942
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,120
Carlo, you put the bag down

943
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:08,920
This is someone else's stuff

944
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,160
We can't eat, okay

945
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:14,680
Let's be a dog

946
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:15,360
Have backbone

947
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:15,960
How can you eat

948
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,040
What about things given by others

949
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:18,600
Right, you put it down quickly

950
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,240
It was meant for it

951
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,040
What are you robbing

952
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:24,720
I'm telling you

953
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:26,120
In this matter

954
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:27,240
Before it was negotiated,

955
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,840
It can't eat this food

956
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:29,400
Do you know

957
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:30,800
Come on, come on, get it, Carlo

958
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:31,560
An adult's fault

959
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:32,600
Children are innocent

960
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:33,400
You give it

961
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:34,880
Give me you give me

962
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:35,640
What did you rob

963
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:37,120
Give it to me. This is for it
