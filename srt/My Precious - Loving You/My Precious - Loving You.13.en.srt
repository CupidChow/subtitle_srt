[Episode 13]

26
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,328
Hello.

27
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,344
Your card.

28
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,880
Welcome to our luxurious honeymoon suite.

29
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,120
May you be together

30
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,160
[Carlo]
in love forever.

31
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,960
No, did you get it wrong?

32
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,160
Honeymoon suite?

33
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,360
We only booked one room?

34
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,760
Yes, Mr. Shen.

35
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,920
It shows here that only one room was booked.

36
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,160
Could you please check for us

37
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,600
if there are any other rooms available?

38
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,160
Just a moment. I'll check for you.

39
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,960
I'm sorry, Miss.

40
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,640
All the rooms are booked out for today.

41
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,944
Thank you.

42
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,200
Oh my.

43
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,920
What the heck

44
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,280
did you do?

45
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,920
What did I do?

46
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,800
How's the room?

47
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,320
You got there so soon.

48
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,680
Isn't it a kind of romantic,

49
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,280
passionate and exotic feel?

50
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,120
"Romantic"?

51
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,280
You have no idea how awkward it is right now.

52
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,472
Awkward, huh?

53
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,060
It is just right.

54
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:26,160
Do you two both have feelings for each other?

55
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,280
Otherwise,

56
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,440
you wouldn't be feeling awkward, right?

57
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,000
You shouldn't mind that.

58
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,280
What nonsense!

59
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,080
I'll deal with you after I get back. Bye.

60
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,360
Fine.

61
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,680
You'll thank me.

62
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:53,760
Well, I think Tian Peilan--

63
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,480
Let me tell you, she did it on purpose.

64
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,240
I checked the order.

65
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:00,040
It said to spread roses all over the bed

66
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,920
and to have red wine and champagne delivered
at a certain time in the evening.

67
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,480
So you shouldn't punish her, right?

68
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,720
Of course, I'm going to punish

69
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,700
and criticize her, right?

70
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,240
As a front desk receptionist,

71
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,280
doesn't she know

72
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,800
her basic duty?

73
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,800
Doesn't she know whether I drink or not?

74
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,648
She deserves it.

75
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,848
Forget it.

76
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,960
But I think

77
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,680
this large room is enough for the two of us.

78
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,600
Let's rest first.

79
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,720
It's too hot outside.

80
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,920
I'll take you out for a walk this evening.

81
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,072
Mr. Shen,

82
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,640
here you are.

83
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,440
That factory
has been abandoned for several years.

84
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,960
It took me a long time

85
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,320
to find this information.

86
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,800
If you need anything else,

87
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,040
feel free to contact me at any time.

88
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,200
It's already dark.

89
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,304
Shen Mi.

90
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,960
Shen Mi.

91
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,168
Carlo,

92
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,400
where is Shen Mi, Carlo?

93
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,160
I'm going out for a bit.

94
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,520
I'll be back later.

95
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,520
Where did he go?

96
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,920
The air is so fresh.

97
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,920
The air is really good.

98
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,400
Shen Chen?

99
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,600
Who's calling me?

100
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,520
Shen Chen, is that you?

101
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,856
Hello.

102
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,800
Why are you here?

103
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,100
The classmate
of my classmate is getting married.

104
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,880
The classmate of your classmate.

105
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,008
Here.

106
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,800
Shen Chen, you are so undisciplined.

107
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,160
The hospital is understaffed right now.

108
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,600
What are you here for?

109
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,240
Didn't I explain to you already?

110
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,640
My classmate's classmate is getting married.

111
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,640
Our relationship is so good.

112
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,720
If I don't go, he'll be angry with me.

113
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,760
Your classmate's classmate.

114
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,912
Is this your first time here?

115
00:07:50,912 --> 00:07:52,240
Yeah.

116
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,400
Then you are quite lucky.

117
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,400
Just in time for the Water Lantern Festival.
Look how lively it is.

118
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,800
It is quite lively.

119
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,840
Why don't we rent a boat

120
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,920
and go boating?

121
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,320
Better not. I get seasick.

122
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,680
And I haven't eaten yet.

123
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,760
I'm a bit hungry.

124
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,480
Hungry? It is easy to solve.

125
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,780
There is a delicious mango rice dish here.

126
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:13,960
Let's go eat it together.

127
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,560
Why don't you go buy it?

128
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,120
I go buy it?

129
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,600
Okay, wait here.

130
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,472
Don't leave.

131
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:40,120
Carlo, do you also not want to go boating?

132
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,919
I don't want to go either.

133
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:44,520
Do you think that person will be dumbfounded

134
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,000
if we leave?

135
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,640
Let me take you around.

136
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,856
Let's go.

137
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,456
Go.

138
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,080
Lanterns for sale.

139
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,800
Lanterns for sale.

140
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,440
Young lady, you are so pretty.

141
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,920
Buy a lantern.

142
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,960
My lanterns make wishes come true.

143
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,960
It's so beautiful.

144
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,560
Buy one.

145
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,900
It can make wishes come true?

146
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,800
Yes, take one.

147
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,640
So beautiful. I'll buy it.

148
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,200
Okay, thanks.

149
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:34,040
Carlo, I just set afloat the lamp

150
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,320
to commemorate my former dog.

151
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,420
His name was Zaizai.

152
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:38,520
Just like you,

153
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,240
vibrant and cute.

154
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,160
I miss him tremendously.

155
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,320
Seeing you

156
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,720
so healthy

157
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,580
and happy,

158
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:52,000
I feel assured.

159
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,960
After all, someone once said

160
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,120
rather than mourning the unfortunate dead,

161
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,880
saving more lives

162
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:00,880
was more meaningful.

163
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,128
Do you agree?

164
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,320
That person made quite a sense.

165
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,640
Was that person me?

166
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,280
Your heart is pounding so fast.

167
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,680
I was scared by you.

168
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,680
You appeared out of the blue.

169
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,960
What's the matter?

170
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,720
Is it only you who's allowed to walk by the sea

171
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,000
and I'm not allowed to?

172
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,720
You are quite impressive.

173
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,880
In this pitch-dark night,

174
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,760
how did you recognize me at one glance?

175
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,800
Actually,

176
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,800
I spotted Carlo first.

177
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,640
He's slightly more noticeable than you.

178
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,080
What were we talking about?

179
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,480
What's it?

180
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,040
We were releasing a lantern,

181
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,720
and then I told a story to it.

182
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,344
Oh, right.

183
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,680
It is the Water Lantern Festival.

184
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,960
Why did you know it too?

185
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,808
"Too"?

186
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,640
Dr. Shen is here as well.

187
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,400
I've severely criticized Dr. Shen.

188
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,440
He deeply regrets

189
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,680
his reckless actions.

190
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,040
But his arrival does solve a problem.

191
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,520
Our accommodation issue has been settled.

192
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,280
You can share a room with him.

193
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,480
Come on, just put a lid on it.

194
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,120
Pass me a pipe, yes.

195
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,200
- Thanks.
- Next.

196
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,272
Thank you.

197
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,320
Sir, have you seen

198
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,080
a young girl with a white dog?

199
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,640
- Yes, I did see them.
- Which way did they go?

200
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,680
They seemed to have gone that way.

201
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,120
- White dog.
- Yes, white.

202
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,160
- Thank you.
- Not at all.

203
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,200
It's starting to wind.

204
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,580
They must

205
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:18,480
have received our thoughts by now.

206
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,320
Do you also have some secrets

207
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,360
that you don't want to tell others
in this life?

208
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,800
Everyone has secrets in their hearts.

209
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,184
I'm all ears.

210
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,360
Why do you want to know?

211
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,680
I just want to understand you more

212
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,920
and want you to understand me more.

213
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,640
Isn't it a good thing?

214
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,200
It would also be very helpful

215
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,680
for the future development of Tianlin.

216
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,000
So official.

217
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,940
Alright, I'll tell you.

218
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:10,160
But you have to keep it a secret.

219
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,240
You can't tell anyone else.

220
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,520
Okay, I'll keep it a secret.

221
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,120
You have to swear like this.

222
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,560
How childish are you?

223
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,920
Alright, I swear.

224
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,960
Tian Yuxian acts laid back now,

225
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,360
but when he was little,

226
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,980
he was often bullied by me to tears.

227
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:36,840
He was so little then.

228
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,400
Why would you bully him?

229
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,960
Actually,

230
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,840
it was because when he was newborn,

231
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,560
I felt

232
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,480
that my parents were always around him,

233
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,120
which made me worried

234
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,160
that my mom and dad didn't love me anymore.

235
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,000
I felt that my love was being shared.

236
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,880
I find it funny thinking about it now.

237
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,400
I was too young back then.

238
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,040
Actually, it was only later that I knew

239
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,840
they were worried

240
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,440
that I would be too lonely by myself,

241
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,340
so they wanted to give me another companion.

242
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:09,880
They thought

243
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,280
they couldn't possibly

244
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,400
stay with me forever.

245
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:18,120
I've finished speaking. It's your turn.

246
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,000
My…

247
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,400
My secret.

248
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,392
Alright then.

249
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,280
Actually, I am not--

250
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,632
Tian Tian.

251
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,800
Let's talk about it next time.

252
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,000
I'll tell you.

253
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,480
Tomorrow,

254
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,480
buy the earliest flight ticket and return.

255
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,839
Don't hang around here and annoy me.

256
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:18,839
I won't go. I won't buy it.

257
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:21,000
If Mengnan sees

258
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,200
the three of us together,

259
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,280
Tian Tian would definitely suspect something

260
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,760
about the relationship between us.

261
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,079
What if your identity is exposed?

262
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,480
Then I just won't let her see

263
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,640
the three of us together.

264
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,560
I wouldn't guarantee that.

265
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,480
No, Shen Mi, what do you mean?

266
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,440
You're not acting very brotherly at all.

267
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,600
Do you have to separate me
and be alone with her?

268
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,360
This competition isn't fair.

269
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,440
Just hear what you're saying. Okay.

270
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,520
You just stay here

271
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,800
if you want to, okay?

272
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:47,808
Alright.

273
00:17:47,808 --> 00:17:49,040
But if Mengnan sees you,

274
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,880
you will take all the consequences yourself.

275
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,920
Okay.

276
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,720
But

277
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,080
you absolutely cannot disclose

278
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,320
that Tian Tian is a vet.

279
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,200
Well,

280
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,800
I can't guarantee that.

281
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,896
What are you going to do?

282
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,920
I'm going to tell Tian Tian now

283
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,200
you are my younger cousin.

284
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,728
Don't joke, Mi.

285
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,720
You're a good cousin, right?

286
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,720
Let's discuss it again.

287
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,120
- "Again"?
- I just discussed it with you.

288
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,720
The previous discussion doesn't count.
Let's start over.

289

Mi, you're my cousin.

290
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,360
Hurry, Mi, say it.

291
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,160
Say it.

292
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,920
I'll book you a plane ticket, and you go.

293
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,264
No need.

294
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:24,920
Mi,

295
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,360
I have something to say.

296
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,720
Tian Tian is alone

297
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,380
in this foreign land.

298
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:31,560
It is not safe for her to sleep alone.

299
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,400
I'll sleep with her,

300
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,040
so that you don't have to worry, right?

301
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,680
Why do you worry so much?

302
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,800
Come sit here.
I have something very important to tell you.

303
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,800
Hurry.

This matter

308
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:51,160
must be settled first.

309
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,360
Tonight,

311
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,600
You can find any ground to sleep on.

312
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,520
You want to sleep with me again? I won't.

313
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,280
You've grown up. Aren't you ashamed?

314
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,480
Are you insane?

315
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,760
Who said I wanted to sleep with you?

316
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:05,880
I said I'd sleep in bed,

317
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,280
and that you'd sleep on the ground.

318
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,320
You sleep in bed.

319
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,460
I sleep on the ground.

320
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:12,880
Yes.

321
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,080
Why?

322
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,200
Let me tell you, Shen Mi,

323
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,960
if I sleep with you today,

324
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,000
I am a pig.

If I sleep with you, I am a pig.

326
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,880
Shen Mi,

327
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,880
must we do this?

328
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,160

After all, you're my younger cousin.

331
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,920
So,

332
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,280
are you used to sleeping in this bed, Pig?

333
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,160

we haven't slept in the same bed
for many years.

To control T-cell lymphoma.

What the heck!

Want to shake me off?

379
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,960
No way.

380

All of these

381
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,440

Hurry up.

385
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,760
The pet industry conference
in that sub-venue is about to start.

386
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,840
After hearing the lecture just now,

387
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,920
do you have any thoughts?

388
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,680
Basically no.

389
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,720
But I saw so many experts

390
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,860
listening to Mr. Gu's lecture
like his students.

391
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:41,440
That shows that your plan is really something.

392
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,520
It can't be all esoteric lectures these days,
can it?

393

You don't like it?

394
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:55,760
Not exactly.

395
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,680
I just feel it's too far from my major.

396
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,100
So you need to take advantage
of this conference

397

Here's what you'll be tested on
for the competition today.

00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
If a dog accidentally chokes on something

412

while eating or playing,

413
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,840
as a professional pet doctor,

414
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,620
how should we deal with it?

415
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:34,000
The rules are very simple.

00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,600

Please dial again later.

00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,680
You performed the Heimlich maneuver very well.

444
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:45,960
Very clever idea.

445
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,280
Doctor Tian, would you mind

446
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,640
doing it again and explaining it to us?

447
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,304
Of course not.

448
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,160
Firstly,

449
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,200
I open the dog's mouth

450
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,660
to determine if its airway is clear.

451
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:58,280
Then use touch

452
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:00,200
to feel the position of the foreign object.

453
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:03,140
Once I identify the object's location,

454
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:05,180
I stand the dog up completely

455
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:07,000
and make it lean on me.

456
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,880
Make a fist with your left hand

457
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,060
against the lower edge of its rib cage.

458
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:13,880
Put your right hand on your left fist.

459
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:17,000
Apply pressure inwards and upwards swiftly.

460
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,720
The rationale is

461
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,880
using the inherent air pressure in its body

462
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,760
to squeeze the foreign object out.

463
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,000
During this process,

464
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,400
avoid contacting the ribs and sternum

465
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,520
so as not to cause
unnecessary secondary injury.

466
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,000
- Awesome.
- Awesome.

the Heimlich maneuver

480
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,680
could also be applied to animals.

481
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,680
That was my dad's idea.

482
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,760
When I was little,

483

Zaizai got a toy ball stuck in his throat.

484
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,280

- Zaizai.

00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,760
That's great.

491
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,200
Zaizai is okay.

492
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,400
At that time, I thought

493
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,740
a vet was a very remarkable profession.

494
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:50,200
Maybe that's part of the reason

495
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,560
I wanted to be a vet.

496
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,336
Do you know?

497
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,256
Actually,

498
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,280
I think you are a very good vet.

499
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,940
You can actually give compliments?

500

You won the award today,

502
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,720
so I won't say any dampening words.

503
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,160
Now you're being a buzzkill.

504
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,160
I'm hungry. Let's go eat.

505
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,000
Why are you here?

506
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:21,920
I…

507
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,960
What am I here for?

508
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,680
I came here to get a diving certificate.

509
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,808
Right, bro?

510
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,840
You have a diving certificate.

511
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,080
Yes, I have, but it expired.

512
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,920

514
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,440
Okay.

515
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,680
But if Mengnan sees you,

516
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,500
you will take all the consequences yourself.

517
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:50,560
Okay.

518
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,200
What on earth are you here for?

519
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,520
If you don't want to say it, forget it.

520
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,712
Well.

521
00:30:55,712 --> 00:30:56,760
What are you doing?

522
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:57,940
I have something to tell you.

523
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:59,300
- What are you doing?
- Come with me.

524
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:00,560
I'm telling you.

525
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,600
- I don't want to listen
- Listen to me.

526
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,640
Didn't we grow up together from childhood?

527
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,568
I can't eat anymore.

528
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,200
What's wrong? Not satisfied?

529
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,940
You just said
you were okay with anything to eat.

530
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:31,520
I wanted to eat at the street food stall,

531
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,480
but you refused.

532
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:36,080
Why do you have to choose the street food stall
when I invite you to lunch?

533
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,440
The street food stall is delicious.

534
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,840
I've checked it online.

535
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,680
Then, how about tomorrow night?

536
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,040
Tomorrow night?

537
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,280
Won't there be a reception banquet?

538
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,280
There must be

539
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,360
a lot of delicious food then.

540
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,640
I've got my stomach ready for a big meal.

541
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,800
It's a pity that I wanted to save my appetite
for the afternoon,

542
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,060
but you ordered so much.

543
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:56,240
It was a real dilemma.

544
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:59,960
No worries.
This is a small amount of food for you.

545
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,220
After all, you can eat so much.

546
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:04,680
Yes, I eat more than I should at my age.

547
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:09,500
By the way, do you know you need
to wear evening dresses for the banquet?

548
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:11,800
Do I need to wear a dress for a meal?

549
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:15,200
Isn't it clear on the invitation card?

550
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,840
I didn't notice it.
You should have reminded me.

551
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,620
Would it help?

552
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:20,720
Would you specially order an evening dress

553
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,600
for a meal?

554
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,080
- No, I wouldn't.
- See, there you have it.

555
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,160
It seems someone is going to sleep alone
in the hotel tonight again.

556
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,080
Fine.

557
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,120
I won't go.

558
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,560
Green mango salad.

559
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:38,840
Why didn't you order this?

560
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,760
You love mangoes, don't you? Go ahead and eat.

561
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:52,360
Thank you. Is your nose okay?

562
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:54,960
It's nothing, a minor injury.

563
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,160
Not a big deal to me.

564
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,360
Hang out with me from now on.

565
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,624
Go ahead and eat.

566
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,880
Shen Mi, what's wrong?

567
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,440
Nothing.

568
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,800
Go on eating.

569
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,480
Can you accompany me somewhere
after we finish eating?

570
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,400
What do you really want to say?

571
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,240
I'm not here to watch you drink.

572
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,480
Do you know Tian Tian?

573
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,600
You know her too.

574
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,160
She is my cousin's personal doctor.

575
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,360
Can't I get to know her?

576
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,480
You like her?

577
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,840
That's why you pursued her this far?

578
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,184
Yeah, right.

579
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,380
What does it have to do with me?

580
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:01,720
You're wasting my time.

581
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,220
Don't you want to know

582
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:05,800
how my cousin feels about her?

583
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:10,280
Didn't you come here

584
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,360
because of it?

585
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,464
So what?

586
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,072
What are you trying to say?

587
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,800
From what I know about my cousin,

588
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:29,080
he has feelings for Tian Tian.

589
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:31,520
So we can form an alliance.

590
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,880
The goal of our alliance

591
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:34,640
is to break them apart

592
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,000
and not to let them be together.

593
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,040
How about it? Do you want to cooperate?

594
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:41,472
Childish.

595
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,560
How about this?

596
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:45,679
I'll let you know about anything

597
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:47,040
that happens to him as soon as I can.

598
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,216
Sounds good, right?

599
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,840
One more thing.

600
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:56,000
Don't tell Tian Tian that we know each other.

601
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:57,800
What's the reason?

602
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,160
The reason is…

603
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,080
I will tell you about it later.

604
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:02,944
Okay?

605
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:05,840
Thanks for your drink.

606
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,800
Can you pay the bill? I didn't bring any money.

607
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,440
Let me tell you.

608
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,840
Don't say anything when you get back,

609
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,860
or I will pull your teeth out.

610
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:20,920
Did you hear it, Carlo?

611
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,136
Come to me.

612
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,360
Don't say a word.

613
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,120
Where are we going now?

614
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,880
Don't be anxious. We will be there soon.

615
00:36:15,369 --> 00:36:17,349
[Best Friend Gao Zhuo]

616
00:36:44,526 --> 00:36:46,976
[Best Friend Gao Zhuo]

617
00:36:53,299 --> 00:36:55,264
[Best Friend Gao Zhuo]

618
00:36:59,188 --> 00:37:01,600
[Best Friend Gao Zhuo]

619
00:37:03,699 --> 00:37:06,560
[Best Friend Gao Zhuo]

620
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,480
Buddy,

621
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:38,960
I brought a friend to see you.

622
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:03,440
Tian Tian, this is my friend Gao Zhuo.

623
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,440
He was my only friend.

624
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,600
I had lived in this place for eight years.

625
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,280
He had been with me for eight years.

626
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,880
Eight years.

627
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:26,440
So how old were you when you came here?

628
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,480
I was six

629
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,776
at that time.

630
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,560
The processing factory of Lvchuan

631
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,240
had a big problem

632
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,720
with a batch of raw materials,

633
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,320
causing a great loss to Lvchuan.

634
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,120
My father rushed to deal with it.

635
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,760
My mother and I came along.

636
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:06,280
Baby,

637
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,600
I've got some work to do.

638
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,580
I'll come back and play with you tonight, okay?

639
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:11,080
Okay, Daddy.

640
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,160
You need to listen to Mom at home.

641
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,440
- See you, Dad.
- Bye.

642
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,840
Everything was fine
when we parted during the day.

643
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:21,360
But when I saw my father again at night,

644
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,120
he was no longer breathing.

645
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:27,760
The police told us

646
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:28,880
an accident happened to him at the factory.

647
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,000
Hongyi.

648
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,800
Hongyi.

649
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,360
You can't leave us.

650
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:41,120
Hongyi.

651
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,520
Daddy.

652
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,280
Then why did you

653
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,360
run out of the hospital?

654
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,024
I forgot.

655
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,120
You forgot?

656
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,440
I was so young then

657
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,840
and I witnessed the death of my loved one.

658
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,360
Aside from my father's face,
all I can remember is fragmented.

659
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,640
I can't remember anything at all.

660
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,120
Afterward, all I could remember was

661
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:46,160
a completely strange place,

662
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,680
and there was no one I knew.

663
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,440
All I could hear was a language
I couldn't understand.

664
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:55,920
Mom.

665
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,040
Mom.

666
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:09,880
Mom.

667
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,440
I'm scared.

668
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:17,480
Mom.

669
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,280
Are you hungry?

670
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:35,440
Are you Chinese?

671
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,520
Yes, I am.

672
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,600
Then I'll share half of it with you.

673
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:45,460
Thank you.

674
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:47,744
It's okay. Just eat it.

675
00:42:13,604 --> 00:42:17,124
♫ Your gaze is unwavering ♫

676
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:23,684
