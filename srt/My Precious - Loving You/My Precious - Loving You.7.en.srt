1
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,720
Speaking of talents

2
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,240
Do you think

3
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,880
How is Tianlin's talent reserve

4
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,600
Are all of them unique

5
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,560
Actually, I was just about to tell you

6
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,440
This matter

7
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:51,800
Say it

8
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,360
What's the matter

9
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,200
Now Tian Lin

10
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,920
These employees may want to

11
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,480
Full dismissal

12
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,600
Leave none

13
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,360
What did you say? Say it again

14
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,919
All expelled

15
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,640
Leave none

16
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,680
Don't eat you, man

17
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,880
The sausages are in your head

18
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:17,880
Right

19
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,840
It's not you, is it

20
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,320
What's wrong with it

21
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,400
What did they do wrong

22
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,840
Why should I be fired

23
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,240
You almost stabbed me

24
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,280
Do you know

25
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,840
You poked me in the heart

26
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,000
What did they do wrong

27
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,960
Why should I be expelled

28
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,800
Good

29
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,600
I'm telling you

30
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,800
Chen Yifan steals rape and plays tricks

31
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,280
Don't do practical things

32
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:33,920
Tian Peilan

33
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,160
In addition to prying for gossip,

34
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,160
Is to ask for gossip

35
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,600
Tian Yuxian has a cranky personality

36
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,000
Disobedience to management

37
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,880
Where's Yue Yue

38
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:40,800
It is full of lies

39
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,840
To resort to deceit

40
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,520
Am I wrong

41
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,280
What about Wen Jing

42
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,440
She is hardworking and willing to work

43
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,920
Why should I fire her, too

44
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,080
You didn't see what I just said

45
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:49,800
In all the scenes,

46
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,080
Did you take her with you

47
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,280
What's wrong with that

48
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,480
Employees needed by enterprises

49
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,800
Is to be able to focus

50
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,040
Focus on your major

51
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,120
And fast-growing employees

52
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,360
And not someone like her

53
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,880
No principles, no planning

54
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,880
I can only be a good old man

55
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:02,360
Such a person

56
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,000
In the company

57
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,920
It's fatal, you know

58
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:05,640
You

59
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,080
Row

60
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,200
You are eloquent

61
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,040
You're all ready

62
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,320
One set after another, right

63
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,040
Then I'll hear you out today

64
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,320
You almost stabbed me just now

65
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,600
You have to tell me you're sorry

66
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,600
Me and you

67
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,000
Who told you to fire them

68
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,880
I'm sorry

69
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,680
Have no sincerity

70
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,680
I'm sorry

71
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,560
Don't go too far if you say it or not

72
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,440
You know

73
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,360
Lvchuan is studying a project

74
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,240
For cats and dogs

75
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,560
Experiment of lymphoma targeting drugs

76
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:49,840
Know

77
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,160
Once this drug is successfully developed,

78
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:52,880
Green Chuan will choose

79
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,920
A number of pilot hospitals

80
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,200
Carry out publicity and promotion

81
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,840
In the process of publicity and promotion,

82
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,880
Selected hospitals

83
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,440
You will get a lot of exposure

84
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,040
But that's not the point

85
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,760
The point is that in a short time

86
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,680
Can become a new drug

87
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,120
Hospital designated for use

88
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,240
So in my plan

89
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,120
Tianlin itself is the first in China

90
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,320
Isn't that a good thing

91
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,760
But now Tianlin is not worthy

92
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,800
This pilot hospital

93
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,240
Must be

94
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,880
The most professional and highest standard hospital

95
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,240
Who else will serve you

96
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,600
That's why I told you today

97
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,600
All the demands made

98
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:25,920
All the demands made

99
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,280
I'm doing it all for

100
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,840
Strive to develop in this direction

101
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,200
So I hope Tian Lin's future

102
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,240
Can be more specialized

103
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,360
Brand standardization

104
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,120
Can you understand what I'm saying

105
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,120
I know all the truth

106
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,920
But it's impossible to drive people

107
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,800
Why can't you understand

108
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,880
How can I understand

109
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,240
Tian Lin now

110
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,800
The operation mode of is

111
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,960
It's a family style

112
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:50,960
Management mode

113
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,800
It is operated by interpersonal relationships

114
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,560
And all the relationships

115
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,880
It all comes from your father

116
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,800
Equivalent to your father

117
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,040
Is using his own personality charm

118
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,320
To run the hospital

119
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,120
Do you think there is no risk in this

120
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,000
The risk is too great

121
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,000
Once your father falls down,

122
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,440
The hospital is equivalent to no more

123
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,200
The hospital is equivalent to no more

124
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,360
Do you understand

125
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:09,920
I just hope

126
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,240
Can you learn from this matter

127
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,360
Learn some lessons

128
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,960
Don't repeat the same mistakes

129
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,120
I know

130
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,360
I told you to change

131
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,800
I'll make you a substitution

132
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,880
It will definitely bring short-term pain

133
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,240
But I think for Tian Lin,

134
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,280
In terms of future development,

135
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,040
You must endure this pain

136
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:30,960
I'm sorry

137
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,760
I can't bear the pain

138
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,960
How can you not understand

139
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:39,840
What am I talking about

140
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,800
Is that you don't understand

141
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,320
Tianlin has been established since then

142
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,960
Personnel changes often occur

143
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:45,840
But we never did

144
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,600
Voluntary dismissal

145
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,840
Any employee

146
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,360
Do you know what this is called

147
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,760
Called the Virgin

148
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,840
It's called human touch

149
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,400
What's the use of human touch

150
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,720
Human touch can help you

151
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,520
Improve performance

152
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:56,960
Can still help you

153
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,840
Get the qualification of pilot hospital

154
00:05:58,840 --> 00:05:59,320
Human touch

155
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,480
For the future development of farmland forest,

156
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,960
Does it have any effect

157
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,720
It's useless. It's useless, okay

158
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,160
But they can be in the hospital

159
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,440
In a precarious situation

160
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,920
Stick to it until the last moment

161
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,080
This is called human touch

162
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,440
They are all human beings

163
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,680
This hospital has feelings

164
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,400
Selfish and MoMo like you

165
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,520
A man who doesn't even have a friend

166
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,160
You can't understand it at all

167
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,360
You want to fire them, you can

168
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,400
Then you fire me first

169
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,440
Emotion is emotion

170
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,200
Work is work

171
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,120
I won't tell you

172
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,440
You eat your intestines

173
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,360
Shen Zongzao

174
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,720
Get out of the way

175
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:20,960
Sister Perrin

176
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,640
Busy

177
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,320
Let me ask you something

178
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,920
Ask

179
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,520
What's the matter

180
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,280
Mi Zong

181
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,520
With our dean

182
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,520
What relationship

183
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,040
As you can see

184
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,760
This relationship between them is unusual

185
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,840
Why is it unusual

186
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,120
Between this man and woman

187
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,840
What else is unusual

188
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,920
It is impossible

189
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,480
They were just like enemies

190
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,040
Who doesn't pay attention to who

191
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,640
It's on again

192
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,320
Dr. Chen will give you some water

193
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,400
Is this stock fun

194
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,760
You don't manage money

195
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,560
Wealth ignores you

196
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,400
Please, can you be a little lighter

197
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,520
Why don't I give it to you on the second floor

198
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,240
Let's get a separate office

199
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,360
Save you from squeezing in my house every day

200
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,000
Interaction reduces efficiency

201
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,080
What is this

202
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,880
This is Tianlin's current cash flow

203
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,840
A hundred thousand

204
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,480
Why is there so little left

205
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,360
So you're still going to

206
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,320
Decorate one for me alone

207
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,200
The office

208
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,240
No

209
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,760
Have no money

210
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,080
Tian Tian Emergency Department

211
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:31,880
Coming right away

212
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,280
Hello

213
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,480
I'll take his temperature first

214
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,400
41.2 degrees

215
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:03,920
Doctor

216
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,920
Is it serious that our family is happy and strict

217
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,240
Don't worry yet

218
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,400
Does it have any lately

219
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,120
Symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting

220
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,000
No, ah

221
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,200
Diet defecation

222
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,800
It's all quite normal

223
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,440
So this is it

224
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,720
Let's do a blood routine first

225
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,200
See if there is anything wrong with the blood phase

226
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,040
If there is no problem

227
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,400
It should be no big deal

228
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,480
Row

229
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,200
Then you go outside first

230
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,320
Take a rest and wait

231
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,280
That's hard for you

232
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,840
Don't be afraid

233
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,880
Don't move, baby. It hurts a little

234
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,160
I'll do it. I'll do it

235
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,400
No need

236
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,600
It's enough for me and Wen Jing

237
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,760
Why don't you get busy with something else

238
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,160
It's okay. I'm not busy, Dean Tian

239
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,320
I was originally a physician assistant

240
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:13,720
Assisting you is not

241
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,000
It's my job

242
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,520
Right, too

243
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,360
Then this is for you

244
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:17,960
And

245
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,400
Cephalosporins may be used later

246
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,920
I want to give it a skin test

247
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:22,600
Good

248
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:23,600
Good

249
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,680
Tian Tian

250
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,280
Grandma Wang called and said

251
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,640
Their fat ball is sick again

252
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,520
Answer the phone quickly

253
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,360
Good

254
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,160
You take care of it for me

255
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,320
Darling oh

256
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,280
Grandma Wang, she's here

257
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,360
Grandma Wang

258
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,200
What's the situation now

259
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:54,440
To

260
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,280
Are you saying

261
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,640
Vomiting is yellow-green, right

262
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,680
What about defecation

263
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,440
It's like water, right

264
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,560
Are there any other features

265
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,360
OK, I get a general idea

266
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,600
Don't worry about Grandma Wang

267
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,160
I'm ready to come right now

268
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:10,840
Good

269
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,640
All right, I'll see you later

270
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,000
I have to go out to see a doctor

271
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,480
Go on, go on

272
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:15,960
This place is yours

273
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:16,960
Take it here

274
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,360
Yue Yue

275
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,200
It's the thin one

276
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,000
I know

277
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:56,640
Gentle and quiet

278
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,360
Take the blood routine results

279
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,360
Show me

280
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,880
Are you going to make a home visit

281
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,520
I'm afraid the fat ball will get small

282
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,240
Go and have a look

283
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,640
Normal hemoglobin

284
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,240
Lymphocyte hyperplasia

285
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,880
Looks like a viral cold

286
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,040
Yue Yue is not inflammation

287
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,160
You don't have to test it

288
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,160
Good

289
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,000
You go quickly

290
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:18,680
I'll call it later

291
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:19,920
0.5 ml of Tonglian

292
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,840
Okay, that's yours

293
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,040
See you later

294
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,360
Why are you here

295
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,080
You're not

296
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,800
Do you need a car in an emergency

297
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,760
Get in the car

298
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,240
OK, thank you

299
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,040
It's quite good

300
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,640
Isn't it quite good

301
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,640
It's cat plague

302
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,760
Fortunately, there is no blood in the stool

303
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,720
Or you'll be in trouble

304
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,160
Grandma Wang, where are you going

305
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:28,160
I'll I'll boil a pot of water

306
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,840
Let me make you tea

307
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,240
It's okay. Don't bother

308
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,280
No trouble

309
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,040
Thank you, Grandma Wang

310
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,040
I especially want to drink tea

311
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,000
We'll drink when you're ready later

312
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Good

313
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,120
Why are you so thirsty

314
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,200
I thought you needed an infusion

315
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,440
Can you hurry up

316
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,960
Urge. Urge. Urge. What

317
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,120
There is a process here

318
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,520
Hold it for me and hang it up

319
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,160
This is about the same

320
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,480
It will take more than an hour

321
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,960
If you have something to do, go back first

322
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:28,720
Then I do have

323
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,920
A lot of things to do

324
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:30,960
And my schedule

325
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,400
Particularly busy

326
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,240
But

327
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,080
I've already declined

328
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,200
So would you like to

329
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,520
In this hour's time,

330
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,840
Have a small chat with me

331
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,360
Just talk

332
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,560
What do you want to talk about

333
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,120
Talk about the two of us

334
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,160
The relationship between

335
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,960
Relationship

336
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,440
Aren't we just

337
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,240
A cooperative relationship

338
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,400
What I want to talk about is

339
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,280
Between the two of us

340
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,960
A cooperative relationship

341
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,520
How to talk

342
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,720
I think so

343
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,480
What about a good cooperative relationship

344
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,880
What is it based on

345
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,720
Is based on long-term stability

346
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,040
Knowing and trusting each other

347
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,800
On the basis of

348
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,560
But now for you and me

349
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,600
Almost zero

350
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,920
The two of us barely have

351
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:23,800
So I think we

352
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:24,520
So I think we

353
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,960
It is necessary to communicate well

354
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,760
To learn more about

355
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,360
Each other's inner thoughts

356
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,400
Or ours

357
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,760
Some things in life

358
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,000
Do you know what I mean

359
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,160
Row

360
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,960
Then how do you understand it

361
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:38,720
How to communicate

362
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,840
Particularly simple

363
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,920
Just ask each other a question

364
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,640
OK, then I'll ask first

365
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,280
How did you shape this

366
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,960
Of an inhuman character

367
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,320
Why did you ask first

368
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,760
I, I brought it up. I asked questions first

369
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:55,640
Do you still want to

370
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,720
Enhance one's feelings

371
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,120
Don't answer and pull down

372
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,760
OK, I'll answer you

373
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:02,600
You tell me

374
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,520
How did you do it

375
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,599
Go anywhere

376
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:05,359
Meet anyone

377
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:05,680
All right

378
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,480
What about love so overflowing

379
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,800
You haven't answered my question yet

380
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,400
Did I just answer

381
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:14,160
It's unreasonable

382
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:17,200
Tian Tian, I'm telling you

383
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,319
You're gonna talk to me like this

384
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:19,599
Our partnership

385
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:21,040
There will never be improvement

386
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,440
There will never be development

387
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,920
Do you know what I mean

388
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,760
OK, then I'll change it to a simpler one

389
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,720
Do you have a girl you like

390
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,480
No

391
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,000
How many girlfriends have you talked about

392
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
No, either

393
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,720
None of them

394
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,520
You don't grow up

395
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,880
Haven't even been in love, have you

396
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,040
Why

397
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,120
You don't like women

398
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,360
What about you

399
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,720
Have you ever had it

400
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,720
Have you ever been in love

401
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,480
How many boyfriends have you had

402
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,680
You tell me to come

403
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,200
One

404
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,760
None of them

405
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,520
None of them

406
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,240
Why

407
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:58,960
Why don't you think about it

408
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,040
What about your own problems

409
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:00,880
Like you

410
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,720
How can anyone like it

411
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,680
Who said that

412
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,120
There are so many people who like me

413
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,360
From childhood to adulthood

414
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,080
I don't want to talk about it myself

415
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,800
I am afraid of delaying my study

416
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,720
What are you laughing at

417
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,320
Where's Gu Mingze

418
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:20,840
Ever chase you, too

419
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:22,880
Gu Xuechang

420
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,720
How do you know him

421
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,920
That day

422
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,200
You're done drinking

423
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,440
I saw him like this

424
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,840
I'm holding it out for you

425
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,440
I drank too much that day

426
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,720
People help me to be normal

427
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,240
You said how did you

428
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,640
So I don't care about you.

429
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,840
Drill into other people's arms when you are drunk

430
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,520
What about safety awareness

431
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,600
Have no guard at all

432
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,760
Do you know him well

433
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:41,440
You

434
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,000
More familiar than you

435
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,200
And said that I

436
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,480
What about lawyer Han

437
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:52,960
Han lawyer

438
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,560
With the two of us asking questions today

439
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,240
Does it have anything to do with it

440
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,120
At your grandfather's house that day

441
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,400
She has an aggressive look

442
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,960
Almost ate me alive

443
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,080
There is a problem at first sight

444
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,520
You go with the cat

445
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,880
You play with the cat

446
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,960
Our topic today

447
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:09,960
That's all for now

448
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:10,760
Don't say a word

449
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,480
I don't want to tell you

450
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,480
You go see the cat

451
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,400
I was going to see the fat ball

452
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,000
It's still hello

453
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,360
Much better than that man

454
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:23,920
Compare with whom

455
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,520
Who do you compare cats with

456
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,600
You're not even as good as a cat

457
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,440
That's better than one

458
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,720
People who no one likes are better

459
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:33,760
I

460
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,800
I told you there was

461
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,480
Thank you, Mr. Shen

462
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,520
Send me there in spite of my busy schedule

463
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,160
What are you doing

464
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:11,800
You calm down

465
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,920
We are treating

466
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,000
Don't do it

467
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,120
Who are you hitting

468
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,480
What kind of hospital is this

469
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,400
Stop

470
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,480
What are you doing? You guys

471
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,440
Chen Yifan

472
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,920
What the hell is going on

473
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,440
Doctor Chan

474
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:33,480
What's the matter

475
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,800
Huanhuan is dying

476
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,520
What's the matter

477
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,560
Doctor Chen, come and have a look

478
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,000
How come it's in shock

479
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,760
What did you give it

480
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,880
I don't know

481
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,560
Nurse Wen injected it

482
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,200
Tong Li'an

483
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:55,680
It's just like this

484
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,520
It is impossible for Tong Li'an to go into shock

485
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,560
Where's the medicine

486
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,320
That

487
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,200
This is not Tong Li'an

488
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,240
This is a cephalosporin

489
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,040
What are you doing

490
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,160
How's Huan Huan

491
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,240
Dr. Chen has treated it very well

492
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,120
It was injected in time

493
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:17,880
Adrenaline

494
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,200
Samethasone sodium phosphate

495
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,360
I just hung up on glucose

496
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,320
It has stabilized

497
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,560
What about Huan Huan's master

498
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:30,160
After all, it was our hospital's mistake

499
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,080
I think he

500
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,160
You can't let us go easily

501
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,880
You don't have to worry about this matter

502
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,640
I've settled it through negotiation

503
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,600
They also signed the confidentiality agreement

504
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:39,760
They also signed the confidentiality agreement

505
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,840
No one will put this matter

506
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:41,760
Divulge

507
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:45,880
Shen Zong really has good skills

508
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,000
Shen Zong really has good skills

509
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,200
Since Shen always puts this matter

510
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,320
Handle it so thoroughly

511
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,400
So perfect

512
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:52,760
Then it's nothing

513
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:53,680
Let's withdraw

514
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,120
Wait a minute, wait a minute

515
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,360
I didn't say completely solve it, did I

516
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:58,840
Do you know that

517
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,400
This matter if

518
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,200
If it is not handled properly,

519
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:02,720
Will be on the hospital

520
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,000
What are the consequences

521
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:04,840
So in order to

522
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:05,840
Avoid such a thing

523
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,080
Happens again

524
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,760
I think

525
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,200
Wen Jing Yue Yue

526
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,640
Between the two of you

527
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,600
One must stand up

528
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,240
Take full responsibility

529
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:24,760
I

530
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,080
Shen Zong

531
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,440
It's not that I pass the buck

532
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,680
I've been assisting Nurse Wen all the way

533
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,920
In the end, she was operating it all

534
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,960
I injected the medicine. That's right

535
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:38,720
But

536
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,320
But

537
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,520
The medicine is smoked by Yue Yue

538
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:44,240
How can it be that I took the medicine

539
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,320
I just handed you the needle

540
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:47,520
That cephalosporin

541
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,800
I haven't even touched it

542
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,560
You're not all alone

543
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,440
Operated

544
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,520
Yue Yue

545
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,760
How can you turn right and wrong upside down

546
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:58,200
No

547
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,480
That

548
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,440
How could I not tell

549
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,720
What about cephalosporin and Tolliam

550
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,600
Then according to what you say

551
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,040
I've worked for so many years

552
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,880
Can't I tell the difference between these two medicines

553
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,000
I

554
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:11,480
I

555
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:13,720
Shen Zong

556
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,040
I think this thing

557
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,440
It can't be Wen Jing's fault

558
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,560
Experienced in Wen Jing

559
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:21,720
This little Wen

560
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:22,480
In our hospital

561
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,680
It has been working for many years

562
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,720
Her professionalism

563
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,760
Everyone is also obvious to all

564
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,400
Right

565
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,120
So this low-level mistake

566
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,440
She can't have committed it

567
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,200
I also stand gentle and quiet

568
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,240
What do you say, sister

569
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,280
I

570
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,640
You are all acquaintances

571
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,040
So you bully

572
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,200
I'm a new comer

573
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,960
How do you talk

574
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:45,480
No

575
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,400
That's not what we meant

576
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,120
That

577
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,360
Shen Zong

578
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,160
I didn't do it

579
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,760
Mr. Shen, you have to believe me

580
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,640
What should Mr. Shen do

581
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,480
It's very simple

582
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,840
Both are open

583
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,480
What

584
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,040
No

585
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,840
The other man is innocent

586
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:09,200
Better kill a thousand than put one

587
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:09,760
What do you mean

588
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,520
Better kill a thousand than put one

589
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,640
Who you kill and who you release

590
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:13,920
I'm telling you

591
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,840
If you fire Wen,

592
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,160
Just get rid of me first

593
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:19,600
Get out of the way

594
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,400
Nothing

595
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,600
I advised him, Mr. Shen

596
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,360
Elder sister

597
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,120
Tian Lin is really boring now

598
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,080
I quit, too

599
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,280
Tian Yuxian Tian

600
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,880
I apply to resign

601
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:56,960
Gentle and quiet

602
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,280
So

603
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,560
Are you admitting that you did something wrong

604
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,320
Is it

605
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:08,400
That medicine

606
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,320
It's really not my mistake

607
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,960
I-I just don't want

608
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,840
Dr. Chen and them

609
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,400
Because I'm leaving here

610
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,360
It really shouldn't be like this

611
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,240
Gentle and quiet

612
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,120
Let me ask you a question

613
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,520
Haven't seen it

614
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,720
Never touched it

615
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,120
Is that right

616
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,640
I definitely didn't

617
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:39,920
Let's get her out of here

618
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,200
Mr. Shen Shen

619
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,160
What does that mean

620
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,920
Is the medicine ready

621
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,320
All right

622
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,480
Cosmetic color number

623
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,840
I don't particularly understand

624
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:18,520
But if you look at it

625
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,040
The color of this bottle

626
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,240
With the lipstick she used

627
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,160
Are they the same

628
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,920
Yue Yue, sorry

629
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:37,520
Please immediately

630
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,680
Pack up your personal belongings

631
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,160
Leave Tianlin Hospital immediately

632
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,160
Go and go

633
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,800
Who wants to be here

634
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:47,600
Get out of the way

635
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,560
Thank you, Mr. Shen

636
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,080
You don't have to thank me

637
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,520
You should thank those who want to thank

638
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,960
Trust your colleagues

639
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,000
And

640
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:02,840
You have to remember

641
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:04,360
No matter in the future

642
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,920
Anything happens

643
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,480
You have to know

644
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,280
What should I do

645
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:11,600
Stick to your bottom line and principles

646
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,080
Things you shouldn't do

647
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,720
It's not something you should do

648
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,480
Learn to refuse

649
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,160
Get it

650
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,360
I'm going to thank them

651
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,240
I told you so

652
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,440
That Yue Yue, right

653
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,480
Yes yes

654
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,120
The resume is false

655
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,120
You didn't listen at that time

656
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,080
And now

657
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,360
Yes

658
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,160
And

659
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,840
Chen Yifan Tian Yuxian

660
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:43,440
You see

661
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,280
What's their attitude? To me

662
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,640
I saw it

663
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,440
But they're today

664
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:50,640
Willing to

665
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,520
Sacrifice yourself to save others

666
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:53,720
This is what it is

667
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,240
The human touch in your mouth

668
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,400
So I think

669
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,080
Let's both take a step back

670
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,960
Take a step back

671
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,720
Let me set you a performance

672
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,880
As long as you can finish it

673
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,240
I won't fire them

674
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,800
What performance appraisal

675
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,720
Make a profit within three months

676
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,400
Three

677
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,440
Three months

678
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,400
Row

679
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,960
Isn't it profit

680
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:27,400
That's right

681
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,040
Hospital hush money

682
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,640
Take the hospital account

683
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,760
What kind of person is stingy

684
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,160
Yes

685
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,840
Carlo, why are you here

686
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,760
Carlo

687
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,360
Why are you here

688
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,000
What are you doing here

689
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:08,680
Don't let me work

690
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,120
Isn't it

691
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,440
Isn't it

692
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,040
Go

693
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,080
Let's go over there

694
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,840
Carlo, look at it. It's okay

695
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,040
It didn't get that heavy

696
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,080
Carlo

697
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,080
Isn't it

698
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,080
Fat and heavy

699
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:33,840
What's the matter

700
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,640
Don't let me work, do you

701
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,040
What else is there

702
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,000
There are many more

703
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:46,680
That, that upstairs

704
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,600
That one, two or three or so, that one

705
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,040
How's it going

706
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:49,600
Old money

707
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:51,840
I know why old money divorced

708
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:52,920
Why why why

709
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,280
Because it's a woman

710
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,160
What

711
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,000
Female

712
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,040
Little three

713
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,040
Who ah who ah

714
00:29:59,040 --> 00:29:59,560
You, you said

715
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:00,840
I'm sure I won't tell

716
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:01,840
My goodness

717
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,200
Who is not good to find? Why find her

718
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:03,800
I saw her

719
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,120
Lots of boyfriends there

720
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:08,400
You

721
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,840
That Aunt Guan

722
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:11,880
That cat food

723
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:12,960
It's selling so well on our side

724
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:13,640
It's gone

725
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,160
Shall I call you

726
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,160
Just the one with the tail number 38

727
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:16,720
Isn't it

728
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,240
Hurry up and eat it.

729
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,360
I'll call you. Call you

730
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:19,160
Thank you. I'm leaving.

731
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,600
I'll call you. I'll call you.

732
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,240
All right

733
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,680
This cat food is really

734
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,320
It's selling so well. Really

735
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,720
Wei, thank you. I'll do it. I'll do it

736
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,040
It's a mess. It's too busy. Really

737
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,560
All right

738
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,000
It's a mess. Clean up

739
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:36,640
Boss

740
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,160
Call everyone to the meeting

741
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:38,680
Good

742
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,280
I'm going to call it now

743
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,440
Immediately

744
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,240
What about this one

745
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:55,040
I specially prepared it for you

746
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,720
I'll tell you about it now

747
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:00,520
Approximately

748
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,720
What are you doing

749
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,160
Do you want to play golf

750
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,360
The hospital is for you

751
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,680
Where you play golf

752
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:17,240
Doctor Chan

753
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,000
I'm talking to you

754
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,920
Can you show me a little respect

755
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:21,840
Can you turn around

756
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,080
Yes, I'm listening

757
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:23,840
Go ahead

758
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,320
Revenue equals traffic

759
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,800
What is the flow equal to

760
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:31,040
The so-called traffic is equivalent to

761
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:31,960
All the guests

762
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,120
Come to our shop

763
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,640
What is the conversion rate

764
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,920
Existing these

765
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,720
After the guests arrive at our store,

766
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,120
Like our stay

767
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,560
Don't like our walk

768
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,040
After establishing a relationship with us,

769
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,280
Then there is our next

770
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:45,160
Guest order rate

771
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,520
What do you like for lunch

772
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,200
Old place

773
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:48,720
Sure

774
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,680
No, let's order takeout

775
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,400
I want to eat fried eel with shrimp

776
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,800
I eat fried rice cake

777
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:55,920
Let's all talk about it

778
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:56,680
Let me make a statistic

779
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,760
I, I, Zhajiang Noodles

780
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:58,800
Then order me a piece of Sichuan

781
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,200
Do you want some noodles

782
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,960
Before I finish my words today,

783
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,760
No one will leave this room

784
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,280
What does that mean

785
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,960
Is this going to grade us

786
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,680
Since macroscopic things

787
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:32,840
You're not interested

788
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:34,600
Then let's talk about a little microscopic

789
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,440
What about starting today

790
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,440
I introduced a new assessment

791
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,440
What about this assessment

792
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,480
Out of 100

793
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:43,960
Passing line 60

794
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,080
Scores of assessment

795
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:45,960
With your monthly salary

796
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:46,720
Direct hook

797
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,840
If your assessment

798
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,080
Achieve full marks

799
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,000
You will get a corresponding bonus

800
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:51,800
But if you are

801
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:52,800
If you fail

802
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,080
No bonus

803
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,960
Wages can only be paid to you

804
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,160
Seventy percent

805
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,200
Why is this

806
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:02,640
None before

807
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,600
Such a regulation

808
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,400
Dean Tian, isn't he

809
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,680
Why change it now

810
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:07,520
I

811
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,240
This is Dean Tian and me

812
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,240
Unanimously decided

813
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,440
Is that right

814
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,160
What about this assessment mechanism

815
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:15,920
Not for

816
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,440
Deduct everyone's treatment

817
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,320
Pure to get our hospital

818
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,560
Take a step further

819
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,240
For the development of the hospital

820
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,720
Let's be considerate

821
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:24,840
Understand it

822
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:26,560
You

823
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:30,640
Shen Zong

824
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,040
I have one here

825
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,320
It's on page two

826
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:35,160
The third big article and the third small article

827
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:38,080
It is forbidden to chat with customers

828
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,600
I'm a receptionist here

829
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,200
Is that I communicate with customers

830
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:41,720
That's me

831
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,320
It is a good way to maintain customer relations

832
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:44,440
A very important means

833
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,360
You won't let me communicate

834
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,000
Don't let me chat

835
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,200
How can I do my work

836
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,760
You as a receptionist

837
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,640
What you talk about is linked to business

838
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,880
Of course there is no problem

839
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,560
But

840
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:56,680
You little book

841
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:57,880
Do you mind if I have a look

842
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:58,640
Thank me

843
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:04,520
Come

844
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,560
Let me have a look at what you usually remember

845
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,120
What are they

846
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:13,199
Turn a page casually

847
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,800
What's all this

848
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,679
Lao Qian and Lao Zhang next door

849
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:19,199
Rear-end collision insurance claims

850
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:19,880
Mao Mao is in a hurry

851
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,440
Run away from home with a dog

852
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,120
What do you mean

853
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,040
You keep recording these things

854
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:23,920
What to do

855
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,280
Do you want to be a detective

856
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,400
And

857
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,800
September 3

858
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,639
Zhao Jie of Haojing Yueting

859
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:31,600
Driving a new Porsche

860
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,840
Follow-up with edamame

861
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:34,560
You even have people

862
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,560
I remember my name clearly

863
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,280
My daughter's new private middle school

864
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,960
The tuition fee is 250,000 a year

865
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,080
Are you kidding me

866
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,040
You remember all these things

867
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,280
What are you doing? You

868
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,320
What are you doing

869
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:49,600
I'm telling you

870
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,760
You as a receptionist

871
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,679
You will meet every day

872
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:52,920
All kinds of people

873
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,040
What you need to do most

874
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,440
Is what they ask you

875
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,480
What do you give them

876
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,440
It's as simple as that

877
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:57,960
Why do you want to

878
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,000
To record these things

879
00:34:59,000 --> 00:34:59,800
I don't understand

880
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:00,800
You pry into other people's privacy

881
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,080
Does it make sense

882
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,760
Before you learn

883
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,280
How to be a good front desk

884
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,640
I'll keep this book for you

885
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:07,560
All right, you go back

886
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:08,440
Tian

887
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,280
Tian Peilan

888
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,640
Sit down

889
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,680
One thing I don't understand

890
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,440
You put a few of us

891
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,920
It's all arranged clearly

892
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,040
Then what standard should I take

893
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,080
What about you

894
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:26,760
The criteria for assessing me

895
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:27,920
Particularly simple

896
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,840
At least three months to complete

897
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:31,920
Half of the turnover

898
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,880
What is this

899
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:54,520
This is

900
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,280
Our current performance requirements

901
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,360
Brand promotion plan

902
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:01,840
Since what

903
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:02,600
Tian Lin has asked me

904
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,600
Take over in an all-round way

905
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:05,440
So all the plans

906
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,720
I did it all over again

907
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,120
And you have to know

908
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:08,640
We don't have

909
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,320
So much time to settle down

910
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,520
A good brand

911
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,520
It takes ten years to precipitate

912
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,680
Even decades

913
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:14,920
But you didn't

914
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,200
You only have three months

915
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:18,840
And now

916
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,120
One of the most difficult problems is

917
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,560
The whole hospital goes up and down

918
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,120
Just a doctor in Chen Yifan

919
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,880
This is a big trouble

920
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,080
You're only half

921
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,080
Then according to what you say

922
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,880
Our Tianlin Hospital is nothing

923
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,240
Of course not

924
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,360
There is also a huge advantage

925
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,880
It was adopted by Tian Lin

926
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:36,800
Stray pets

927
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:38,520
You won't

928
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,360
To use these stray animals

929
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,440
Do publicity

930
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,240
That's right

931
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:42,560
I mentioned it in the plan

932
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,240
The concept of a support fund

933
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,160
What about all the people who come to Tianlin Hospital

934
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,160
All right

935
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,480
Donate if you want

936
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,520
No way

937
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,280
This is not with you Lvchuan at the beginning

938
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,040
Do paid adoption

939
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:52,800
Is it a property

940
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,320
What's wrong with paid adoption

941
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,400
Of course there is a problem

942
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,280
That charity

943
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,400
How can it be used to make money

944
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,360
It's not called making money

945
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,120
Can you not be so narrow-minded

946
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,600
Lvchuan is also good, Tianlin is also good

947
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,520
We're just creating

948
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,400
More opportunities

949
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,240
Let caring people

950
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:06,920
To unleash their love

951
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:07,600
You can't even connect them

952
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,920
The right to release love

953
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:09,920
Have you taken it all away

954
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,400
Kick well

955
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,080
I'm surprised

956
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:37,840
Shen Zong

957
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,560
The environment is basically finished

958
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:40,760
Just small animals

959
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:41,520
Hard work

960
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:42,840
That's right

961
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,000
I also want to

962
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,600
Dean Jean Tian

963
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,000
Take a shot of holding a kitten

964
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:47,840
And then our interior

965
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:48,760
It's basically over

966
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,080
I'll lead the team to shoot on location

967
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:51,280
That's right

968
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:52,960
Let me introduce you

969
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:53,800
What about this one

970
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,040
Is our Dean Tian

971
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:55,640
Hello, Dean Tian

972
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:56,360
Hello

973
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:57,920
I've worked hard for you for a while

974
00:37:58,880 --> 00:37:59,600
I

975
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:12,880

Dean Tian

Smile again

978
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:18,880
A good director

979
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,000
I'm sorry. I'll do it again

980
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,360
Okay, let's do it again

981
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,360
To prepare

982
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:25,960
Three, two, one start

983
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:32,840
Ka

984
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,680
Let's have another one

985
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:35,520
Ka

986
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:36,480

Dean Tian

991
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,360
Do you remember it

992
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,280
What was it like when it first came

993
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:50,640
What's it like now

994
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:52,920
It changed so much

995
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,080
Have such a warm home

996
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:56,920
It's all because of you

997
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,560
So you should be happy

998
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,440
Then I'll try again

999
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:07,680
Director

1000
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:08,920
Let me have one with her

1001
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,040
Okay, no problem

1002
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,720
Okay, come on, let's get ready

1003
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:12,880
Come

Three, two, one start

00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,760
Yes, just sweep it here

1006
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:12,560
To give you a card

1007
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:14,480
Row pair

1008
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,120
It is also a stray cat to play with

1009
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:18,360
Yeah, we've been here for a while. Yeah

1010
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,720
This is your thing

1011
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:21,400
Okay, go well

1012
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,440
Thank you

1013
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:26,720
Stethoscope

1014
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:27,480
OK, thank you

1015
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,120
Nothing

1016
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,320
Next

1017
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,640
Come on, do you want to cut it

1018
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:42,960
Right

1019
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:43,800
A little long

1020
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,200
Give it a shave

1021
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:45,680
Row

1022
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:46,480
Its hair is so long

1023
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,880
Little darling, darling

1024
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:48,760
You can choose something

1025
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:49,600
Go to check out

1026
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:50,200
Okay, okay, okay

1027
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:50,840
Thank you

1028
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,000
Thank you for your love

1029
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,120
Thank you

1030
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:55,320
Honey, you're playing here

1031
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,640
The hair is knotted

1032
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,520
You can't do this at ordinary times

1033
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:00,040
It's not good for it

1034
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,560
I have some hair to cut

1035
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:32,280
Shen Zong

1036
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,160
What are you doing

1037
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:35,520
I'm ready

1038
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:36,760
Put this area

1039
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,280
All for stray animals

1040
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:40,280
A place to do that kind of free activities

1041
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:41,720
Let them have a

1042
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:42,800
Play space

1043
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:44,640
Save some time when someone says I

1044
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,560
Take public welfare money to do black things

1045
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:51,320
How come this man has such a good memory

1046
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:07,640
What are you looking at

1047
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:09,240
Can you pass me those pliers

1048
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:12,520
To

1049
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,120
Do you have something to pay back

1050
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:26,240
It's okay. Why don't you go to work first

1051
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:30,240
I'm just a little unaccustomed
