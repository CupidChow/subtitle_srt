00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,400
<i>Shen Mi has a fever.</i>

182
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,640
<i>Anyway, his fever's quite severe.</i>

183
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,600
I can't leave him at home alone.

184
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,880
He's sick.

185
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,280
Okay, take good care of him.

186
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,400
Tian Tian.

187
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,000
<i>[Tian Peilan]</i>
<i>You don't have to rush back to the hospital.</i>

188
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,560
<i>We'll take care of it.</i>

189
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:45,320
<i>You'd come after he's recovered.</i>

190
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,000
Got it, thank you then.

191
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,400
Okay.

192
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,848
Goodbye.

193
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,880
Why are you eavesdropping on my phone calls?

194
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,696
Is Shen Mi sick?

195
00:18:01,152 --> 00:18:02,200
What's wrong with you?

196
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,760
He's sick and you're still laughing.

197
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,300
You don't understand.

198
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,960
When a person is sick,

199
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,840
he's the most vulnerable and helpless.

200
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,240
That's when he'll drop

201
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,600
all his defenses and disguise.

202
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,680
If there's someone

203
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,640
taking care of him

204
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,880
and look after him…

205
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,024
<i>Tian Tian.</i>

206
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,920
<i>You should get back to work at the hospital.</i>

207
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,816
<i>I'm fine.</i>

208
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,680
<i>Don't worry about me.</i>

209
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,056
<i>I won't leave you.</i>

210
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,620
<i>Now is the time when you are most vulnerable,</i>

211
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:05,800
<i>most helpless,</i>

212
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,920
<i>and most likely to drop all your disguise.</i>

213
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,040
<i>At this time,</i>

214
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,520
<i>you need someone</i>

215
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,040
<i>to take care of you</i>

216
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,080
<i>and look after you.</i>

217
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,416
<i>Will you</i>

218
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,120
<i>be this one?</i>

219
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,320
<i>Yes.</i>

220
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,320
<i>It's always been me.</i>

221
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:47,280
Then they are likely to make it.

222
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,560
I am not feeling well lately.

223
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,920
I might be sick.

224
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,320
Come on.

225
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,700
Bro, hold on.

226
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:57,980
Help.

227
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:59,140
- What happened?
- Help me.

228
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:00,820
What's wrong? What happened to Shen Chen?

229
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:01,960
What's his problem?

230
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:04,040
- What's going on?
- Looks like he's got food poisoning.

231
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,040
Poisoning?

232
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,040
What are the symptoms?

233
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,400
I have vomiting and diarrhea.

234
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,860
Let me write you
a Traditional Chinese prescription.

235
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:10,920
Mr. Chen, no need.

236
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,640
No need, Mr. Chen, no need.

237
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,280
Mr. Chen, you…

238
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,320
take him to the hospital with Tian Yuxian.

239
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,200
- Yes.
- Hurry up.

240
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,480
- Send him to the hospital, hurry up.
- No way.

241
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,120
- Let's go. Don't force yourself. Let's go.
- I must be on duty.

242
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,560
What? Let's go.

243
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,560
You can't be delayed right now.

244
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,160
Aunt, maybe I'll take him.

245
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,120
Mr. Chen, you'd stay here.

246
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,200
Tianlin can't open without a doctor.

247
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,840
Okay, hurry up.

248
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,780
- Let me carry you.
- Easy. Easy.

249
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:32,600
What did you eat?

250
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,360
We're all fine here.

251
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,000
Looks like he is quite sick.

252
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,640
What did he eat?

253
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,920
Alright, let's do this.

254
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,640
Are you really going to Shen Mi's house?

255
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,520
If it's really as what your aunt says,

256
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,600
I have to go.

257
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,960
You are still in this outfit.

258
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,880
Okay, never mind. I'm going.

259
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,400
38.2 degrees.

260
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,120
A little better than before.

261
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,320
It is fine then.

262
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,120
You should go back to the hospital.

263
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,360
How can that work?

264
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,080
Anyway,

265
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,680
I am your personal doctor.

266
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,760
It's my duty to take care of you.

267
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,480
Don't forget you're a vet.

268
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,480
Don't get me worse.

269
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,520
I think you're getting much better.

270
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,200
You have the nerve to get me mad.

271
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,720
Well, if you say so,

272
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,800
then I'm leaving now.

273
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,280
Leave then.

274
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,360
I am really leaving.

275
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,328
Oh my.

276
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,640
You remember to eat the porridge.

277
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,360
I cooked porridge for you,

278
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,720
and you talked to me like this.

279
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,112
I'm so angry.

280
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,560
Just left like this.

281
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,320
I'm a patient, after all.

282
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,200
You have no conscience at all.

283
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,720
Although he talked mean,

284
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:31,040
he is a patient after all.

285
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,520
Tian Tian.

286
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,296
Tian Tian.

287
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,660
What?

288
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:24,280
Why do you call me?

289
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,208
Tian Tian.

290
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,880
<i>I can't even go to the bathroom peacefully.</i>

291
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,280
<i>What?</i>

292
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,660
<i>Just left like this.</i>

293
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:38,040
<i>what do you take me for?</i>

294
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:41,040
<i>Guess who got me sick.</i>

295
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:42,880
<i>What a conscienceless person.</i>

296
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:58,960
She has no conscience,

297
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,920
but did make a nice porridge.

298
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,040
I won't eat it.

299
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,280
Can you stop?

300
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,720
No.

301
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,160
<i>No.</i>

302
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,880
<i>I can't be a loser like Carlo.</i>

303
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,080
<i>I just have a taste.</i>

304
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:23,400
<i>I don't think it'd make me a loser.</i>

305
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,072
I…

306
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,864
Well…

307
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,400
I was just trying to tease you,

308
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,200
didn't expect you to secretly eat the porridge.

309
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,840
Please don't make such a childish joke.

310
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,520
I was wrong. I will wash them for you.

311
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,320
Who is it? Knocking so loud.

312
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,680
An insurance guy.

313
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:53,180
Just an insurance guy and I'll get rid of him.

314
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:55,000
Oh my. He's knocking so loud.

315
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,040
- I will go talk to him.
- No.

316
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:58,080
This is not a girl thing.

317
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,160
You go wash clothes,

318
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,360
I'll handle it.

319
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,600
Hurry, you'd go wash.

320
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,360
Well…

321
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,360
This clothes have to be hand-washed.

322
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,760
Yes, you have to hand-wash it.

323
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,040
Hand-washing?

324
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,824
Yes.

325
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,648
I'm sorry.

326
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:23,960
I'll handle it.

327
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:24,992
Don't worry.

328
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,840
Hand-washing?

329
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,560
Are you insane?

330
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:36,720
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

331
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,072
I…

332
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,000
I am here to visit you. Can't I?

333
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,180
You are not here to visit me,
but keeping an eye on me.

334
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:53,380
You have visited me. Alright, go back.

335
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:55,120
I am telling you,
don't play these tricks with me.

336
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,416
I have to get in.

337
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,260
This is my house.

338
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:01,720
I have every right not to let you in.

339
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,400
I am your younger brother.

340
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,720
You have no right not to let me in.

341
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,720
I have to go in first.

342
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:08,340
Alright. Let me tell you,

343
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:09,640
don't you think she's going
to be suspicious of you

344
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,480
coming into my house every other day

345
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,860
with some unreasonable excuse?

346
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:15,880
Think about it for yourself.

347
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,040
What if all those stories you made up

348
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,120
get caught?

349
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,400
How's that? Is he still here?

350
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,640
The same insurance guy.

351
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,520
It's okay. I'll chat with him a little longer.

352
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,120
Why do salesmen

353
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,280
- so persistent?
- Insurance?

354
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:32,840
Selling products?

355
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,400
You're good, Shen Mi.

356
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,280
You have no shame.

357
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,120
How incapable are you?

358
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,400
You're always interrupting my life.

359
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,820
As a salesman, you don't even brush your teeth.

360
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:50,000
So disgusting.

361
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:19,800
<i>Mr. Ma, I'm sorry.</i>

362
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,480
I'm really not available today.

363
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,880
Someday…

364
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,440
Someday I will surely

365
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,520
visit you personally to apologize.

366
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,960
<i>I will drink three cups of wine to apologize.</i>

367
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,720
Okay.

368
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,360
Mr. Ma, has Han picked you up?

369
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,800
<i>Yes.</i>

370
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,780
I know you're busy.

371
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:42,320
It's okay. You go do your work.

372
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,560
Goodbye.

373
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,896
Alright.

374
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,760
Mr. Ma.

375
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,160
I've heard grandpa talk about you before,

376
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,240
saying you and he founded

377
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,440
the first animal hospital together.

378
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,760
Then you are the founder of Lvchuan.

379
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,160
Yes, time flies,

380
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,800
more than forty years have passed.

381
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:06,120
I didn't expect Mr. Shen

382
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,720
to make such a small hospital

383
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,120
into such a large family business.

384
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,200
I wouldn't have gone abroad if I'd known.

385
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:19,280
By the way, I heard that

386
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,720
you have been appointed
as the Director General of Greater China

387
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,520
by the Nature Foundation.

388
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,800
I haven't been back in over 20 years,

389
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,280
and everything has changed.

390
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:34,700
Han, what's the plan later on?

391
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:36,240
Well, Mr. Ma,

392
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,140
I have booked the restaurant.

393
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:39,400
Would you like to

394
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,720
go to the restaurant first

395
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,280
or to the hotel to drop your luggage first?

396
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,040
There's no need to

397
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,240
go to the restaurant for a meal.

398
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,720
Simple meal will do.

399
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,720
Let me tell you.

400
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,480
I was thinking about

401
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,200
having a meal at Mr. Shen's place.

402
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,420
It's too much trouble

403
00:29:58,420 --> 00:29:59,520
to go to the restaurant.

404
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,200
I don't feel relaxed.

405
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,800
Mr. Ma, how about this?

406
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,400
We're not going to the restaurant.

407
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,980
I'll take you to another place.

408
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:09,056
Okay.

409
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,720
Are you cooking hot pot?

410
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,560
And there's a very delicious base ingredient.

411
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:35,840
However,

412
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:38,000
can I eat this when I'm having a fever?

413
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,260
Your fever is due to the wind-cold.

414
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:41,680
Therefore, eating hot pot

415
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,320
can drive out the cold within your body.

416
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,920
Trust me, when I had a fever,

417
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,920
I would eat hot pot and sweat a bit,

418
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:48,960
then I'd be recovered by the next day.

419
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,280
<i>Can I trust</i>

420
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,360
<i>your method?</i>

421
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,280
Just trust me.

422
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,560
I'll go get it.

423
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,480
Hello, is this the residence of Mr. Shen Mi?

424
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,520
Who are you?

425
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,360
Miss Han told us to bring the meal here.

426
00:31:05,115 --> 00:31:06,349
<i>[Han Mengnan]</i>

427
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,120
What's with the meal at the door, Mengnan?

428
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,240
<i>Grandpa asked me to serve Mr. Ma,</i>

429
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,320
<i>so I ordered a meal for a meal at your house.</i>

430
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,800
My house? How long before you get here?

431
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,440
<i>About ten minutes.</i>

432
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,840
T-Ten minutes?

433
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,680
Okay.

434
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,980
Alright, I see.

435
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,200
What's going on?

436
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,960
I don't have time to explain right now.

437
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,000
Now move everything of yours
to the guest bedroom.

438
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,384
Follow me.

439
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,480
What's going on? Who's coming?

440
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,660
Why the rush?

441
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:49,160
My grandpa's good friend, Mr. Ma,

442
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,120
he'll be arriving at my house in ten minutes.

443
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,400
You'd go out later.

444
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,000
I'll call you later and explain.

445
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,120
All right, let's get this box inside.

446
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,440
Forget it. I'll get it.

447
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,520
Let's close this up.

448
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,200
Thank you for your effort.
You can head home now.

449
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,600
I won't send you off today.

450
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,080
I'll call you after they leave.

451
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:26,880
Okay, you'd act by the situation.
I'm leaving then.

452
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,940
You'd hide.

453
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:33,408
Alright.

454
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:50,500
Mr. Ma, you are here. Please come in.

455
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:51,680
Mr. Ma, please.

456
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,680
Oh my.

457
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:03,360
How did I end up in this room?

458
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,160
Mr. Ma, I don't know
your taste in Chinese food,

459
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,640
so I took it upon myself

460
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,260
to order some western food for you.

461
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:19,520
It's also prepared
by a three-star Michelin chef.

462
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,920
Please try

463
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,120
to see if they suit your taste.

464
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,080
Good. Pretty good.

465
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,320
I'm glad you like them.

466
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:28,920
Mr. Ma.

467
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:29,920
Would you like some wine?

468
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:31,760
I'll pass on the wine.

469
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:33,880
I'd like water instead.

470
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:35,800
I just got back from abroad,

471
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,120
I'm still struggling with jet lag.

472
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,280
It's me who's not thoughtful.

473
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,380
I'll go get it for you.

474
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:41,880
No need.

475
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,360
Mr. Ma, I'll get you water.

476
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,360
You scared me.

477
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,480
You scared me.

478
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:56,760
I'm scared in this room.

479
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:57,820
What's going on out there?

480
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:58,920
Just hold on a little longer.

481
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,520
We'll finish eating soon. Okay?

482
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:01,640
I can't take it anymore. Hurry up.

483
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,720
This room is scary.

484
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:03,940
It's so boring.

485
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:06,200
Maybe you can watch
another horror movie with me tonight.

486
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:07,840
Are you joking?

487
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,679
You're scared and
you want to watch another horror movie?

488
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:11,600
What's wrong with you?

489
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,760
Then I'll go out.

490
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:15,000
Stop it.

491
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,180
Okay, I got it. I'll watch it with you.

492
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:18,600
Anything you want. You call the shots.

493
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:22,368
Wait for me.

494
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,760
Hurry up.

495
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,000
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

496
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,440
Mr. Ma.

497
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,960
You've heard

498
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,440
a lot of symphonies abroad, right?

499
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:06,120
Not so much.

500
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,460
I knew it.

501
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:08,480
Then you must

502
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,640
be quite familiar with

503
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,760
the Paris Symphony Orchestra, right?

504
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,160
I was lucky enough

505
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,480
to hear them play live

506
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,040
Les Troyens of Hector Berlioz

507
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,560
when I was in France

508
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,760
on a business trip.

509
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,200
It's really shocking.

510
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,640
They are truly a world-class
symphony orchestra.

511
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,320
Really?

512
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:28,400
I'll definitely go

513
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,720
listen to it sometime.

514
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:36,900
Mr. Ma.

515
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:38,200
What is your next step

516
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,200
after taking over

517
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,760
as Director General of Greater China?

518
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:46,120
I'll mainly focus on
environmental protection and public welfare.

519
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,960
That's great.

520
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,280
Now Lvchuan is also preparing

521
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,920
many public welfare projects.

522
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:53,640
Why don't you

523
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,440
tell us now

524
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,100
what's next for the association?

525
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:59,000
There might be a lot of things

526
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,400
we fit together in.

527
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,320
No, Mengnan.

528
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,400
Mr. Ma just got back,

529
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,780
is still jet-lagged.

530
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:08,680
It's not a perfect time

531
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:09,920
to talk about business now.

532
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,120
I'm sorry, Mr. Ma.

533
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:14,000
I was too hasty and thoughtless.

534
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,280
It's nothing.

535
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,680
Young people have enthusiasm,

536
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:17,720
which is always good.

537
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,080
Where is the restroom?

538
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,960
Just down that hallway and turn left.

539
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,240
Excuse me.

540
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,160
Mengnan.

541
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,240
Mr. Ma just got back from abroad,

542
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,740
he's still struggling with jet lag.

543
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:39,540
It's too rushing to talk about business

544
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:41,080
with him now.

545
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,080
Hello, Mr. Ma.

546
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,680
<i>Shen Mi is quite capable.</i>

547
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:01,360
<i>I can't believe he even kept a girlfriend here.</i>

548
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,880
Do you know me, girl?

549
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,220
Shen Mi just told me.

550
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:10,480
<i>I need to have a good talk</i>

551
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,240
<i>with Mr. Shen.</i>

552
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:16,000
Are you going to eat hot pot?

553
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,800
No, I am not.

554
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:20,200
I-I just leave it here.

555
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,560
No way.

556
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,760
Look at this meat and these vegetables,

557
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:27,200
they won't taste good anymore

558
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,440
if you put any longer.

559
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,280
I'm afraid it's not good

560
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:32,280
to eat here.

561
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:35,440
After all, these are all Mr. Shen's furniture.

562
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,800
If they get any smell…

563
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,760
Don't be afraid.

564
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,100
Let me tell you, girl.

565
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:43,320
I finally got back.

566
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:45,200
Shen Rongxian

567
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,720
didn't even show up.

568
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,720
He should be glad I don't blame him.

569
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,600
Don't be afraid. Listen to me. Let's eat.

570
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,200
I know.

571
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,720
Of course, I know.

572
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,760
The food

573
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,040
and this music I prepared today,

574
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:02,640
I just wanted to please Mr. Ma

575
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,200
and win him over to help you.

576
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:08,100
I tried to win over Gu Mingze
for you back then.

577
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:09,940
You were indifferent to him.

578
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:11,240
What about now?

579
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:13,360
The new drug is on its way,

580
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:15,200
and all the credit goes to Shen Hongyuan.

581
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,320
And you?

582
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,200
Like nothing happened.

583
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:21,360
I know I was a little hasty today.

584
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,280
I pleased Mr. Ma

585
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,600
because I wanted to win over capitals for you.

586
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,000
Now you are blaming me.

587
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,600
I already told you

588
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,120
not to meddle in my affairs.

589
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:35,440
Mengnan, you want to please him,

590
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,080
but don't bring him to my house, okay?

591
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,900
And look at all the dishes you ordered,

592
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:40,760
did you see Mr. Ma eat any?

593
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:52,160
<i>The first time I saw her,</i>

594
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,120
<i>I was thinking,</i>

595
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,080
<i>"How could there be such a pretty little girl?"</i>

596
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:58,400
<i>Alright. After we go back,</i>

597
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,640
<i>you must introduce us to each other.</i>

598
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,680
<i>Of course,</i>

599
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,280
<i>you two will definitely become good friends.</i>

600
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,640
Mengnan.

601
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:07,240
Don't worry about me anymore.

602
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,360
We won't have any chemistry.

603
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:36,000
How is it?

604
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,760
Delicious.

605
00:39:40,832 --> 00:39:41,960
Have some more.

606
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:43,200
Mr. Ma, you should eat more meat.

607
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,280
- Here you are.
- Okay.

608
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,520
Mr. Ma, are you sure it's okay for you

609
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,140
to eat here and not to go out?

610
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:50,360
It's okay.

611
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,280
Listen.

612
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,660
When I'm abroad,

613
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:56,320
I miss traditional dishes from home.

614
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,880
Like Longjing Shrimp, Beggar's Chicken,

615
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,920
especially this hot pot.

616
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,440
Although it is convenient
to eat Chinese food abroad,

617
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,960
it's not as authentic as ours.

618
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,136
Exactly.

619
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,460
I spent so many years abroad,

620
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:13,700
but I still have a Chinese stomach.

621
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:16,760
My favorite food is still Chinese food,

622
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,200
especially the hot pot.

623
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,280
The enoki mushrooms are ready.

624
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,104
- Okay.
- Be careful, it's hot.

625
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,840
This should go with this.

626
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,072
Girl,

627
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:35,040
I see you eat this all the time.

628
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,480
Is this pickled mango?

629
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,640
Well, it's my mom's special.

630
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:39,800
Pickled green mango.

631
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,000
Try it, it's delicious.

632
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,580
Let me try.

633
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:44,640
I haven't had one of these in years.

634
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:51,904
How is it?

635
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,260
It tastes good. I like it.

636
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:56,608
Really?

637
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,260
Give me some more.

638
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:00,340
There's more.

639
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:01,600
There's more out there.

640
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,080
I haven't tasted

641
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:06,600
such authentic pickled mangoes
in all my years abroad.

642
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,680
Right?

643
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:09,960
Then we both have the same taste.

644
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Shen Mi

645
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,600
just doesn't like this.

646
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,440
That means Shen Mi

647
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:17,600
has no taste.

648
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:21,120
This is really delicious.

649
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:29,080
M-Miss Han.

650
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:31,760
Long time no see.

651
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:33,520
Long time no see.

652
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:07,200
Mr. Ma.

653
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,720
I'm really sorry about today.

654
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:10,760
I didn't treat you well.

655
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,480
No.

656
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,440
You did a great job.

657
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:15,600
I'm so glad.

658
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:19,320
You've had a long day, just go home.

659
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:22,560
You too. Good night.

660
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:23,720
Okay, goodbye.

661
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,016
Let's go.

662
00:42:53,222 --> 00:42:56,742
<i>♫ Your gaze is unwavering ♫</i>

663
00:42:58,758 --> 00:43:03,302
<i>♫ Only enough to accommodate me ♫</i>

664
00:43:04,518 --> 00:43:09,190
<i>♫ I have been melted by you countless times ♫</i>

665
00:43:10,150 --> 00:43:13,702
<i>♫ Yet I'm at a loss for what to do ♫</i>

666
00:43:15,654 --> 00:43:18,598
<i>♫ I can only hold on to you ♫</i>

667
00:43:20,678 --> 00:43:24,582
<i>♫ Now you are still with me ♫</i>

668
00:43:26,246 --> 00:43:30,502
<i>♫ Traveling through time together ♫</i>

669
00:43:32,358 --> 00:43:40,294
<i>♫ Someday, I'll be completely
forgotten by the world ♫</i>

670
00:43:40,294 --> 00:43:43,494
<i>♫ Leaving no trace ♫</i>

671
00:43:43,494 --> 00:43:47,526
<i>♫ Only you will still remember ♫</i>

672
00:43:49,286 --> 00:43:51,590
<i>♫ My appearance ♫</i>
