Why is it running nose and drooling?

205
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:13,800
Did you feed it something dirty?

206
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,920
Or did you give it a stimulant?

00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,560
all our efforts over the years will be in vain.

373
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,840
The worship is just a form.

374
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,480
It's enough

375
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,200
to keep your yearning in your hearts.

376
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:17,680
I think he would understand.

377
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,480
You know what?

378
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,200
Shen Hongyuan…

379
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,728
Now,

380
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:27,960
the more afraid he is,

381
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,320
the more correct our judgment is.

382
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,520
However,

383
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,640
I have an even more important thing to do.

384
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,600
What is it?

385
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,720
Wait a second.

386
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,200
I bought you some food.

387
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,080
- Dad.
- You're here.

388
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,560
You bought too much stuff.

389
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,960
It's not all for you.

390
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,360
Some of it is for Carlo.

391
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,920
I'm about to attend the Animal Medicine Summit.

392
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,980
I will be gone for a few days.

393
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:18,360
It will be a waste

394
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,000
if so much stuff expires.

395
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,080
Why don't you take it back?

396
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,160
You're going to the summit?

397
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,560
But you have left the R&D department.

398
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,800
I'm representing the Tianlin Animal Hospital.

399
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,700
Is that necessary?

400
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,560
I don't think it's necessary either.

401
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,080
You persuade him.

402
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,240
He has a heart disease.

403
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,960
What if anything happens?

404
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,900
- Yeah.
- It's okay.

405
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:45,580
I'm a grown person.

406
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:49,120
Dr. Tian will take care of me.

407
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,528
Don't worry.

408
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,760
You're biting a little duck.

409
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,240
Look how dirty it is.

410
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,900
Look at the mess you've made here.

411
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,400
You've got toys everywhere.

412
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,400
You're not happy to hear that?

413
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,240
A shy boy.

414
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,360
Look, I bought you a new toy.

415
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,536
Look.

416
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,360
And your favorite little ball.

417
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,560
And a rugby ball.

418
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,120
Let me tidy up for you.

419
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,080
Toys are scattered everywhere.

420
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,560
You made such a mess.

421
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,528
Good boy.

422
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:41,120
You need to put more heart into this matter.

423
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,080
Alright, I get it.

424
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,800
Remember the responsibility

425
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,280
on your shoulders.

426
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,000
I get it.

427
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,600
I'll remember.

428
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,736
Red light.

429
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,560
Why are you absent-minded?

430
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,760
I'm okay, Dad.

431
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,160
You sure?

432
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,656
Yeah.

433
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,632
Let's go.

434
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,936
What did you say?

435
00:25:08,448 --> 00:25:09,760
The two of us

436
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:13,040
are representing Tianlin
to attend the Animal Medicine Summit.

437
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,840
Yes.

438
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,320
So, you mean

439
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,640
the travel expenses for this trip
should be borne by Tianlin in full?

440
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,800
What else?

441
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:25,480
You are our shareholder and investor.

442
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,840
You invested in Tianlin.

443
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:29,160
So, we're a family.

444
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,760
That makes sense.

445
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,520
A family shouldn't be distant.

446
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,760
We don't need

447
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,120
to count every penny.

448
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,200
So, about the travel expense,

449
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,960
Lvchuan Group…

450
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,080
Impossible.

451
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,360
Tian Peilan, let's have a meeting.

452
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,720
What's this meeting about?

453
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:09,440
About the standards for this trip.

454
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:13,120
Choose an economy class on budget airlines.

455
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,120
Anyway, the cheaper, the better.

456
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,400
Red-eye flights are also okay.

457
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:22,400
For accommodation, choose local youth hostels.

458
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,800
Affordable homestays

459
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:24,800
will be better.

460
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,600
Tian Peilan, did you make a note?

461
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,020
What about the meal allowance?

462
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:36,160
I've thought about it.

463
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,480
50 yuan a day, at most.

464
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,100
Wait, how much?

465
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,120
50 yuan.

466
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,880
What can you eat with 50 a day?

467
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,840
What can you do with 50 in Fu City?

468
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,320
I can tell you.

469
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,520
It's 50 yuan.

470
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,720
When I was in university,
I tried to save money to aid stray cats.

471
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,200
I only ate a small quantity
of rice with free soup per day.

472
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,432
I ate like this for a month.

473
00:26:54,432 --> 00:26:55,560
No wonder

474
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,640
I felt your brain was not fully developed.

475
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,360
- I…
- Well,

476
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,360
stop arguing.

477
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:05,080
What else needs to be noted down?

478
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,440
That's all. I will tell you
when I think of something else.

479
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,504
Okay.

480
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,420
Oh, one more thing.

481
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:15,000
You book flight and accommodation

482
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,480
for one person.

483
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,936
One person?

484
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,520
Who's not going?

485
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,600
I'm not going.

486
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,800
It's crunch time

487
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,740
to complete the performance target.

488
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:34,400
How can I abandon everyone

489
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,160
to travel and have fun?

490
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,360
I've explained to you.

491
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,960
This trip is to broaden your horizons.

492
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:42,480
No need. I will only

493
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,840
focus on my small place.

494
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,160
Since the hospital's funds are tight now,

495
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,800
we are still far from achieving the target.

496
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,080
I can't be reckless with money.

497
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,456
It's inappropriate.

498
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,920
Tian Tian.

499
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:56,920
I think this is a great opportunity.

500
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:57,920
Besides,

501
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:00,480
it's also for the future of the hospital.

502
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,800
You should go.

503
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,280
I do want to,

504
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:07,200
but I can't afford this trip.

505
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,080
How about this?

506
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:13,760
I'll call for hospital staff to make donations.

507
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:14,960
That's not appropriate.

508
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,200
- Our hospital doesn't have good benefits.
- Indeed.

509
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,360
They can't afford much anyway.

510
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,480
Alright, stop it.

511
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,840
Drop the act, okay?

512
00:28:26,541 --> 00:28:28,416
[Yuanrui Bank]

513
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,760
I'll cover the expenses.

514
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,640
Are you happy now?

515
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,160
Absolutely.

516
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,140
Now,

517
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:15,080
they still have plenty of lunch boxes.

518
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,864
Yes.

519
00:29:16,864 --> 00:29:18,340
So,

520
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:20,440
how is your speech for the summit going?

521
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,280
The text is more or less prepared.

522
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,960
But in fact,

523
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,020
I kind of resist big meetings.

524
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:28,600
Why?

525
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,380
What I hate the most is to act like a teacher.

526
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:32,760
Especially when I think

527
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,440
about the industry elites
who will be attending,

528
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,440
I feel kind of anxious.

529
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,160
They should be anxious.

530
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,360
Why?

531
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,640
Think about it. The targeted drug for lymphoma

532
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,080
is a difficulty that researchers worldwide

533
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,600
have been struggling to conquer.

534
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,160
Now, it has been successfully overcome

535
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,160
by a researcher in Fu City.

536
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,120
They should be far more anxious.

537
00:29:52,704 --> 00:29:54,080
Go on.

538
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,860
Actually, I admire you.

539
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:57,440
Dr. Gu,

540
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,840
what you're doing now

541
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,600
is an extremely forward-thinking, innovative,

542
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,320
and beneficial thing for pets.

543
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,800
You should be proud.

544
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,560
Mengnan, thank you.

545
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:11,660
If so, do me a favor.

546
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:13,320
Go ahead.

547
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,680
Get me an invitation
to the Animal Medicine Summit.

548
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,440
You're going to Thailand?

549
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,280
You don't want to?

550
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,880
Of course not.

551
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,480
I'm just wondering how to do.

552
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,780
If Lvchuan Group receives orders

553
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:32,760
at this summit…

554
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,640
A professional legal person must be there

555
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,760
for on-site review.

556
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:50,640
This hotel's swimming pool looks good.

557
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,480
With good ratings.

558
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,320
Let me look.

Nothing. What about you?

563

Shouldn't you be working now?

564
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,160
I'm thirsty. I'm here to get some water.

565

Why such a big reaction?

on the computer.

Be good.

It's a black card.

That's a VVIP credit card.

584

Who in our hospital can have that?

585

Only he can have it, right?

00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:28,080
I'm quite worried about him.

750
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:31,320
He must be lonely now.

751
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,480
As soon as we land,

752
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,720
I'll look after him. Don't worry.

753
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,540
Who is Carlo?

754
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:38,320
Shen Mi's dog.

755
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,040
Mr. Mi is truly considerate.

756
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:45,320
Yes, he is.

757
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:47,040
Sometimes dogs are happier than humans.

758
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,360
Dear guests,

759
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,080
your flight is about to board.

760
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,380
Please expedite your boarding process.

761
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:57,728
Thank you.

762
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:09,000
Our flight is delayed for half an hour.

763
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:13,760
Mingze, Miss Han.

764
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:14,944
We're leaving.

765
00:41:14,944 --> 00:41:16,032
Alright.

766
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:17,840
Shen Mi.

767
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:19,720
Let's have dinner together when we get there.

768
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:23,080
Sure, we'll do it

769
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,280
if everyone is not busy.

770
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,240
That depends, alright?

771
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,440
Mr. Shen, if you have any questions,

772
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,520
call me anytime.

773
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:09,664
Thank you.

774
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,960
The organizing committee
has arranged everything very well.

775
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:15,240
They sent someone to pick us up.

776
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:17,760
Lvchuan Group is important to this conference.

777
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,520
No big deal.

778
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,568
Sure.

779
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:26,840
We're not representing Lvchuan Group.

780
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:29,440
Shouldn't the car fare…

781
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:32,200
It should be paid by Mr. Mi,

782
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:33,800
the important man of Lvchuan Group

783
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,640
and the sponsor of Tianlin.

784
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,112
What do you say?

785
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:45,840
Welcome you to our hotel.

786
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:47,760
Enjoy your trip.

787
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:49,520
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

788
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:51,040
You're welcome.

789
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,104
Hello.

790
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:58,560
Here are your cards.

791
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,560
Welcome

792
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,240
to the honeymoon suite.

793
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:05,360
Wish you a happy honeymoon

794
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:06,480
and marriage.

795
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:11,600
No, did you make a mistake?

796
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:12,600
Honeymoon suite?

797
00:43:35,606 --> 00:43:39,126
♫ Your gaze is unwavering ♫

798
00:43:41,142 --> 00:43:45,686
♫ Only enough to accommodate me ♫

799
00:43:46,902 --> 00:43:51,574
♫ I have been melted by you countless times ♫

800
00:43:52,534 --> 00:43:56,086
♫ Yet I'm at a loss for what to do ♫

801
00:43:58,038 --> 00:44:00,982
♫ I can only hold on to you ♫

802
00:44:03,062 --> 00:44:06,966
♫ Now you are still with me ♫

803
00:44:08,630 --> 00:44:12,886
♫ Traveling through time together ♫

804
00:44:14,742 --> 00:44:22,678
♫ Someday, I'll be completely
forgotten by the world ♫

805
00:44:22,678 --> 00:44:25,878
♫ Leaving no trace ♫

806
00:44:25,878 --> 00:44:29,910
♫ Only you will still remember ♫

807
00:44:31,670 --> 00:44:33,974
♫ My appearance ♫
