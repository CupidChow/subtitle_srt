I don't want to see my dad

Can I tell you a story?

About me…

45
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,840
About me and Shen Mi.

46

At that time,

47
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,760
Shen Mi and I were vagrant,

48
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,900
with nowhere to belong.

49
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,280
For eight years,

50
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,080
we had nothing but each other.

51
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,600
Whenever we were hungry, cold,

52
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,600
desperate,

53
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,720
Shen Mi always told me a name.

54
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,800
He said there was a girl named Han Mengnan

55
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,920

After hiding it from you all these years,

68
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,600
it's hard to ask you to forgive me now.

69
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,840
But even if we get married,

70
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,080
can I really make it up

71
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,640
and bring you happiness?

72
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,240
Moreover,

73
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,640
you have a man who is willing
to take care of you, protect you,

74
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,752
and even

75
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,880
love you as much as Shen Mi.

76
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,200
Do you really want to abandon him?

77
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,848
But at least,

78
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,240
I can make you unhappy now, can't I?

79
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:21,856
Gao Zhuo.

80
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,240
Isn't marrying you

81
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,000
exactly what my dad wants?

82
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,440
You really misunderstood.

83
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,400
Your dad and I were…

84
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,840
No matter what your reasons
and motivations were,

85
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,520
do you think I still care?

86
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,560
If there's nothing else,

87
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,392
I'll take my leave.

88
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,720
I'm going to try on a wedding dress tomorrow.

89
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,840
Will you come with me?

90
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,160
- Tomorrow I…
- Forget it.

91
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,688
You don't have to come.

92
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,640
I know your size anyway.

93
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,960
I'll be back in a minute.

94
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,680
It's too late to go out.

95
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,680
Go to have a rest early.

96
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,640
Honey, you go inside first.
I have something to talk to our son.

97
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:02,040
Okay, tell your son not to go out this late.

98
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:11,328
Son.

99
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,200
What's wrong? You've been restless all night.

100
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,440
Nothing, I'm just a bit tired.

101
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,320
Shen Mi is a sure bet

102
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,320
to be the CEO.

103
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,080
I won't rush you anymore.

104
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,120
Don't worry about it.

105
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,280
It's such a weird

106
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,880
dinner.

107
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,480
Based on the previous situation,

108
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:39,200
Shen Mi should be with that Dr. Tian,

109
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,280
why did he say to marry Mengnan today?

110
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,440
I don't know.

111
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,600
And here's the weird thing.

112
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,440
Your mom remembered

113
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,480
Shen Mi was allergic to eels
when he was a child

114
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,420
seriously.

115
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:57,760
He ate a lot today,

116
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,760
but nothing happened.

117
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,720
Don't stay too late, come home early.

118
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,648
Carlo.

119
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:47,880
Shen Mi, I'm already home.
Don't worry about me.

120
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,380
Are you okay? Did you drink?

121
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:53,120
Do you feel uncomfortable?

122
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,760
I'm a little worried about you

123
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,160
that you didn't reply my messages.

124
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,720
I've already put Carlo
with the electronic collar.

125
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:08,340
Another electronic bracelet
is on the kitchen island.

126
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:09,680
Did you see it?

127
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,320
As for how to connect,

128
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,680
I guess you don't need me to teach you
as you are so smart.

<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">[Tianlin Animal Hospital]</font></font></i>

189
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,120
He didn't reply to your messages yesterday.

190
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,940
Yes.

191
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,720
Do you think something
might have happened to him?

192
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:58,320
What could possibly happen to a man that big?

193
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,360
But there's something fishy about this.

194
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,480
Yes, he didn't reply at all.

195
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,880
It's you.

196
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,480
What's wrong? Let's have the meeting.

197
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,440
Meeting? Who said so?

198
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,520
Of course Shen Mi. Didn't he tell you two?

199
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,280
This is Mr. An.

200
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,096
Hello everyone.

201
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,800
He'll take over all of Tianlin's operations

202
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,808
for me.

203
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,176
Why?

204
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,200
Because I'm going back to Lvchuan.

205
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,760
I'm going back to Lvchuan to take over as CEO.

206
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,880
So I might be too busy

207
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,120
to accompany you

208
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,160
until the very end.

209
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,360
But I'm especially grateful

210
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,640
for all the experiences

211
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,320
we've had together,

212
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,280
all the memories we've had,

213
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,720
and all the growth we've had together.

214
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,360
Now Tianlin will surely

215
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,488
continue to grow stronger

216
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,920
even without me.

217
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,480
All right. Don't be so depressed.

218
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,840
Didn't Mr. Shen say before?

219
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,840
He wouldn't stay in Tianlin
for more than a year.

220
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,800
Now he's just leaving a bit early.

221
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,040
And we're all one family.

222
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,200
He'll be back to see us any minute, right?

223
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,640
Why don't you guys get back to work?

224
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,360
I'll have something to talk to Miss Tian.

225
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,440
You take Carlo back.

226
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,160
You call me Miss Tian in front of them,

227
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,440
making it so formal.

228
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,640
You were too serious just now

229
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,000
and scared everyone.
They thought you were saying goodbye.

230
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,400
What time did you get home last night?

231
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,560
You didn't reply to my messages at all.

232
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,144
What happened to you?

233
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,240
I want to take a walk.

234
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,560
Would you like to accompany me?

235
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,320
Okay.

236
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:54,240
Okay, thanks for coming. Bye, Diandian.

237
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,536
Tian Tian.

238
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,512
Can you help me check the record?

239
00:16:08,512 --> 00:16:09,600
Record?

240
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:15,120
You go check. I'll wait for you in the car.

241
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,680
What's wrong with the record?

242
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,776
I understood.

243
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,440
The record?

244
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:25,200
I understood

245
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,980
why Shen Mi acts like this since yesterday.

246
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:30,340
What? What are you talking about?

247
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:32,680
Let me ask you. What are you going to do now?

248
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,520
He said he'd take me for a walk.

249
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,280
It seems that he has
something important to say,

250
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,660
making it so mysterious.

251
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:39,140
Something important

252
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:40,360
and being mysterious.

253
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,464
That's right.

254
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
What?

255
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,640
Based on my years

256
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,640
of experience in dating,

257
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:52,120
Shen Mi is definitely

258
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,200
going to propose to you.

259
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,320
What?

260
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,360
What are you talking about? Impossible.

261
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,680
He didn't reply to your messages

262
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,360
or meet you since yesterday,

263
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,599
right?

264
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:09,040
He's preparing to propose to you.

265
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,680
He wants it to be a surprise.

266
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,384
Really?

267
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,280
You… Stop now.

268
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,359
I have to go.

269
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,240
Tian Tian.

270
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,319
Play it cool.

271
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:21,520
Pretend you don't know anything.

272
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,800
Pretend you don't know anything.

273
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,256
What are you talking about?

274
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,040
It's a secret.

275
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,640
Chen Yifan.

276
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,440
Can you do me a favor?

277
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,600
Okay.

278
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,240
It's a very, very important thing.

279
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,400
After I leave,

280
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:25,000
everything in Tianlin will be taken over by An.

281
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,240
But don't worry,

282
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,000
he just

283
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,320
checks the books regularly.

284
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,360
He won't get involved in
any of the operation decisions.

285
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,200
Lvchuan will also support
Tianlin unconditionally.

286
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,640
Whether you want to expand,

287
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,720
or something wrong

288
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,620
with the operation,

289
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:46,080
Lvchuan will always

290
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,120
support you with money.

291
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,640
What are you seeing?

292
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,328
Nothing.

293
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,640
The pet show is going to
be opened the day after tomorrow,

294
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,500
and we'll be the special guests.

295
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,800
So I want to pick out a bright suit for you.

296
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:13,000
I'm talking about
the future planning of Tianlin,

297
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,720
why are you telling me all this crap?

298
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,080
Doesn't the future of Tianlin have you?

299
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,280
What should I worry?

300
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,200
What's wrong with you?

301
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,020
Are you upset

302
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,920
or uncomfortable?

303
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:30,944
I'm fine.

304
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:38,400
Are you upset that I wasn't listening to you?

305
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,040
Sorry, I was happy

306
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:43,120
to think that we'd go to the pet show together,

307
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,580
so I was distracted.

308
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:46,760
I'll listen to you more carefully about work.

309
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,960
Anyway, we have a lot of time ahead.

310
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,560
You can teach me whenever you want.

311
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,400
I have nothing more to teach you.

312
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,720
I have taught everything that should be taught.

313
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,560
You are on your own from now on.

314
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,400
What do you mean?

315
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,320
Let's break up.

316
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,380
What did you say?

317
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,640
I said let's break up.

318
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,880
Why are you joking with me like that?

319
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,120
Did I do something wrong? Or…

320
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,040
Does it look like I'm joking with you?

321
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,584
No.

322
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,520
Wait.

323
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,528
You…

324
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,360
Even if you're joking,

325
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,760
at least you should give me a reason.

326
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,000
Why?

327
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,600
I don't love you.

328
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,160
I have never loved you from the beginning.

329
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,840
I only approach you

330
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,040
to fulfill the task Grandpa gave me.

331
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,168
Now,

332
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:44,960
you no longer have

333
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,040
any value for me.

334
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,280
I don't need you anymore.

335
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,280
Do you understand?

336
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,240
I don't believe it.

337
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,900
I don't believe you at all, Shen Mi.

338
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:58,540
Do you have some other reason?

339
00:20:58,540 --> 00:20:59,720
Or did I do

340
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,200
something wrong?

341
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,000
I can make up for it.

342
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,880
Please, don't do so.

343
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,800
Don't lie to yourself, okay?

344
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,040
I'm getting married to Han Mengnan soon.

If you don't believe me, you can go ask her,

347
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,560
or Shen Chen, or Grandpa.

348
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,240
We announced the news

349
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,440
in front of everyone last night.

350
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,600
The wedding

351
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,240
is in two days.

352
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,080
What about us?

353
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,720
What about the future you planned with me?

354
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,200
What about the past
we've been through together?

355
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,400
Are they all lies?

356
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,640
Yes.

357
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,256
They are all lies.

358
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,200
I don't believe it.

359
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,840
They are all lies.

I don't believe it.

I don't believe it.

362
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,320
I don't believe it, Shen Mi.

363
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,600
Shen Mi.

364
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:06,960
Shen Mi.

Shen Mi.

I don't believe it.

I don't believe it.

371
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,480
All right, Dr. Gu.

372
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,400
Dr. Gu, on behalf of Lvchuan,

373
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,520
I would like to thank you

374
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,600
for your outstanding contribution
to the Group during this period

375
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,800
and wish you all the best
in your future career.

376
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,688
Thank you.

377
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,528
I'm leaving.

378
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,360
Miss Han, because time is so tight,

379
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,280
this is the only room available.

380
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:34,320
It doesn't matter. We didn't have many guests.

381
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,360
This is good.

382
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,680
I've already ordered the wedding cake.

383
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,960
They'll deliver it directly
early tomorrow morning.

384
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,080
Have you seen the cake?

385
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,840
Yes.

386
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,480
I hope I'm not interrupting.

387
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:52,512
No, Vivian and I have some business to discuss.

388
00:23:52,512 --> 00:23:53,568
Well…

389
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,440
I'll grab a coffee.

390
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,480
Let me know when you're done.

391
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,568
Okay.

392
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,600
Miss Han, you can try the wedding dress today.

393
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,920
I've made an appointment for you at 3:00 p.m.

394

What did you say?

I've made an appointment for you
at 3:00 p.m. to try your wedding dress.

Okay, no problem.

398
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,080
I'll get back to work then.

399
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:24,864

402
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,160
Do you know about this?

403
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,560
Vivian is so gossipy.

404
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:07,200
I guess there's not many people
in Lvchuan who don't know about it.

405
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,900
I really don't know. Who is he marrying?

406
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,880
It's from Vivian.

407
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,040
Who else could it be?

408
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,200
Han Mengnan.

409
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,280
So when are they going to get married?

410
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:20,580
I think it's the 18th of the month.

411
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:22,220
Isn't that the day after tomorrow?

412

Why are you asking so much?

413
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:26,080
What? Are you going to
give a wedding gift to him?

00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,072
Shen Chen.

489
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:52,864
Ask Shen Chen to comfort her.

490
00:30:52,864 --> 00:30:53,920
Right.

491
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:55,552
What?

492
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,200
It's not time

493
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,360
for such a joke. Is it fun?

494
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,640
Alright, you two go get busy.

495
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,760
I'll be fine here by myself.

496
00:32:09,088 --> 00:32:10,160

509
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,856
Here! The keys are here.

510
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,760
When the door opens,

511
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:10,760
don't speak nonsense anymore. Did you hear me?

512
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,080
W-Why are you guys here?

513
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:29,520
Why do you look so bad?

514
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:30,760
Are you tired?

515
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,800
Why don't you go home for today?

516
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,200
We're here at the hospital.

517
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,760
Yes, you should go home and rest.

518
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,040
- Go take some rest.
- I'm good.

519
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,080
So many customers today,

520
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,960
aren't you busy?

521
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,560
Hurry up and get back to work.

522
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,940
I'll go change clothes

523
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:46,080
and be right there.

524
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:53,984
What should we do?

525
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:56,832
Chen Yifan.

526
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,440
Watch your mouth today.

527
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,856
Did you hear me?

528
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:57,720
What about these things?

529
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,480
I'll send them back to her.

530
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,400
Have you told Tian Tian on this?

531
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:10,360
Does Han Mengnan have something

532
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,520
on you?

533
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,400
If you can't handle it, I'll take care of it.

534
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,880
My marriage to Mengnan has been settled.

535
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:16,960
Just stay out of it.

536
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,960
My marriage to Mengnan

537
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:22,600
makes everyone in the family happy.

538
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,600
What about Tian Tian?

539
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,400
You know my mom doesn't like her,

540
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,560
and I have a bad temper.

541
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:31,480
We're just not right for each other.

542
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,760
What else can I do

543
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:35,680
besides walk the dog with her

544
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,320
every day?

545
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,680
I can't give her happiness.

546
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,040
I have a lot of things to pack.

547
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,680
Just go back if you don't
have anything else to say.

548
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:57,880
Then I will continue to pursue Tian Tian.

549
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:15,800
Well, I didn't want to go to your wedding.

550
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,200
But my dad said,

551
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,920
we are family after all,

552
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,480
so I have to go.

553
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,560
I'll leave after I use the restroom.

554
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,096
Tell me,

555
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:37,840
in this world,

556
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:40,420
is the relationship between relatives

557
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:42,160
the only thing that will never change?

558
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:46,280
Right, brother?

559
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:25,680
Miss Han. This wedding dress

560
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,000
is perfect on you.

561
00:37:28,896 --> 00:37:29,984
Thank you.

562
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:33,280
You don't think I looked good in those ones?

563
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,080
No. They all looked good.

564
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,640
If you're not satisfied with this one,

565
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:39,240
we have many others.

566
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,400
I'm sure you'll find the right one.

567
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,680
No, I'll take this one.

568
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:46,600
Okay, I'll have the assistant
take it off and wrap it for you.

569
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,960
Tomorrow we'll send someone
to put it on for you.

570
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,000
Please be assured.

571
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,040
Thank you.

572
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,800
By the way, when is your husband coming?

573
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:02,304
He's not coming.

574
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:07,160
It's okay, he's so busy.

575
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,840
Just wrap up the suit for me.

576
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:12,280
Okay, Miss Han, I'll get busy then.

577
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,280
Thank you.

578
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,600
I didn't find you in the tearoom.

579
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,160
Where did you go?

580
00:38:44,548 --> 00:38:46,660
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">[Where are you?]</font></font></i>

582
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:43,160
Is this from his comb?

583
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,120
I'm asking you.

584
00:39:49,664 --> 00:39:50,688
Yes.

585
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,880
Dad, I think

586
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:21,040
my brother is not who you think he is.

587
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,520
Let science

588
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,080
answer that.

589
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:57,600
Tian Tian.

590
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:00,760
Here. Try the sweet and sour ribs
your mom made today.

591
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,700
Is it just the right taste?

592
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:03,840
Thanks, dad.

593
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:08,320
How is it?

594
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,480
Listen.

595
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:13,320
That's because
she ran out of salt in our house.

596
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,216
I'm full.

597
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:24,992
Where are you going?

598
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:26,592
I'm going to feed the cat.

599
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,480
That's good.

600
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,536
Go ahead.

601
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:31,584
Go ahead.

Dad, is my sister

619
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:59,280
okay?

620
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:01,040
Well.

621
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:03,440
The last time Zaizai died,

622
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,400
she alone went to the rooftop to feed the cat

623
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:07,160
for several hours there.

624
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:09,984
Afterwards,

625
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:12,920
she hasn't been able to use the scalpel again.

626
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:15,160
Then my sister was dumped by Shen Mi,

627
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:16,960
will she be scared of
falling in love in the future?

628
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:19,480
