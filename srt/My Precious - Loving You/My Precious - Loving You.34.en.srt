26
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:48,120
<i>Why haven't you made any progress
after all these years?</i>

27
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,440
<i>Always doing those sneaky, underhanded things.</i>

28
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,040
<i>Don't you dare to win squarely for once?</i>

29
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,640
Father, don't be angry.

30
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,160
I really didn't know about this matter.

31
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,760
Can I explain it to you
when I get home tonight?

32
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,520
<i>Don't bother.</i>

33
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,920
<i>I don't want to see you.</i>

34
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,280
Father!

35
00:02:12,032 --> 00:02:13,184
Mr. Shen,

36
00:02:13,184 --> 00:02:14,320
Liu Shi'an is in the lobby again,

37
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,640
crying and begging to see you.

38
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,680
Tell him to get out of here.

39
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,880
Understood.

40
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,280
Get out!

41
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,120
Come back.

42
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,840
What's with the anger, old man?

43
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,240
Does it still hurt?

44
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,840
Yes, of course it hurts.

45
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,160
You and your brother are fine, right?

46
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,120
I don't have any problems with him.

47
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,640
But I can't say the same
for him and his father.

48
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,320
I'll kill you.

49
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,440
I've raised you for over 20 years.

50
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,520
Yet you are so ungrateful.

51
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,760
You traitor!

52
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,360
I'm about to take the position of CEO.

53
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,400
Now, I've lost everything.

54
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,280
Why do you fight with Shen Mi

55
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,440
for such a long time?

56
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,120
I won't sit in this position for long.

57
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,440
I'll hand over the Lvchuan Group
to you sooner or later.

58
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,000
Why don't you understand?

59
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,880
I'm not interested in the Lvchuan Group.

60
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,520
And I don't care who the CEO is.

61
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,480
Don't leave such a troublesome job to me.

62
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,760
Who else should I give it to?

63
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,040
You are my son.

64
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,760
You can keep it since you like it so much.

65
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,720
I'm leaving now.

66
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,112
Shen Chen!

67
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,600
You may just keep living in Shen Mi's shadow.

68
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,640
He throws you a few bones,

69
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,240
and you're quite content eating them.

70
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,040
Keep your tail wagging happily.

71
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,040
With your attitude,

72
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,480
I'd better give up the Lvchuan Group.

73
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,536
Get out!

74
00:04:10,656 --> 00:04:11,720
Father,

75
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,000
I will strive

76
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,840
for the things I like with my own ability.

77
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,200
I don't need you to give them to me.

78
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,408
Here.

79
00:05:28,736 --> 00:05:29,760
Here.

80
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,760
Eat a bit of it.

81
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,120
It's still the same.

82
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,640
Why don't you tell me about it?

83
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,880
Gu Mingze,

84
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,200
I'm a person who doesn't like a lot of changes.

85
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,360
Look at this lunch box.

86
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,680
It has chicken,

87
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,280
green vegetables,

88
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,600
scrambled eggs with tomatoes,

89
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,000
and a serving of rice.

90
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,680
It's simple, clear,

91
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,672
and obvious at a glance.

92
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,400
I've had it many times.

93
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,040
I just wish that my life

94
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,520
could be so simple

95
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,160
and unchanging.

96
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,480
Gu Mingze, do you know?

97
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,240
Since my childhood,

98
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:39,040
I have had plans for my life.

99
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,920
I don't like surprises.

100
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,680
Isn't it better to keep everything simple?

101
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,760
I am someone who likes routine.

102
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,880
Why would there be so much uncertainty?

103
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,360
Why would there be losses

104
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,680
and regrets?

105
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,160
Why can't we follow the process

106
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,800
and go step by step?

107
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,520
Gu Mingze,

108
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,200
if everything that I firmly believe in

109
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,600
changes entirely,

110
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,080
please tell me

111
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,600
what I should do.

112
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,760
Mengnan,

113
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,120
I'll take you to a place.

114
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,568
Maybe there

115
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,440
you can find the answer you're looking for.

116
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,760
This was my elementary school.

117
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,800
After graduation,

118
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,000
I never came back.

119
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,080
Where is this place?

120
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,040
This is where

121
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,320
I got claustrophobia.

122
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,600
Are you crazy? Your symptoms

123
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,840
will occur immediately.

124
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,280
It's okay. Don't open the door.

125
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,688
Stay with me for a while.

126
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,024
Just for a while.

127
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,320
Is it really okay for you to do this?

128
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Are you alright?

129
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,600
Why do you do this?

130
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,136
Because of you.

131
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,320
I want to try

132
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,680
to face my fears for you.

133
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,720
You know what?

134
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,360
When I was young, I did well in school,

135
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,200
but I was somewhat introverted

136
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,200
and didn't fit in.

137
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,680
Although the teachers liked me,

138
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,440
my classmates didn't really like
to play with me.

139
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,880
One day, a classmate told me
that the PE teacher

140
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,120
wanted me to go to the equipment room

141
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,480
and help organize the sports equipment.

142
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,440
<i>Sir?</i>

143
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,680
<i>Sir?</i>

144
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,720
<i>What are you doing?</i>

145
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,800
<i>Open the door!</i>

146
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,280
<i>I've always had it out for you.</i>

147
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,760
<i>You are just good at studying.</i>

148
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,120
<i>Don't you love to study?</i>

149
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,320
<i>It's so quiet here.</i>

150
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,120
<i>You should take your time to study here.</i>

151
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,360
<i>School is over. Let's go home.</i>

152
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,280
<i>Open the door! Open the door!</i>

153
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,440
<i>Open the door!</i>

154
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,760
<i>Open it quickly!</i>

155
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,080
I was locked in here for an entire night,

156
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,552
and I was so scared.

157
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,640
Ever since then,

158
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,040
I've developed claustrophobia.

159
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,080
Many years have passed,

160
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,360
and I'm here again.

161
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,560
I just wanted to tell you

162
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,080
that I love you, Mengnan.

163
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,320
Because I love you,
I am willing to face the fears in my heart.

164
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,320
And I did it.

165
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,528
Mengnan,

166
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,760
will you accept me?

167
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,320
I've already bought

168
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,440
the plane tickets to go abroad

169
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,112
for this month.

170
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,480
Mengnan,

171
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,800
that place

172
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,080
is extremely beautiful. It's always summer.

173
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,760
I want to live there with you in a house

174
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,600
that is by the mountains and faces the sea.

175
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,720
We can go fishing at sea

176
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,240
and surf together.

177
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,400
We can invite a few good friends

178
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,440
to listen to music and have tea.

179
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,040
I want to spend the rest of my life
with you like that.

180
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,152
What do you think?

181
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,280
What on earth is Grandpa looking for us for?

182
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,720
I'm not so clear about it either.

183
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,600
He simply told me to bring you here.

184
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,080
Are you worried about my mom?

185
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,440
No.

186
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,400
Don't be afraid. I'm here. Let's go.

187
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,840
Your grandpa

188
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,040
saw the Pet Vet Competition.

189
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,800
Grandpa, I'm sorry.

190
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,920
It's my fault.

191
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,240
I shouldn't have kept it from you.

192
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,120
Grandpa,

193
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,400
it has nothing to do with her.

194
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,760
I forced her into it.

195
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,120
It was my idea.

196
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,720
You really underestimate me.

197
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,880
<i>At the critical moment,</i>

198
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,040
<i>we also need to</i>

199
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,280
<i>constantly blow air into his nose.</i>

200
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,320
<i>If something is blocking his airway,</i>

201
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,600
<i>I will pull out his tongue.</i>

202
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:31,000
I have spent a lifetime
dealing with cats and dogs.

203
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,520
Do you really think you can fool me

204
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:37,360
with your little minds?

205
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,240
Alright.

206
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,720
Don't think I know nothing

207
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,400
just because I'm old.

208
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,320
I was also young once.

209
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,320
I understand

210
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,840
you youngsters'

211
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,960
little thoughts,

212
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,200
tricks,

213
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,440
and tactics when you are in love.

214
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,280
Don't think

215
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
that I am some antiquated relic.

216
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:12,880
Do you understand?

217
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,040
Regardless,

218
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,200
as long as you two

219
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,600
are happy together,

220
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,280
I'm happy.

221
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,960
Let's talk business now.

222
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,280
Shen Mi,

223
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,320
when do you plan to return to Lvchuan?

224
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,480
Grandpa,

225
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,080
the agreed-upon one year isn't over yet.

226
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,440
Tianlin can't do without me now.

227
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,200
That agreement

228
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:19,360
was just to shut your uncle up.

229
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:23,240
Now you've squarely defeated him.

230
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,400
What else can he say?

231
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,280
You knew all along?

232
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,680
Now,

233
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,560
although I don't manage Lvchuan much now,

234
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,920
there isn't anything I don't know,

235
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,760
and nothing can be hidden from me.

236
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,560
Xichong

237
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,440
was a scheme
your uncle secretly plotted against you.

238
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,440
Moreover,

239
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,080
he conspired

240
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,640
with that judge named Shi Mingyuan.

241
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:52,120
Nothing could possibly be hidden from me.

242
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,360
Just now, I gave him a good scolding.

243
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,960
Furthermore,

244
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,360
Tianlin is now on the right track.

245
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,320
You don't need to be there every day.

246
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:03,800
I'm old,

247
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,359
and there are many things I can't do myself.

248
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,960
You need to share
some of the burden with me, right?

249
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,400
How about this?

250
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:25,000
Shen Mi,

251
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,920
you don't need to be at Lvchuan all day.

252
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:30,120
But as long as there is a problem at Lvchuan,

253
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,480
you must oversee it.

254
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,232
Can you promise that?

255
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,720
I can, grandpa.

256
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,912
Don't worry.

257
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,520
Okay.

258
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,760
First, help me with one thing.

259
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,080
For many years,

260
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,840
Lvchuan has been sponsoring

261
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,360
a blind marathon runner.

262
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,632
Here is his photo.

263
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,200
In some time,

264
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,960
he's going to go abroad to compete.

265
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,000
Your grandpa

266
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,840
wants you to console him

267
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,040
on behalf of Lvchuan.

268
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,200
Leave it to us, grandpa.

269
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,600
You can rest assured.

270
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,160
That's all.

271
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,920
You can go back first.

272
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,520
Shen Mi,

273
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,200
whenever you are free,

274
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,560
bring Dr. Tian more often to see me.

275
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,840
Okay, grandpa. We're leaving first.

276
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,040
Take care of yourself.

277
00:18:32,384 --> 00:18:33,480
- Goodbye.
- Go ahead.

278
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,240
- Grandpa, goodbye.
- Goodbye.

279
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,640
Mom.

280
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,160
Shen Mi.

281
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,840
I brought Tian Tian to see Grandpa.

282
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,480
Hello, Mrs. Shen.

283
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,600
Hello, Dr. Tian.

284
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,520
Mrs. Shen, there are so many flowers here.

285
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,240
Are all these for your floral art?

286
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,360
I don't have much to do at home.

287
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,160
So I do flower art to kill time.

288
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,840
Sister-in-law.

289
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,200
What brings you here today?

290
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,640
I'm here to see my father.

291
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,208
He's in the room.

292
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,472
Uncle.

293
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,480
Dr. Tian,

294
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,360
how about I give you a bunch of flowers?

295
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,480
Thank you, Mrs. Shen.

296
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,040
This bunch of baby's breath

297
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,600
matches you very well.

298
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,680
Thank you, Mrs. Shen.

299
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,200
Don't you like them?

300
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,528
I do.

301
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,544
I like them a lot.

302
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,400
Mom, we're leaving now.

303
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,320
Now?

304
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,720
Take care.

305
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,400
Let's go.

306
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,856
Mrs. Shen, goodbye.

307
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,440
Since just now,

308
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,040
you've seemed restless.

309
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,800
Did my mom scare you?

310
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,160
No. How could that be?

311
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,880
Don't you like these flowers?

312
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,800
No, the flowers are very beautiful.

313
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,520
- You--
- Shen Mi.

314
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,600
Your grandpa ordered me

315
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,800
to explain to you

316
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,440
about the Lvchuan matter.

317
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,160
Then, you guys talk first.

318
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,280
I'll go back to the car.

319
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,672
Okay.

320
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,800
You want to talk about

321
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,720
the matter with Mengnan, right?

322
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,640
Although I feel sorry
that you two didn't make it,

323
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,720
it is your own business, after all.

324
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,200
I can't control it, nor should I.

325
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,040
But what I want to say is

326
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,680
that no matter who you choose to be with,

327
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,040
never forget where you came from.

328
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,880
You must remember who you are

329
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,880
and know what you are doing.

330
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,720
Last time you went abroad,
Mengnan was able to discover Gao Zhuo.

331
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,920
Such a thing should absolutely
never happen again.

332
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,040
I know.

333
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,120
Also,

334
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,600
I'll say it again.

335
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,360
You are Shen Mi of Lvchuan.

336
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,600
And you can only be Shen Mi of Lvchuan.

337
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,584
Do you understand?

338
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,800
I know what I'm doing.

339
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,320
Okay, you can go now.

340
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,600
Didn't I tell you

341
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,360
that you didn't have to come today?

342
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,600
Father, I have some things

343
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,840
that I need to explain to you.

344
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,000
You are my son.

345
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,320
No one knows a son better than his father.

346
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,240
You don't need to explain further.

347
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,240
Anyway,

348
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,040
heaven knows what you did.

349
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,624
I'm tired.

350
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,280
That's all for now.

351
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,040
Father, things aren't as you imagine.

352
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,520
Don't listen to baseless gossip.

353
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,136
Father!

354
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,360
Why are you leaving so soon?

355
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,400
Won't you stay for dinner?

356
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,128
I have things to attend to.

357
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,240
Sister-in-law,

358
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,960
do you know the girl just now?

359
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,840
She's Shen Mi's private doctor.

360
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,512
Don't you know her?

361
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,120
<i>Tianlin is just a small hospital,</i>

362
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,400
<i>deeply trapped in a debt crisis</i>

363
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,120
<i>and facing bankruptcy.</i>

364
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,280
<i>But today, we stand here
through our own efforts.</i>

365
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:48,640
Are you sure she's not here to see Carlo?

366
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,280
Do you think I can't tell
a doctor for humans and a vet apart?

367
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,240
<i>Dr. Tian,</i>

368
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,040
<i>how about I give you a bunch of flowers?</i>

369
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,920
<i>Don't you like these flowers?</i>

<i>The symbolic meaning of baby's breath</i>

372
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,360

373
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,520
You're up.

374
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,600
You are up early today.

375
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,680
Shen Mi said that he would have work
at the company later.

376
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,088
He asked me to accompany him.

377
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,080
You are now

378
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,680
able to help Shen Mi with his work?

379
00:26:06,048 --> 00:26:07,160
Mom,

380
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,440
am I that bad?

381
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,560
Well,

382
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,000
I didn't mean anything.

383
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,320
Why are you watering

384
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,680
the plastic flowers?

385
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,440
Don't mention it.

386
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,800
I'm doing this for you.

387
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,560
These baby's breath flowers
you brought home yesterday

388
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,560
are real ones.

389
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,080
But the flowers are a bit small,

390
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,640
dry, and shriveled.

391
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,200
Without my vibrant flowers complementing them,

392
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,840
they would look meager.

393
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,880
Don't buy such unnecessary things anymore.

394
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,280
Where shall I put them?

395
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,640
Good morning.

396
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,816
Morning.

397
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,056
What do you think?

398
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,400
Not only your mom,

399
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,320
but even you are mocking me now.

400
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,752
Don't you like them?

401
00:27:59,648 --> 00:28:00,720
I don't.

402
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,880
I do.

403
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,320
I like baby's breath.

404
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,832
Look.

405
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,688
They are so beautiful.

406
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,680
I think baby's breath flowers are great.

407
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,720
They are simple, pure, and beautiful.

408
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,600
They don't compete for attention,

409
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,120
always giving quietly.

410
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,440
I think, in the future,

411
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,080
our home

412
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,440
should be filled with them.

413
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,568
Okay?

414
00:29:06,916 --> 00:29:11,360
<i>[Honorary Certificate]</i>

415
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:12,992
Champion.

416
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,680
Champion.

417
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,240
Champion.

418
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,560
You've finished your food again.

419
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,960
I specially prepared a bit more for you.

420
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:31,000
And you still finished it, huh?

421
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:34,920
Champion, come on. It's game time.

422
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,672
Good boy.

423
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,720
Champion, where have you gone off to?

424
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,080
Stay still, Champion.

425
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,920
Why are you eating more and more now?

426
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,040
Is it because
training has been too hard recently?

427
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,040
Then eat more.

428
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,960
We need to intensify our training
these next few days.

429
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,160
He is Yan Dejun.

430
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:30,960
The Labrador he's leading is called Champion.

431
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,120
This is the guide dog
specially trained for him by Lvchuan.

432
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,560
I didn't expect that Yan Dejun,

433
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,440
the marathon champion of the Paralympic Games,

434
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,120
would have your support behind him.

435
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,480
Their daily lives

436
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,720
and all the competitions
they participate in around the world

437
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,960
are all financed by us.

438
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,160
Just the training cost for this guide dog

439
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,200
has already reached more than two million.

440
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,000
A guide dog

441
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,080
requires so much financial
and labor investment.

442
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,080
But that makes sense. Currently, there are

443
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,760
just over 200 guide dogs in the whole country,

444
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,160
with 50,000 people
on the waiting list every year.

445
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,360
Mr. Yan, that's all for today's training.

446
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,800
Okay.

447
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:07,840
Mr. Shen from Lvchuan is here.

448
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,744
Mr. Shen.

449
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,920
Come here, Champion.

450
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,080
What are you laughing at?

451
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,520
You used to solve my problems with me.

452
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,520
I didn't expect

453
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:26,560
that I would have the chance

454
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:27,960
to solve your problem with you.

455
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,400
We can do a lot of things together
in the future.

456
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,600
Here, Mr. Yan.

457
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,824
Okay, thank you.

458
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,480
Mr. Yan.

459
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,000
How old is Champion?

460
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,640
He's six years old.

461
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,840
Mr. Yan, I am representing the Lvchuan Group

462
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:20,880
to visit you.

463
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:24,120
We've had the plane tickets and hotel ready

464
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,720
for your marathon next week.

465
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,640
Mr. Shen, thank you

466
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,200
for helping me a lot all these years.

467
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,760
You've won honors for our country.

468
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,680
We should be thanking you.

469
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,800
I'm flattered.

470
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:47,200
Mr. Yan, forgive me for being curious.

471
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,680
But participants like you

472
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,240
are usually assisted by a leading runner

473
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,080
instead of a guide dog, right?

474
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,360
Yes, you're right.

475
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,840
Usually, a Labrador's stamina

476
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,720
isn't enough to last a full marathon.

477
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,320
But Champion is special.

478
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,280
His stamina far exceeds that of other dogs.

479
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,000
Perhaps this is a gift.

480
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,760
But, as you know,

481
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,360
he's already six years old.

482
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,120
If converted to human age,

483
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:15,040
he's at the end of his prime.

484
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,080
So the competition this time

485
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:19,880
might be our last stop together.

486
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,400
Champion ran away.

487
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,560
It's okay. He's been doing this lately.

488
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,264
He'll be back soon.

489
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,520
They're not just friends

490
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,920
but also partners in careers

491
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,120
who strive for a common goal.

492
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,400
This is really amazing.

493
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,720
Isn't this Champion?

494
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,160
Why hasn't he returned?

495
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,360
What happened to you?

496
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:09,880
He vomited.

497
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,704
Yes, he did.

498
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,976
Champion.

499
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:17,239
- Mr. Yan.
- Champion!

500
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:18,272
Mr. Yan,

501
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:21,960
Champion is here.

502
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,000
Where did you run off to, Champion?

503
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,159
You've scared me.

504
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:30,040
Mr. Shen, I thought you had left.

505
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,440
We were about to leave.

506
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,960
But then we saw Champion vomiting here.

507
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,520
So we came to see what was going on.

508
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:39,560
He vomited? How could this happen?

509
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,400
The dog food he eats has always been the same,

510
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,760
and there hasn't been any problem.

511
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:45,120
Is there anything unusual

512
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,679
about Champion lately?

513
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,520
Unusual?

514
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,280
In the past one or two months,

515
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,560
he would disappear after finishing eating.

516
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:54,960
But after a while,

517
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,000
he would come back on his own.

518
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:59,400
There is nothing else.

519
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:24,000
Mr. Yan,

520
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,320
we might need to bring Champion

521
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,040
back to the hospital for a full check-up.

522
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,840
Mr. Yan.

523
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:51,240
Mr. Yan, you don't need to worry too much.

524
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:52,640
Dr. Tian

525
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,760
is doing a check-up on Champion.

526
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:55,760
Don't worry.

527
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,640
Thank you all, I…

528
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,480
I really appreciate it.

529
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,640
Here, have some hot water.

530
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,800
Be careful. It's hot.

531
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,800
- Thank you.
- Take it slowly.

532
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,360
Good boy, Champion.

533
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,480
Good boy.

534
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,528
There is something.

535
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,280
Don't worry too much.

536
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,360
He should be fine.

537
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,520
Just rest assured.

538
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,592
Champion comes out.

539
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:20,224
Slow down.

540
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,680
- Easy.
- Champion.

541
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,720
Dr. Tian, is he alright?

542
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,680
The examination results are out.

543
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,680
Champion's small intestine wall
has unclear division.

544
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,560
And his intestine's muscular layer
is thickened.

545
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,640
There are also

546
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:47,400
multiple significant enlargements
in his lymph nodes.

547
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,760
I-I don't understand.

548
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,520
W-What does that mean?

549
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,704
To put it simply,

550
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:00,240
Champion might have lymphoma.

551
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,640
But we need to wait

552
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,520
until the biopsy is done to confirm.

553
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,240
It can't be.

554
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,120
No.

555
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,640
He is with me every day.

556
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:13,040
He eats well and sleeps well.

557
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,400
We train together every day.

558
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,640
How could he possibly get lymphoma?

559
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,440
Dr. Tian, could it be possible

560
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:20,760
that you have made a mistake?

561
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:23,240
Can you reexamine him?

562
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:25,680
Mr. Yan,

563
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,000
didn't you say

564
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,400
that after Champion finishes his meal,

565
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,760
he will disappear for a while?

566
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,040
If I'm not guessing wrong,

567
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,800
the moment he disappears

568
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:36,200
is when he goes to vomit out

569
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,240
the food you give him.

570
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,720
Why would he do that?

571
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,160
Because he doesn't want you to worry.

572
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,720
He's right.

573
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:57,320
If it's a malignant tumor,

574
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:00,040
dogs can't eat that much.

575
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:03,600
But you said
Champion's appetite hasn't changed.

576
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,080
That means he's enduring the pain

577
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,080
and discomfort.

578
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,760
He would eat the dog food you gave him

579
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,160
before stealthily vomiting it out again.

580
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,960
Mr. Yan,

581
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,120
Champion loves you very much.

582
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,560
He's afraid you'll worry.

583
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,480
He's a well-trained guide dog,

584
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:25,200
so he doesn't bark just about anything.

585
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,480
Even if he's in pain and suffering,

586
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:28,800
he will endure

587
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,600
and keep quiet.

588
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:35,480
Why are you so silly?

589
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:38,840
You should have told me, Champion.

590
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,920
Dr. Tian.

591
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,000
Mr. Yan, please get up.

592
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,640
- Please save him. I beg you.
- Get up.

593
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:01,160
- Please.
- We'll do our best.

594
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,480
Please save him.

595
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,200
Mr. Yan, please calm down.

596
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:06,440
Right now, we haven't performed a biopsy.

597
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,880
So we can't fully confirm.

598
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,280
Maybe it's not that serious.

599
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,400
Even if he really has lymphoma,

600
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,960
we will try our best to save him.

601
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,120
Promise me

602
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,840
that you will save him.

603
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,400
He has been with me for so many years.

604
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,800
I can't lose him.

605
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,840
Don't worry.

606
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,600
We'll do everything possible to save him.

607
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,120
Thank you.

608
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,120
Thank you very much.

609
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,480
Please save him.

610
00:40:44,102 --> 00:40:48,224
<i>[Tianlin Animal Hospital]</i>

611
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,880
How is it?

612
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:03,200
Let's talk outside.

613
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,640
The condition is indeed serious.

614
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,040
A complete cure

615
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:14,144
is unlikely.
