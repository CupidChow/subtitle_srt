26
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,220
Old couple.

27
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:43,360
Old couple.

28
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:48,440
We support each other.

29
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,520
That's what it means to have a companion.

30
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,920
But who would have thought

31
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,120
I fell ill

32
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,600
before her.

33
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,400
Well, you guys are watching me?

34
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,240
No, no.

35
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,120
I just want to spend more time with you.

36
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,680
Besides, if something happens
during my surgery…

37
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,640
Don't talk if you can't, just watch the dog.

38
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,220
Dafu.

39
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,440
Dafu.

40
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,680
You're the best.

41
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,680
So you train Dafu

42
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,400
to watch over Auntie Ge at all times
in case something happens to her?

43
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,500
Your Auntie and I

44
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,960
have come this far.

45
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,880
We can't just let go.

46
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,720
Actually,

47
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,480
your aunt's cooking

48
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,680
is quite bad.

49
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,240
She has been cooking for most of her life.

50
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:05,560
I've eaten it for most of mine.

51
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,320
Now I'm in the hospital.

52
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,940
I can't eat her cooking.

53
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:16,080
I, I'm not used to it now.

54
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,000
People,

55
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,540
when they get used to something,

56
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,680
it's hard to let go.

57
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,720
Your aunt

58
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,600
is used to me being by her side,

59
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,040
taking care of her, reminding her,

60
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,040
and staying with her.

61
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,944
Well,

62
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,440
if I'm not around,

63
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,200
at least there's Dafu

64
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,960
continuing

65
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:52,040
to watch over her, remind her,

66
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,480
and take care of her, right?

67
00:03:59,776 --> 00:04:00,800
Auntie.

68
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:02,840
Darling.

69
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,580
You old man, you are saying
ominous things again.

70
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:06,624
Hurry up.

71
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,440
I knew you would be like that.

72
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,240
So I didn't want

73
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,760
to tell you about Dafu.

74
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,400
As for my cooking being bad,

75
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,800
why didn't you say that before?

76
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,080
Darling,

77
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,240
whether the food is good or not doesn't matter.

78
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,200
As long as you cook it,

79
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:32,960
no matter what I eat,

80
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,440
I like it.

81
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:59,440
Tian Yuxian, turn it off, turn it off.
I can't hear.

82
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,920
Good boy, Dafu.

83
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,120
Why is there no movement outside?

84
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,120
I find it strange, too.

85
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,480
I have a feeling something is not right.

86
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,480
What's wrong?

87
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,480
Tian Yuxian, what are you doing?
What's the time now?

88
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,860
You're still grooming the dog?

89
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:29,240
Just because we're idle, why can't we groom?

90
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,040
Hey, people inside, listen up!

91
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,248
If you don't leave our beauty salon,

92
00:05:37,248 --> 00:05:38,272
we're going to call the police.

93
00:05:38,272 --> 00:05:39,760
We won't go out.

94
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,720
No one can take the dog away today.

95
00:05:42,784 --> 00:05:43,920
Okay.

96
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,920
I advise you all to come out quickly.

97
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,160
- It's okay, it's okay, be good, Dafu.
- Don't knock anymore.

98
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,160
I said, "Don't knock anymore."

99
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,200
We won't let you in.

100
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,360
If anyone comes in, we will fight back.

101
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,360
It's me, Shen Mi.

102
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,920
You better put that thing down.

103
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,720
I'm sorry to put you through this.

104
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,840
It's all my fault.

105
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,780
Liu Shi'an, I'm sorry.

106
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:08,100
I won't do that thing to Dafu.

107
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:11,060
Look at what a mess this has become.

108
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:12,480
Sorry to have troubled you guys.

109
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,400
Or,

110
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,780
shall I pay you guys some compensation?

111
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:20,800
No need.

112
00:07:24,608 --> 00:07:25,632
Auntie Ge,

113
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,808
I think you should go home first.

114
00:07:28,384 --> 00:07:30,144
Uncle Jiang is still waiting for you
in the hospital.

115
00:07:30,144 --> 00:07:31,360
Alright.

116
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,384
Yes, indeed,

117
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,680
this issue has escalated

118
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,120
to more than just a monetary problem.

119
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,912
Right, Mr. Mi?

120
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,990
Auntie Ge, compared to us,

121
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:44,600
Uncle Jiang really needs you more, right?

122
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,800
Yes.

123
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,880
Okay, thank you.

124
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,880
Thank you, thank you.

125
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,280
I'm so sorry, so sorry.

126
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,760
Madam, let me walk you out.

127
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,040
For the euthanasia fees,
we didn't really plan to take your money.

128
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,640
We just wanted you to reconsider.

129
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,880
Let's talk about it.

130
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,960
Your guys came to our Xichong and caused chaos,

131
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,640
causing such a bad influence on our hospital.

132
00:08:05,216 --> 00:08:06,640
You have also injured our people.

133
00:08:07,264 --> 00:08:08,288
What do you have to say for yourself?

134
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,880
I also got injured.

135
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,480
What do you say about this?

136
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,000
What kind of injury do you have
and where is it?

137
00:08:15,296 --> 00:08:16,416
My hand is injured.

138
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:17,460
Let me see.

139
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:18,560
Have a look.

140
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,480
You really played this drama well.

141
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,536
Well, well.

142
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,720
Okay, so you Tianlin are doing this here.

143
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,776
I'm telling you that we recorded
the whole process.

144
00:08:27,776 --> 00:08:28,832
Later,

145
00:08:28,832 --> 00:08:30,920
I will expose your despicable behavior
to the internet

146
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,960
and expose you all.

147
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,000
You are doing this here.

148
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:37,080
Did you forget that we also have
video recordings?

149
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,640
<i>Auntie, you must not be afraid.</i>

150
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:46,560
<i>With us from Xichong supporting you,
rest assured.</i>

151
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,360
<i>Today, we must snatch Dafu</i>

152
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,000
<i>from this shady store.</i>

153
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,320
- <i>I assure that once Dafu enters our Xichong,</i>
- Where did they get this?

154
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,240
<i>I guarantee that you will watch it die
right before your eyes.</i>

155
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,248
<i>Mr. Liu,</i>

156
00:08:57,248 --> 00:08:59,776
<i>do you not know that Auntie has been
brainwashed by feudal superstitions?</i>

157
00:08:59,776 --> 00:09:00,832
<i>She said</i>

158
00:09:00,832 --> 00:09:03,000
<i>Dafu was possessed by a lost soul,
do you believe it?</i>

159
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,040
<i>I know.</i>

160
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,960
<i>Then why do you still have to euthanize it?</i>

161
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,400
<i>In Xichong,</i>

162
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,560
<i>our consistent principle is</i>

163
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,800
<i>not to ask customers why,
only how customers want to do it.</i>

164
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,960
Do you want me to post this video online?

165
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,320
Let everyone see

166
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:19,360
just how unethical Xichong is,
lacking moral boundaries.

167
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,520
It's an extremely dishonest pet hospital.

168
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,000
Please, please, don't, show some mercy.

169
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,580
Well,

170
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:29,520
we are in the same line of business.

171
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,440
A harmonious atmosphere benefits everyone.

172
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,480
Otherwise…

173
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,080
Otherwise what?

174
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,904
Let's just forget it.

175
00:09:35,904 --> 00:09:37,280
Let's forget it.

176
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,072
Forget it, forget it.

177
00:09:40,064 --> 00:09:41,088
Mr. Mi, okay?

178
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,880
We each give an inch.

179
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,960
Mengnan, just got off work?

180
00:10:38,848 --> 00:10:39,904
Yes.

181
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,600
What happened? Why are your eyes so red?

182
00:10:46,336 --> 00:10:47,360
It's over.

183
00:10:47,936 --> 00:10:49,040
What's over?

184
00:10:50,528 --> 00:10:51,580
New drug.

185
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:52,880
Did something go wrong?

186
00:10:54,752 --> 00:10:55,880
It's finished.

187
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,760
Put me down, there's someone.

188
00:11:16,576 --> 00:11:17,632
I'm dizzy.

189
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,280
- Let's celebrate.
- Let's celebrate.

190
00:11:37,152 --> 00:11:38,200
Let's go.

191
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,328
Okay.

192
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,080
Thank you everyone for coming here tonight.

193
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,720
We hope you will like our song. Thank you!

194
00:12:44,352 --> 00:12:45,520
Come on, try this, it's still warm.

195
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,920
Why do you have free time to visit me today?

196
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,020
Because I missed you.

197
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:49,380
I missed you too, baby.

198
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:50,680
This is the loving meal

199
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,032
I cooked especially for you after work.

200
00:12:52,032 --> 00:12:53,040
What delicious food?

201
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,640
Your favorite steak rice.

202
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,704
Jealous?

203
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,320
Come on, have a taste, come on.

204
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,080
- Does it taste good?
- It's delicious.

205
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,680
I don't envy at all.

206
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,840
Bento, we used to eat it frequently.

207
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,000
However, speaking of it,

208
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,120
it appears that we haven't eaten
bento together in a long time.

209
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,680
I particularly miss those days.

210
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:18,180
It seems that ever since
we last drank at my house,

211
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:19,760
we haven't eaten together again.

212
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,520
Regardless, congratulations on your success.

213
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,080
No, I should say, congratulations
to Lvchuan on your success.

214
00:13:44,864 --> 00:13:45,920
Us?

215
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,680
I am leaving Lvchuan.

216
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,240
Why are you leaving Lvchuan?

217
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,300
My mission at Lvchuan is over.

218
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:01,200
Staying any longer does not serve any purpose.

219
00:14:08,352 --> 00:14:09,360
Well,

220
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,100
where will you go

221
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,160
after leaving Lvchuan?

222
00:14:15,392 --> 00:14:16,448
I haven't decided yet.

223
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,720
I still remember that big tree
that you took me to see before.

224
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,520
I like such views very much.

225
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,420
Backing onto the mountain and facing the sea.

226
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:26,320
If we could build a row of wooden houses there,

227
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,640
it would be great to open a guesthouse.

228
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,920
Didn't I tell you before?

229
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,680
I thought you were joking.

230
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,880
I never joke about things with you.

231
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,216
Mengnan,

232
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,720
would you like to come with me?

233
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,280
Actually,

234
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,400
I quite envy you.

235
00:15:24,224 --> 00:15:25,320
Why do you say that?

236
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,800
You can choose to live the life you want.

237
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,040
You are truly brave.

238
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,720
May we both be brave. Cheers.

239
00:15:36,896 --> 00:15:37,984
Cheers.

240
00:15:40,256 --> 00:15:41,440
Thank you.

241
00:15:49,952 --> 00:15:51,104
Where are you going?

242
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,024
Surprise.

243
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:59,340
Hello, can I sing a song?

244
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:01,840
No problem, come with me.

245
00:16:09,088 --> 00:16:10,112
Okay.

246
00:16:14,496 --> 00:16:15,560
Excuse me, everyone.

247
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,720
I want to dedicate a song

248
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,040
to a girl here.

249
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,520
A very special girl

250
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,160
to me.

251
00:16:26,304 --> 00:16:27,360
May I?

252
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,560
Okay.

253
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,240
Bravo! Bravo!

254
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,440

Thank you, everybody.
Thank you, everybody. Thank you.

278
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,000
Look, how interesting.

279
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,312
Dinner's ready.

280
00:18:29,312 --> 00:18:30,440
Go, let's eat.

281
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,488
Dinner time.

282
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,000
Dad, did you cook today's meal?

283
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,040
Yes.

284
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,640
Careful.

285
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,440
From today until this time next year,

286
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,120
I'll take care of all the meals at home.

287
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,680
But I want to eat mom's cooking.

288
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,200
Isn't my cooking tastier?

289
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,040
Your mom is now our family's
key protected member.

290
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,400
We can't let her get tired.

291
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,280
What's wrong with mom?

292
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,840
Feifei, your mom is pregnant.

293
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,180
Soon, you'll have a younger brother or sister.

294
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,216
Are you happy?

295
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,520
Everything is normal.

296
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:13,080
No progress at all.

297
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,340
This is a marathon.

298
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:18,460
We just started, so don't worry.

299
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:21,800
Right now, I'm quite envious of Mrs. Ge.

300
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,840
As age catches up,

301
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:27,600
having someone like Mr. Jiang,

302
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,400
who is gentle and considerate,
as a companion in old age,

303
00:19:31,072 --> 00:19:32,224
it's really nice.

304
00:19:32,224 --> 00:19:33,312
Really nice.

305
00:19:33,312 --> 00:19:34,600
You have one too.

306
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,880
Me? I don't have one.

307
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,328
Mr. Chen.

308
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,240
What are you holding?

309
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,016
For me?

310
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,616
Thank you.

311
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,720
I…

312
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,040
I bought you some snacks.

313
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,360
Caring too much for no reason.

314
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,280
So, are you asking for a favor from me?

315
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,560
Don't be so cynical about people.

316
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,720
I usually prepare these snacks.

317
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,560
Also…

318
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,408
Also…

319
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,360
Also, you are not afraid of gaining weight.

320
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,440
You!

321
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:22,280
Oh my God, it's too sweet.

322
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,000
You're still envious of others.

323
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,920
I'm envious of you.

324
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,120
I don't mind gaining weight.

325
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,280
I never thought

326
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,680
usually, he prepared your snacks.

327
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,696
No.

328
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,400
It's so sweet, it sticks to the teeth.

329
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,080
No wonder he's been exercising
and such for no reason.

330
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,880
Because he wants to become stronger
to protect you.

331
00:20:43,808 --> 00:20:44,840
Absolutely not.

332
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,680
If he can persist,

333
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,160
I would write my surname backwards.

334
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,000
Writing your surname backwards
is still the same character.

335
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,400
Let me look at your expression.

336
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,080
Why are you staring at me?

337
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,480
Think about your own business.

338
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,460
What's my business?

339
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:08,140
It's about you and Shen Mi.

340
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:09,520
Your thing.

341
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:11,960
Did you notice

342
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,980
since you and Shen Mi
have been living together,

343
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:16,700
he really has changed a lot?

344
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,000
No.

345
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,440
How can you say no?

346
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,480
He used to be just like an ice lolly.

347
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:24,760
Now in dealing with people,
he is much more kind.

348
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,680
This is the change.

349
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,160
Well, he is a little kinder.

350
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,520
I'm reading through several articles.

351
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,600
Pushed.

352
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,480
How can you tell
if he's secretly in love with you?

353
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,480
The first one is,

354
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,400
most changes in a man's behavior

355
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,960
99% of the time are because he

356
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,760
already has the woman of his dreams.

357
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,880
You'd be the one to read
such senseless articles.

358
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,088
I wouldn't read those love-addled ones.

359
00:21:53,088 --> 00:21:54,340
I'm leaving.

360
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:55,680
These are mine.

361
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:58,000
I'll hog some first.

362
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,320
Besides, Old Tian,

363
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,040
could you also send me the link?

364
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:07,120
No, I want to critique it well,

365
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,080
the person who wrote this senseless love piece.

366
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:23,840
Chen Yifan, aren't you annoying?

367
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,920
How did you buy so much stuff?

368
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,720
When I go to the supermarket
once every two weeks,

369
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,680
I won't buy this much.

370
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,440
Times have changed.

371
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,880
Your home hosts an extra

372
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,640
beautiful young girl now.

373
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,480
We have to double the daily expenses.

374
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,520
So silly.

375
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,200
Who are you calling silly?

376
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,320
I just eat a bit more.

377
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:10,120
Why is there a child sitting here so late?

378
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,200
Maybe his parents haven't come home yet.

379
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,700
Carlo, wait a moment.

380
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:27,400
After we put things away, I'll make you dinner.

381
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,960
<i>The article has been pushed to you.</i>

382
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,880
<i>Check them one by one.</i>

383
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,040
<i>If every one hits the mark,</i>

384
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:44,760
<i>I advise you two to get married on the spot.</i>

385
00:23:48,256 --> 00:23:49,312
Why are you laughing?

386
00:23:49,312 --> 00:23:50,820
Nothing.

387
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:51,960
Do you have something to do?

388
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,160
What could I have to do?

389
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,560
<i>Fake solemnity.</i>

390
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,600
<i>I need to test you thoroughly.</i>

391
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,920
What are you looking at?

392
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:58,920
Nothing, nothing.

393
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,240
Something was posted in the group.

394
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,240
Quickly put them into the refrigerator.

395
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,560
Carlo, dinner's ready.

396
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,296
Eat slowly.

397
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,560
Eat slowly.

398
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,320
<i>The second rule of secret love.</i>

399
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:27,160
<i>He always watches your every move</i>

400
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,080
<i>from where you can't see him</i>

401
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,560
<i>and help you to avoid danger in time,</i>

402
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,720
<i>silently protecting you.</i>

403
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,720
Is your hand okay?

404
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,272
I'm fine.

405
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,280
What could happen to me?

406
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,600
<i>Ouch, it hurts so much.</i>

407
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,680
<i>You passed this one.</i>

408
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,920
<i>The third rule of secret love.</i>

409
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:51,560
<i>When you compliment other women,
he won't follow your words.</i>

410
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,960
<i>But when you compliment other men,</i>

411
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,360
<i>he will refute immediately, even defame.</i>

412
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,640
<i>He is slightly angry,
but doesn't want to be noticed.</i>

413
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,920
I haven't seen Miss Han coming to you recently.

414
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,560
What's wrong? You miss her?

415
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,560
I can set up a date for you.

416
00:25:08,384 --> 00:25:09,720
Not that.

417
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,580
I just purely think

418
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:14,520
Miss Han has high education
and a great demeanor.

419
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,920
As a girl, I really admire her.

420
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,320
<i>Pretending to drink water, right?</i>

421
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,560
<i>Such a good actor.</i>

422
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,480
The incident with Dafu last time

423
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,040
thanks to Dr. Shen.

424
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:36,240
You see, if he hadn't
thought of a trick in time

425
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,400
to distract Aunt Ge,

426
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,320
the trouble wouldn't
have been resolved so smoothly.

427
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,920
Just a cunning trick.

428
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,880
I also think it was a cunning trick.

429
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,180
But my mom is a funny person.

430
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:49,000
He only visited our home once.

431
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
My mom actually likes him a lot.

432
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,080
She would casually say to me,

433
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,560
"Look, he can cook,

434
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,560
has a sweet tongue and a careful heart.

435
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,720
He's got so many certificates.

436
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,440
How versatile! The more skills the better."

437
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:03,040
Haven't you ever heard of an old saying
"Jack of all trades, master of none"?

438
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,840
Firstly, a man needs to be stable

439
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,920
to give a woman a sense of security.

440
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,240
Since when did having a slick tongue
become a strength?

441
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,380
I really don't understand.

442
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:13,520
<i>So accurate.</i>

443
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,960
I can't argue with that.

444
00:26:22,752 --> 00:26:23,776
Carlo.

445
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,880
Carlo, you want to go out?

446
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,400
It's so late, don't go down.

447
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,120
It's too late, stop it, okay?

448
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,540
It's really too late.

449
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:43,360
Can't walk you. Tomorrow, okay?

450
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,720
No, Carlo.

451
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,680
Carlo, you really want to go out?

452
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,880
I can't handle it.

453
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,880
Okay, okay, let's go, let's go.

454
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,480
Well,

455
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:10,760
can we not go right before the supermarket
is about to close next time?

456
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,240
Look at what Carlo is being held up as.

457
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,760
I'm sorry, Carlo.

458
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:19,000
The fish and meat are on sale at that time.

459
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,720
A lot cheaper than usual.

460
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,456
We don't care about that little money, okay?

461
00:27:23,456 --> 00:27:26,280
<i>We… Wait, he said "we".</i>

462
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,640
But we can't just splurge, right?

463
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,460
Don't worry, this is not wasteful spending.

464
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:34,320
Why is this kid still here?

465
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:43,120
Little friend, do you live here?

466
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,440
It's so late.

467
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,720
Are you not going home?

468
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,800
Are you lost?

469
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,440
Don't be scared, we are not bad people.

470
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,800
Will you tell me?

471
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,840
This doesn't look like hearing problems.

472
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,320
You go get his phone and call his parents.

473
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,360
Have his parents pick him up.

474
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,840
Where are you going while I'm talking to you?

475
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,360
Don't scare him.

476
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,040
Little boy,

477
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,360
the gentleman is not a bad person.

478
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,760
He's just worried about your safety.

479
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,056
How about this? You tell me
your family's phone number.

480
00:28:21,056 --> 00:28:22,160
I'll call them.

481
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,720
Let them pick you up, okay?

482
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,000
Or else

483
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,160
go home with the gentleman.

484
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,080
It's cold and not safe outside.

485
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,760
We'll make you something delicious, okay?

486
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,160
It's okay if you don't eat.

487
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,400
This is your pet, right?

488
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,260
It's hungry.

489
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:45,400
Shouldn't you feed it?

490
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,040
Looking at his dress style,

491
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,480
he doesn't look like a homeless child.

492
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,120
He should have run away from home.

493
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,720
We should take his phone by force.

494
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,520
You, an adult, snatching from a child.

495
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,880
It will scare him and leave childhood scars.

496
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:29,940
Childhood…

497
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:31,640
How old is this child?

498
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,160
He's almost taller than you.

499
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:35,760
When did you measure that?

500
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,960
I am much taller than him.

501
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,880
Extraordinary times,

502
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,080
extraordinary measures.

503
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,400
There's no other way.

504
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,400
I'll snatch it.

505
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:46,000
Don't, don't, I think
we still have to take it slow.

506
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,320
Gradually.

507
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:50,040
But we have been talking for so long.

508
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,600
He keeps looking back.

509
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,920
Why won't he respond?

510
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,200
No matter what the reason is now,

511
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,640
the main issue

512
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,720
is to find his parents.

513
00:29:59,712 --> 00:30:00,800
if it really doesn't work,

514
00:30:01,312 --> 00:30:02,400
I'll report this to the police.

515
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,360
I won't go to the police station.

516
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,660
So you can talk.

517
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:07,920
I won't go to the police station.

518
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,840
Okay, you don't have to go.

519
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,660
Then tell me where your parents are

520
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:15,440
and where's your home, okay?

521
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,448
I'm not going home, either.

522
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,960
What's wrong with you?

523
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,880
What time is it? It's so late.

524
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,760
Aren't your parents worried about you
if you don't go home?

525
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:26,040
What's your name, kid?

526
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,480
Miss, I need the bathroom.

527
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,080
The bathroom is inside.

528
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,400
Go inside and turn left.

529
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,240
Open the door.

530
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,660
What's the matter with you, kid?

531
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:43,296
Running around in someone else's house?

532
00:30:43,296 --> 00:30:44,400
I'm not opening the door.

533
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,760
Kid, could you please open the door?
Open it and talk.

534
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,920
I'm not going to the police station.
I'm not going home, either.

535
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,040
I'm not going anywhere.

536
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,280
Alright, alright, that's enough, Carlo.

537
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,480
There's no rush. Let me handle this.

538
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,480
You don't need to worry about this, just go.

539
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:14,380
Let me tell you, I'm taking the keys
and opening the door right now.

540
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:16,980
Just you wait, I'll take you straight
to the police station.

541
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:18,432
Or should we try again?

542
00:31:18,432 --> 00:31:19,520
Try again?

543
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,640
He could run away from home.

544
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,640
He's already run away.

545
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,760
He must have his reasons.

546
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,040
If we forcibly take him back,

547
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,320
what if he runs away again?

548
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,400
If it really doesn't work,
we will carry him to the police station.

549
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,540
Alright then.

550
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:31,200
I think what you said makes sense.

551
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,360
Or else,

552
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,400
let's eat something first.

553
00:31:38,432 --> 00:31:39,760
I have a plan now.

554
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,360
What are you preparing to cook?

555
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,592
Banana pancakes.

556
00:31:54,592 --> 00:31:55,760
Sweets.

557
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,280
Definitely. All kids like sweets, don't they?

558
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,280
Wave it under his nose.

559
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,320
Get him to crave it so that he will come out.

560
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,600
But if he doesn't crave it,

561
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,520
to tell the truth, I may just
have to find the keys then.

562
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,720
You're pretty good at this.

563
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,640
Not too bad. Well,

564
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,360
not worse than Shen Chen, am I?

565
00:32:24,352 --> 00:32:25,696
You men are really funny.

566
00:32:25,696 --> 00:32:26,720
How about this?

567
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,760
Someday at Tianlin Hospital,

568
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,120
let's organize a cooking contest for you.

569
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,000
You can have a competition
and see who is better.

570
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,280
I don't have the time for that.

571
00:32:46,432 --> 00:32:48,224
<i>The fourth rule of secret love.</i>

572
00:32:48,224 --> 00:32:50,680
<i>He is willing to cook for you.</i>

573
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:52,960
Carlo, let's go.

574
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:09,200
Kid, you're probably hungry, aren't you?

575
00:33:09,856 --> 00:33:11,808
The gentleman and I made you
something good to eat.

576
00:33:11,808 --> 00:33:13,280
Would you like to come out and eat some?

577
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,464
I'm not hungry.

578
00:33:14,464 --> 00:33:16,480
Your kitten was eating so well just now.

579
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,720
You must be hungry, too.

580
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,040
Let me tell you,

581
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,720
I advise you to give up resistance now.

582
00:33:23,552 --> 00:33:25,568
Isn't it okay to come out and have a good meal?

583
00:33:25,568 --> 00:33:27,280
You can feel a little better.

584
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:29,360
And don't make me so angry, okay?

585
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,432
Even if I'm hungry, I won't eat.

586
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,360
You both definitely want to trick me out.

587
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,600
Then take me to the police station.

588
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,640
We didn't lie to you.

589
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,440
We absolutely will not
take you to the police station.

590
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,320
I won't, under circumstances you're unwilling,

591
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:45,400
call your parents, okay?

592
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,640
I don't believe. What if you cheat?

593
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,744
If we cheat you,

594
00:33:51,744 --> 00:33:53,760
just let the gentleman's house
explode in place.

595
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:56,160
- Leaving us nowhere to live.
<i>- Explode in place.</i>

596
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:58,640
<i>Why are you looking at me?
Am I not coaxing a child?</i>

597
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,440
<i>Woman, what are you swearing at?</i>

598
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,120
Are you full?

599
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:41,840
You are not full. Just say it.

600
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,120
It's not like we won't feed you.

601
00:34:43,936 --> 00:34:44,960
Eat up.

602
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:46,880
Thank you, uncle.

603
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,679
Don't. Don't.

604
00:34:51,456 --> 00:34:52,840
Kid,

605
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:55,239
you haven't told me what your name is.

606
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:01,800
I'm asking you a question.

607
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:03,552
What's wrong?

608
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:07,080
Your parents won't let you tell strangers
about your family situation?

609
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,880
Your parents are right.

610
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,920
But we are not strangers.

611
00:35:15,744 --> 00:35:16,768
Look,

612
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,840
we have known each other for so long.

613
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:22,280
By now, we definitely can't
be considered strangers.

614
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,920
Miss, my name is Feifei.

615
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,260
Feifei,

616
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:33,280
where do you live?

617
00:35:34,208 --> 00:35:35,328
I'm full.

618
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,000
What's wrong with you?
We're talking to you. Why are you…?

619
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,600
Breaking through psychological defenses
is not so easy.

620
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,840
We have to take it slow.

621
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,800
Okay, your turn.

622
00:36:01,184 --> 00:36:02,420
Feifei,

623
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:04,600
playing the game alone is not fun.

624
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,240
Let's three play together.

625
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:10,260
One phone, three people, how to play?

626
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:12,920
Who told you we have to play mobile games?

627
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,760
Why you're not throwing quickly?

628
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,960
Why are you in such a hurry?
Just roll a five directly.

629
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,360
Kill you in seconds.

630
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,840
Oh my god, that's miraculous!

631
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,280
See, it's just that miraculous!

632
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,440
No need to play, one, two, three, four, five.

633
00:36:38,176 --> 00:36:39,200
No need to play.

634
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:41,000
Well,

635
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,400
I don't believe it, let's play another round.

636
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,040
Miss,

637
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,976
you've already lost ten rounds.

638
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:48,120
It's not my problem.

639
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,520
It's a problem of my luck.

640
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,104
This flying chess game depends on luck.

641
00:36:51,104 --> 00:36:52,200
He's just lucky.

642
00:36:53,728 --> 00:36:55,776
Flying chess not only involves luck.

643
00:36:55,776 --> 00:36:57,280
It also requires strategy.

644
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,980
There's even strategy?

645
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:01,320
Luck is just a part of strength.

646
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,440
You're really not suited to this game.

647
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,480
When did you two become a team?

648
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,500
Okay, I'm not suited for this game, right?

649
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:14,200
But I'm good at another game.

650
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:16,640
Why don't we compete in dancing?

651
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:17,728
How do we compete?

652
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,080
Don't we have any normal dances?

653
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,720
Do we have to do this?

654
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:26,960
Wait, you both have a star.

655
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,480
Why don't I have one?

656
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,200
You didn't even dance.

657
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,680
But, I was dancing.

658
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,880
The uncle ruined our rhythm.

659
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,640
Who are you calling uncle?

660
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,020
Then are you admitting defeat?

661
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:43,380
I admit defeat.

662
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:45,780
As an uncle, I definitely admit defeat.

663
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:46,820
Now,

664
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:49,520
we invite the two of you
for a championship match, okay?

665
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,760
I will play the music for you guys.

666
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,920
You two, are you alright
with a championship duel?

667
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,080
- Okay.
- Come on.

668
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,540
Are you ready?

669
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:58,592
Let's do this.

670
00:38:15,488 --> 00:38:17,632
Feifei, what's wrong?

671
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,920
This dance is easy to dance.

672
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,200
The song is also nice.

673
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:28,940
When I was little,

674
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:30,480
my mom used to sing this song for me.

675
00:38:38,624 --> 00:38:40,880
Are you missing your mom?

676
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:41,952
No.

677
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,000
<i>Feifei, you are about to be late,
you are about to be late.</i>

678
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,540
<i>Come on, come on, hurry, hurry. Come on.</i>

679
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:54,080
<i>Dad is here to pick you up after school.</i>

680
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,400
<i>What happened?</i>

681
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,960
<i>Dad, I forgot my backpack.</i>

682
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,480
<i>Don't you carry it yourself?</i>

683
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,840
<i>No, mom usually helps me with it.</i>

684
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:06,016
<i>What can I do? All my books are in the bag.</i>

685
00:39:06,016 --> 00:39:07,160
<i>How am I going to attend class?</i>

686
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:08,440
<i>Feifei, in that case,</i>

687
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,600
<i>you go to class first for today.</i>

688
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,800
<i>I'm going to be late.</i>

689
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,660
<i>I will call your teacher later to explain.</i>

690
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:15,168
<i>Go, hurry up, hurry up. Go to class.</i>

691
00:39:15,168 --> 00:39:16,240
<i>Be good in class.</i>

692
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,560
<i>Dad, Daddy.</i>

693
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:22,000
- <i>♪ Twinkle, twinkle, little star ♪</i>
- <i>Mom, Mom.</i>

694
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,360
<i>Can you play with me for a while?</i>

695
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,640
<i>Feifei, you play with your phone for a while.</i>

696
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,320
<i>Mom is giving prenatal education to the baby.</i>

697
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:32,440
<i>♪ Twinkle, twinkle, little star ♪</i>

698
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:35,880
- <i>♪ It fills up the whole sky ♪</i>
- <i>Mummy,</i>

699
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:38,380
<i>isn't this the song you sang to me
when I was little?</i>

700
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:41,080
<i>Yes, now Mom has to sing it
for the little baby.</i>

701
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,800
<i>Daddy, I have finished my homework.</i>

702
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,240
<i>Can you take me to play basketball?</i>

703
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:53,380
<i>Daddy has to buy wonton for Mommy.</i>

704
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:55,240
<i>Play with Blue, good boy.</i>

705
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:56,800
<i>But you promised me.</i>

706
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:01,800
<i>Feifei, Mom vomited out all the dinner she ate.</i>

707
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,040
<i>If she doesn't eat anything,</i>

708
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:06,040
<i>how is the baby in her womb
going to get the nutrition?</i>

709
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:08,760
<i>It will then be born skinny and tiny, won't it?</i>

710
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,900
<i>You can watch TV
or play on your phone for a while.</i>

711
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:14,560
<i>But whatever you do, don't disturb Mom.</i>

712
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:15,680
<i>She just fell asleep.</i>

713
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,472
<i>Be good.</i>

714
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:29,640
<i>Blue, it's just us two left again.</i>

715
00:40:31,104 --> 00:40:32,160
<i>Goodbye.</i>

716
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,472
<i>Goodbye.</i>

717
00:40:33,472 --> 00:40:36,280
<i>Feifei, who is picking you up today?</i>

718
00:40:37,792 --> 00:40:38,840
<i>Don't worry.</i>

719
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,880
<i>I guess your parents will be here soon.</i>

720
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,080
<i>Your dad is calling.</i>

721
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:47,800
<i>Feifei's father,</i>

722
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,960
<i>who of you is picking up Feifei today?</i>

723
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:54,600
<i>Okay, then I will talk to him, okay.</i>

724
00:40:55,424 --> 00:40:56,600
<i>Feifei,</i>

725
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:59,180
<i>your dad is taking your mom
to the hospital for a checkup.</i>

726
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:00,640
<i>It might be a bit late.</i>

727
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:01,920
<i>Let's go back to class first.</i>

728
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:12,720
<i>♪ Twinkle, twinkle, little star ♪</i>

729
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,740
- <i>Feifei, you take Blue out first.</i>
- <i>♪ It fills up the whole sky ♪</i>

730
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:17,200
<i>I have something to say to Mom.</i>

731
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:19,840
<i>Go out quickly.</i>

732
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,100
<i>This second one really gives you a hard time.</i>

733
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:30,000
<i>It's tougher than when you
were carrying our first.</i>

734
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:32,720
<i>Let me check your ringworm.</i>

735
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,600
<i>Progressively itchier.</i>

736
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:39,920
<i>It's been a few days,
why is it still like this?</i>

737
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,760
<i>Yes, being pregnant,</i>

738
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,180
<i>I dare not apply any medication.</i>

739
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:44,580
<i>What should I do?</i>

740
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:45,960
<i>Let me show you a photo.</i>

741
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,160
<i>Do you think it looks like this?</i>

742
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,408
<i>It does.</i>

743
00:41:53,408 --> 00:41:54,480
<i>My God.</i>

744
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,480
<i>What is this?</i>

745
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:59,260
<i>Ringworm from a cat.</i>

746
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:00,680
<i>What should we do about this?</i>

747
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:01,760
<i>Calm yourself first.</i>

748
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:06,520
<i>A few days ago, I asked my colleagues
who have cats.</i>

749
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:08,600
<i>When their wives were pregnant,</i>

750
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:09,900
<i>they all sent their cats away.</i>

751
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:11,760
<i>Saying they were afraid of getting infected.</i>

752
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:15,920
<i>If it's not a miscarriage,
it will be a malformed fetus.</i>

753
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,280
<i>Is it that serious?</i>

754
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,420
<i>What should we do?</i>

755
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:22,960
<i>Why don't we send Blue away first?</i>

756
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:25,680
<i>No, no.</i>

757
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:29,180
<i>Blue grew up with Feifei.</i>

758
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:30,680
<i>Feifei will definitely not want to let it go.</i>

759
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:32,160
<i>What can we do then?</i>

760
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:34,480
<i>- No, no.
- Now, the baby in your womb is most important.</i>

761
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:37,000
<i>He will definitely understand us in the future.</i>

762
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:48,000
Feifei, how nice would it be
to have another child at home.

763
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,280
He can play with you.

764
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:50,680
You won't feel lonely then.

765
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:52,680
Not good, not good at all.

766
00:43:20,244 --> 00:43:23,764
<i>♫ Your gaze is unwavering ♫</i>

767
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:30,324
<i>♫ Only enough to accommodate me ♫</i>

768
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:36,212
<i>♫ I have been melted by you countless times ♫</i>

769

774
00:44:07,316 --> 00:44:10,516
<i>♫ Leaving no trace ♫</i>

775
00:44:10,516 --> 00:44:14,548
