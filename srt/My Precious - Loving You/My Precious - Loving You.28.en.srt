1
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:02,188
it's her

2
00:02:03,089 --> 00:02:04,457
Why don't we just blow her away?

3
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:07,760
treat customers

4
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,063
Have enough patience and sincerity

5
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:13,166
Go and get busy

6
00:02:18,838 --> 00:02:20,173
Tang Yuan is so cute

7
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:21,841
a while

8
00:02:22,175 --> 00:02:24,144
Let the doctor give you a good look

9
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:26,613
The fever will go away after just one injection.

10
00:02:29,182 --> 00:02:30,483
hello madam

11
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:34,220
Who are you

12
00:02:34,721 --> 00:02:36,322
I am the director of this hospital

13
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:37,690
Dr. Xiaoxian just now

14
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:38,525
Already put your case

15
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:39,526
Explained to me

16
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:41,494
What about us?

17
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:42,629
We also developed a set for it

18
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:44,130
Detailed treatment plan

19
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:45,965
Just

20
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,202
Is the situation of glutinous rice balls very bad?

21
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:51,938
Is it still possible to save it?

22
00:02:52,972 --> 00:02:53,706
it

23
00:02:53,706 --> 00:02:55,508
Isn't it just a fever?

24
00:02:55,942 --> 00:02:57,443
Why can't we be saved?

25
00:02:57,944 --> 00:02:58,978
How could it be?

26
00:02:58,978 --> 00:02:59,646
Miss

27
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:01,347
Don't get excited

28
00:03:01,581 --> 00:03:03,183
its condition is very good

29
00:03:03,616 --> 00:03:04,717
It's just our hospital

30
00:03:04,717 --> 00:03:05,919
There is no medicine now

31
00:03:06,653 --> 00:03:07,453
No more medicine

32
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:08,855
What should I do?

33
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:11,124
i know a place

34
00:03:11,424 --> 00:03:12,358
There must be medicine

35
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:13,493
real

36
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:17,263
Deficiency of spleen and stomach

37
00:03:19,465 --> 00:03:21,267
Kidney yang deficiency

38
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:24,037
Come in

39
00:03:25,104 --> 00:03:26,105
Doctor Chen

40
00:03:26,105 --> 00:03:26,839
Come on

41
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,241
Wait a minute

42
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:29,976
No, Dr. Chen, it's urgent.

43
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:31,945
Hurry up

44
00:03:37,483 --> 00:03:38,851
Why are you so nervous?

45
00:03:38,851 --> 00:03:39,652
What's the disease?

46
00:03:40,853 --> 00:03:41,988
It's hard to say

47
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:43,489
Is it a dog or a cat?

48
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:45,625
It's hard to say

49
00:03:45,925 --> 00:03:47,493
Anyway, you’ll know after seeing it

50
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:53,466
Why hasn't the doctor come yet?

51
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:54,867
When will he arrive?

52
00:03:54,867 --> 00:03:55,468
Hello

53
00:03:55,868 --> 00:03:56,736
I am the doctor

54
00:03:58,171 --> 00:03:59,239
The doctor is here

55
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,039
Where is the patient?

56
00:04:08,047 --> 00:04:08,681
you

57
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:12,085
It's not me, it's it

58
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:14,387
It's called glutinous rice balls

59
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:17,824
The doctor is here

60
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:19,292
Tang Yuan is saved

61
00:04:20,159 --> 00:04:21,961
Glutinous rice balls, be good

62
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:25,465
Keep it up, it'll be fine soon

63
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:29,669
glutinous rice balls hello

64
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:35,341
Good glutinous rice balls

65
00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:40,179
OK OK

66
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:45,251
Aunt

67
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:46,452
what do you mean

68
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:48,054
There is no more medicine at Xichong

69
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:48,788
Only then did you

70
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:50,123
Recommended to us

71
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:52,058
Yes

72
00:04:52,058 --> 00:04:53,526
I knew it was those guys again

73
00:04:53,526 --> 00:04:54,661
Let me talk to them.

74
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:56,296
what to do

75
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:01,601
What are you doing?

76
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:03,102
Solve the immediate matter first

77
00:05:03,102 --> 00:05:04,804
Don't make trouble any more

78
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:06,005
how to solve

79
00:05:06,005 --> 00:05:06,806
It's already like this

80
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:08,574
This needs to be sent to a mental hospital.

81
00:05:09,609 --> 00:05:10,777
Tangyuan means you have a fever

82
00:05:10,777 --> 00:05:11,844
It's not like I'm out of my mind

83
00:05:11,844 --> 00:05:13,279
Why send to a mental hospital

84
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:13,846
no no no

85
00:05:13,846 --> 00:05:15,148
Auntie, I didn't mean that

86
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,416
I'm not talking about that

87
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:17,650
I said her

88
00:05:17,917 --> 00:05:18,785
If you don't obey me again

89
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:20,086
I'll send you to a mental hospital

90
00:05:20,586 --> 00:05:21,220
What's wrong

91
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:23,289
OK

92
00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:23,890
good

93
00:05:24,557 --> 00:05:26,092
Lao Chen, please stop saying a few words.

94
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:28,061
Our top priority now

95
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:29,629
It is to find out the cause of glutinous rice balls

96
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:30,863
further inspection

97
00:05:36,402 --> 00:05:37,837
It's really hot

98
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:42,108
right

99
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:43,776
Its forehead is weirdly hot

100
00:05:46,045 --> 00:05:46,646
girl

101
00:05:47,246 --> 00:05:48,681
You touched the wrong one

102
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:49,949
This dumpling butt

103
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:55,888
Aunt

104
00:05:56,923 --> 00:05:58,324
What they both tested just now was

105
00:05:58,324 --> 00:05:59,058
Rectal temperature

106
00:05:59,058 --> 00:05:59,759
That's right

107
00:06:00,893 --> 00:06:01,694
Rectal temperature

108
00:06:02,428 --> 00:06:03,162
That's good

109
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:04,597
thank you doctor

110
00:06:04,897 --> 00:06:05,965
thank you doctor

111
00:06:05,965 --> 00:06:06,766
Otherwise

112
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:07,333
Xiao Wen

113
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:07,967
Make it first

114
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:09,168
Routine blood tests

115
00:06:09,168 --> 00:06:10,370
If it weren't so small

116
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,838
Just take an anti-inflammatory shot first and see.

117
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:13,539
good

118
00:06:14,774 --> 00:06:15,375
girl

119
00:06:15,608 --> 00:06:17,043
What are you doing?

120
00:06:17,276 --> 00:06:17,877
I

121
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:20,580
I took Tangyuan to check.

122
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,081
Take a blood test and test it

123
00:06:22,081 --> 00:06:23,416
It's easy to prescribe the right medicine.

124
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:24,817
You just hold it like this

125
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:26,819
It's so sick now

126
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:28,688
You're not allowed to push a cart or anything like that.

127
00:06:28,688 --> 00:06:29,922
Send it over?

128
00:06:31,157 --> 00:06:31,958
aunt aunt

129
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:33,059
push push push

130
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:33,860
Must push

131
00:06:37,363 --> 00:06:38,164
Come aunty

132
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:41,200
Auntie, the car is here

133
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:42,668
Is this okay, aunt?

134
00:06:43,836 --> 00:06:44,637
so cold

135
00:06:44,637 --> 00:06:45,838
The glutinous rice balls will be frozen

136
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:49,509
Aunt

137
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:50,743
We have cushions

138
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:52,245
It won't get cold if you put it on

139
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:53,279
good

140
00:06:55,648 --> 00:06:56,816
Is this okay, aunt?

141
00:06:57,483 --> 00:06:58,818
Don't fall down

142
00:06:58,818 --> 00:06:59,218
Do not worry

143
00:06:59,218 --> 00:07:00,219
No, no

144
00:07:00,787 --> 00:07:02,622
Then we took it for a checkup.

145
00:07:03,656 --> 00:07:04,490
Do not worry

146
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:04,957
good

147
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,293
You two push slowly and be careful.

148
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:08,461
Slow down

149
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:10,096
Don't knock it down

150
00:07:12,064 --> 00:07:12,965
She is sick

151
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:14,000
Or are we sick?

152
00:07:17,403 --> 00:07:18,237
big liar

153
00:07:19,138 --> 00:07:20,039
what are you doing

154
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:22,141
This is how a harmonious society saves you

155
00:07:22,141 --> 00:07:23,643
I want to strangle you to death now

156
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:24,944
Why did you follow me in the first place?

157
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:26,546
Promise without hesitation

158
00:07:26,546 --> 00:07:27,847
during cohabitation

159
00:07:27,847 --> 00:07:28,848
I won’t talk to Tian Tian

160
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:29,582
How is it?

161
00:07:29,582 --> 00:07:31,284
You are all dating now

162
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:33,586
I'm going to tell grandpa now

163
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:34,387
She is not at all

164
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:35,721
What kind of heart doctor?

165
00:07:35,721 --> 00:07:36,622
You are useless

166
00:07:36,989 --> 00:07:37,623
Wait a moment

167
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:38,291
what to do

168
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,459
Didn’t you also lie to her?

169
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:40,526
How did I lie to her?

170
00:07:40,526 --> 00:07:41,060
You tell her

171
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,495
What is your family's business?

172
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:43,696
do small business

173
00:07:43,696 --> 00:07:44,497
lonely lonely

174
00:07:44,497 --> 00:07:46,199
lack of family warmth

175
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:47,400
Are you kidding me?

176
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,768
If you let Tian Tian know

177
00:07:48,768 --> 00:07:49,936
you are not only my brother

178
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:51,103
You still like your pet

179
00:07:51,103 --> 00:07:52,405
The son of the boss behind the scenes

180
00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:53,573
What do you think she will think

181
00:07:57,743 --> 00:07:58,478
Don't think

182
00:07:58,478 --> 00:07:59,779
If you say so, I will

183
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:01,848
I'll tell grandpa later

184
00:08:01,848 --> 00:08:02,615
But I and her

185
00:08:02,615 --> 00:08:03,282
There is no future

186
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:04,851
I have no future with you

187
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:05,485
big liar

188
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:06,719
Wait a moment Wait a moment

189
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:07,987
what to do

190
00:08:08,287 --> 00:08:09,388
We two are very innocent

191
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:10,690
What's the meaning

192
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:11,624
We didn't date

193
00:08:11,624 --> 00:08:12,959
we are not together

194
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:17,330
If that's the case

195
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,265
You will still be my good brother

196
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:23,202
We still have a future

197
00:08:25,771 --> 00:08:26,439
You

198
00:08:27,573 --> 00:08:28,908
But I'll keep an eye on you

199
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:36,449
Dean

200
00:08:36,449 --> 00:08:37,517
The test results are out

201
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:38,384
Take a look

202
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:44,857
Doctor

203
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,026
What kind of disease does Tangyuan have?

204
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:49,128
I took a preliminary look

205
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:50,730
It shouldn't be tiny

206
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:51,964
Like cat plague

207
00:08:51,964 --> 00:08:53,900
So give it a fever-reducing shot

208
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:54,934
It should be fine

209
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:57,003
good

210
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:00,006
Not afraid

211
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:01,340
Don’t be afraid of glutinous rice balls

212
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:03,409
Just one injection and you'll be fine

213
00:09:05,177 --> 00:09:06,646
Come and disinfect first

214
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:18,024
Tangyuan, bear with the pain.

215
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:25,765
Okay, it doesn't hurt

216
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:27,600
So cute glutinous rice balls

217
00:09:29,602 --> 00:09:30,636
It's okay

218
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:32,305
Aunt

219
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:34,040
Why don't you let Tangyuan stay in the hospital?

220
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,141
Observe for a few more days

221
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:36,409
Let Xiao Wen take care of it

222
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:39,579
Auntie, don't worry

223
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,147
Tangyuan will be fine soon

224
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,282
Could you please take a step to talk to me?

225
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:49,121
Come aunty

226
00:09:49,121 --> 00:09:50,122
You drink some water

227
00:09:50,122 --> 00:09:52,258
Aunt drink water

228
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:53,693
Thank you

229
00:09:59,665 --> 00:10:00,800
who are you

230
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:06,038
Aunt

231
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:07,373
I am Dr. Oda

232
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:08,341
Do you remember?

233
00:10:08,808 --> 00:10:09,775
Dr. Tian

234
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:11,477
This is a hospital

235
00:10:12,979 --> 00:10:13,613
Right aunt

236
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,581
This is our pet hospital

237
00:10:15,581 --> 00:10:17,249
You bring your pet to see a doctor

238
00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:19,085
pet hospital

239
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:19,385
pet hospital

240
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:21,120
did you forget

241
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:23,089
sweet dumpling

242
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,026
By the way, Tangyuan is sick.

243
00:10:27,493 --> 00:10:29,061
It's got a fever, it's infected

244
00:10:29,061 --> 00:10:29,495
no

245
00:10:29,495 --> 00:10:30,429
it's dying

246
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:31,197
aunt aunt

247
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:32,098
Tangyuan has a fever

248
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:33,265
But I cured it

249
00:10:33,265 --> 00:10:34,000
gave it an injection

250
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,735
The fever is gone now and I'm fine

251
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:37,803
Return

252
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:40,606

00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:01,727
two hundred

266
00:11:01,727 --> 00:11:03,029
Auntie, you really don’t need it.

267
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:03,963
Auntie, forget it

268
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:04,730
four hundred

269
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:05,531
This money is really not enough

270
00:11:05,531 --> 00:11:06,499
six hundred

271
00:11:09,135 --> 00:11:09,568

Excuse me

279
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:29,321
I'm causing trouble for you

280
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:30,456
It's okay, it should be

281
00:11:31,223 --> 00:11:31,924
one hundred

282
00:11:33,225 --> 00:11:33,559

287
00:11:39,498 --> 00:11:40,366
Finished soon

289
00:11:41,967 --> 00:11:42,968

291
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:45,204
Mom

Let's go back

293
00:11:46,772 --> 00:11:48,340
There are still a lot of things to do at work. Let’s go.

294
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:49,942
Small blog

295
00:11:49,942 --> 00:11:51,243
when did you come

296
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:54,013
I just arrived. I will take you home.

297
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:55,147
drive me home

298
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:55,781
Let's go

299
00:11:56,982 --> 00:11:58,584
Tangyuan Where did the glutinous rice balls go?

300
00:11:58,584 --> 00:11:58,884
No aunt

301
00:11:58,884 --> 00:11:59,618
Where did the glutinous rice balls go?

302
00:11:59,618 --> 00:12:00,853
You bring glutinous rice balls to see a doctor

303
00:12:00,853 --> 00:12:01,821
i cured it

304
00:12:01,854 --> 00:12:02,288
Now you can

305
00:12:02,288 --> 00:12:03,622
took it home

306
00:12:03,622 --> 00:12:04,657
Yes, cured

307
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:05,624
Cured

308
00:12:06,692 --> 00:12:08,060
good good good

309
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:11,997
doctor

310
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:14,066
This has caused you a lot of trouble

311
00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:14,667
Look

312
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:15,935
How to calculate this consultation fee?

313
00:12:15,968 --> 00:12:16,535
Need not

314
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:17,970
No more consultation fees

315
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:19,305
There is no need for consultation fee

316
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:22,308
As long as the disease is cured, right?

317
00:12:22,341 --> 00:12:22,808
right

318
00:12:24,276 --> 00:12:24,977
thanks thanks

319
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:26,078
It'll be fine if you're not sick

320
00:12:27,012 --> 00:12:27,947
Mom, let's go

321
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:29,281
let's go

322
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:31,650
Thank you

323
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:32,184
I'll send you

324
00:12:32,218 --> 00:12:32,718
Right

325
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,822
You are not allowed to write anything for glutinous rice balls

326
00:12:36,822 --> 00:12:38,023
Medical records?

327
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:38,290
No

328
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:39,959
What medical records should be written? No need

329
00:12:40,826 --> 00:12:41,460
Right, right

330
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:43,295
You see, my mind is so busy that I forget

331
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:45,197
I'll write the medical records right away.

332
00:12:46,398 --> 00:12:47,399
I forgot

333
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:48,400
Look at my brain

334
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,476
sweet dumpling

335
00:13:00,813 --> 00:13:01,814
pet type

336
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:04,617
pet type

337
00:13:07,486 --> 00:13:09,321
Why don't you write?

338
00:13:11,657 --> 00:13:12,825
cat or dog

339
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:13,559
cat

340
00:13:15,227 --> 00:13:16,862
Cat, it must be a cat

341
00:13:16,862 --> 00:13:18,330
Right, aunt, are you talking about this person?

342
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,501
gender

343
00:13:26,172 --> 00:13:27,773
This cat is male

344
00:13:27,773 --> 00:13:29,008
Still a mother

345
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:30,843
mother

346
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:31,944
male

347
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:33,646
How come you, the father and the mother, are separated from each other?

348
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:34,814
Can't tell the difference

349
00:13:35,247 --> 00:13:36,816
Tangyuan has just had a vasectomy.

350
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:37,917
Of course it's male

351
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:40,052
Yes, it must be male

352
00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:41,020
It's male, right

353
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:46,325
I'll take a call

354
00:13:48,093 --> 00:13:49,261
knew

355
00:13:49,261 --> 00:13:50,696
Can you help me deal with it?

356
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:53,332
Okay, I'll go back when I'm done here.

357
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:54,466
know know

358
00:13:54,466 --> 00:13:55,134
Hang up

359
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:58,504
Mom let's go home

360
00:13:58,938 --> 00:14:00,139
Not finished yet

361
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:01,407
Stop writing. Go home.

362
00:14:01,907 --> 00:14:02,942
How can I leave before I finish writing?

363
00:14:02,942 --> 00:14:03,642
Finish writing before leaving

364
00:14:03,642 --> 00:14:05,177
Mom, please stop making trouble, okay?

365
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:07,880
I'll play with you at home

366
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,548
I can make trouble with you or play with you.

367
00:14:09,815 --> 00:14:10,683
Don't delay my doctor's treatment

368
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:11,884
Working normally

369
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:12,985
I

370
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:15,487
Why did I make a fuss?

371
00:14:15,487 --> 00:14:16,589
Tangyuan is sick

372
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,157
I took it to see a doctor

373
00:14:18,757 --> 00:14:19,859
Why did I make a fuss?

374
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:21,227
Don't mention your cat

375
00:14:21,227 --> 00:14:21,727
Our family is basically

376
00:14:21,727 --> 00:14:22,828
I've never had any cats

377
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:24,730
Why haven't you raised it?

378
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:25,998
The glutinous rice balls are at home

379
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:26,966
I'll go home and look for it right now

380
00:14:37,743 --> 00:14:39,378
It’s really not easy for this son

381
00:14:39,645 --> 00:14:40,246
Have to go to work again

382
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:41,580
He has to take care of his mother again

383
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:42,648
It’s really frustrating

384
00:14:43,015 --> 00:14:44,316
This child takes care of his parents

385
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:45,718
It's a matter of course

386
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,653
Just like you got into so many troubles when you were a kid

387
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:48,654
Your parents don’t think you are a burden either.

388
00:14:48,654 --> 00:14:49,622
I find you annoying

389
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:51,323
It's like you've never been in trouble

390
00:14:52,691 --> 00:14:53,158
Don't

391
00:14:55,361 --> 00:14:56,829
It is said that raising children will protect you from old age.

392
00:14:56,829 --> 00:14:58,297
That also depends on the child.

393
00:14:58,297 --> 00:14:59,465
what does it look like

394
00:14:59,465 --> 00:15:00,065
You tell me later

395
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:01,133
If there is a child

396
00:15:01,133 --> 00:15:02,401
Busy at work every day

397
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:03,802
Not seeing each other all day long

398
00:15:04,136 --> 00:15:06,705
Then should I raise this child?

399
00:15:06,705 --> 00:15:08,374
What's the difference?

400
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:11,243
Children still need to be raised

401
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:13,579
It just depends on how we raise ourselves.

402
00:15:15,147 --> 00:15:16,649
It can be done, Lao Chen

403
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:17,383
Okay, I'll take it

404
00:15:17,383 --> 00:15:18,384
Something

405
00:15:20,185 --> 00:15:21,287
Look at how smart you are today

406
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:22,421
Shaking well

407
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:23,389
I won’t settle accounts with you

408
00:15:24,523 --> 00:15:25,457
You two can do it

409
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,359
Don't be disgusting everyone here

410
00:16:48,974 --> 00:16:49,742
Dean morning

411
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:51,443
Good morning, aunt

412
00:16:53,979 --> 00:16:55,948
What's wrong with your neck? You have a stiff neck.

413
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:00,486
It's not a stiff neck, it's a pillow

414
00:17:05,557 --> 00:17:06,925
Good glutinous rice balls

415
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:08,527
Don't be afraid

416
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:10,429
The doctor will come later

417
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:12,064
will cure your disease

418
00:17:21,006 --> 00:17:21,774
Every day we

419
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:22,941
What are you doing? This is

420
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:24,743
People like to pet and fuck like a raging fire

421
00:17:24,743 --> 00:17:25,944
turbulent

422
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:27,379
We play with her every day

423
00:17:27,746 --> 00:17:28,380
I tell you

424
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,048
Tianlin Pet Hospital

425
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:30,149
sooner or later one day

426
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:31,650
It will become Tianlin Nursing Home

427
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:33,018
What?

428
00:17:33,018 --> 00:17:33,452
And you

429
00:17:33,452 --> 00:17:34,420
Just press it today

430
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:35,721
Go through the process again yesterday

431
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:36,789
Anyway, the normal saline solution

432
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:38,057
No cost

433
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,858
Please, Dr. Chen

434
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:40,959
Our hospital has a knife

435
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:42,027
It's up to you

436
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:42,928

What's wrong with glutinous rice balls?

440
00:18:01,613 --> 00:18:02,481
Aunt

441
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:03,882
Why are you crying?

442
00:18:04,149 --> 00:18:05,184
You, what's wrong with you?

443
00:18:05,184 --> 00:18:06,118
Aunt

444
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:08,720
sweet dumpling

445
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:11,957
My glutinous rice balls are dying

446
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:14,726
Aunt

447
00:18:14,726 --> 00:18:16,495
Sitting in front of you is Dr. Chen

448
00:18:16,495 --> 00:18:17,696
A knife from our hospital

00:18:17,696 --> 00:18:18,464
He's there

00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:56,702
Sister, you can't go in

One stitch down

475
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:19,525
It must be alive and kicking

476
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:20,626
Is that right? A shot in the arm.

477
00:19:20,626 --> 00:19:21,260

Properly

526
00:20:52,017 --> 00:20:53,285
Look at it, its teeth are really straight

527
00:20:54,786 --> 00:20:55,020
Laughed

528
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:55,854
Right, right?

00:20:56,555 --> 00:20:57,623
It seems to be moving

530
00:20:57,623 --> 00:20:58,390

531
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:02,461

532
00:21:03,061 --> 00:21:03,795
Sister, let me ask

Before this glutinous rice balls

00:21:04,563 --> 00:21:05,297
Has anything been moved?

535
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:06,164
Surgery or something

536
00:21:06,164 --> 00:21:07,099
That's why you have a fever

537
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:10,569
It had that ligation surgery

538
00:21:11,303 --> 00:21:13,538
It didn't take long for it to become like this

539
00:21:16,575 --> 00:21:17,142
look

540
00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:18,944
Found the cause of the problem

541
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:19,978
Definitely this ligation surgery

542
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:20,646
Not done cleanly

543
00:21:20,712 --> 00:21:21,580
it's infected

544
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:22,314
That's why it has a fever

545
00:21:22,314 --> 00:21:23,782
Don't worry, sister, leave it to me

546
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:25,350
Gentle and quiet

547
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:26,084
Preparing for surgery

548
00:21:26,084 --> 00:21:28,253
Check your blood pressure and heart rate

549
00:21:31,857 --> 00:21:33,458
This is necessary preparation before surgery

550
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:36,395
Sister, the dumplings will be good

551
00:21:43,535 --> 00:21:44,269
Don't worry, sister

552
00:21:50,942 --> 00:21:52,511
How is it? Is everything normal?

553
00:21:52,511 --> 00:21:52,844
normal

554
00:21:52,911 --> 00:21:53,412
OK

555
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:54,346

556
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:02,554
This is butt

557
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:08,694
Sister, don't worry

558
00:22:08,694 --> 00:22:09,328
This anesthesia

559
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:10,929
It will take a while before we can perform the operation

560
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:11,830
So for a while

561
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:12,297
I'll do surgery on it

562
00:22:12,297 --> 00:22:12,664
The operation is over

563
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:14,166
it will definitely recover

564
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,967
Why don't you go out and wait for a while?

565
00:22:16,234 --> 00:22:17,869
Sister, you know our Dr. Chen

566
00:22:17,903 --> 00:22:19,204
What about superb medical skills?

567
00:22:19,204 --> 00:22:21,473
Hundreds of surgeries have been performed

568
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:22,708
Don't worry

569
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:23,809
Or we

570
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:24,710
Let's wait outside

571
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:25,310
Don't get in the way of their surgery

572
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:26,945
Auntie, the operation will take a while.

573
00:22:26,945 --> 00:22:28,180
So you wait outside

574
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:28,914
Don't hinder Dr. Chen. Don't worry.

575
00:22:28,914 --> 00:22:30,248
Leave it to me to do the surgery

576
00:22:30,248 --> 00:22:30,782

577
00:22:31,216 --> 00:22:32,818
Just do it well. It'll be fine.

Tangyuan is fine

579
00:22:33,985 --> 00:22:35,053

584
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:49,534
look

585
00:22:49,835 --> 00:22:51,903
Knife, let's start

586
00:22:51,937 --> 00:22:53,171
A full set of acting

587
00:23:13,258 --> 00:23:14,893
Tangyuan will be good

588
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:17,529
Coming, coming, coming

589
00:23:18,096 --> 00:23:18,563
sister

590
00:23:19,664 --> 00:23:21,633
Doctor, how are the glutinous rice balls?

591
00:23:21,633 --> 00:23:23,835
The glutinous rice ball surgery was particularly successful.

592
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:24,770
sweet dumpling

593
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:28,473
Does it hurt? Tangyuan

594
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:30,008
Sister, let me ask

595
00:23:30,008 --> 00:23:30,776
glutinous rice balls last time

596
00:23:30,776 --> 00:23:32,210
When doing ligation surgery

597
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:33,245
that

598
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:35,247
Did it lick the wound?

599
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:36,248
Then within a few days

600
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:37,115
that wound

601
00:23:37,115 --> 00:23:39,217
That yellow discharge

602
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:42,087
Yes

603
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:44,089
it seems to be old licking

604
00:23:45,123 --> 00:23:46,091
I also heard what you said

605
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:47,392
What kind of secretion is that?

606
00:23:47,692 --> 00:23:48,593
That hospital

607
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:49,661
Did you give glutinous rice balls?

608
00:23:49,661 --> 00:23:51,329
Wear that Elizabeth hoop

609
00:23:53,231 --> 00:23:54,032
What circle

610
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:55,934
That circle

611
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:56,868
Just to prevent cats

612
00:23:56,868 --> 00:23:58,103
To lick its wound

613
00:23:58,103 --> 00:23:59,070
wear around the neck

614
00:23:59,104 --> 00:23:59,771
Because where is the cat’s mouth?

615
00:23:59,805 --> 00:24:01,072
There are a lot of bacteria

616
00:24:01,072 --> 00:24:02,574
So what if it licks the wound?

617
00:24:02,574 --> 00:24:03,275
easily lead to

618
00:24:03,308 --> 00:24:04,743
That wound infection?

619
00:24:04,743 --> 00:24:05,710
Suppuration or something

620
00:24:07,512 --> 00:24:08,547
It seems not

621
00:24:08,547 --> 00:24:09,014
rest assured

622
00:24:09,014 --> 00:24:09,981
This time we give it

623
00:24:09,981 --> 00:24:11,583
Wear that Elizabeth hoop

624
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:12,150
and

625
00:24:12,417 --> 00:24:14,019
That wound is suppurating

626
00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:14,619
infected tissue

627
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:15,587
we have removed

628
00:24:15,887 --> 00:24:16,755
your glutinous rice balls

629
00:24:16,755 --> 00:24:18,390
You will recover soon

630
00:24:20,025 --> 00:24:20,725
Thank you

631
00:24:20,926 --> 00:24:21,693
Thank you doctor

632
00:24:21,726 --> 00:24:22,294
You're welcome

633
00:24:23,829 --> 00:24:24,596
Gentle and quiet

634
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:26,565
Take Tangyuan to get an injection of anti-inflammatory medicine

635
00:24:26,865 --> 00:24:28,467
Okay, come with me

636
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:28,900
good

637
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:29,634
This way

638
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:31,403
Goodbye glutinous rice balls

639
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:32,938
Don't worry, Auntie

640
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:33,872
Thank you doctor

641
00:24:33,872 --> 00:24:35,006
You're welcome You're welcome

642
00:24:35,006 --> 00:24:35,807
come with me

643
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:36,575
Thank you

644
00:24:36,575 --> 00:24:37,409
Goodbye sister

645
00:24:37,709 --> 00:24:38,343
good

646
00:24:42,214 --> 00:24:43,582
Chen Yifan

647
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:46,051
Thank you for your hard work

648
00:24:46,351 --> 00:24:47,085
I worked very hard

649
00:24:47,085 --> 00:24:48,653
I act so well

650
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:49,754
Very tired

651
00:24:49,754 --> 00:24:50,822
Give me a massage quickly

652
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:51,723
Hurry up

653
00:24:59,631 --> 00:25:00,899
I'll give you a good press

654
00:25:00,932 --> 00:25:01,299
Laotian

655
00:25:01,299 --> 00:25:02,834
My beauty has strength

656
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:03,168
Laotian

657
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:04,636
Could you please add another clock?

658
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:05,470
Dean Tian Dean Tian

659
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:06,204
Dean Tian Dean Tian

660
00:25:06,204 --> 00:25:06,872
How about I add another clock to you?

661
00:25:06,872 --> 00:25:07,606
How about I add another clock to you?

662
00:25:07,606 --> 00:25:08,573
Good Good Good Chen Yifan

663
00:25:08,607 --> 00:25:09,374
i was wrong

664
00:25:15,814 --> 00:25:16,982
What about the patient’s family?

665
00:25:17,582 --> 00:25:18,884
Still waiting at the door

666
00:25:18,884 --> 00:25:20,552
Because I gave it anti-inflammatory drugs

667
00:25:21,219 --> 00:25:22,621
for a pillow

668
00:25:23,088 --> 00:25:24,389
He actually performed an operation on it

669
00:25:24,389 --> 00:25:25,023
this kind of thing

670
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:26,391
In addition to Tianlin Hospital

671
00:25:26,391 --> 00:25:27,526
There is really no other hospital

672
00:25:27,592 --> 00:25:28,460
can be done

673
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:29,661
are you mocking me

674
00:25:29,661 --> 00:25:30,529
I'm praising you

675
00:25:31,263 --> 00:25:32,163
Even a pillow

676
00:25:32,464 --> 00:25:33,732
can be so attentive

677
00:25:34,099 --> 00:25:35,033
What's more

678
00:25:35,734 --> 00:25:36,735
What about a life?

679
00:25:37,469 --> 00:25:38,470
That's pretty much it

680
00:25:41,406 --> 00:25:42,073
But there's something

681
00:25:42,073 --> 00:25:43,308
I still can't figure it out

682
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:44,943
What did you say about Aunt Liu’s performance just now?

683
00:25:44,943 --> 00:25:46,211
It seems to be true

684
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:47,145
But his son

685
00:25:47,178 --> 00:25:48,313
Why deny it?

686
00:25:48,313 --> 00:25:49,915
Did you ever have a cat at home?

687
00:25:50,515 --> 00:25:51,783
It doesn't make sense

688
00:25:51,783 --> 00:25:52,284
you just said

689
00:25:52,284 --> 00:25:53,685
What kind of surgery did it perform?

690
00:25:53,685 --> 00:25:54,819
ligation surgery

691
00:25:55,487 --> 00:25:57,188
This ligation is all in my textbooks

692
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:58,023
Just seen it

693
00:25:58,023 --> 00:25:59,624
The current mainstream sterilization surgery

694
00:25:59,624 --> 00:26:01,226
This method is no longer used

695
00:26:03,862 --> 00:26:05,263
I probably understand

696
00:26:05,263 --> 00:26:06,264
you understand what

697
00:26:06,498 --> 00:26:07,165
Don't worry

698
00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:08,567
this matter

699
00:26:08,633 --> 00:26:09,234
Have to call

700
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:10,869
Ask a professional

701
00:26:14,873 --> 00:26:15,574
grandpa

702
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:17,075
can i ask you something

703
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:18,777
About ligation surgery

704
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:22,414
Current pet medical institutions

705
00:26:23,181 --> 00:26:25,850
Basically can't do it

706
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:28,019
Cat and dog underwent neutering surgery

707
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:29,421
that technology

708
00:26:29,454 --> 00:26:31,356
They were all used before

709
00:26:31,356 --> 00:26:31,489
They were all used before

710
00:26:31,856 --> 00:26:33,692
It’s long out of date now

711
00:26:35,193 --> 00:26:36,628
After ligation

712
00:26:37,228 --> 00:26:37,929
Male cats often still go into heat

713
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:40,865
Male cats often still go into heat

714
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:42,434
and

715
00:26:42,867 --> 00:26:45,170
can easily cause infection

716
00:26:46,571 --> 00:26:47,405
That grandpa

717
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:49,007
you said before

718
00:26:49,007 --> 00:26:50,542
About how long ago

719
00:26:51,076 --> 00:26:54,245
About twenty or thirty years ago

720
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:56,448
I understand, grandpa

721
00:26:57,215 --> 00:26:59,851
Why weren't you there last time I went home?

722
00:27:01,753 --> 00:27:02,887
I let Lao Han

723
00:27:03,221 --> 00:27:05,223
Take me to Hainan to relax

724
00:27:06,658 --> 00:27:07,125
Neither can I

725
00:27:07,192 --> 00:27:09,260
You always stay at home, right?

726
00:27:09,594 --> 00:27:10,228
good

727
00:27:10,228 --> 00:27:11,630
Okay, then I get it, grandpa

728
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:12,664
You pay attention to your health

729
00:27:12,697 --> 00:27:13,865
I know, I know

730
00:27:15,266 --> 00:27:16,468
work on your businesses

731
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:18,136
goodbye

732
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:20,972
Do you understand?

733
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:21,306
Do you understand?

734
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:24,342
Ligation surgery can easily cause infection

735
00:27:24,342 --> 00:27:25,310
cause death of animals

736
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:25,577
cause death of animals

737
00:27:26,111 --> 00:27:27,979
Twenty or thirty years

738
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:36,087
Tangyuan will be good

739
00:27:36,388 --> 00:27:38,223
It'll be fine soon

740
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:40,792
Aunt

741
00:27:41,226 --> 00:27:42,427
Tangyuan is so cute

742
00:27:42,427 --> 00:27:43,128
You must give it

743
00:27:43,128 --> 00:27:44,462
I took a lot of photos, right?

744
00:27:45,964 --> 00:27:47,866
Photos of glutinous rice balls

745
00:27:51,436 --> 00:27:52,070
Where can I think of it?

746
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:53,171
photo of it

747
00:28:02,947 --> 00:28:04,582
When you can't find the key

748
00:28:04,616 --> 00:28:05,450
call

749
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:06,985
Don’t watch TV too late

750
00:28:06,985 --> 00:28:08,787
Go to bed on time at ten o'clock

751
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:20,732
Take galantamine at nine o'clock

752
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:22,367
Memantine hydrochloride tablets

753
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:23,468
Eat at eleven o'clock

754
00:28:28,506 --> 00:28:29,307
sweet dumpling

755
00:28:29,574 --> 00:28:31,543
Tangyuan, where have you gone?

756
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:32,444
sweet dumpling

757
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:33,978
Tangyuan, come out quickly

758
00:28:33,978 --> 00:28:35,780
Auntie, the dumplings are here

759
00:28:38,817 --> 00:28:39,884
Good glutinous rice balls

760
00:28:40,418 --> 00:28:41,286
It's eleven o'clock

761
00:28:41,352 --> 00:28:42,954
Auntie, it’s time for you to take medicine

762
00:28:45,623 --> 00:28:46,391
give it to me

763
00:28:54,532 --> 00:28:55,533
Thank you

764
00:28:58,169 --> 00:29:00,305
I always forget things

765
00:29:00,305 --> 00:29:01,306
So Xiaozhi

766
00:29:01,339 --> 00:29:02,674
Just help me throughout the house

767
00:29:02,674 --> 00:29:04,709
They are all covered with notes reminding me

768
00:29:05,009 --> 00:29:06,411
He also helped me book a table

769
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:08,012
Told me to take medicine on time

770
00:29:09,514 --> 00:29:11,416
Xiaozhi is very well-behaved

771
00:29:14,152 --> 00:29:16,654
I just have a bad temper sometimes

772
00:29:17,388 --> 00:29:18,623
Always mean to me

773
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:22,894
He wasn't like this when he was a kid

774
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:25,864
Then when he was young

775
00:29:25,864 --> 00:29:27,298
what is it like

776
00:29:27,298 --> 00:29:28,700
when he was little

777
00:29:29,634 --> 00:29:31,703
Are you willing to stay by my side?

778
00:29:31,703 --> 00:29:33,004
all day in front of mom

779
00:29:33,004 --> 00:29:34,806
Mom clings to me from behind

780
00:29:34,806 --> 00:29:36,407
So lovable

781
00:29:41,746 --> 00:29:42,714
but

782
00:29:43,548 --> 00:29:46,384
He is too busy now

783
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:49,821
Sometimes I don’t come back at night

784
00:29:50,421 --> 00:29:51,055
Aunt

785
00:29:51,656 --> 00:29:52,924
Can you take us to see

786
00:29:52,924 --> 00:29:54,492
What was Xiaozhi like when he was a child?

787
00:30:00,431 --> 00:30:01,733
Yeah

788
00:30:02,267 --> 00:30:03,268
i have him

789
00:30:03,268 --> 00:30:05,270
So many photos of my childhood

790
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:05,870
Do you want to see it?

791
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:06,604
Want to see

792
00:30:07,505 --> 00:30:08,673
Do you want to see it? Do you want to see it?

793
00:30:09,274 --> 00:30:10,408
I'll take you to see it

794
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:11,276
go go go

795
00:30:12,844 --> 00:30:13,378
Come

796
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:17,182
Come in quickly

797
00:30:18,049 --> 00:30:18,616
When he was a child

798
00:30:18,616 --> 00:30:19,184
I took a picture of him

799
00:30:19,217 --> 00:30:20,852
Many, many photos

800
00:30:21,953 --> 00:30:22,453
Come

801
00:30:23,354 --> 00:30:24,389
Sit down

802
00:30:24,389 --> 00:30:24,956
You guys sit

803
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:26,057
I'll look for it

804
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:27,826
He has many, many photo albums

805
00:30:28,259 --> 00:30:29,994
Where did I put it?

806
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:32,497
This should be placed

807
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:33,264
where did you put it

808
00:30:33,298 --> 00:30:34,365
Is this it, aunt?

809
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:35,767
It seems like this

810
00:30:36,935 --> 00:30:37,969
I'll look for it

811
00:30:38,803 --> 00:30:41,172
This is Xiaozhi

812
00:30:41,973 --> 00:30:42,574
this

813
00:30:42,974 --> 00:30:44,309
This is this

814
00:30:49,814 --> 00:30:50,415
Look

815
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:54,352
Auntie, when you were young

816
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:55,253
so beautiful

817
00:30:55,253 --> 00:30:56,154
She is a great beauty

818
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:57,755
Where?

819
00:30:58,356 --> 00:30:59,257
Too good at talking

820
00:30:59,824 --> 00:31:00,625
This is him

821
00:31:01,292 --> 00:31:03,194
The photo was taken when the first tooth appeared.

822
00:31:03,728 --> 00:31:04,596
This is his first time

823
00:31:04,596 --> 00:31:06,831
Left behind when I learned to walk

824
00:31:12,937 --> 00:31:14,873
Tangyuan Xiaozhi

825
00:31:17,141 --> 00:31:18,009
sweet dumpling

826
00:31:21,846 --> 00:31:22,647
found it

827
00:31:23,147 --> 00:31:23,781
found it

828
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:26,851
what do they say

829
00:31:27,452 --> 00:31:28,353
Cute

830
00:31:32,123 --> 00:31:33,191
This is also

831
00:31:34,459 --> 00:31:35,126
You do this first

832
00:31:35,126 --> 00:31:36,060
You hold off the customer first

833
00:31:36,094 --> 00:31:37,028
I've finished taking care of things here

834
00:31:37,028 --> 00:31:37,729
Just go back to the company

835
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:39,530
Okay, I won’t say it anymore. I won’t say it anymore.

836
00:31:41,466 --> 00:31:42,867
I'm really sorry

837
00:31:42,867 --> 00:31:43,334
My mother gives it to you

838
00:31:43,334 --> 00:31:44,369
Caused so much trouble

839
00:31:50,708 --> 00:31:51,409
Look, look

840
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,711
How cute he was when he was little

841
00:31:53,711 --> 00:31:54,779
chubby

842
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:57,849
Look at this

843
00:31:58,116 --> 00:31:58,750
It's Xiaozhi

844
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,385
Taken on my fourth birthday

845
00:32:01,152 --> 00:32:02,687
Then how does he look?

846
00:32:02,687 --> 00:32:04,022
Still a little unhappy

847
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:07,225
A new set of clothes bought

848
00:32:07,225 --> 00:32:08,026
Just put it on

849
00:32:08,026 --> 00:32:09,327
My pants were torn

850
00:32:09,327 --> 00:32:10,528
Can you be happy?

851
00:32:16,067 --> 00:32:16,434
look

852
00:32:16,467 --> 00:32:17,568
I told you not to run around

853
00:32:17,568 --> 00:32:19,537
Hold on tight, Mom, you just won’t listen.

854
00:32:19,537 --> 00:32:20,505
Drop it

855
00:32:20,505 --> 00:32:22,807
Hurry, tell mom where it hurts

856
00:32:22,874 --> 00:32:25,310
Mom, my legs hurt

857
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:27,312
It's okay, Xiao Zhiguai

858
00:32:27,545 --> 00:32:28,346
Mom, blow it

859
00:32:28,379 --> 00:32:29,614
Xiaozhi doesn’t feel any pain anymore

860
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:33,051
What's the matter

861
00:32:33,084 --> 00:32:34,452
Did mom hurt you?

862
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,221
The pants are torn

863
00:32:37,221 --> 00:32:39,791
What should I do if I take pictures for a while?

864
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:40,658
It doesn’t matter

865
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:42,794
Mom has a way

866
00:32:44,195 --> 00:32:45,029
mother

867
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:46,731
This piece of cloth of yours

868
00:32:46,731 --> 00:32:48,566
Where did it come from?

869
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:50,101
It's from mom's clothes

870
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:51,469
Cut it out

871
00:32:51,769 --> 00:32:53,504
Come and see if the sewing is good or not.

872
00:32:53,538 --> 00:32:56,007
Mom sews great

873
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:57,275
very nice

874
00:32:57,275 --> 00:32:57,375
very nice

875
00:33:12,223 --> 00:33:13,224
About glutinous rice balls

876
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:14,859
You really have no impression

877
00:33:14,859 --> 00:33:15,626
Are they all gone?

878
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:19,464
How old was I at this time?

879
00:33:20,031 --> 00:33:20,698
I really

880
00:33:21,366 --> 00:33:22,300
Don't remember

881
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:25,069
But your mother

882
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:27,605
all things to you

883
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:29,307
I remember everything clearly

884
00:33:34,212 --> 00:33:35,179
Look at this

885
00:33:35,747 --> 00:33:38,049
This is Xiaozhi’s first time riding a tricycle

886
00:33:38,549 --> 00:33:39,684
Riding so fast

887
00:33:40,451 --> 00:33:42,453
At that time, he was only three years old

888
00:33:42,453 --> 00:33:43,421
Children in the courtyard

889
00:33:43,421 --> 00:33:44,589
Not as fast as him

890
00:33:46,657 --> 00:33:47,592
And this one

891
00:33:47,992 --> 00:33:49,193
It's with the neighbor's little sister

892
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:50,061
Taken together

893
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,231
This toy gun

894
00:33:53,231 --> 00:33:55,166
I bought it for his birthday

895
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:56,667
Look at the way he holds it

896
00:33:59,003 --> 00:34:00,405
Isn't it interesting?

897
00:34:05,109 --> 00:34:06,010
So cute

898
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:06,811
sweet dumpling

899
00:34:07,512 --> 00:34:08,579
Where did the glutinous rice balls go?

900
00:34:08,613 --> 00:34:09,180
Aunt

901
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:09,814
Where are the glutinous rice balls?

902
00:34:09,814 --> 00:34:11,082
The dumplings are in the outer room

903
00:34:11,082 --> 00:34:11,949
do not worry

904
00:34:11,949 --> 00:34:12,750
When I came in just now

905
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:13,751
It's right outside

906
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:17,655
It's good to be here, it's good to be here

907
00:34:19,624 --> 00:34:21,192
When Xiaozhi was young

908
00:34:21,192 --> 00:34:22,860
I like playing with glutinous rice balls the most.

909
00:34:23,661 --> 00:34:25,363
When I was in kindergarten

910
00:34:25,363 --> 00:34:26,564
There are children every day

911
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:28,066
Come and play with glutinous rice balls at home

912
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:30,068
Xiao Zhi is happy

913
00:34:33,538 --> 00:34:34,305
But

914
00:34:36,274 --> 00:34:37,875
Later Tang Yuan became ill

915
00:34:40,111 --> 00:34:41,979
Xiaozhi has grown up too

916
00:34:42,346 --> 00:34:43,981
He doesn't cling to me anymore

917
00:34:46,951 --> 00:34:49,787
He is busy working all day

918
00:34:50,822 --> 00:34:52,423
Busy on the phone

919
00:34:54,525 --> 00:34:55,993
After returning home

920
00:34:56,794 --> 00:34:58,963
You don't have time to talk to me either

921
00:35:01,566 --> 00:35:02,233
I

922
00:35:03,334 --> 00:35:05,970
I can only talk to Tangyuan

923
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:08,473
Still good glutinous rice balls

924
00:35:10,475 --> 00:35:11,109
But

925
00:35:12,643 --> 00:35:14,145
it's sick again

926
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:16,214
Aunt

927
00:35:30,261 --> 00:35:31,529
Where did the glutinous rice balls go?

928
00:35:33,331 --> 00:35:34,499
I'll look for it for you

929
00:35:34,866 --> 00:35:36,467
The dumplings should be outside

930
00:35:36,734 --> 00:35:37,668
Don't worry

931
00:35:38,336 --> 00:35:39,170
I'll go look for it

932
00:35:45,409 --> 00:35:46,811
sweet dumpling

933
00:35:48,946 --> 00:35:50,114
Small blog

934
00:36:03,928 --> 00:36:05,630
Your mother's memory of you now

935
00:36:06,564 --> 00:36:07,465
always stay

936
00:36:07,465 --> 00:36:09,066
When you were very young

937
00:36:09,634 --> 00:36:10,968
Maybe you don't remember

938
00:36:11,636 --> 00:36:12,703
But auntie

939
00:36:14,906 --> 00:36:16,207
I haven't forgotten it till now

940
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:17,975
to your mother

941
00:36:17,975 --> 00:36:19,177
Maybe that time

942
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:19,944
in her life

943
00:36:19,977 --> 00:36:21,145
happiest time

944
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:23,314
So anyway

945
00:36:23,314 --> 00:36:24,248
I won't forget it either

946
00:36:27,618 --> 00:36:28,386
My mother, she

947
00:36:30,555 --> 00:36:31,789
severe Alzheimer's disease

948
00:36:33,391 --> 00:36:34,792
The doctor said this disease

949
00:36:35,326 --> 00:36:36,394
is irreversible

950
00:36:37,728 --> 00:36:39,697
Even taking medicine can only delay it

951
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:42,233
The rate at which brain nerve cells age

952
00:36:43,768 --> 00:36:44,869
Imported medicines are expensive

953
00:36:47,171 --> 00:36:49,373
I work overtime day and night

954
00:36:50,575 --> 00:36:51,576
Just want to

955
00:36:52,009 --> 00:36:53,611
Give my mother the best medicine

956
00:36:53,611 --> 00:36:54,312
let her condition

957
00:36:54,312 --> 00:36:55,513
Worse more slowly

958
00:36:58,583 --> 00:36:59,250
If it were her

959
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:01,686
Even if you remember me for one more day, it would be fine

960
00:37:05,423 --> 00:37:06,257
Mr. Li

961
00:37:07,191 --> 00:37:08,793
than an uncertain future

962
00:37:08,793 --> 00:37:10,795
Cherish and seize the moment well

963
00:37:10,795 --> 00:37:12,230
Maybe it's more important

964
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:14,632
than treatment

965
00:37:14,865 --> 00:37:15,566
maybe your mother

966
00:37:15,633 --> 00:37:17,134
More need for the company of relatives

967
00:37:47,298 --> 00:37:48,766
Xiao Zhiguai

968
00:37:49,867 --> 00:37:51,502
Don't be afraid, Xiaozhi

969
00:37:52,336 --> 00:37:54,171
It doesn't matter if the pants are torn

970
00:37:54,171 --> 00:37:55,339
Mom fixed it up for you

971
00:37:55,339 --> 00:37:57,108
Just like new

972
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:00,177

00:38:43,788 --> 00:38:45,089
say sorry

990
00:38:45,089 --> 00:38:46,457

Mr. Shen, let me interrupt.

00:40:46,143 --> 00:40:47,378

00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:00,591
They all have beauty.

1052
00:41:00,891 --> 00:41:02,259
I'm afraid of holding everyone back

1053
00:41:03,327 --> 00:41:04,228
No way

1054
00:41:04,261 --> 00:41:05,329
Your current technology

1055
00:41:05,329 --> 00:41:07,364
But it's much better than before

1056
00:41:07,364 --> 00:41:08,365
do you know

00:41:08,432 --> 00:41:09,500

Many people are here for you

Stop being modest

1062
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:15,973
Excessive humility is pride

1063
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:16,674
we are still waiting for you

1064
00:41:16,674 --> 00:41:17,675

Yes, you are a brother

1066
00:41:21,712 --> 00:41:23,380
Someone once said

1067
00:41:23,414 --> 00:41:25,382
Having confidence does not necessarily mean you will win

1068
00:41:25,382 --> 00:41:27,451
But if you don’t have confidence, you will definitely lose.

1069
00:41:27,451 --> 00:41:28,018
come on

1070
00:41:31,889 --> 00:41:33,324
You see everyone supports you

1071
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:34,592
Everyone has seen your progress

1072
00:41:34,925 --> 00:41:36,393
You have to have confidence, you know?

1073
00:41:36,694 --> 00:41:38,028
And this time if the pilot hospital

1074
00:41:38,028 --> 00:41:39,063
What if we got it?

1075
00:41:39,096 --> 00:41:40,664
I will expand

1076
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:41,832
Add more people

1077
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:42,833
What about this?

1078
00:41:42,867 --> 00:41:44,435
Just my unilateral idea

1079
00:41:44,435 --> 00:41:45,035
What's next?

1080
00:41:45,035 --> 00:41:45,736
one more thing

1081
00:41:45,736 --> 00:41:46,904
I have to leave it to Dean Tian to do it.

1082
00:41:46,904 --> 00:41:48,405
Dean Tian, ​​please say a few words.

1083
00:41:48,472 --> 00:41:49,573
Say a few words

1084
00:41:50,608 --> 00:41:51,408
What do I want to say?

1085
00:41:51,408 --> 00:41:52,409
Just now Mr. Shen was

1086
00:41:52,443 --> 00:41:53,444
That's almost it

1087
00:41:53,444 --> 00:41:54,178
Everyone just for

1088
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:55,346
Salary and bonus doubled

1089
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:56,714
For the future of our Tianlin

1090
00:41:56,714 --> 00:41:57,581
work hard together

1091
00:41:58,516 --> 00:41:59,383
come on, come on, come on

1092
00:41:59,383 --> 00:42:01,585
Tian Lin must win

1093
00:42:02,152 --> 00:42:02,786
come on
