1
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,000
Your surname is Shen

2
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,360
What's up

3
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,160
It's okay It's okay

4
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,960
You have quite a lot of work experience

5
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,880
Veterinary Qualification Certificate

6
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,520
Certified Public Accountant

7
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,040
Nutritionist Diving Certificate

8
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,880
Bartender Financial Analyst

9
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,759
And your pet medical care

10
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:11,080
Still studying abroad

11
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,440
I studied in Canada before

12
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,280
Just came back this year

13
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,800
Originally

14
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,680
What does my dad want me to learn?

15
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,360
Business management

16
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,360
But I'm not very interested

17
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,000
I just have extra time

18
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,400
Passed this exam

19
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,560
Pet medical qualification certificate

20
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,520
Because I think

21
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,600
animals can't talk

22
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,920
But what about the vet?

23
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,680
It can also help animals relieve their suffering

24
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,160
So I think this industry

25
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,360
particularly great

26
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,760
I think so too

27
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,800
But you have a problem here

28
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,600
You have no clinical experience

29
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,640
Not at the pet hospital either

30
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,840
Really worked

31
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,320
Don't worry, I'm willing to do it

32
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,680
Just ask them from house to house

33
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,640
Can't even do it

34
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,120
I do not care

35
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,080
I'll take a look

36
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:44,880
wait for me a while

37
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,360
Doctor Chen

38
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,240
Doctor Chen

39
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:50,600
What's up

40
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,320
You came just in time

41
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,320
they want to give dogs

42
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,800
Vocal cord removal surgery

43
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,760
I explained to them

44
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,520
Here we are

45
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,360
I can't do this kind of surgery

46
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:56,920
right

47
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,480
This is our dean

48
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,960
If you have anything, you can discuss it with her

49
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,040
I leave it to you. I'm leaving first.

50
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:01,720
I have something else to do

51
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,560
Doctor Chen Lao Chen

52
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,440
Dr. Chen is right

53
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,000
Our hospital

54
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,480
It is true that this kind of surgery cannot be performed

55
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,320
And a regular hospital

56
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,240
Can't do anything

57
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,800
Then I'll find an irregular one.

58
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,960
Madam, why do you say that?

59
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,640
You have to be responsible for your dog

60
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:21,920
That's it

61
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,920
Let me tell you something

62
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,280
This vocal cord is close to the artery

63
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,280
A little careless

64
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,920
Surgery would be very dangerous

65
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,280
Even life-threatening

66
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,360
Do you dare to believe those

67
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,600
Irregular hospital?

68
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,440
Even if the operation is successful by luck

69
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,160
The recovery period after surgery is also long.

70
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,560
The chance of infection is also high

71
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,840
Once this dog loses its vocal cords

72
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,080
It lost contact with the outside world

73
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,800
The most important way of communication

74
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,680
It may lead to anxiety and depression

75
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,000
Even manic and biting

76
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,480
You didn't expect any of this, right?

77
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,200
I can't think about that much anymore

78
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,560
I'm so annoyed

79
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,880
It barks at night

80
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,400
Call at night

81
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,520
I will be forced into it

82
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,480
Nervous breakdown

83
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,200
I really can't stand it anymore

84
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:03,920
I can not stand it any more

85
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,960
Daughter-in-law Daughter-in-law

86
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,200
If you really can't stand Curly Fu

87
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,200
Let's give it away

88
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,560
Are you willing?

89
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,240
I've had it for five years

90
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,400
Of course I can't bear it

91
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,840
But you are like this

92
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,000
What can I do

93
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,880
Juan Fu, let's go

94
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,280
Curly Fu

95
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,240
Curly Fu

96
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:28,200
Curly Fu

97
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,000
So your name is Juan Fu?

98
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,480
sit

99
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,960
You are so pitiful

100
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,160
Your master plays with his mobile phone

101
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,000
right

102
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,080
I won’t play with you either

103
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,960
Come and give it back to you

104
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:44,840
Curly Fu

105
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,080
Curly blessing to

106
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,720
Curly Fu

107
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,240
you dog

108
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,560
No problem at all

109
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,080
You need to know

110
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:54,920
dog's sense of smell

111
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,480
One thousand two hundred times that of humans

112
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,160
Hearing is sixteen times that of humans

113
00:04:59,120 --> 00:04:59,520
so

114
00:04:59,520 --> 00:04:59,920
Once in the evening

115
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,800
In the dead of night

116
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,600
Even if your neighbor

117
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,160
make a little noise

118
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,680
It will become very alert

119
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,720
Of course it's not malicious

120
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,520
It's to protect you

121
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:08,760
don't want you to suffer

122
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,960
a little harm

123
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:13,760
Are you two

124
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,880
Often get off work late

125
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,920
You get off work very late and are very tired

126
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,120
Come back and fall asleep

127
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,000
Or just play on your phone

128
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,160
Don't accompany it either

129
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,120
Have you ever considered

130
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,200
How it feels

131
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,640
it every day during the day

132
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,960
Alone in the house

133
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,240
It must be very lonely, very lonely

134
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,240
what can it do

135
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,440
Just sleep

136
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,920
Then wait until you come back

137
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,960
It wants you to play with it

138
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,040
Just call

139
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,560
Why don't you call it a name, right?

140
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,280
So

141
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,120
Just come back

142
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,200
You still have to accompany it and walk it

143
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,880
From now on it will be night

144
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,720
When barking

145
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,840
Just turn on the light

146
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,840
soothe it soothe it

147
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,280
Repeat several times

148
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,480
That's good

149
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:52,920
OK thank you doctor

150
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,720
It's OK

151
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,360
Let's go

152
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,840
goodbye

153
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,840
Walk slowly

154
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57,800
Welcome to come again next time

155
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,080
Our Tianlin Hospital

156
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,240
sure

157
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,760
You are so professional

158
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,800
This eloquence

159
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,280
This comforting ability

160
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,080
Ok, Ok

161
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,440
ok ok

162
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,000
Then let me add one more thing

163
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,120
Do you know how to neuter your pet?

164
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:13,840
Of course

165
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,440
Will it remove bacteria and mites?

166
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,320
Can

167
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,360
All-rounder

168
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,240
Congratulations on passing the interview

169
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,560
Welcome to join us Tianlin

170
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,680
Thank you, Dean

171
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,520
thank you thank you

172
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,160
Carlo

173
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:32,960
Card

174
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,080
What's stuck?

175
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,440
Is it stuck?

176
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,480
There are people here who speak Thai.

177
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:51,760
Too many skills but not too much pressure

178
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,080
this gentleman

179
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,000
What disease do you have?

180
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:53,840
No

181
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,000
introduce

182
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,520
This is our Tianlin investor

183
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,240
Mr. Shen

184
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,400
Also surnamed Shen

185
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:01,920
What a coincidence

186
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,600
All have the surname Shen

187
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,640
enter

188
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,000
Tian Tian, ​​this is the assessment form

189
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,320
The young man just finished his interview

190
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,720
How about joining him?

191
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,400
Where are the people?

192
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,840
Mr. Shen said what to do for him

193
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,200
New employee training

194
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:39,800
who

195
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,040
Shen Mi

196
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,160
What training did he give him?

197
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,280
resign immediately

198
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,360
Why, brother

199
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,840
We two brothers work together

200
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,400
Brothers working together can cut through gold

201
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,600
How happy

202
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,960
Who can break the bank with you? Happy

203
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,960
What did you say you came to Tianlin for?

204
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,760
For Tian Tian

205
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,520
Tian Tian

206
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,160
No. Do you remember?

207
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,440
I called you once

208
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,440
I said those teeth are really big

209
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,520
That girl is her

210
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,640
You didn't hear me finish what I said

211
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,800
Just hang up the phone

212
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,160
I tell you

213
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,560
You said the teeth are really big

214
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,760
that girl

215
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,840
Contact with you outside

216
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,320
Those women are different

217
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,880
Stay away from her, you know?

218
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,680
Brother, do you also like her?

219
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,480
I

220
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,520
don't like

221
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,360
You don't like the effort you put into it

222
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,160
I have to invest in this small hospital.

223
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,720
So what do you like?

224
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,000
nurse named Wen

225
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,919
are you crazy

226
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:36,440
What are you talking about? You are here

227
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,720
That can't be the aunt at the front desk, right?

228
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,360
I'm like you

229
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,720
Meet one and like one

230
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,799
Don't talk nonsense

231
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:42,520
First

232
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,559
I love every relationship

233
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:45,160
They are all serious and responsible

234
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,400
It hasn't achieved the right result yet

235
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,600
That's not due to fate

236
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,280
second

237
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,080
Tianlin is a formal institution

238
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,920
I have a salary and a job

239
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,080
There are also five insurances and one housing fund

240
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,720
This does not violate our bet

241
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,080
The bet is canceled

242
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,680
You go back to work in Midorikawa tomorrow.

243
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,160
Then this will definitely be even worse

244
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,200
Then I'll tell grandpa

245
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,120
You find a vet

246
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,240
Be a personal doctor

247
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,760
Why are you talking here?

248
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,280
That me

249
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,240
Yes, didn’t I just come here?

250
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,200
Then Mr. Shen

251
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,000
Take me to get acquainted

252
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,760
The environment of our hospital

253
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,560
environment environment

254
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,200
Right, Mr. Shen?

255
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,200
Brat, please squeeze gently.

256
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,160
Do you know each other?

257
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,520
I was just about to introduce it to you

258
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,520
know about know about

259
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,440
Mr. Shen is also named Shen.

260
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,240
My surname is Shen too

261
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,840
Da Shen and Xiao Shen

262
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,680
very happy very happy

263
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,200
We were a family in our previous life, right?

264
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,520
Don't tell me, there's more

265
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,600
A little bit like

266
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,720
I'm nothing like him

267
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
He looks like Huang Zitao

268
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,480
Then you can talk slowly

269
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,280
Have a nice chat

270
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,280
I'll get busy first

271
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,640
Okay, then I'm leaving too

272
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,480
Who is Huang Zitao?

273
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,960
it's not important

274
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,040
Your matter

275
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,560
Can't let Tian Tian know

276
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,160
Did you hear that?

277
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,320
Is that right?

278
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,360
I can't let that person know either.

279
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,720
I'm so mad at you

280
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,600
Wife

281
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:19,760
when at home

282
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,440
A little wild dog came in.

283
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,200
Thank you for your hard work, Lao Shen.

284
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,680
I'm not coming back

285
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,200
Are you having dinner with my mother?

286
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,800
Can you please stay outside?

287
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,560
swaying

288
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,920
Hurry back to work in the group

289
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,160
Never reply at any time

290
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,720
Doesn’t the group have you?

291
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,560
What am I going to do?

292
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,840
Dad is old

293
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,320
Now in charge of the audit department

294
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,520
We have to focus on the R&D department again

295
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,360
Can't you come back and help me?

296
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,400
Aren't you happy with this?

297
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,440
I was originally in the audit department

298
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,240
well done

299
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,080
I have to go. Why?

300
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,000
R&D department

301
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
If you are not tired, who is tired?

302
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,160
Silly boy

303
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,480
This R&D department belongs to the group

304
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,520
future and hope

305
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,320
Especially this time, Dr. Gu is here

306
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,760
I became even more powerful

307
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,120
I'm going to make a big splash

308
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,840
You quite respect it

309
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,920
That Dr. Gu

310
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,200
Is he that powerful?

311
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,800
You will come to work in the group tomorrow

312
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,880
You young people know each other

313
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,160
Very good child

314
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:18,920
OK

315
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,040
I dont go

316
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,640
If you don't go, what will you do?

317
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,600
Don't get excited

318
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,840
I have a job

319
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,640
what's the job

320
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,480
OK

321
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,880
It’s not easy to come back

322
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,640
Then stop nagging a few words

323
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:32,880
son

324
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,040
Talk to mom

325
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,560
What job are you looking for?

326
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,680
Serious work

327
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,600
There is a salary and five insurances and one housing fund.

328
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,160
Very good

329
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,120
that is

330
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,040
Five insurances and one fund

331
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,040
Have you seen your brother recently?

332
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:48,920
no

333
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,440
no

334
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,960
Don't be so sad

335
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,920
Mom, I got paid

336
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,720
Give you a good set of cosmetics

337
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,560
good son

338
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,720
That old Shen

339
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,000
what do you want

340
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,640
I want a dog leash

341
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,360
Need a dog leash

342
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,360
When did our family get a dog?

343
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:07,800
You do this

344
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,200
I'll give you a set

345
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,200
Anti-hair loss toiletries

346
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:11,840
Go! Go! Go

347
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,960
Sister Peilan

348
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,680
So many flowers

349
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,880
You are so popular

350
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,240
I am so envious

351
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,400
This is nothing

352
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,280
What is there to envy?

353
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,240
This is almost a MILF.

354
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,240
How unlike you?

355
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,760
This youthful one

356
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,040
How nice

357
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,360
So today's Valentine's Day

358
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,880
Do you have any plans for the evening?

359
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,640
I have a best friend

360
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,280
held a

361
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,000
A blind date for overseas returnees

362
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,600
I didn't want to go at first

363
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,880
She just has to let me

364
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,440
Go make a scene

365
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,600
Then there's nothing I can do

366
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,040
returnees

367
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,720
I think it's a bunch of kelp

368
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,360
Doctor Chen

369
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,720
What is kelp?

370
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,880
Returned from overseas and unemployed

371
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,800
This smell is sour

372
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,440
What does it taste like?

373
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,440
Doctor Chen

374
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,920
Have you made a date tonight?

375
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,760
This kind of party

376
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,720
I never join in the fun

377
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,480
It's you who doesn't join in the fun

378
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,720
Still no one joins in the fun with you

379
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,200
Comrade Chen Yifan

380
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,640
Such cheap flowers

381
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,360
I'm so embarrassed to give it away

382
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,200
I'm going to work first

383
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,160
Hello

384
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,560
We are from Tianlin Pet Hospital

385
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,040
I would like to consult your organization

386
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,120
Are there regular

387
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,960
Deworming and neutering

388
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,360
you already have

389
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,480
Fixed-point cooperation

390
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,960
Okay, thank you. Excuse me.

391
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,280
Please come in

392
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,840
Come get your coffee

393
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,840
And coffee

394
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,680
so good

395
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,000
I'm pretty good myself

396
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:39,400
Thank you

397
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,000
Mr. Shen didn't come today

398
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,040
He still has company matters to be busy with

399
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:46,880
And he's not

400
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:47,800
Come here every day

401
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,520
You said Green River Group

402
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,320
you know

403
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,120
I know

404
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,800
Green River Group, Shen Mi

405
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,840
So famous, right?

406
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,240
also famous

407
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,880
I heard from Sister Peilan in the past two days

408
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:07,800
In fact, our hospital

409
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,600
The boss behind it is Shen Mi

410
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:11,920
You say he is one

411
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,440
Companies that make animal products

412
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,080
Why invest

413
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,080
Where is our hospital?

414
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:16,680
Still say

415
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,520
Your relationship is unusual

416
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,480
What are you talking nonsense about?

417
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,280
Does this have anything to do with your work?

418
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,480
Of course it matters

419
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,400
I have to figure it out

420
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,800
Our pet hospital

421
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,240
These intricate

422
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:29,960
interpersonal relationships

423
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,600
Only in order to work better is not

424
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,600
Then let me explain it to you

425
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,600
Where is Midorikawa?

426
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,360
Although animal products are developed

427
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,320
But they also want to move into

428
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,360
medical market

429
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,960
So I went to our hospital.

430
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:41,880
Between me and Shen Mi

431
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,120
Also an investor

432
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,920
relationship with partners

433
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:46,800
That's it

434
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,280
Gone

435
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,480
Gone

436
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,080
That's it

437
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,080
Really gone

438
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,600
It doesn’t matter

439
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:55,640
Also

440
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,240
Employees at Tianlin

441
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,320
We all get along well with each other

442
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,800
You'll fit in here quickly

443
00:15:59,240 --> 00:15:59,880
Do not worry

444
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,240
OK

445
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,680
Then you are busy

446
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,960
thank you for the coffee

447
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:10,840
Is there anything else?

448
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,360
It's OK

449
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,280
Here comes another one named Shen

450
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,200
What are you playing, Woohyun?

451
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,320
Don't call me Woohyun

452
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,360
I'm not familiar with you

453
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:51,840
It's OK

454
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,520
What are you doing?

455
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:57,680
Let me do it

456
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,920
What are you doing? Do you know how?

457
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,240
I'll come, just watch you

458
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,079
Please come in

459
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,200
Mr. Han, your flowers

460
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,040
Who sent it

461
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:26,240
Dr. Gu

462
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,840
I've passed this contract

463
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:33,680
You go deal with it

464
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:34,600
okay

465
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,200
close the door

466
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,200
Thank you

467
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:06,640
Hello VIP

468
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,840
How long does this customization take?

469
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,080
Normally

470
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,480
It will take a week

471
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,120
If you are particularly anxious

472
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:19,920
I want it now

473
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,240
we try our best

474
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,400
Done

475
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,480
best player

476
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,000
Okay, Brother Chen

477
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:33,920
So powerful

478
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,080
Not bad

479
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,240
I'm in our group

480
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,240
At best, it's an upper-middle level

481
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,040
What group is that?

482
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,480
Can you pull me there easily?

483
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,560
I don’t have your WeChat account

484
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,120
Me I sweep you I sweep you

485
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,200
Brother, is it convenient?

486
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:47,960
convenient

487
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:48,720
convenient

488
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,320
I scan you

489
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:49,840
Come

490
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:51,360
Done

491
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:51,960
Sweep it up

492
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,480
I'll drag you into the group

493
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,200
Xing Tao

494
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:01,880
Yes, that one

495
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,520
Is that Xing Tao who plays games?

496
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,280
Right, right, right

497
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,000
it's him

498
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,240
I usually have a good relationship with him

499
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,760
We often have nothing to do together offline

500
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:08,880
elder brother

501
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,360
from now on

502
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,840
You are my brother with a different surname

503
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:12,640
OK

504
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,440
from now on

505
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,800
You are my brother with a different surname

506
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:15,480
let me ask you something

507
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,800
What does your sister like?

508
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,160
Why do you ask?

509
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,320
I'll just ask

510
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,880
Isn’t your sister the boss?

511
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,360
I want to do what he likes

512
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,040
Don't

513
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,800
Offending her is not

514
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:26,760
This way

515
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:30,960
It’s okay if you don’t say it

516
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:31,560
Anyway

517
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,320
Xing Tao doesn't have much time recently

518
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:34,880
Don't

519
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,080
I'm kidding

520
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,360
What are you serious about? I'm kidding

521
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,680
I didn't take it seriously, I was joking

522
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,960
Tell me what she likes

523
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,640
like to eat

524
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,560
She is very good at eating

525
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,920
One meal can last three bowls of rice

526
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:46,840
three bowls of rice

527
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:47,600
That's a lot

528
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,280
What else do you like?

529
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,440
let me see

530
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,400
Her bag is broken

531
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,240
The bag is broken

532
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,520
Are there any that cost nothing?

533
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,640
Because I just came here, right?

534
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,880
Money is a bit tight

535
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,640
free of charge

536
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:03,720
Think about it

537
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,480
Today it’s me and my girlfriend

538
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,000
love one month anniversary

539
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,640
Fireworks will be set off by the river at eight o'clock in the evening

540
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,600
Are you coming single?

541
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,240
Does your sister like fireworks?

542
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,000
Like it

543
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,160
We both played together since childhood

544
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,680
If you do this, do me a favor

545
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:41,800
red dot

546
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:00,800
So beautiful

547
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,280
Our walking service

548
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:38,000
You really need to make an appointment

549
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,520
Tian Peilan, what’s wrong? This is

550
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,240
Tian Tian, ​​you came just in time

551
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,360
Isn't today Valentine's Day?

552
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,360
Suddenly so many people came

553
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,840
You need our help

554
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,040
Just help me

555
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:46,840
Today is Valentine's Day

556
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,160
I have activities in the evening

557
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:48,880
Be happy every night

558
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,840
Must walk

559
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:50,720
I really can't get away

560
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,960
Yes

561
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,400
Tian Peilan

562
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,080
Don't point at me

563
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,080
I'm going on a blind date today

564
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,480
Your aunt’s happiness for the rest of her life

565
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,400
Just point to today

566
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,920
You should be careful, Tian Tian

567
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,240
What about Chen Yifan?

568
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,320
Don't mention Chen Yifan

569
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,200
People get off work

570
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,880
As soon as the click hits, he disappears.

571
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:09,960
What about Xiao Wen?

572
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,480
Doesn’t that mean you need to go to night college?

573
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,120
She said she wanted to improve herself

574
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,640
No, I'm in a hurry

575
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,720
I'll leave first, leave it to you

576
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,120
Then look for her, look for her

577
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:18,920
Sorry, I have something else to do

578
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,720
I go first

579
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,360
no no

580
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,000
Excuse me

581
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,360
Tian Yuxian

582
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,840
Don't look at me. My stomach hurts

583
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,160
I ate something bad at lunch

584
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:27,880
so many dogs

585
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,040
We are all off work

586
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,160
Why haven't you left yet?

587
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,520
Leave right away

588
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:33,960
Tonight

589
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,280
Get some more dogs

590
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:36,720
Small problem

591
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,720
Emergency notification

592
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,200
Liudian Tianlin Hospital

593
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,880
Meet at Tianlin Hospital at six o'clock

594
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,120
Get more dogs

595
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,560
Send me a message when you receive it

596
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,320
Ok, Ok

597
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,680
It's trivial

598
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,000
Why are you still standing there?

599
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,120
Please help me quickly

600
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,320
What can I do to help?

601
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,440
Help walk the dog

602
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,440
I'm good at walking the dog.

603
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,040
but so many dogs

604
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,880
I can't walk here alone

605
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,280
Me, my sister helps me, my sister helps you

606
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,040
OK OK

607
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,080
And you

608
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,200
I can't do it anymore

609
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:08,360
no

610
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,240
Come on, give it to me

611
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,280
Come on, it's okay, it's okay

612
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:11,800
It's okay It's okay

613
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:12,080
Come

614
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:12,960
Come, come, come

615
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:14,960
Come all to me

616
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,600
okay

617
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,560
It's okay It's okay

618
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,840
Shall we have dinner together tonight?

619
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,440
if you have an appointment

620
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:04,600
When I didn't say

621
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:17,920
Lawyer Han

622
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,480
Are these flowers sent by Mr. Mi?

623
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,720
So beautiful

624
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,800
Are these flowers sent by Mr. Mi?

625
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,160
So beautiful

626
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,760
I've already booked a ride

627
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:29,800
No one ever picked up

628
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,760
It’s all the holidays

629
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,400
What's better than this

630
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,320
Taxi

631
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,920
Broken steps, what broken knots?

632
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:53,600
Comrade

633
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,360
Want a ride?

634
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:19,600
Come

635
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,080
How is it

636
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,160
Are you okay?

637
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,760
You said it was okay

638
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:25,240
Try throwing it down

639
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,200
See if it hurts

640
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,320
Where are you going?

641
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,720
none of your business

642
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:32,840
etc

643
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:39,760
give

644
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,280
If you don’t want to eat it, keep it for yourself.

645
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,320
Not for you to eat

646
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,000
I want you to warm your hands. It's too cold.

647
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:47,640
Just bought

648
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:48,880
Still warm

649
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:56,960
Be warm

650
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,120
that

651
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,360
How about I send it to you?

652
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,160
Sprinkle it a little

653
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:20,600
Wait a moment

654
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,040
Don't move

655
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:32,480
Come

656
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:45,720
nice

657
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:47,960
Come on, sit tight

658
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:49,480
Slow down

659
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,800
Have you never ridden an electric donkey?

660
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,800
Let you feel it

661
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,560
What is lightning fast?

662
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,320
Sit tight

663
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,560
Where are you going by yourself?

664
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,480
Sit tight

665
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,880
Come, your meal is ready

666
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:45,480
Thank you

667
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:46,640
Good bye

668
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,200
goodbye

669
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,480
Good sir, your face is good

670
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,000
Thank you

671
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:00,640
you're welcome

672
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:23,920
What a coincidence What a coincidence

673
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,640
You, just eat instant noodles

674
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,560
The last one was bought by you

675
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:12,840
Eat quickly

676
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:13,520
No more cold food

677
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,000
You should eat quickly too

678
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,240
good

679
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:33,920
today

680
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,440
I didn’t delay your date, right?

681
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,600
I'm single

682
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,320
This kind of day has nothing to do with me

683
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,400
It shouldn't be

684
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,080
I mean

685
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:46,840
should be

686
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,920
You are too busy with your career and delayed

687
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,440
That's not it either

688
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,200
Really?

689
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,800
I think

690
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,080
Career is important

691
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,160
but not

692
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,560
Completely disregarding love

693
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,120
You should find one

694
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,880
Like you

695
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,440
Willing to fight with you

696
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,200
Still like dogs

697
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:10,680
For example

698
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,560
Shen Chen

699
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,080
Today it’s you and Tian Yuxian

700
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,680
Let's set up a game for me together.

701
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:17,960
No

702
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,480
How could there be such a coincidence?

703
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,520
everyone at the same time

704
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:21,640
Ask to walk the dog

705
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,240
I thought I acted pretty well

706
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,160
discovered by you

707
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:01,960
I won’t see you during the day

708
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,040
What are you doing now?

709
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,760
Why are you working the night shift here?

710
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,600
What about the rest

711
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,680
Old Chen left long ago

712
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,840
My aunt went on a blind date

713
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:09,680
Wen Jing went to night party

714
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:10,600
I'll support it temporarily

715
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:13,520
Where is your sister?

716
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:14,800
my sister

717
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:16,600
Went to the park for a walk with the dog

718
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,440
Go Carlo

719
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,720
go for a walk in the park

720
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,400
It's over, it's over, it's over

721
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:29,920
You take me here

722
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:30,920
What on earth do you want to do?

723
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,400
I

724
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:35,360
I have a gift for you

725
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,920
And gifts

726
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,600
It's okay I don't need it

727
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,560
you need to

728
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,480
I do not need

729
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,560
you need to

730
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,200
What a beauty

731
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,760
Chen Yifan

732
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,400
stop

733
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:21,880
What's up

734
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,040
Stop it quickly

735
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,080
Come and take a look

736
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:38,560
good

737
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,960
So beautiful

738
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:51,560
Does it look good?

739
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:52,680
nice

740
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,240
Do you like it?

741
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:56,360
like

742
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:10,280
In fact, life is like fireworks

743
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,560
will disappear soon

744
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,679
But at least it was gorgeous

745
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:21,159
this is you for me

746
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,239
prepared

747
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:23,920
These fireworks are specially made by me

748
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,040
prepared for you

749
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,679
Tailored

750
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:27,639
That

751
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,800
Who is Lulu?

752
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,400
Who is Lulu?

753
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:35,880
Lulu I love you

754
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:46,080
Me, I'm going to ask Lulu who she is

755
00:34:58,600 --> 00:34:59,720
why are you here

756
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,000
This Lulu

757
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,600
So happy

758
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,560
Hurry up Hurry up

759
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,600
Why are you walking so fast?

760
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,160
I have so many dogs

761
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,000
If someone comes specifically for me

762
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,520
Set off such a firework to propose marriage

763
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,360
I will definitely marry him

764
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:55,880
You women

765
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,560
I just like this kind of arrogance

766
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:58,640
bells and whistles

767
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,720
Have this little money to set off fireworks

768
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,960
It's better to buy roasted sweet potatoes.

769
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:04,920
I'm serious

770
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,040
save some money

771
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,560
Follow me to speculate in stocks

772
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:09,280
Financial management

773
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:12,760
You know what a ghost you are

774
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,040
Okay, I'll give it back to you. It's not cold anymore.

775
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:18,840
so beautiful

776
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,040
Come

777
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:30,920
What are you doing?

778
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,040
Isn’t it a holiday today?

779
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,200
gift to you

780
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,480
gift to me

781
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,000
No need to buy

782
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,680
what is

783
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:48,920
Open it and take a look

784
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:51,920
good

785
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,640
what do you mean

786
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,280
This guy

787
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,000
It is inevitable that there will be one

788
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,360
Headache, brain fever or something like that

789
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,000
You are alone

790
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:06,440
How will you feel uncomfortable in the future?

791
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,160
Follow the acupoints above

792
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:07,960
It's all marked

793
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,520
It's particularly useful when you press it yourself.

794
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,120
People are getting older

795
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:13,400
You should take good care of it

796
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:16,440
Do you like it?

797
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,400
Chen Yifan

798
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,080
Are your acupuncture points itchy?

799
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,160
Who is alone

800
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:23,800
Who?

801
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:24,560
Who who is older

802
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,640
I'm kind, you say it, you say it

803
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:26,240
What did you say

804
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,400
What to say

805
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,040
who

806
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:30,520
go away

807
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:31,560
Who?

808
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:32,480
Who?

809
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,360
Didn't you mean me?

810
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,760
How can you be so kind as to be a donkey liver and lungs?

811
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,760
This thing works great

812
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:37,480
I ignore you

813
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,160
What was your attitude just now?

814
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,040
What's wrong with me

815
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,400
You walk forward alone with your head down.

816
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,400
Don't pay any attention to me

817
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,560
what do you mean

818
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,080
I disturbed

819
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,640
You're dating Dr. Shen

820
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,400
I'll blame myself in front of you

821
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,000
Is there any problem?

822
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,720
Really boring

823
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,360
You still have the nerve to tell me

824
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,320
how about you

825
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:20,960
I'd like to ask

826
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,320
what are you doing today

827
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,600
Tian Lin didn’t work hard even after he came here.

828
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:24,480
Not working hard either

829
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,960
Three days of fishing and two days of drying nets

830
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:36,720
Give it back to me

831
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:37,800
what

832
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,760
give me back my pen

833
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,520
Give it to you Give it to you

834
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:48,760
I didn't expect you

835
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,040
He is so small-bellied

836
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,680
After giving the things, I took them back to ask for them.

837
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:58,880
This is for you

838
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:07,440
Isn't this just a

839
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,840
Is it the exact same pen?

840
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:11,600
Take it out and look at it carefully.

841
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,240
It's the same after looking at it

842
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,640
So what's your day today?

843
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:32,800
Everyone is busy with this

844
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,160
Don't get me wrong

845
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:35,560
I just don't like other people

846
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:37,200
Just holding my things

847
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,600
A dead duck talks back

848
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,440
Do you want it? Do you want it?

849
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:44,280
I want I want I want

850
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,080
This is the end of things

851
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,480
Just don't ask for it back.

852
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,960
I dominate the love scene

853
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,480
Judging from many years of experience

854
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,720
Shen Chen treats you

855
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,520
It's just evil intentions

856
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,840
I can tell it right away

857
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,640
Don't make blind guesses, aunt.

858
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:23,400
Why are you so serious?

859
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,360
Not kidding you

860
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,800
This is Shen Chen, right?

861
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:29,000
Just human beings are okay

862
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,360
But being a boyfriend

863
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,120
Absolutely not

864
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,600
He was just messing around with me

865
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:35,880
He came back from studying abroad

866
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,240
How can you like me?

867
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:40,080
What's the use? I've checked everything

868
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,200
He was studying abroad at the time

869
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:41,760
applied for

870
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,720
What is poverty bursary?

871
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,520
Look at his watch

872
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,680
It looks like it's a fake

873
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:50,600
You also investigated who is behind it?

874
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:51,600
Really

875
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,080
I'm telling you he is

876
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,080
Just came to our Tianlin

877
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:54,960
I want to be the dean with me

878
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,040
Build a good relationship

879
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:57,160
Condom almost

880
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,280
I don't have the leisure now

881
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:02,080
Thinking about these messy things

882
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:02,720
an achievement

883
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,360
It makes me unable to breathe

884
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,920
Then what you said last time was for stray pets?

885
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,480
Do sterilization

886
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:11,840
Is it possible?

887
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:13,960
Is there any contact information?

888
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:14,720
No chance

889
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,320
No contact information

890
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,200
I left a message

891
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,520
Wait for the reply

892
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,240
difficult

893
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,440
I am the person in charge of Tian Lin

894
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,000
right

895
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:35,960
I gave it to you before

896
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,360
Leave a message online

897
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:40,920
Hello

898
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,160
Right, right

899
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,480
we are willing to cooperate

900
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:47,240
Tonight?

901
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:49,440
Okay. Where is it?

902
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:50,880
OK

903
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,800
Cuiyun Hotel, I remember it

904
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:54,160
okay

905
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:55,240
That's OK

906
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:57,000
Let's talk in detail tonight

907
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:58,680
OK

908
00:41:58,680 --> 00:41:59,360
see you tonight

909
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:00,360
Thank you

910
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:03,040
What's going on

911
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,680
There's hope

912
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:06,400
I tell you

913
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,000
Hanlu Charity, you know?

914
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:09,920
I left a message for them before

915
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:10,920
They replied to me

916
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,680
Said he wanted to make an appointment with me to discuss in detail

917
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:13,560
If we Tian Lin

918
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:14,680
Can pass their assessment

919
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:16,160
They are willing to take all the business

920
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,280
Make it for us

921
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:20,280
but

922
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,440
Before this thing happens

923
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,920
Never tell Shen Mi

924
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:23,720
Why?

925
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:26,640
Tian Tian

926
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:28,760
How many times have I told you

927
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:31,000
Secrets are used to make things come true, words are used to reveal failures.

928
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:34,280
Hype it before it’s done

929
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:35,320
What did I say?

930
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:36,200
Didn't work

931
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:37,240
Underachievement
