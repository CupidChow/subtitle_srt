00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:20,550
So cute.

187
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:28,830
Are you tired?

188
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:30,190
A bit. Thanks.

189
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:35,510
Kittens that suffer from difficult births
like this are likely to die young.

190
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:37,590
It will be better
after a 24-hour observation period.

191
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:41,810
You go rest. I'll watch for you.

192
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:43,270
Okay then, thanks.

193
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,310
Have you given any thought to that matter?

194
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:48,830
What matter?

195
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:50,230
The one Shen Chen brought up.

196
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:52,130
Oh, that one.

197
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:53,270
I've thought about it,

198
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:54,630
and I've decided to reject him.

199
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:58,470
Why?

200
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:00,070
I don't like younger ones.

201
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:02,350
I prefer someone mature and stable.

202
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:05,470
You like Chen Yifan then.

203
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:08,510
Isn't he a little too mature?

204
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:12,470
Chen Yifan.

205
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:15,120
Chen Yifan.

206
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:20,250
Chen Yifan, why are you still sleeping?

207
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:21,470
Get up.

208
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:31,376
What time is it?

209
00:13:31,376 --> 00:13:32,630
What time is it? You slept for so long.

210
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:33,790
We're very busy.

211
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:42,030
What's wrong? Are you not feeling well?

212
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:44,630
You have a fever.

213
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:46,870
Did you go out yesterday
without drying your hair first?

214
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:47,870
Did you catch a cold?

215
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:52,336
Perhaps.

216
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:54,870
Check again to confirm.

217
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:56,816
Am I burning up?

218
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:00,336
Really?

219
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:07,230
It's great to be sick.

220
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,830
- What's wrong?
- What's wrong?

221
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:14,950
I have a fever.

222
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:17,150
You're sick.

223
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:18,670
Yes, I'm sick.

224
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:21,870
Why are you hitting me?
I'm sick and you're still hitting me?

225
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:29,744
Could you hold this for me?

226
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,270
Tian,

227
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:37,470
Tian, what's wrong?

228
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:39,070
Don't grab my hand. Let go.

229
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:42,070
I'm working with an illness.

230
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:43,230
Don't you feel sorry for me?

231
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:44,270
I think you're fine.

232
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:46,470
Hurry up and go to work.

233
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:47,910
I have a fever.

234
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:50,030
What just happened?

235
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:52,750
He was getting handsy with me.

236
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:55,630
- I was not.
- Chen.

237
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:58,670
Yesterday, I was performing surgery while sick.

238
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:00,070
I haven't even eaten yet.

239
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:01,350
And she told me to start working.

240
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:02,550
How could she be so cold?

241
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:08,048
I'll heat up the food.

242
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:12,890
I'm going back to work.

243
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:14,070
You blushed.

244
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:15,184
No.

245
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:37,030
Dr. Chen doesn't even have time to eat.

246
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:38,910
Considering your dedication to your work,

247
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:40,790
I think we can consider a pay raise.

248
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,370
Sounds good.

249
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:44,150
If this continues in the long run,

250
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:45,510
it's not out of the question.

251
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:49,390
Where's the delivery guy?

252
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:50,710
He went to earn medical expenses for White.

253
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:53,150
Oh, right. He wanted me to give this to you.

254
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:58,790
That guy

255
00:15:58,790 --> 00:15:59,910
draws very well.

256
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:32,710
A new trendy bubble tea shop has opened
on Jiuan Street.

257
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:35,990
Such a long line.

258
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:42,670
They have my favorite mango flavor.

259
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:46,670
Unfortunately,
there are only 500 servings available.

260
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:48,950
I'm not sure if I'll be able to get one.

261
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:50,790
If you want one, go buy it.

262
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:52,630
I'd like to,

263
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:54,570
but I can't get away from the hospital.

264
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:57,670
Moreover, if I go after work,
they'll definitely be sold out.

265
00:16:58,790 --> 00:16:59,856
I won't be able to get one.

266
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:03,950
Remember the day
when we had dinner with the liar?

267
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:07,150
Shen waited in line for a long time

268
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:08,950
to buy me my favorite, the mango flavor.

269
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:11,789
Unfortunately,
I didn't have a chance to drink it.

270
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:14,390
He put so much effort into it.

271
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:16,150
I might never have the chance to drink

272
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:18,430
such a delicious mango slush again in my life.

273
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:21,890
Alright, stop talking.

274
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:23,290
Where is that place?

275
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:24,670
I'll send you the location.

276
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:27,472
Thanks.

277
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:30,256
Done.

278
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:38,110
Why hasn't it been canceled yet?

279
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:39,590
How much time has passed?

280
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:42,070
I've already made my point clear.

281
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:44,270
It was an accidental touch of the hand.

282
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:47,710
I'm telling you,
Zhao Hao's penalty must be canceled.

283
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:50,030
Otherwise, I will file a complaint
against you with the Consumers Association.

284
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:56,048
What made you so angry early in the morning?

285
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:58,270
Hurry up, Dr. Shen.

286
00:17:58,270 --> 00:17:59,410
I'm going to work.

287
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:00,592
Hurry.

288
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:09,230
This task must be done swiftly,
decisively and efficiently.

289
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:11,510
Above all, we have to get the maximum benefit
at the lowest cost.

290
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:13,190
- Understand?
- Yes.

291
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:15,350
Secrecy is of the utmost importance,

292
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:17,110
especially to keep it a secret from Mr. Shen.
Understand?

293
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:19,310
- You can leave now.
- Okay.

294
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:22,670
You stepped on my foot.

295
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:26,710
May I know how you tricked Mr. Shen out?

296
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:29,790
I have my own wits.

297
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:33,810
Alright, go on your mission.

298
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:35,270
- Alright.
- Impressive.

299
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:36,880
I'm counting on you guys.

300
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:41,590
How smart I am.

301
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:52,990
This will not be an easy task, bro.

302
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:54,710
I wouldn't take it if it was easy.

303
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:55,790
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

304
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:30,320
Retreat.

305
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:03,670
Baby.

306
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:05,390
Let me check your mouth.

307
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:11,430
It's mealtime.

308
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:16,550
It's time to eat.

309
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:20,390
Kang, come.

310
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:21,456
Come.

311
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:41,110
Let me check your eyes.

312
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:55,390
You need to adapt well to the new environment.

313
00:21:58,670 --> 00:21:59,990
Don't run out.

314
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:52,750
Look, it's pregnant.

315
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:54,070
Look.

316
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:56,030
Its little belly is so round.

317
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:57,150
Let's check to see

318
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:58,390
how many babies she has later.

319
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:02,070
You are so lucky to be here, aren't you?

320
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:03,070
Be good.

321
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:04,570
Does it itch?

322
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:06,190
Let me scratch for you.

323
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:16,070
Welcome to Tianlin.

324
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:24,976
Thanks.

325
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:30,310
A distraction, right?

326
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:32,790
You're amazing.

327
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:34,710
No.

328
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:36,910
I really wanted to eat this shaved ice

329
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:38,830
and then just happened

330
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:40,510
to think of those poor stray animals.

331
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:42,430
And then coincidentally, Yuxian and Shen

332
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:43,990
volunteered to catch them.

333
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:45,150
What could I do?

334
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:47,050
Everything just fell into place.

335
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:48,830
That's true.

336
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:52,990
Tian Tian, your tric…

337
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:54,150
Tric what?

338
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:55,190
Triscuit.

339
00:23:58,736 --> 00:23:59,888
Stop.

340
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:01,936
Sit down.

341
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:07,830
How many times have I told you?

342
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:10,790
We don't have that much budget anymore.

343
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:11,870
There's no more room

344
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:13,510
to accommodate so many animals.

345
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:15,630
You must think of a way

346
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:16,830
to solve this problem.

347
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:17,870
Do you understand?

348
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:20,870
Or we can send them to the shelter.

349
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:22,550
It's so easy to get infected.

350
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:24,530
The mortality rate is so high.

351
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:25,550
Will that work?

352
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:27,750
Or post them

353
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:29,950
in our adoption group
to allow families to adopt them.

354
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:32,610
Don't you have any common sense?
Even shelters are not a good option,

355
00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:34,990
let alone family adoption.

356
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:36,112
Well.

357
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:39,030
You vetoed both options.

358
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:40,270
What do you suggest?

359
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:43,030
Now

360
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:45,648
we can only resort to the adoption platform
of the Lvchuan Group.

361
00:24:45,648 --> 00:24:46,690
No way.

362
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:47,790
Why not?

363
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:48,950
Isn't it obvious?

364
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:51,030
What Lvchuan offers is paid adoption.

365
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:53,710
Tian Tian does not want it
to become a tool for making money.

366
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:54,800
Right, Tian Tian?

367
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:57,750
How many times have I told you,

368
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:58,832
especially you?

369
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:01,250
This is not profiteering at all.

370
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:03,470
It's just a way to do good.

371
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:04,590
All the money

372
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:06,070
is truly spent

373
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:07,710
on stray animals.

374
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:09,150
It's no different in essence to the charity

375
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:11,470
that Tianlin is doing now. Do you understand?

376
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:12,710
There's a difference.

377
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:14,230
At least I know every cent

378
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:15,270
donated to Tianlin

379
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:17,590
has been truly spent on pets.

380
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:20,070
What about Lvchuan?
Where did the money go? How much is spent?

381
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:21,168
It's invisible.

382
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:25,110
You don't trust me, do you?

383
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:26,690
Of course, I trust you.

384
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:29,710
But you don't have much of a hand
in the group now.

385
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:31,630
You don't know

386
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:32,750
how the specific handlers below are doing.

387
00:25:36,176 --> 00:25:37,290
Okay.

388
00:25:37,290 --> 00:25:38,390
How about this?

389
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:40,230
I happened to see a newly opened cat café

390
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:42,210
on the street the other day

391
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:44,710
posting a lot of ads for buying kittens.

392
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:45,750
Why don't we try there?

393
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:48,310
Of course, I'm just making a casual suggestion.

394
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:51,510
They have a location

395
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:52,710
and people to carefully feed

396
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:54,230
and play with animals.

397
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:55,230
This idea is brilliant.

398
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:56,590
What do you think, Mr. Shen?

399
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:58,710
Let's see later.

400
00:25:58,710 --> 00:26:00,030
That's a half agreement, then.

401
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:01,104
I'm leaving.

402
00:26:01,104 --> 00:26:02,430
I proposed this plan.

403
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:03,550
May the odds be ever in your favor.

404
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:15,632
Mr. Shen.

405
00:26:18,430 --> 00:26:19,430
What do you mean?

406
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:20,910
- Mine
- I know.

407
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:21,910
I bought it.

408
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:24,190
- I know.
- I personally drove to buy it.

409
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:25,264
Can't I drink it?

410
00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:27,650
You have hands and feet.
You can go get your own.

411
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:29,190
I have no money, bro.

412
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:35,990
Fine, I don't like it anyway.

413
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:52,350
Over here are the breeds of cats
that we are currently selling,

414
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:54,550
such as British Shorthair,
American Shorthair, Ragdoll,

415
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:56,430
Siamese, Scottish Fold and Garfield.

416
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:57,830
We have

417
00:26:57,830 --> 00:26:59,150
both common and uncommon ones.

418
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:01,630
Also,

419
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:03,650
we do sell some pet equipment.

420
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:05,110
Mainly imported ones.

421
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:06,990
Of course,
there are some domestically produced ones too.

422
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:10,110
How about I take you in to take a look?

423
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:12,670
No need. Mr. Ma, we are short on time.

424
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:14,230
Why not go directly to see the cat room?

425
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:15,970
No problem. Come.

426
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:17,070
Please follow me.

427
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:20,432
Let's go.

428
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:25,040
Please follow me.

429
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:29,550
Be careful. The stairs are slippery.

430
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:35,990
Director Tian, take a look.

431
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:37,830
This is our cat room.

432
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:42,590
Sir, these are the kittens we just rescued.

433
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:44,270
They are very poor in socialization.

434
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:45,990
You will need to put a lot of effort
into feeding them.

435
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:48,070
What a thing to say.

436
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:50,870
Director Tian, you can absolutely trust us.

437
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:54,190
I used to breed competitive-level cats.

438
00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:56,270
You know, these kinds of cats

439
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:58,870
have undergone strict pedigree verification.

440
00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:00,870
I have a lot of experience
in taking care of them.

441
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:03,370
However,

442
00:28:03,370 --> 00:28:05,190
because these kinds of cats

443
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:06,610
are vulnerable,

444
00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:08,930
the cost
of raising them is naturally very high.

445
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:10,390
I was under a lot of pressure

446
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:12,030
to raise them,

447
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:14,270
so I transitioned to this cat café.

448
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:16,510
You can rest assured.

449
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:20,170
I can absolutely take good care
of these poor little ones.

450
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:21,390
Thank you.

451
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:26,750
Let's get the cats out.

452
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:35,190
These cats

453
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:37,830
are like my own children to me.

454
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:45,350
Right, get some cat food.

455
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:47,750
Hurry up and feed them.

456
00:28:55,390 --> 00:28:56,496
Give me.

457
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:05,430
That's very kind of you.

458
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:07,536
That's what I should do.

459
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:12,070
Director Tian, I've signed the agreement.

460
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:14,070
Now it only needs your signature.

461
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:17,390
Hold on, please.

462
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:19,590
Why don't you let the cats stay here
for some days first

463
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:21,910
and think it over?

464
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:23,270
What's there to consider?

465
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:25,170
What's there to consider, really?

466
00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:27,310
Mr. Ma has shown us around.

467
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:30,290
And the staff were very patient.

468
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:31,710
- What else are you worried about?
- I…

469
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:34,430
Director Tian, actually,

470
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:35,990
I'm really looking forward

471
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:37,470
to working with you.

472
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:39,830
After all, we all want to contribute

473
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:41,430
to helping

474
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:42,990
stray pets.

475
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:45,430
Why don't we do this?

476
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:46,590
If you have any pets

477
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:47,630
that aren't suitable

478
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:49,190
for adoption,

479
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:50,950
you can freely bring them to me.

480
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:52,190
Of course.

481
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:53,710
In return,

482
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:55,150
the routine check-ups

483
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:56,970
and vaccinations

484
00:29:56,970 --> 00:29:58,390
of all our cats

485
00:29:58,390 --> 00:29:59,990
can all be done

486
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:01,910
at your hospital.

487
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:05,070
I wonder what do you think?

488
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:07,750
No need. We are doing charity work.

489
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:09,270
It's not about business with you.

490
00:30:10,256 --> 00:30:11,270
Great!

491
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:13,070
Then I think we can sign.

492
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:14,128
Let me sign.

493
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:18,128
Let me stamp my handprint.

494
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:21,070
Done, sir.

495
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:22,750
Of course, you are more than welcome to do it

496
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:23,950
at our hospital if you insist.

497
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:25,470
We would be more than grateful.

498
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:29,190
So, let's have a pleasant cooperation.

499
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:30,224
I hope so.

500
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:32,950
- We'll leave then.
- All right.

501
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:33,968
Goodbye.

502
00:30:41,670 --> 00:30:43,110
This is killing two birds with one stone.

503
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:44,550
Shen has done a great job.

504
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:51,270
But Mr. Shen doesn't seem happy.

505
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:55,190
I guess it's because he thinks

506
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:56,590
Miao Café poached his group's client.

507
00:30:57,270 --> 00:30:58,710
How can you be so immature?

508
00:30:58,710 --> 00:30:59,750
What's wrong with you?

509
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:02,630
Haven't you guys noticed that the owner

510
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:04,390
of this cat café feeds stray cats
and pedigree cats

511
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:05,710
different cat food?

512
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:17,870
Personally, I can't accept

513
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:20,270
his differential treatment,

514
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:22,230
and I won't believe him.

515
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:23,350
Such a big store.

516
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:25,150
He wouldn't be so stingy
with the cat food, right?

517
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:27,750
Right, maybe your eyes are getting old.

518
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:29,030
Even if it's packed separately,

519
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:30,590
that doesn't mean
there's anything wrong with the ingredients.

520
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:31,750
Don't worry for nothing.

521
00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:34,390
Besides, the owner looks honest and simple.

522
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:35,470
He seems like a good person.

523
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:38,030
In Mr. Shen's view,

524
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:39,070
he's the only good man

525
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:40,590
in the world. Let's go.

526
00:31:49,904 --> 00:31:51,870
[Tianlin Animal Hospital]

527
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:53,230
Diandian is a regular customer here.

528
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:54,550
I know. It'll be your turn soon.

529
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:55,710
Okay. Wen Jing,

530
00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:57,590
get Diandian's medical history book.

531
00:31:57,590 --> 00:31:59,510
Please wait here. We will be right with you.

532
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:01,790
Wen Jing,

533
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:03,750
please sterilize my acupuncture tools.

534
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:04,848
Wen Jing.

535
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:09,230
Wen Jing, get my sterilization tool, Wen Jing.

536
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:11,470
- Okay, I got it.
- Where's my trimmer's charger?

537
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:12,750
- Wen Jing.
- Wait.

538
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:14,510
Tian, where's Wen Jing?

539
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:15,590
I'm very busy right now.

540
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:17,670
- Not a clue.
- Did she skip work?

541
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:19,030
Tian Yuxian, come help me.

542
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:20,750
- I don't have time.
- The trimmer is over there.

543
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:21,910
You go find a charger over there.

544
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:23,190
Here's today's…

545
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:25,710
The size is at the bottom left.

546
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:26,830
Go change to a larger one.

547
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:28,350
The size is on the far left.

548
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:33,470
Any problems noticed?

549
00:32:33,470 --> 00:32:34,530
I found out

550
00:32:34,530 --> 00:32:36,470
everyone couldn't do without Wen Jing.

551
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:37,710
Where is she?

552
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:39,470
I let her go to the Miao Café.

553
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:40,592
Why?

554
00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:42,288
I'm back.

555
00:32:57,430 --> 00:33:00,070
The atmosphere of our shop is good, isn't it?

556
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:02,330
We have pedigree cats.

557
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:03,710
If there's one

558
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:05,070
you're interested in,

559
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:06,990
I'll give you a 20% discount.

560
00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:08,112
How does that sound?

561
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:14,670
- Hello.
- Hello.

562
00:33:14,670 --> 00:33:16,230
Are you here to buy a cat?

563
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:19,390
No. Is this a cat café?

564
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:22,390
Yes. What would you like to drink?

565
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:24,670
I would like a glass of orange juice.

566
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:26,470
Alright, I will get it for you right away.

567
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:29,390
We just got a couple of kittens.

568
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:30,670
You can feel free

569
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:33,350
to play with them later.

570
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:36,190
- Please have a seat.
- Okay.

571
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:49,510
Here it is.

572
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:52,390
Your orange juice.

573
00:33:52,390 --> 00:33:53,488
Thank you.

574
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:56,790
Sir, your cats are really lively.

575
00:33:58,390 --> 00:34:01,070
That's because you are so pretty

576
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:02,510
and they can't contain their excitement.

577
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:04,430
To be honest,

578
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:05,710
our cats

579
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:06,950
are lively all day long.

580
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:08,430
No matter when you come,

581
00:34:08,430 --> 00:34:10,590
they are guaranteed to be full of vigor.

582
00:34:12,790 --> 00:34:14,010
You can look around.

583
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:15,120
I will leave you alone.

584
00:34:21,910 --> 00:34:23,830
I stayed in that shop for almost a day.

585
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:25,830
Just like what Mr. Ma said,

586
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:27,370
not a single cat had slept.

587
00:34:27,370 --> 00:34:28,750
That's really strange.

588
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:31,470
Cats usually sleep for a dozen hours a day.

589
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:32,910
If it's because they'd been drugged--

590
00:34:32,910 --> 00:34:34,000
I think so too.

591
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:36,030
Just like those unregulated cat cafés.

592
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:37,550
They inject stimulants into the cats

593
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:39,590
just to make them sleep less
and play with the customers.

594
00:34:40,709 --> 00:34:42,709
This is too much.

595
00:34:42,709 --> 00:34:44,430
No, I must hurry up and get those cats back.

596
00:34:45,109 --> 00:34:47,149
What use is there for you to rush over now?

597
00:34:47,149 --> 00:34:48,950
Will Mr. Ma just give the cats back to you?

598
00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:50,430
We can't watch cats be sent to their death.

599
00:34:50,990 --> 00:34:52,550
I understand your feelings now.

600
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:54,669
But we can't rush into this.

601
00:34:56,470 --> 00:34:58,350
Those stray cats are already weak.

602
00:34:58,350 --> 00:35:00,070
If they consume those drugs
in large amounts for a long time,

603
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:01,190
the harm is great.

604
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:04,080
Director.

605
00:35:08,350 --> 00:35:10,990
What? You want to get the cats back?

606
00:35:11,790 --> 00:35:14,590
We don't intend to take them back.

607
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:16,590
The cats that were sent over previously

608
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:18,910
hadn't been fully dewormed and examined.

609
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:20,870
So we would like to make sure
everything is properly done

610
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:22,830
and then send them back here.

611
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:23,952
Yes.

612
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:26,710
That's quite troublesome.

613
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:27,790
And furthermore,

614
00:35:27,790 --> 00:35:29,850
your hospital is so far away from here.

615
00:35:29,850 --> 00:35:31,950
If the cats need to be examined,

616
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:35,670
I could easily just find a local pet clinic.

617
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:36,816
Isn't that so?

618
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:39,390
Sir, the cats

619
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:40,950
interact with so many customers every day.

620
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:42,430
What if someone carries a germ?

621
00:35:42,430 --> 00:35:43,570
They're too vulnerable to infection.

622
00:35:43,570 --> 00:35:45,750
So we just want to take them

623
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:46,870
and get them vaccinated right away.

624
00:35:56,430 --> 00:35:58,150
Sir,

625
00:35:58,150 --> 00:35:59,470
you are really unreliable.

626
00:35:59,470 --> 00:36:00,970
It was you who said yourself yesterday

627
00:36:00,970 --> 00:36:03,470
that you'd send all the cats over to us
for an examination, correct?

628
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:05,310
24 hours haven't even passed yet,

629
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:06,390
and you've changed your tune!

630
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:08,310
Fine.

631
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:09,350
We won't let you keep the cats here anymore.

632
00:36:09,350 --> 00:36:10,350
Give them back to me right now.

633
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:14,110
Since we've all laid it out,

634
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:15,150
mark my words.

635
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:23,150
Party B should give the animals agreed upon
in this agreement to Party A

636
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:25,750
from the effective date of the agreement.

637
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:26,910
Meanwhile,

638
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:29,910
Party B cannot demand Party A
to return the adopted animals

639
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:31,430
as long as Party A has not violated

640
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:32,670
any obligations agreed upon.

641
00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:35,750
We did sign the adoption agreement, didn't we?

642
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:38,230
Besides,
the management rights over the cats now

643
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:39,230
belong to me.

644
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:41,070
If I really were to take them

645
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:42,470
for a check-up,

646
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:45,630
I would be the one deciding
which hospital to go to.

647
00:36:46,350 --> 00:36:47,530
You have no right to interfere,

648
00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:49,230
let alone claim them back.

649
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:50,430
You should look again

650
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:52,310
at Clause 12 of the third term.

651
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:53,830
There, it clearly states
that under any circumstances,

652
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:56,350
if Party A mistreats the cats,

653
00:36:56,350 --> 00:36:57,790
Party B has the right to reclaim them.

654
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:02,430
Which eye of yours saw me mistreating animals?

655
00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:04,630
What evidence do you have to prove

656
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:05,950
my abuse of stray cats?

657
00:37:05,950 --> 00:37:07,710
You won't let us vaccinate the cats.

658
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:09,030
Isn't that abuse?

659
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:10,950
Stop it.

660
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:12,430
I'm about to close up the shop.

661
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:14,710
Let's not waste each other's time.

662
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:15,830
You--

663
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:17,830
What are you doing?

664
00:37:17,830 --> 00:37:19,230
Why did you stop me?

665
00:37:21,350 --> 00:37:23,670
Mr. Ma was being cocky just

666
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:24,950
because we didn't have any evidence.

667
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:26,390
He's nothing but a sanctimonious man.

668
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:27,670
He's not a decent person.

669
00:37:30,070 --> 00:37:31,088
Are you done talking?

670
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:33,030
Did I tell you to sign?

671
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:35,030
Hadn't I been hinting

672
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:36,270
that you shouldn't sign?

673
00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:38,070
Did you give me a chance to speak?

674
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:40,430
Didn't you say he was honest?

675
00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:45,030
I admit

676
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:47,150
I'm a bad judge of character.

677
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:52,550
Actually, it's not that bad.

678
00:37:54,590 --> 00:37:55,750
What does it mean?

679
00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:56,990
After all, you chose

680
00:37:56,990 --> 00:37:58,430
to collaborate with me,

681
00:37:58,430 --> 00:38:00,470
which could be considered the peak
of your life.

682
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:03,790
I don't have time for jokes now.

683
00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:04,976
What should we do?

684
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:07,270
What's the use of your anxiety now?

685
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:08,550
There will always be a solution.

686
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:09,950
Go back first and think about it.

687
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:11,190
Go home or return to the office?

688
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:14,230
I just remembered I'd got something else to do.

689
00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:16,150
I'll go take care of that first.

690
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:17,190
You can go back.

691
00:38:19,888 --> 00:38:21,030
Just go.

692
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:22,032
What is it?

693
00:38:22,032 --> 00:38:23,088
I'm not telling you.

694
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,680
[Miao Café]

695
00:42:15,470 --> 00:42:16,496
It's me.

696
00:42:17,630 --> 00:42:18,670
Why are you here?

697
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:19,950
Hadn't you gone back?

698
00:42:19,950 --> 00:42:22,230
Your behavior this afternoon was so strange.

699
00:42:22,230 --> 00:42:23,230
How could I not be concerned about you?

700
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:24,350
Sure enough, I guessed right.

701
00:42:30,310 --> 00:42:31,910
You're really going

702
00:42:31,910 --> 00:42:33,190
to burglarize?

703
00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:34,550
This isn't burglary.

704
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:35,990
I'm gathering evidence of a crime.

705
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:38,190
Look how strange the kitten is behaving.

706
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:39,830
They must have been fed stimulants.

707
00:42:48,310 --> 00:42:49,910
- Do you know how to pick locks?
- What?

708
00:42:49,910 --> 00:42:51,630
There's definitely something I want
in this cabinet.

709
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:53,830
What are you doing?

710
00:42:53,830 --> 00:42:56,030
Do you know you're committing a crime?

711
00:42:56,030 --> 00:42:58,270
How can I just watch you commit a crime?

712
00:42:58,270 --> 00:42:59,344
Let's go.
