1
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:41,401
Before this thing happens

2
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:42,902
Never tell Shen Mi

3
00:01:42,902 --> 00:01:43,703
Why?

4
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:46,606
Tian Tian

5
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,741
How many times have I told you

6
00:01:48,741 --> 00:01:50,977
Secrets are used to make things come true, words are used to reveal failures.

7
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:54,247
Hype it before it’s done

8
00:01:54,247 --> 00:01:55,281
What did I say?

9
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:56,182
Didn't work

10
00:01:56,182 --> 00:01:58,384
Not enough success, more than enough failure

11
00:02:00,987 --> 00:02:01,788
He definitely is

12
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:02,922
Talk about me like this

13
00:02:02,922 --> 00:02:03,656
Don't say it

14
00:02:03,656 --> 00:02:05,458
You learned so well

15
00:02:06,326 --> 00:02:07,360
I can imagine it all

16
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,628
His face

17
00:02:09,028 --> 00:02:09,562
In order not to see

18
00:02:09,562 --> 00:02:10,864
His face

19
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:12,899
Don't tell him

20
00:02:12,899 --> 00:02:13,666
And let him know

21
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:14,968
I achieved it alone

22
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:16,736
He will never dare to look down on me again

23
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:22,976
Don't say it

24
00:02:45,798 --> 00:02:47,267
morning

25
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:47,901
come on

26
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:49,869
Come on morning

27
00:02:49,869 --> 00:02:50,436
come on

28
00:02:54,207 --> 00:02:55,108
Good morning, Lao Chen

29
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:56,042
morning

30
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:57,410
come on

31
00:03:01,814 --> 00:03:02,182
morning

32
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:02,882
come on

33
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:05,818
What's going on? This is

34
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:11,824
Do not worry

35
00:03:11,824 --> 00:03:13,092
With my aunt’s big mouth

36
00:03:13,092 --> 00:03:14,494
I must know everything now

37
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:17,931
What should I do?

38
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:19,332
brother

39
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:20,667
you have to help me

40
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,068
What else does your sister like?

41
00:03:22,068 --> 00:03:22,869
Like to eat

42
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:24,204
What to eat then?

43
00:03:25,338 --> 00:03:26,139
mango

44
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:27,507
Anything related to mango

45
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:28,441
She likes to eat

46
00:03:29,442 --> 00:03:30,877
That Jiu'anli shopping mall

47
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,412
A new mango shop opened

48
00:03:32,645 --> 00:03:34,013
If you can get it for her

49
00:03:34,013 --> 00:03:35,348
As for that mango smoothie

50
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:35,782
I think she likes it

51
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:36,416
OK

52
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:37,083
Wait a moment

53
00:03:38,918 --> 00:03:39,619
come on

54
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:41,821
Are you sick

55
00:04:03,676 --> 00:04:04,210
aunt

56
00:04:05,545 --> 00:04:06,779
Aunt, this is me

57
00:04:06,779 --> 00:04:07,480
Tian Yuxian

58
00:04:07,947 --> 00:04:09,616
What's wrong with Shen Chen?

59
00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:10,850
in a hurry

60
00:04:11,117 --> 00:04:13,419
He has big things to do

61
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,622
What big thing can he do?

62
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:17,090
It’s a date. What else can we do?

63
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:19,425
What did you want me to do?

64
00:04:19,692 --> 00:04:20,560
No battery

65
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:22,362
How many times have I told you

66
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:23,096
Put the power supply here

67
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:24,197
You can't find it yourself

68
00:04:24,197 --> 00:04:25,365
You let me pull it out every time

69
00:04:25,365 --> 00:04:26,065
you really are

70
00:04:26,065 --> 00:04:26,866
You think I'm not busy enough?

71
00:04:26,866 --> 00:04:27,734
no

72
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:28,368
hold

73
00:04:43,249 --> 00:04:44,450
You have plans for the evening

74
00:04:45,985 --> 00:04:47,120
Change the time

75
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,221
Grandpa let me go

76
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:49,689
Ask you to come too

77
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:50,723
Can't change

78
00:04:51,157 --> 00:04:52,158
I don't have time to play with you today

79
00:04:52,158 --> 00:04:52,759
Doctor-patient game

80
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:53,626
Next time

81
00:04:54,093 --> 00:04:55,495
What are your plans?

82
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:56,863
No comment

83
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:35,068
Excuse me

84
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:36,769
I am Tian Tian from Tianlin Hospital

85
00:05:36,769 --> 00:05:37,970
There was too much traffic on the way here.

86
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:38,838
I'm really sorry

87
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,573
It doesn't matter. I understand. I understand.

88
00:05:40,907 --> 00:05:42,108
You are a member of Hanlu Charity

89
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:42,909
Director Han

90
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:43,876
Nice to meet you

91
00:05:44,977 --> 00:05:47,280
My surname is Liu Liu Cheng

92
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,015
He is the person in charge of Han Lu

93
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:50,717
Excuse me

94
00:05:50,717 --> 00:05:51,918
Look, I haven't figured it out yet.

95
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:52,852
Just scream

96
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,321
It's okay, Dean Tian

97
00:05:55,321 --> 00:05:56,656
Many people said it wrong

98
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:00,259
Dean Tian

99
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:01,961
our first meeting

100
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:03,796
I'll toast you

101
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:07,066
Director Liu

102
00:06:07,066 --> 00:06:08,401
Let me tell you the truth

103
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:10,336
I'm a drunk person

104
00:06:10,336 --> 00:06:11,838
And the wine isn’t very good either.

105
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:13,906
If you drink alcohol, you will definitely drink too much.

106
00:06:13,906 --> 00:06:14,974
so i'm afraid

107
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:16,743
It won't be easy for us to talk later.

108
00:06:18,244 --> 00:06:20,079
Well, since you can't drink it

109
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,647
I can't force it either

110
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:22,415
these are

111
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:23,983
Bad habits of wine table culture

112
00:06:23,983 --> 00:06:25,418
So we don’t need to advocate

113
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:26,452
Dean Tian

114
00:06:26,452 --> 00:06:27,520
Otherwise we will

115
00:06:27,854 --> 00:06:29,422
Use this juice instead of wine

116
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:30,289
How is it? Still healthy?

117
00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:31,124
Ok, Ok

118
00:06:32,358 --> 00:06:33,493
thank you thank you

119
00:06:42,201 --> 00:06:42,668
Come

120
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:48,441
Thank you grandpa

121
00:06:50,643 --> 00:06:54,147
Looking back, I saw Dr. Oda

122
00:06:54,647 --> 00:06:56,649
I need to criticize her properly

123
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:00,253
Why

124
00:07:01,687 --> 00:07:03,456
She promised so well back then

125
00:07:04,557 --> 00:07:06,959
Need psychological care

126
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:08,928
And make sure you’re in a good mood

127
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:09,929
The result is now

128
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:12,298
Didn't accomplish anything at all

129
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:14,934
Grandpa, you misunderstood Dr. Tian

130
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:17,170
I've just been thinking about something

131
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:18,704
Hospital management matters

132
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:21,007
Then why is she

133
00:07:21,007 --> 00:07:22,542
Didn't come back with you

134
00:07:23,876 --> 00:07:25,077
She asked me for leave

135
00:07:26,145 --> 00:07:27,280
What specifically?

136
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:29,982
I don't know. She didn't tell me.

137
00:07:31,818 --> 00:07:34,220
You should care more about her

138
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,723
Maybe she is now

139
00:07:38,724 --> 00:07:40,660
What difficulties did you encounter?

140
00:07:42,895 --> 00:07:44,096
It's not even possible to say

141
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,732
After all, she is now

142
00:07:46,732 --> 00:07:48,935
I'm with you every day

143
00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:50,837
nearest person

144
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:52,972
Do you know

145
00:07:59,445 --> 00:08:00,413
Got it, grandpa

146
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:03,683
You should go back early

147
00:08:04,283 --> 00:08:05,651
You also spend more time with young people

148
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:06,853
socialize

149
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:08,855
Don't always talk to an old man like me

150
00:08:08,855 --> 00:08:09,922
stay together

151
00:08:12,425 --> 00:08:13,860
Let me have another drink with you

152
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:21,968
Their dishes are very good

153
00:08:25,404 --> 00:08:26,138
every year we

154
00:08:26,138 --> 00:08:28,140
They will allocate a certain amount of funds

155
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,442
Come give these stray pets

156
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:30,243
sterilize

157
00:08:30,576 --> 00:08:32,044
Especially in the next two months

158
00:08:32,044 --> 00:08:33,145
This stray cat

159
00:08:33,145 --> 00:08:34,580
Their estrus period has arrived

160
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:35,781
So now

161
00:08:35,781 --> 00:08:37,517
This is the peak period for sterilization

162
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:38,284
understand

163
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:38,985
we will do our best

164
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:40,052
Be cooperative

165
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:41,587
Did you bring any?

166
00:08:41,587 --> 00:08:42,588
Related to this information

167
00:08:42,588 --> 00:08:43,456
can i have a look

168
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:44,290
Some

169
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:46,726
I'm just ready

170
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:47,326
Take a look

171
00:08:47,326 --> 00:08:48,127
This is from our hospital

172
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:48,961
some introduction

173
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:51,931
Managed by Han Lu

174
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:53,299
Millions of charity donations

175
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:55,501
Stray dogs rescued every year

176
00:08:55,501 --> 00:08:56,335
stray cat

177
00:08:56,335 --> 00:08:57,503
There are thousands of them

178
00:08:57,503 --> 00:08:58,104
many hospitals

179
00:08:58,104 --> 00:08:59,305
Everyone wants to cooperate with us

180
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:00,940
But we are concerned about this

181
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,308
of cooperative hospitals

182
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:04,043
Qualifications, hardware

183
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:05,411
including their professional standards

184
00:09:05,411 --> 00:09:06,279
We all have to do one

185
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:07,446
comprehensive inspection

186
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:09,215
Don't worry about this

187
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:09,982
Our hospital

188
00:09:09,982 --> 00:09:11,317
since my father founded

189
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:12,852
It has been more than twenty years

190
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:13,586
And last year

191
00:09:13,586 --> 00:09:14,420
A comprehensive

192
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:15,454
Upgrade

193
00:09:15,454 --> 00:09:16,222
Hardware certainly can

194
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:17,523
Meet your requirements

195
00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:18,558
And from our hospital

196
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:19,325
all doctors

197
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:20,426
All are professional

198
00:09:20,426 --> 00:09:22,495
Medically qualified professionals

199
00:09:22,495 --> 00:09:23,729
So what about business capabilities?

200
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:24,931
absolutely no problem

201
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:26,165
That's great

202
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:31,771
Tian Tian

203
00:09:32,538 --> 00:09:33,205
Shen Chen

204
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:34,373
Are you off work?

205
00:09:34,373 --> 00:09:35,308
Why are you back?

206
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:36,776
Where is Tian Tianren?

207
00:09:37,276 --> 00:09:38,811
She went to talk to the people from Han Lu

208
00:09:39,812 --> 00:09:42,448
Anyway, I just had something to do when I went out.

209
00:09:42,448 --> 00:09:43,382
Han Lu

210
00:09:44,684 --> 00:09:45,885
It's the rescue company

211
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:47,186
Korean House for Stray Pets

212
00:09:47,186 --> 00:09:48,588
No, you know that too

213
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:49,655
where have they gone

214
00:09:49,989 --> 00:09:51,090
What happened to Cuiyun Restaurant?

215
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,058
This Hanlu is a group of people

216
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:52,959
In the name of public welfare

217
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,427
A liar who cheats money and sex

218
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:55,227
Cheating

219
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:58,798
Call Tian Tian

220
00:09:58,798 --> 00:09:59,966
Okay, got it, got it

221
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:01,267
Didn't you tell me earlier?

222
00:10:07,506 --> 00:10:08,541
I just looked at the information

223
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:09,942
It's also the same as ours here

224
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:11,077
This kind of partner

225
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:12,445
Requirements are relatively up to standard

226
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,581
Director Liu is also welcome

227
00:10:15,581 --> 00:10:16,415
Come to our hospital anytime

228
00:10:16,415 --> 00:10:17,450
Visiting guidance

229
00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:20,086
As for the price, you can rest assured.

230
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:20,920
we can do it

231
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,922
The lowest price at the same level

232
00:10:23,255 --> 00:10:24,624
Because after all we also hope

233
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,559
Do your best for public welfare

234
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,161
The price is easy to negotiate

235
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:31,297
Dean Tian’s

236
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:34,066
Enthusiasm for public welfare

237
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:35,501
I'm very touched

238
00:10:35,935 --> 00:10:36,802
Thank you very much too

239
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:40,606
sorry sorry

240
00:10:40,606 --> 00:10:40,940
It's okay It's okay

241
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:41,140
I

242
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,241
I'm coming I'm coming

243
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:52,018
Excuse me

244
00:10:52,518 --> 00:10:53,185
to you

245
00:10:53,185 --> 00:10:54,654
Okay, so careless

246
00:10:56,889 --> 00:10:57,890
Then

247
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:00,426
I wish we could be able to

248
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:01,260
Successful cooperation

249
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,294
Happy cooperation

250
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:14,106
Tian Tian answer the phone

251
00:11:14,106 --> 00:11:14,840
What's going on with this kid?

252
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,175
Why haven't you answered the phone?

253
00:11:16,575 --> 00:11:17,209
stop wasting time

254
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:18,277
Change clothes to save someone

255
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:22,615
Come

256
00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:24,283
This is their signature dish

257
00:11:24,283 --> 00:11:24,817
have a taste

258
00:11:30,122 --> 00:11:30,890
Dean Tian

259
00:11:31,724 --> 00:11:32,458
Are you okay?

260
00:11:35,961 --> 00:11:36,896
Director Liu

261
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:38,564
I'm going to the bathroom

262
00:11:39,065 --> 00:11:39,932
Is it really okay?

263
00:11:39,932 --> 00:11:40,599
It's OK

264
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:34,653
Dean Tian, ​​the appointment is over

265
00:12:34,653 --> 00:12:36,789
help me

266
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:37,523
what

267
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:38,691
help me

268
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:39,492
what are you doing

269
00:12:39,892 --> 00:12:40,760
What's wrong with you

270
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,468
Tian Tian, ​​what’s wrong with you?

271
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:54,640
Tian Peilan

272
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:56,175
Where is Tian Tian?

273
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:56,909
At Cuiyun Hotel

274
00:12:56,909 --> 00:12:57,943
You go there quickly

275
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:16,695
Dean Tian

276
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:19,365
Dean Tian

277
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:31,477
who are you

278
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:34,146
Do you know this is my box?

279
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:35,047
Get out of here quickly

280
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:52,765
what are you doing

281
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:54,300
are you crazy

282
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,602
When I was a kid, I just thought you were playful

283
00:13:56,602 --> 00:13:57,636
How can you do this now?

284
00:13:57,636 --> 00:13:59,138
What about the obscene and shameless things?

285
00:13:59,138 --> 00:13:59,572
I tell you

286
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:00,906
This is a misunderstanding, you know?

287
00:14:00,906 --> 00:14:01,607
what is misunderstanding

288
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:02,708
I've seen it all

289
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:03,809
Are you crazy?

290
00:14:03,809 --> 00:14:04,844
You don't even listen to my explanation

291
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:05,945
Shut up

292
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:07,947
Get out of Tianlin starting today

293
00:14:07,947 --> 00:14:08,814
don't let me see you again

294
00:14:08,814 --> 00:14:09,348
Did you hear that?

295
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:10,349
I tell you

296
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:11,817
If you want to hit me again, I'll hit you back.

297
00:14:11,817 --> 00:14:12,718
Fight back

298
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:13,719
Come

299
00:14:14,653 --> 00:14:15,454
Stop fighting. Stop fighting.

300
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:15,721
Look at Tian Tian

301
00:14:15,721 --> 00:14:16,722
Stop it, it's a misunderstanding

302
00:14:16,722 --> 00:14:18,123
Let go, let go

303
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:22,928
Tian Tian

304
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:25,264
Tian Tian Tian Tian

305
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:26,398
What are you doing? This is

306
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:27,900
You won’t wait for me either

307
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:28,734
Driving so fast

308
00:14:29,068 --> 00:14:30,202
If I had known earlier, I would have driven slower.

309
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:31,537
Punched by a psycho

310
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:33,439
What's going on

311
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:35,207
this matter

312
00:14:35,774 --> 00:14:37,042
It's a bit complicated to explain

313
00:14:37,476 --> 00:14:38,677
Please stop making trouble, okay?

314
00:14:38,677 --> 00:14:40,212
Hurry up and call a car to take you to the hospital.

315
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:41,747
Look how she doesn't wake up

316
00:14:42,481 --> 00:14:43,215
Tian Tian

317
00:14:43,582 --> 00:14:45,084
Wake up, what's wrong?

318
00:14:52,324 --> 00:14:53,759
how about it doctor

319
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,095
from patient's blood

320
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:57,062
Checking results

321
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:58,097
we found a

322
00:14:58,097 --> 00:14:59,164
Illegal drug ingredients

323
00:14:59,798 --> 00:15:00,799
This drug ingredient

324
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:02,167
Can cause coma

325
00:15:02,167 --> 00:15:04,003
and pathological symptoms of loss of consciousness

326
00:15:05,104 --> 00:15:05,938
last year or two

327
00:15:05,938 --> 00:15:07,339
There are many lawless people

328
00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:08,807
secretly using this

329
00:15:08,807 --> 00:15:10,042
Drugs with prohibited ingredients

330
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:12,144
exercise physical control over people

331
00:15:12,144 --> 00:15:13,479
to achieve criminal purpose

332
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:17,917
oh my god oh my god

333
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:18,884
So scary

334
00:15:18,884 --> 00:15:20,085
Fortunately it's okay

335
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:21,487
If it weren't for Shen Chen

336
00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:22,922
I'm not sure what will happen.

337
00:15:23,656 --> 00:15:24,490
Xiao Shen and the police

338
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,058
How's the record going?

339
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:27,693
Recording now

340
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:29,662
What about the one named Liu?

341
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,130
Caught it and handed it over to the police.

342
00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:32,598
Very good

343
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:33,899
So disgusting

344
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:35,467
Such people should be sentenced to a few more years

345
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:39,972
Doctor

346
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:40,940
What happened to that report?

347
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:45,044
Judging from the results of the inspection

348
00:15:45,377 --> 00:15:47,079
The amount of drug in the patient’s body

349
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:48,280
Not very high

350
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,749
Usually six to eight hours later

351
00:15:50,749 --> 00:15:53,385
The patient will regain all consciousness

352
00:15:53,852 --> 00:15:55,454
But I still recommend

353
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:56,889
Tonight she is still

354
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:58,657
It is better to stay in the hospital for observation for one night.

355
00:15:58,657 --> 00:15:59,959
Let's discuss it.

356
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:00,626
OK

357
00:16:01,226 --> 00:16:02,261
Thank you thank you doctor

358
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:03,762
Thank you doctor

359
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:19,578
Otherwise tonight

360
00:16:19,578 --> 00:16:21,413
I'll stay here with her

361
00:16:21,413 --> 00:16:22,414
You go back and rest first

362
00:16:22,414 --> 00:16:23,048
OK

363
00:16:25,784 --> 00:16:26,819
Otherwise

364
00:16:27,786 --> 00:16:28,988
I'll stay too

365
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,022
Let's go together

366
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:31,690
One more person means more effort

367
00:16:32,024 --> 00:16:34,426
What if something happens tonight?

368
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:36,128
You're such a bitch

369
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:36,895
What happened?

370
00:16:36,895 --> 00:16:37,763
What else can happen?

371
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:38,063
I mean

372
00:16:38,063 --> 00:16:39,098
Then what are you talking nonsense about?

373
00:16:39,098 --> 00:16:39,465
what do you mean

374
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:40,933
One more person means more effort

375
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:42,201
okay

376
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:44,770
Please stop making noise here, okay?

377
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:46,372
i stay

378
00:16:47,206 --> 00:16:47,773
She wakes up tomorrow

379
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:48,907
I'll send it back to her

380
00:16:49,975 --> 00:16:51,043
Aren't you going to work tomorrow?

381
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:52,044
Go back and rest early

382
00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:53,479
By the way

383
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,481
Take Sister Peilan with you

384
00:16:55,481 --> 00:16:56,048
OK

385
00:16:56,048 --> 00:16:57,016
along the way along the way

386
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:00,419
Lao Tian, ​​otherwise

387
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,255
I think that’s what I’ll do

388
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:06,158
Very rigorous and reasonable

389
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,093
That Mr. Shen

390
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,828
Then our Tian Tian

391
00:17:09,828 --> 00:17:10,996
Just tonight

392
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:13,565
Leave it to you

393
00:17:16,568 --> 00:17:17,136
OK

394
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:17,903
gone back

395
00:17:17,903 --> 00:17:19,204
Okay, slow down

396
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,141
goodbye

397
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:24,176
Slow down

398
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:41,360
Get on the bus

399
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:46,265
I send you

400
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:34,880
water

401
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:36,849
water

402
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:48,827
Coming Here Coming

403
00:18:49,528 --> 00:18:50,162
Come

404
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:21,126
Shen Mi

405
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:22,528
come out

406
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,720
Does it hurt?

407
00:19:50,255 --> 00:19:51,089
no pain

408
00:19:52,057 --> 00:19:52,858
Hard-spoken

409
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,428
Sit down and I'll tell you

410
00:19:59,298 --> 00:20:00,532
I'm telling you, brother

411
00:20:01,066 --> 00:20:02,334
My fist is harder

412
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:03,769
You didn't even look at that kid

413
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:05,003
What was the result of being beaten by me?

414
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:07,940
Thank you

415
00:20:08,907 --> 00:20:10,609
you are so disgusting

416
00:20:11,176 --> 00:20:12,878
But then again

417
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:13,979
so many years

418
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:16,181
The first time you said thank you to me

419
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:18,250
That's because you grew up

420
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,718
I haven't done anything to make me worry.

421
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:20,419
ok

422
00:20:21,086 --> 00:20:23,121
Isn't that because you are my brother?

423
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:26,358
your behavior

424
00:20:26,358 --> 00:20:27,459
Isn't it disgusting?

425
00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:28,760
It's OK

426
00:20:29,861 --> 00:20:31,296
I really want to punch you again

427
00:20:31,296 --> 00:20:32,497
That won't work

428
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:37,402
elder brother

429
00:20:39,104 --> 00:20:40,706
Do you also like Tian Tian?

430
00:20:44,376 --> 00:20:45,410
like

431
00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:48,180
I knew it

432
00:20:48,547 --> 00:20:49,548
I just like one

433
00:20:49,548 --> 00:20:51,216
People who persevere for their ideals

434
00:20:51,216 --> 00:20:52,284
okay

435
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:52,985
Give it to yourself every day

436
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:53,719
Add so much drama

437
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:54,886
Aren't you tired from acting?

438
00:20:54,886 --> 00:20:56,188
Just like it if you like it

439
00:20:56,188 --> 00:20:57,489
So many excuses

440
00:21:13,805 --> 00:21:14,573
I like it too

441
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:19,745
This time it doesn't matter whether you like it or not

442
00:21:21,146 --> 00:21:22,014
I want to chase her

443
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:37,829
You still laugh

444
00:21:37,829 --> 00:21:39,164
Lift me up

445
00:21:39,598 --> 00:21:40,165
right

446
00:21:46,104 --> 00:21:47,239
Can you be gentler?

447
00:21:49,107 --> 00:21:50,208
I'll come

448
00:22:11,063 --> 00:22:11,563
Come

449
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,201
what do you mean

450
00:22:20,105 --> 00:22:21,373
Come on, sit here

451
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,708
Don't sit down

452
00:22:24,242 --> 00:22:26,011
The two of us supervise each other

453
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:29,581
No need

454
00:22:29,581 --> 00:22:31,450
I already won the last round

455
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:33,118
What if I win another round?

456
00:22:33,118 --> 00:22:34,453
I feel like I'm bullying you

457
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:38,957
It's nothing, I'm leaving

458
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:41,426
Anyway, when she opens her eyes tomorrow morning

459
00:22:41,426 --> 00:22:43,161
The one I see is me

460
00:22:43,161 --> 00:22:44,963
It's okay if I stay later, actually

461
00:22:46,598 --> 00:22:47,265
That's okay

462
00:22:47,265 --> 00:22:48,166
Then you can wait

463
00:22:56,108 --> 00:22:57,576
Call me when you wake up

464
00:22:58,343 --> 00:22:59,077
fair

465
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:02,981
take good care of her

466
00:25:16,281 --> 00:25:17,349
I'm going to clean up

467
00:25:19,384 --> 00:25:20,852
You go to the office to rest first.

468
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,287
good

469
00:25:52,417 --> 00:25:53,919
Do not use detergent

470
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:58,323
Don't use bleach either

471
00:25:59,658 --> 00:26:01,226
Can't be washed with water either

472
00:26:03,862 --> 00:26:05,130
Do not wash with water

473
00:26:28,653 --> 00:26:31,022
How about I pay you a new one?

474
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:32,257
OK

475
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:35,226
I can not

476
00:26:35,226 --> 00:26:36,528
I feel a little distressed

477
00:26:36,528 --> 00:26:38,363
If you don't feel bad, can you have a long memory?

478
00:26:39,064 --> 00:26:39,564
do you know

479
00:26:39,564 --> 00:26:40,932
How dangerous is your behavior?

480
00:26:41,399 --> 00:26:42,934
Isn’t it just to help our Tian Lin?

481
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:44,102
weather the storm

482
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:45,403
Who knows how long it takes to have a meal?

483
00:26:45,403 --> 00:26:46,538
Something could still happen

484
00:26:46,538 --> 00:26:48,373
Who will give you business normally?

485
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,308
What kind of hospital is Tianlin?

486
00:26:50,575 --> 00:26:52,077
You want to be famous but not famous?

487
00:26:52,077 --> 00:26:53,078
It doesn't matter if we want to have a relationship

488
00:26:53,078 --> 00:26:54,346
Want strength but no strength

489
00:26:55,413 --> 00:26:56,181
The prerequisite for cooperation is

490
00:26:56,181 --> 00:26:57,549
Both sides have equal strength

491
00:26:57,949 --> 00:26:58,683
So Tian Lin wants

492
00:26:58,683 --> 00:26:59,317
With the powerful

493
00:26:59,317 --> 00:27:00,785
Cooperation with public welfare organizations

494
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:02,654
You must first strengthen yourself

495
00:27:02,654 --> 00:27:04,022
Otherwise no one will look for you

496
00:27:05,423 --> 00:27:06,291
yes

497
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:07,325
you are right

498
00:27:10,328 --> 00:27:11,596
You don’t have to pay for the clothes.

499
00:27:13,164 --> 00:27:13,732
but

500
00:27:14,199 --> 00:27:15,467
I hope next time

501
00:27:15,734 --> 00:27:17,268
The same thing happens again

502
00:27:17,268 --> 00:27:18,370
You have to tell me in advance

503
00:27:18,703 --> 00:27:20,171
we are partners

504
00:27:20,171 --> 00:27:21,640
You have to believe me, you know?

505
00:27:22,507 --> 00:27:23,541
sure

506
00:27:23,942 --> 00:27:25,176
I'll have a meeting at Midorikawa at nine o'clock

507
00:27:25,176 --> 00:27:25,844
I go first

508
00:27:26,344 --> 00:27:26,945
Wait a moment

509
00:27:27,379 --> 00:27:28,680
Just wear this

510
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:29,748
if not

511
00:27:29,748 --> 00:27:30,815
I don't have time to change it

512
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:32,117
Just wait a moment

513
00:27:40,692 --> 00:27:41,459
alright

514
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,328
Seriously?

515
00:27:43,695 --> 00:27:44,562
Seriously

516
00:27:44,863 --> 00:27:46,297
Although you are the vice president of Midorikawa

517
00:27:46,297 --> 00:27:47,732
But he is also a part of Tian Lin

518
00:27:47,732 --> 00:27:49,334
It’s just right to put our store logo on it

519
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:58,843
If you hadn't saved me in time yesterday

520
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:00,011
I'm done

521
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:00,979
thank you

522
00:28:03,648 --> 00:28:04,883
I didn't save you yesterday

523
00:28:22,067 --> 00:28:23,268
Be careful on the road

524
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:42,220
You replenish troops

525
00:28:42,654 --> 00:28:43,722
Wait me a moment

526
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:44,522
Don't go up first

527
00:28:46,658 --> 00:28:47,459
Don't go up first

528
00:28:51,496 --> 00:28:52,530
How to do this

529
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:54,399
Woohyun, please go out for a moment

530
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:56,968
I have something to tell Dr. Shen

531
00:29:03,108 --> 00:29:04,776
what happened yesterday

532
00:29:04,776 --> 00:29:06,444
Thank you very much

533
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,548
Don't be so polite

534
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:13,051
who told you

535
00:29:13,785 --> 00:29:15,220
It's Tian Peilan

536
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:16,287
Chen Yifan

537
00:29:16,287 --> 00:29:17,188
Still my brother

538
00:29:17,522 --> 00:29:18,423
Your brother

539
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:22,026
My brother, right

540
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:23,294
My surname is Shen too

541
00:29:23,294 --> 00:29:24,229
His surname is Shen too

542
00:29:24,229 --> 00:29:25,764
We were one family five hundred years ago

543
00:29:27,165 --> 00:29:27,999
It's your brother

544
00:29:27,999 --> 00:29:29,300
He told me personally

545
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,401
Said you saved me

546
00:29:30,401 --> 00:29:31,936
Then he is still a human being

547
00:29:32,203 --> 00:29:34,606
I mean he's very honest.

548
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:36,541
You are also very upright.

549
00:29:37,041 --> 00:29:37,909
thank you

550
00:29:37,909 --> 00:29:39,744
Then you go ahead and get busy. I'm leaving first.

551
00:29:43,047 --> 00:29:43,782
look

552
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:45,617
I not only saved you

553
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:47,485
I was even punched by that fool

554
00:29:47,886 --> 00:29:49,487
I've been waiting in line for several hours

555
00:29:49,487 --> 00:29:50,822
buy you that

556
00:29:50,822 --> 00:29:52,323
Internet celebrity mango smoothie

557
00:29:52,924 --> 00:29:54,826
How do you repay me

558
00:29:55,827 --> 00:29:56,861
What do you like to eat?

559
00:29:56,861 --> 00:29:57,862
what do you like to drink

560
00:29:57,862 --> 00:29:58,897
be my girlfriend

561
00:29:58,897 --> 00:29:59,764
impossible

562
00:29:59,764 --> 00:30:01,399
Think about it

563
00:30:01,399 --> 00:30:02,801
think about it think about it

564
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:03,334
I

565
00:30:03,868 --> 00:30:05,436
I thought about it

566
00:30:05,436 --> 00:30:07,005
Still impossible

567
00:30:07,005 --> 00:30:08,139
But apart from this

568
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:09,440
I can do everything else

569
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,575
I can repay you

570
00:30:25,423 --> 00:30:26,024
okay

571
00:30:26,624 --> 00:30:27,759
We're both cleared

572
00:30:29,093 --> 00:30:30,261
I'll buy that for you later too

573
00:30:30,261 --> 00:30:31,696
Internet celebrity mango smoothie

574
00:30:37,602 --> 00:30:39,537
If Shen Mi was yesterday

575
00:30:39,537 --> 00:30:41,039
did what i did

576
00:30:42,941 --> 00:30:44,142
Let you be his girlfriend

577
00:30:44,142 --> 00:30:44,943
will you promise him

578
00:30:47,045 --> 00:30:48,012
he

579
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:50,782
He won't ask

580
00:30:50,782 --> 00:30:52,116
Such a boring question?

581
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:12,937
This summit is very important

582
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:14,639
What about us?

583
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:15,907
Gotta be well prepared

584
00:31:15,907 --> 00:31:17,308
Mr. Shen, I have arranged everything.

585
00:31:17,308 --> 00:31:17,976
Do not worry

586
00:31:30,788 --> 00:31:31,589
Shen Mi

587
00:31:31,856 --> 00:31:33,057
This trademark is on your clothes

588
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:34,292
Is it from our group?

589
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:35,293
no

590
00:31:37,495 --> 00:31:39,297
This is our group meeting

591
00:31:39,297 --> 00:31:41,099
Is it appropriate for you to carry someone else’s trademark?

592
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:42,166
Today is not the departments

593
00:31:42,166 --> 00:31:43,368
Are you here to report on your work?

594
00:31:44,202 --> 00:31:44,869
I as a family

595
00:31:44,869 --> 00:31:46,037
Investors in pet hospitals

596
00:31:46,037 --> 00:31:47,505
Carrying a

597
00:31:47,505 --> 00:31:49,774
The exclusive trademark of this hospital

598
00:31:49,774 --> 00:31:51,009
I think there's no problem

599
00:31:51,342 --> 00:31:51,843
You

600
00:31:51,843 --> 00:31:52,844
Mr. Shen

601
00:31:54,612 --> 00:31:55,880
Everyone is here

602
00:31:56,381 --> 00:31:58,483
Otherwise, let’s get to the point.

603
00:32:00,718 --> 00:32:01,419
good

604
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,321
Let me report to you

605
00:32:03,321 --> 00:32:05,023
Work progress of the R&D department

606
00:32:05,456 --> 00:32:06,958
Since Dr. Gu Mingze

607
00:32:06,958 --> 00:32:08,026
After joining

608
00:32:08,526 --> 00:32:09,661
lymphoma targeted drugs

609
00:32:09,661 --> 00:32:10,695
R&D work

610
00:32:10,895 --> 00:32:11,996
made a major breakthrough

611
00:32:11,996 --> 00:32:13,164
and considerable progress

612
00:32:13,498 --> 00:32:14,866
Believe in the near future

613
00:32:15,133 --> 00:32:16,601
The finished drug will be available

614
00:32:17,969 --> 00:32:20,338
So this Thailand Veterinary Drug Summit

615
00:32:20,972 --> 00:32:22,106
This targeted drug

616
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:22,707
we will act as

617
00:32:22,707 --> 00:32:24,008
Key recommended projects

618
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:26,744
Where is Dr. Gu Mingze?

619
00:32:26,744 --> 00:32:28,146
He will also be mainly responsible for promoting

620
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:33,318
as before

621
00:32:33,318 --> 00:32:34,786
Head of R&D department

622
00:32:35,219 --> 00:32:36,120
Shen Mi

623
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:37,989
Are you going this time?

624
00:32:37,989 --> 00:32:38,656
go

625
00:32:39,223 --> 00:32:40,224
why not go

626
00:32:43,695 --> 00:32:45,363
In what name are you going?

627
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:51,169
Is there any problem?

628
00:32:55,573 --> 00:32:56,708
Come to the next topic

629
00:33:03,581 --> 00:33:05,383
What, say it again

630
00:33:07,418 --> 00:33:08,453
What about next month?

631
00:33:08,453 --> 00:33:09,287
you have to come with me

632
00:33:09,287 --> 00:33:10,521
On behalf of Tianlin Animal Hospital

633
00:33:10,521 --> 00:33:12,123
Go to the Veterinary Drug Summit

634
00:33:13,091 --> 00:33:14,125
Why

635
00:33:14,125 --> 00:33:14,959
Is this necessary?

636
00:33:14,959 --> 00:33:15,927
So necessary

637
00:33:15,927 --> 00:33:17,929
Especially for Tian Lin now

638
00:33:17,929 --> 00:33:19,330
By the way, I'll take you to open up a bit.

639
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:20,732
Your vision and thinking

640
00:33:20,732 --> 00:33:22,700
Learn from more strong people

641
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:23,501
The most important thing is

642
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:24,469
Something you are interested in

643
00:33:24,469 --> 00:33:25,370
global chain

644
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:26,838
Pet hospitals will also participate

645
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:28,206
And they are all very famous

646
00:33:29,574 --> 00:33:31,509
You don't want to start

647
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:33,044
You cultivated me vigorously, right?

648
00:33:33,044 --> 00:33:33,978
Have you taken a fancy to it?

649
00:33:33,978 --> 00:33:35,246
Some of my potential and growth

650
00:33:35,246 --> 00:33:36,814
Stop being narcissistic, okay?

651
00:33:37,482 --> 00:33:38,016
You are far from qualified

652
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:39,617
It's still a thousand miles away

653
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:41,185
Let’s talk about it after you pass it first.

654
00:33:46,758 --> 00:33:48,926
Veterinary Drug Summit

655
00:34:24,829 --> 00:34:25,530
Doctor Chen

656
00:34:25,963 --> 00:34:27,598
Don't worry, the surgery was a success

657
00:34:27,598 --> 00:34:28,933
But your Amy

658
00:34:28,933 --> 00:34:30,168
How many days will you need to be hospitalized for observation?

659
00:34:31,135 --> 00:34:31,869
Thank you Dr. Chen

660
00:34:31,869 --> 00:34:32,837
Thank you so much for your hard work

661
00:34:32,837 --> 00:34:33,938
this is what we should do

662
00:34:33,938 --> 00:34:35,406
Doctor Chen Doctor Chen

663
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,742
What are you doing, Wen Jing?

664
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:39,210
How many times have I told you

665
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:40,244
We healers

666
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:41,813
The mountain must collapse before it

667
00:34:41,813 --> 00:34:43,047
The color remains unchanged

668
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:46,117
What needs to be said slowly?

669
00:34:46,451 --> 00:34:47,418
Doctor Chen

670
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:48,820
Your property manager has called

671
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:50,688
Said that the water pipe burst in your house upstairs

672
00:34:50,688 --> 00:34:52,090
Flooded your home

673
00:34:54,025 --> 00:34:55,126
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

674
00:34:55,126 --> 00:34:56,027
Really

675
00:34:56,027 --> 00:34:56,727
Doctor Chen, this

676
00:34:56,961 --> 00:34:57,829
Doctor Chen

677
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,541
Doctor Chen

678
00:35:11,175 --> 00:35:12,810
What to do with your takeout?

679
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:14,045
You give the takeaway guy a call

680
00:35:14,045 --> 00:35:14,846
Let him send it to my home

681
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:09,967
Takeaway Takeaway Takeout

682
00:36:09,967 --> 00:36:10,568
wait

683
00:36:11,936 --> 00:36:12,970
Takeaway from Unit 2101

684
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:13,971
Is it from you?

685
00:36:13,971 --> 00:36:14,505
yes

686
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:15,406
See for yourself

687
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:18,442
What happened to this takeaway?

688
00:36:18,442 --> 00:36:19,944
Look how you eat it

689
00:36:19,944 --> 00:36:21,212
Is this for human consumption?

690
00:36:21,212 --> 00:36:22,380
No, I am following your request

691
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:23,047
Leave it at your doorstep

692
00:36:23,047 --> 00:36:24,182
I didn't know it would turn out like this

693
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:25,283
What is my request?

694
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:26,918
Eat it yourself

695
00:36:26,918 --> 00:36:28,186
Eat it yourself, I will give you a bad review

696
00:36:28,452 --> 00:36:29,053
etc

697
00:36:29,053 --> 00:36:29,520
what to do

698
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,254
sorry sorry

699
00:36:30,254 --> 00:36:31,389
I didn't know it would turn out like this

700
00:36:31,389 --> 00:36:32,523
Can you listen to my explanation?

701
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:33,357
To explain is to cover up

702
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:34,125
Let go

703
00:36:34,325 --> 00:36:35,293
Let go

704
00:36:35,726 --> 00:36:37,094
If you don't let go, I'll call the police

705
00:36:41,399 --> 00:36:42,400
What's your last name?

706
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,901
My surname is Zhao

707
00:36:43,901 --> 00:36:44,969
My surname is Chen

708
00:36:45,403 --> 00:36:46,737
I am a pet doctor

709
00:36:46,737 --> 00:36:47,638
I'm so busy today

710
00:36:47,638 --> 00:36:48,239
busy day

711
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:49,507
One day of surgery

712
00:36:49,507 --> 00:36:50,041
I already have it at home

713
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:51,008
Soaked in water

714
00:36:51,008 --> 00:36:52,176
I just want to eat something hot

715
00:36:52,176 --> 00:36:53,144
Takeaways look like this now

716
00:36:53,144 --> 00:36:54,078
How can I eat it?

717
00:36:54,946 --> 00:36:56,547
Can you pity me and pity me?

718
00:36:57,381 --> 00:36:58,282
Just wait, you

719
00:36:58,282 --> 00:37:00,284
I will definitely give you a bad review, definitely

720
00:37:00,284 --> 00:37:01,252
You wait

721
00:37:01,252 --> 00:37:02,520
sorry sorry

722
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,287
What are you sorry for?

723
00:37:03,654 --> 00:37:04,589
Wait you

724
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:26,244
It turns out my takeaway

725
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:27,411
It was broken by you

726
00:37:47,064 --> 00:37:48,199
Why are you following me?

727
00:37:50,468 --> 00:37:52,003
There's nothing for you to eat

728
00:37:54,038 --> 00:37:55,239
Don't be so pitiful

729
00:37:55,239 --> 00:37:56,307
look at me

730
00:37:57,341 --> 00:37:58,309
okay

731
00:37:58,743 --> 00:38:00,478
I really can't stand your little eyes

732
00:38:00,478 --> 00:38:01,145
gone

733
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:03,748
gone

734
00:38:05,249 --> 00:38:06,450
Look at you

735
00:38:06,817 --> 00:38:08,052
Why is it so dirty?

736
00:38:08,319 --> 00:38:09,587
Are you wanted by no one?

737
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:13,457
gone

738
00:38:16,494 --> 00:38:17,561
gone

739
00:38:34,011 --> 00:38:34,879
Carlo

740
00:38:35,446 --> 00:38:37,014
Be quiet Carlo

741
00:38:38,849 --> 00:38:40,518
Carlo what are you doing

742
00:38:41,385 --> 00:38:42,320
Carlo

743
00:38:43,254 --> 00:38:44,855
I see you swaying back and forth

744
00:38:47,224 --> 00:38:48,059
Carlo

745
00:38:50,628 --> 00:38:52,330
Where is your master?

746
00:38:54,198 --> 00:38:55,099
Carlo

747
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:57,168
Really

748
00:39:00,538 --> 00:39:01,405
This Shen Mi is really

749
00:39:01,405 --> 00:39:02,907
Unorganized and undisciplined

750
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:04,809
Don't say hello when you go out

751
00:39:15,419 --> 00:39:16,721
How is the hospital doing?

752
00:39:17,488 --> 00:39:19,256
Much better than expected

753
00:39:21,559 --> 00:39:22,159
Dr. Oda

754
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:23,027
no doubt about you

755
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:24,528
What's your physical condition?

756
00:39:26,163 --> 00:39:26,997
Do not worry

757
00:39:26,997 --> 00:39:28,332
Don't worry about this at all

758
00:39:35,973 --> 00:39:37,108
Why is he here?

759
00:39:42,246 --> 00:39:44,615
It's hard to explain this matter

760
00:39:45,082 --> 00:39:45,916
Anyway, he is now

761
00:39:45,916 --> 00:39:47,685
A regular employee of Tianlin Hospital

762
00:39:49,253 --> 00:39:50,187
It won't be Shen Hongyuan

763
00:39:50,187 --> 00:39:51,789
It was arranged on purpose, right?

764
00:39:52,123 --> 00:39:53,157
I hope it's his dad

765
00:39:53,157 --> 00:39:53,924
deliberately arranged

766
00:39:53,924 --> 00:39:55,926
It shows that he can still be a little motivated

767
00:39:56,327 --> 00:39:57,094
But Uncle Han

768
00:39:58,295 --> 00:39:59,930
What do you want to see me for this time?

769
00:40:04,168 --> 00:40:05,336
This veterinary drug summit

770
00:40:05,336 --> 00:40:06,771
Can you not go?

771
00:40:07,605 --> 00:40:08,339
Why

772
00:40:12,042 --> 00:40:12,843
Carlo

773
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,381
Carlo

774
00:40:19,183 --> 00:40:21,218
You don't want to go for a walk

775
00:40:21,218 --> 00:40:22,019
Come

776
00:40:22,853 --> 00:40:24,188
I know you want to go out

777
00:40:24,188 --> 00:40:25,890
Come on, let's put this on

778
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:27,558
So good

779
00:40:28,058 --> 00:40:29,860
Let's go, I'll take you out for a walk

780
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:31,662
Come on, I'll take you to your master

781
00:40:35,566 --> 00:40:37,568
You know Shen Hongyuan is very suspicious

782
00:40:38,135 --> 00:40:39,937
In the past, you went there on behalf of the R&D department

783
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:40,638
is normal

784
00:40:41,205 --> 00:40:42,706
But if you go again this year

785
00:40:43,574 --> 00:40:44,942
That's a bit far-fetched

786
00:40:45,409 --> 00:40:46,977
I'm afraid he will get suspicious

787
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,614
Stop talking about this matter.

788
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:51,449
Uncle Han

789
00:40:51,816 --> 00:40:52,683
do you know

790
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:55,252
I have a reason why I have to go

791
00:40:57,788 --> 00:40:58,489
But

792
00:41:01,892 --> 00:41:03,093
I went first, Uncle Han

793
00:41:03,093 --> 00:41:03,828
All right

794
00:41:07,198 --> 00:41:07,998
Carlo

795
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:11,602
give

796
00:41:12,403 --> 00:41:13,370
Why are you going?

797
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:15,039
Carlo is waiting in a hurry

798
00:41:20,377 --> 00:41:21,345
Don't run too far

799
00:41:21,445 --> 00:41:22,413
I'll come right away

800
00:41:25,783 --> 00:41:26,717
This way, this way

801
00:41:38,896 --> 00:41:40,264
is this your cat

802
00:41:40,264 --> 00:41:41,499
This cat is so cute

803
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:42,700
Did you raise it?

804
00:41:43,067 --> 00:41:43,868
That's right

805
00:41:51,308 --> 00:41:51,909
girl

806
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:53,811
Want to draw a picture?

807
00:41:53,811 --> 00:41:55,412
Very cheap, twenty yuan a piece

808
00:41:59,717 --> 00:42:00,384
never mind

809
00:42:00,618 --> 00:42:01,318
etc

810
00:42:01,318 --> 00:42:02,520
you can hold it

811
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,721
I'll help you draw together

812
00:42:07,658 --> 00:42:08,359
All right

813
00:42:24,241 --> 00:42:24,942
good

814
00:42:31,949 --> 00:42:33,217
Have you gone to find Shen Chen?

815
00:42:34,285 --> 00:42:34,919
right

816
00:42:35,586 --> 00:42:36,053
he saved me

817
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:37,988
I definitely have to express my gratitude to him

818
00:42:38,822 --> 00:42:39,523
Finished

819
00:42:41,825 --> 00:42:42,359
He didn't mention anything

820
00:42:42,359 --> 00:42:43,561
Is it too much to ask for?

821
00:42:46,363 --> 00:42:47,398
be my girlfriend

822
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:48,098
impossible

823
00:42:48,098 --> 00:42:49,967
Think about it

824
00:42:51,335 --> 00:42:52,603
Not too much

825
00:42:53,003 --> 00:42:54,204
There are reasonable ones

826
00:42:54,605 --> 00:42:56,740
He asked me to be his girlfriend

827
00:42:58,175 --> 00:42:59,476
be his girlfriend

828
00:42:59,977 --> 00:43:01,345
Is this reasonable?
