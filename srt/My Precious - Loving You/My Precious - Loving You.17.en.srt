84
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,360

assigned him a lot of work,

177
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,040

will leave because of him.

181
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,240
But at least it allows more customers

182
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,360
to know Tianlin because of his presence.

183
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,880
Yesterday Tian Peilan

188
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,760
Only two out of over a hundred?

189
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,760
Are you proud of that?

190
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,980
Such a low conversion rate.

191
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:17,280
And,

192
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,440
out of over a hundred people,

193
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,480
most of them were Gu Mingze's fans.

194
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,640
There were hardly any customers.

195
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,480
You imposed this dumb performance assessment
on me.

196
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,640
What could I do?

197
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,560
<i>You really took my words seriously.</i>

198
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,800
<i>Time changes everything.</i>

199
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,440
Tian Tian.

200
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,660
We can't rush for instant benefits.

201
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:41,160
What we pursue is reputation and integrity.

202
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,200
That's what I have learned

203
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,800
at Tianlin over the last few months.

204
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,320
Did you forget your original aspiration?

205
00:09:50,368 --> 00:09:51,968
<i>Oh, I won.</i>

206
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,320
You like this?

207
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,520
Slow down.

208
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,240
Be good.

209
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,320
Slow down.

210
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,760
Have some water.

211
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,872
Be careful.

212
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,160
Careful, Dad. Are you okay?

213
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,320
I'm fine.

214
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,640
- Slow down.
- I'm fine.

215
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,280
Tian Tian.

216
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,760
I heard from your aunt

217
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,840
that you invited an expert

218
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,760
who just returned from abroad

219
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,280
to see patients at Tianlin.

220
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,880
I heard you got busy.

221
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,220
Why did you come back?

222
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:30,940
I came back to see you.

223
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:33,000
You climbed up here by yourself.

224
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,140
I'm surprised.

225
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:36,800
Now you can even climb up

226
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,280
to the rooftop with a cane.

227
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,800
Your mom went out to buy groceries.

228
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,120
I suddenly realized

229
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,000
I hadn't fed these cats yet.

230
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,600
So, I came up to check on them

231
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,280
and also to get some exercise.

232
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,120
These cats became familiar with us.

233
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,840
Later, I can trap them

234
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,320
and send them to a shelter.

235
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,560
How have you been getting along

236
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,720
with Shen Mi recently?

237
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,920
Don't mention him.

238
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,520
He's always

239
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,080
screwing with me.

240
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,320
So annoying.

241
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,000
Tian Tian.

242
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,240
If someone causes difficulties

243
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,720
for you at work,

244
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,300
it is not necessarily a bad thing.

245
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:24,120
But he can't

246
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,600
keep opposing me.

247
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,160
Tian Tian.

248
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,820
Let me tell you

249
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,640
about my own experience.

250
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,540
When I graduated from college,

251
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:36,880
I was interning at a veterinary station.

252
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,920
My director's surname is Zhou.

253
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,960
He was incredibly harsh.

254
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,000
Once, I made a small mistake

255
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,520
at work.

256
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,160
He could scold me

257
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,120
in front of everyone

258
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,760
with no mercy.

259
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,640
I felt humiliated.

260
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,080
Back then, I really hated him.

261
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,260
I looked forward to

262
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,860
ending my internship as soon as possible

263
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:03,200
and working at another place.

264
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,160
And guess what?

265
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,400
As I wished,

266
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,440
I started to work in another station.

267
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,440
I was very rigorous

268
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,280
at work.

269
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,160
Only later did I know

270
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,800
that my former director

271
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,880
has a particularly good reputation.

272
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,860
The veterinarians he mentors are

273
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:24,560
in high demand.

274
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,240
Tian Tian.

275
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,080
Only through relentless trials

276
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,640
can one become truly strong.

277
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,280
Do you get

278
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,720
what I'm trying to say?

279
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,960
I get it, Dad.

280
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,380
Not just for Tianlin

281
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:45,640
but also for myself,

282
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,040
I need to prove to him

283
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,640
that I'm not going to give up easily.

284
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,000
Good.

285
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,000
These stray cats

286
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,800
are used to this place.

287
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,024
<i>Mr. Shen.</i>

288
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,480
<i>Here you are.</i>

289
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,260
<i>That factory has been abandoned
for several years.</i>

290
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:50,760
<i>It took me a long time</i>

291
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,080
<i>to find this information.</i>

292
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,160
Bring me all the past business contracts

293
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:12,000
between Lvchuan and the company

294
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,200
in Thailand.

295
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,648
The sooner, the better.

296
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,680
Dr. Gu is working overtime.

297
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,960
I urgently need to find some files.

298
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,336
Why did you come?

299
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,400
I just dropped by to say hello.

300
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,160
Are you available?

301
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,096
You want me for something?

302
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,040
I think what you're doing now

303
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,160
is probably more important.

304
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,600
Do you need any help?

305
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,360
I'm looking for past experimental data

306
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,840
about the targeted drugs,

307
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,720
but I didn't find it.

308
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,640
How long ago?

309
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,000
About a year ago.

310
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,160
I'll help you.

311
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,560
An.

312
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,560
You go to the data library first thing tomorrow

313
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,840
and submit all the data
and documents related to targeted drugs

314
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,360
to Dr. Gu.

315
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,480
If you need the data from a year ago,

316
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,400
you will find it.

317
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,360
How about a game?

318
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,560
- Okay.
- Let's go.

319
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,000
Thank you for today.

320
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,656
Not at all.

321
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,600
If the new drug research is successful,

322
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,800
Lvchuan's leading position in the industry

323
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:04,800
will be even more secure.

324
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,920
I also heard

325
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,720
that this matter may affect

326
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,040
the company's future leadership changes.

327
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,760
I thought Dr. Gu

328
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:15,000
only focused on academic research.

329
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,960
I did not expect you to be interested
in the power struggle

330
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,040
within the company.

331
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,840
I'm not interested.

332
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,940
But I am really puzzled.

333
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:26,160
At this crucial moment,

334
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,120
why did you hand over the R&D department
to someone else?

335
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:32,480
If I say I don't care who takes the credit,

336
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,264
would you believe me?

337
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,760
If the new drug fails,

338
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,720
pets with cancer

339
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,000
will die.

340
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,680
There are only three results.

341
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,720
First,

342
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,320
give them imported drugs,

343
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,360
prolonging their lives
by half a year to a year.

344
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,760
Second, just throw them onto the streets,

345
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,520
leaving them to die. Third, euthanize them.

346
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,960
That's all.

347
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,520
So, my research on new drugs

348
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,640
is just the first step of my plan.

349
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,780
And the second step is

350
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:05,880
to make the patent of this new drug public.

351
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,840
But in that case,

352
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:11,599
other pharmaceutical companies will copy it.

353
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:14,839
Indeed.

354
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:15,920
But in this way,

355
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,880
the price will be lower, right?

356
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:26,960
Making drugs is about conscience.

357
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:30,000
Everyone affords medical care for their pets.

358
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:31,760
That's my commitment

359
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,320
to researching new drugs from the start.

360
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,720
And it has been Lvchuan's belief

361
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,520
since my grandfather's generation.

362
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,720
After I worked in Lvchuan,

363
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,480
what I've heard about you

364
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,080
always baffles me.

365
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,900
Especially when it comes to Tian Tian,

366
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,200
at first, I thought

367
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,520
you were forcing her

368
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,560
to become your dog's doctor

369
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,640
by investing in Tianlin.

370
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,800
I misunderstood you.

371
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,980
About this,

372
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:00,320
Mengnan…

373
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,120
Don't worry. She doesn't know.

374
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,200
But there's one thing I don't understand.

375
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,240
Why can't you let Miss Han know

376
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,800
about Tian Tian's real identity?

377
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,120
That's my private matter.

378
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,160
Can I interpret it like this?

379
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,280
I don't know how you convinced Tian Tian

380
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,800
to act with you.

381
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,000
But the result now is

382
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,520
you have a reasonable reason

383
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,320
to keep Tian Tian by your side.

384
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,460
Dr. Gu, I think

385
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:32,840
there's no need

386
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,380
to discuss this matter.

387
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:35,800
It's pointless.

388
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,800
Regarding the development
and application of the new drug,

389
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,240
I understand your thoughts,

390
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,200
but I can't really agree

391
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,320
with your way of life.

392
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,440
I do not comprehend your behavior.

393
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,320
Life is just so illogical,

394
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,280
isn't it?

395
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,520
Why did you ask An

396
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,960
to search for past contracts

397
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,280
for you?

398
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,000
Nothing.

399
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,680
For no purpose.

400
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,680
I know

401
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,880
what you're thinking about.

402
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,440
I know your investigations abroad.

403
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,360
Your actions will attract attention.

404
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,020
Who are you afraid will find out?

405
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:37,680
I'm afraid?

406
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,240
I fear that your Grandpa might find out.

407
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,900
What if he can't take it?

408
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,800
You know about his health condition.

409
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,240
I have not kept anything secret from you.

410
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,480
What you know

411
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,560
and see is the truth.

412
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,040
The truth?

413
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,120
You have to believe me.

414
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,640
Many things just happen coincidentally.

415
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,320
Your so-called truth is nothing

416
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,680
but the obsession in your heart

417
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,960
affecting you.

418
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,376
Yes.

419
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,880
I know.

420
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,120
Stop doing pointless things,

421
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,400
alright?

422
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,320
the current outcome

423
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,440
is the best for everyone.

424
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,640
But what if we were wrong

425
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,720
from the beginning?

426
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,600
I'm tired, Mr. Han.

427
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,320
You may leave now.

428
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,944
Alright.

429
00:21:00,032 --> 00:21:01,320
You think about it.

430
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,760
So, there is a problem

431
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,320
with one of the clinical samples?

432
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,480
Yes.

433
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,600
I compared it with R&D data from two years ago.

434
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,240
According to today's sample results,

435
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,680
I can say with certainty

436
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:55,080
that the side effect
of the new drug is extremely strong.

437
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,800
Is it lethal?

438
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,400
No, it isn't.

439
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,400
But it will affect the cerebrospinal fluid.

440
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,900
In the worst-case scenario,

441
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:06,120
it may cause paralysis in cats and dogs.

442
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,720
What about the treatment effect on lymphoma?

443
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,460
It's good.

444
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:15,040
That's alright then.

445
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,440
What do you mean, Mr. Shen?

446
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,320
Our goal in developing new drugs

447
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,180
is for the treatment effects.

448
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:23,920
As for the side effects,

449
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,680
it's normal, right?

450
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,280
Any drugs have side effects.

451
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,960
Mr. Shen--

452
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:30,960
Dr. Gu.

453
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,480
I understand what you mean.

454
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,400
The group has invested

455
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,200
heavily in this project.

456
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,040
And after the new drug goes to market,

457
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:41,000
you know what it means to the group, right?

458
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,180
Mr. Shen, I know.

459
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:45,960
Once the new drug is successfully developed,

460
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,880
it has a groundbreaking significance
for the entire industry.

461
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,320
That's right.

462
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,320
How can you deny your own research results

463
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,920
because of a minor problem?

464
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:02,700
I also hope that the new medicine is perfect.

465
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:05,440
But there's nothing perfect,

466
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,656
right?

467
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,720
One out of 110 clinical samples

468
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,520
has only one problem.

469
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,920
The proportion is very low, right?

470
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,840
Besides,

471
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,680
even if there is a problem occurring in mice,

472
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,800
it doesn't necessarily occur

473
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,880
in cats and dogs, right?

474
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,960
Mr. Shen, I get it.

475
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:29,080
But I hope you consider it from my perspective.

476
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,760
I've considered it.

477
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,320
I have.

478
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,520
Since you worked here,

479
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,480
I've considered it from your perspective.

480
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:44,080
I gave you manpower and resources as you wish.

481
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,760
I let you freely research, right?

482
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,440
I've done what I could.

483
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:56,280
Dr. Gu, do you have a solution?

484
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,560
If you do, I will fully cooperate with you.

485
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,776
Yes.

486
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,360
At the Animal Medicine Summit,

487
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,560
Professor Guo Fan's opinion

488
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,720
of box jellyfish toxin

489
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,720
separation inhibitory technology

490
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:12,720
impressed me

491
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,800
deeply.

492
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,100
If we can get Professor Guo's patent,

493
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,120
we will make a breakthrough

494
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,760
in controlling the toxic side effects

495
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,120
of targeted drugs.

496
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,840
Good.

497
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,640
I will help you with the patent.

498
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,240
I'm happy to hear that.

499
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,560
I'll get back to work.

500
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,400
Go ahead.

501
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,280
Let me see your eyes.

502
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,880
Runny nose?

503
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,160
Look at the ears.

504
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,640
I'll touch the tummy.

505
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,320
Has he been constipated for a few days?

506
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,320
The nose is quite clean.

507
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,320
No snot.

508
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,200
Doctor, is Bobby seriously ill??

509
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,320
I just gave it a brief check-up.

510
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,120
The regular blood test indicators are normal.

511
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,880
After taking medicine for a few days,

512
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,560
Bobby will be fine.

513
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,480
That's great. Thank you.

514
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,360
Look at how well he was

515
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,520
when playing with you.

516
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,960
Don't worry. He should not be contagious.

517
00:25:29,431 --> 00:25:33,332
<i>[Tianlin Animal Hospital]</i>

518
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,520
You sign this.

519
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,240
Where is Shen Mi?

520
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,360
He's an undisciplined man.

521
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,128
How should I know where he is?

522
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,840
You keep sighing,

523
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,600
looking so worried.

524
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,400
Are you worried about the performance?

525
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,900
I am.

526
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:00,440
Those small kennels

527
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,680
have brought us some clients.

528
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,640
But that's not enough.

529
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,320
Didn't you

530
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,720
contact larger kennels?

531
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,520
Those famous, large kennels

532
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,960
all have stable partnerships.

533
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,800
Who would notice small hospitals?

534
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,560
What about Panghu Kennel?

535
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,760
Don't count on them.

536
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,640
I visited their boss before,

537
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,640
but he avoided us.

538
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,560
Give it up.

539
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,120
What do you mean?

540
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,480
You're just dropping the subject.

541
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,520
What do you want to say?

542
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,120
No big deal.

543
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,080
The other day, Yan told me

544
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,240
that she and her husband

545
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:38,100
saw the owner of Panghu Kennel

546
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:40,200
in Xiangshui Mountain.

547
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,720
Where exactly is it?

548
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,080
Navigation

549
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,120
can help.

550
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,580
What's up, Dr. Chen?

551
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:08,800
I can't find my vehicle.

552
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,280
Did you buy a car?

553
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,880
No, my electric bike.

554
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,560
Where is my bike?

555
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,280
Tian Peilan.

556
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:06,600
This damn navigation.

557
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,240
It hurts.

558
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,520
Dr. Chen's bike

559
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,720
is damaged.

560
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,480
I am in the middle of nowhere.

561
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,040
Is there anyone around?

562
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:44,960
Where am I?

563
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,600
Tian Peilan.

564
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,040
I'll fight it out with you.

565
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,640
No signal.

566
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,120
Come on.

567
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,120
Which way to go?

568
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:06,040
North, south, west,

569
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,520
and north.

570
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,344
Alright then.

571
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,320
No.

572
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,520
I'll keep trying.

573
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,960
What if I make it?

574
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,000
I've sent it.

575
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:25,840
Be careful on the road.

576
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:26,900
Drive safely.

577
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:29,480
Text me when you find her.

578
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:39,240
<i>[Connecting to Tian Tian]</i>
<i>Sorry, the subscriber you dialed is unavailable.</i>

579
00:29:44,381 --> 00:29:45,368
<i>[Connecting to Tian Tian]</i>

580
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,640
Tian Peilan.

581
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,480
You got me into this trouble.

582
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,040
My phone's out of battery now.

583
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,680
And my e-bike also ran out of battery.

584
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,840
I fell, and it hurt so much.

585
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,640
Where am I?

586
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,720
I'm in the middle of nowhere.

587
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,176
Carlo.

588
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,408
Tian Tian.

589
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,520
Tian Tian.

590
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,960
Shen Mi?

591
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,280
I'm here.

592
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,440
Carlo, come here.

593
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,580
Why are you here?

594
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:19,720
What are you hiding here for?

595
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,080
There is a wild boar.

596
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,120
Just, over there.

597
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,656
You…

598
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,040
Are you injured?

599
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,480
I fell off the bike earlier.

600
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,280
What should we do?

601
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,320
I mean it.

602
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,640
You have to believe me.

603
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,560
Where is the wild boar?

604
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,440
I heard the sound of a wild boar.

605
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,160
Then it appeared over there.

606
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,200
Did you see it?

607
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,440
It's right there.

608
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,560
That's not a wild boar.

609
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:51,840
It really is.

610
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,080
It's coming over.

611
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,400
Okay, stand behind me.

612
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,520
I'll protect you.

613
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,120
Come on, wild boar.

614
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,400
Let me see what it looks like.

615
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,760
I haven't seen it yet.

616
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,360
But I heard it.

617
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,480
Can you tell

618
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,040
that's a wild boar from its cry?

619
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,760
What else could it be

620
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,180
in this place?

621
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:16,400
Okay, I'm here.

622
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,480
It's okay, alright?

623
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,960
Don't be afraid of anything.

624
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,880
Erzhuang.

625
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,560
Erzhuang.

626
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,280
Erzhuang.

627
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:27,160
How could you let a pig run out?

628
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,900
Erzhuang.

629
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:30,680
- Erzhuang.
- Erzhuang.

630
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,096
A pig?

631
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,880
Erzhuang. Be quiet.

632
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,832
Erzhuang.

633
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,360
Look.

634
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,080
Is that a wild boar?

635
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,960
Where is your sister?

636
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,600
Why hasn't she returned at this late hour?

637
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,760
I can't get through to her on the phone.

638
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:59,200
She's looking for a kennel.

639
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,880
A kennel?

640
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:02,720
Well, she should be back by now.

641
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,280
She's not a child.

642
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,600
What?

643
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:10,840
What did you just say?

644
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,720
I gave birth to you

645
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,240
because you can

646
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,360
protect your sister

647
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,720
and not let anyone bully her.

648
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,720
Unexpectedly, you can't help at all,

649
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,620
always playing games on your mobile phone.

650
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:22,220
Can't you do something meaningful?

651
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:24,200
She won't get lost since she's with Shen Mi.

652
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,360
Ms. Gong, I'm sorry

653
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:30,160
we're bothering you

654
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,320
at this late hour.

655
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,480
That's all right.

656
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,360
I'm glad you're here.

657
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,880
I assume Erzhuang scared you.

658
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,720
Have some soup.

659
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,000
Thank you.

660
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,960
I grow

661
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,200
my own vegetables.

662
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,360
It's green food.

663
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,360
The soup is really delicious.

664
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,720
Erzhuang, you're home.

665
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,000
Go.

666
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,360
Be good.

667
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,760
I'll spank your bottom.

668
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,560
Come on.

669
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,680
You're home now.

670
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:10,520
Erzhuang, you're silly.

671
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,560
Why did you run around in the dark?

672
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,639
If you get lost, someone will kill you.

673
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,880
My pig.

674
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,760
Gong.

675
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,560
Yes?

676
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,800
The pig.

677
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,760
Hurry.

678
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,199
What's the rush?

679
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:39,280
The piglet.

680
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,480
Emergency.

681
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,904
Move.

682
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:47,159
Carlo.

683
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:49,199
Carlo, let's go.

684
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,216
I just discovered it.

685
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,000
Dr. Tian, look.

686
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,776
Well…

687
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,760
The feces are white.

688
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,680
If my judgment is correct,

689
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,120
it might be white diarrhea.

690
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:17,120
Is it serious?

691
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,240
Luckily, I didn't eat anything.

692
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,800
Young Master, little Master.

693
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,320
Sorry about that.

694
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,560
So what now?

695
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,800
I need to identify the specific cause
of the disease now.

696
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,120
But even if the disease is diagnosed,

697
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,160
there's no medicine.

698
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,640
Has your father ever worked
at a veterinary station before?

699
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,440
My grandfather used to be a vet too.

700
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,240
I remember he once told me

701
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,720
that back then, there wasn't any medicine

702
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,700
specifically for pets and livestock.

703
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:45,800
They used

704
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,840
remixed human medicine on them.

705
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,760
Yes.

706
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,160
Give me your phone.

707
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,520
I'll call my Dad.

708
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,360
My sister's calling.

709
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,640
Sister, when are you coming back?

710
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,080
Mom is worried about you.

711
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:10,120
<i>Put our Dad on the phone.</i>

712
00:36:14,112 --> 00:36:15,460
Tian Tian.

713
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:16,840
<i>Dad, here's the thing.</i>

714
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,840
I'm at a farmhouse in the suburbs right now.

715
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:19,960
And there are

716
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,480
two little sick pigs.

717
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,080
Could you figure out what's happening?

718
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:26,440
Look.

719
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:28,384
<i>Look at their feces.</i>

720
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,440
Did the piglets vomit?

721
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,920
They vomited.

722
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,520
They did.

723
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,280
<i>Move the phone closer to them.</i>

724
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,720
Alright.

725
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:42,120
<i>What's wrong with them?</i>

726
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,240
No arching back and belly contraction.

727
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:49,440
Judging from their feces,

728
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,640
it should be white diarrhea.

729
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,680
<i>I made the same judgment.</i>

730
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:54,720
Now what?

731
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:55,936
What medicine should they take?

732
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:57,200
<i>Well,</i>

733
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,840
do they have

734
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:02,080
oxytetracycline injection?

735
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,360
There are only needles at home.

736
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,440
Nothing else.

737
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,120
Dad.

738
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,400
<i>Can you suggest other medicine?</i>

739
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,600
Well…

740
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:15,160
How about amoxicillin?

741
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:16,420
Amoxicillin?

742
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:18,040
We have that.

743
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,440
You stay, and I'll go get it.

744
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,760
Okay.

745
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,520
Amoxicillin, and what?

746
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:24,000
How should I mix it?

747
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,560
Dilute it at 15 milligrams per kilogram.

748
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:30,020
15 milligrams per kilogram.

749
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:31,280
Okay, I got it.

750
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,400
Tian Tian.

751
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,200
I heard from your brother

752
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,840
that you're with Shen Mi now.

753
00:37:36,448 --> 00:37:37,680
Yes.

754
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,280
Here it is.

755
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,560
Hurry.

756
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:41,800
Here it is.

757
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,760
Dad, I have to go.

758
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,640
You talk to Shen Mi.

759
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:48,120
I…

760
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,520
I…

761
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,400
I'll do it.

762
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,160
Uncle.

763
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:55,560
Nice to meet you. I'm Shen Mi.

764
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,160
Shen.

765
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,800
Nice to meet you.

766
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:02,360
<i>I heard a lot about you from Director Tian.</i>

767
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,760
Tian Tian often

768
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,880
mentioned you to me and her mother,

769
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:09,480
<i>saying you're young and capable.</i>

770
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:12,080
And the hospital is getting better and better

771
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,840
under your leadership.

772
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,920
<i>By the way, she also told us</i>

773
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,800
<i>that she learned a lot from you.</i>

774
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,000
I'm flattered.

775
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,840
Actually, I also learned a lot

776
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:25,680
from Tian Tian.

777
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:33,720
- What did you learn from me?
- Well, I…

778
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,240
<i>Stop it.</i>

779
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,760
He's just being kind.

780
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:39,080
What can he learn from you?

781
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,720
Dad.

782
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,680
Tian Tian is looking for you.

783
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,240
Dad, what did you say?

784
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,720
I have so many merits.

785
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:47,840
He can't learn something from me?

786
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,000
Weren't you just being kind?

787
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,600
You just said he's young

788
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,680
and capable.

789
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:55,800
<i>Isn't that the truth?</i>

790
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,080
What are you talking about?

791
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,840
I'll hang up.

792
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,280
Okay.

793
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,824
Come on.

794
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:43,960
Dr. Tian.

795
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:46,080
Thank you for your help.

796
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:49,600
My husband and I
will take turns looking after the piglets.

797
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:52,600
If anything happens, we'll have to trouble you.

798
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,520
This quilt was only used once
when my son got married.

799
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:59,200
Rest assured, it's been washed clean.

800
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,920
I hope you don't mind.

801
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:08,520
Don't bother.

802
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:09,560
We can actually sleep

803
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:10,600
on the floor.

804
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,080
No, it's cold in the mountains.

805
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:14,320
What if you catch a cold?

806
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:18,620
We're not…

807
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:19,880
I know.

808
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:22,060
I've been there.

809
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:23,120
Alright then.

810
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,400
You two go to sleep.

811
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:31,800
Well…

812
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,360
Is this quilt

813
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,720
a bit thick?

814
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:37,560
It is.

815
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,400
Do you feel comfortable?

816
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,480
Yeah.

817
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,936
By the way,

818
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,440
how are those two piglets?

819
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,800
I fed them medicine before I went to bed.

820
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,080
They are not having diarrhea anymore.

821
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:58,432
Good.

822
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:01,980
Well…

823
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:05,080
will the wound on my face

824
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,360
leave a scar?

825
00:42:29,894 --> 00:42:33,414
<i>♫ Your gaze is unwavering ♫</i>

826
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:39,974
<i>♫ Only enough to accommodate me ♫</i>

827
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:45,862
<i>♫ I have been melted by you countless times ♫</i>

828
00:42:46,822 --> 00:42:50,374
<i>♫ Yet I'm at a loss for what to do ♫</i>

829
00:42:52,326 --> 00:42:55,270
<i>♫ I can only hold on to you ♫</i>

830
00:42:57,350 --> 00:43:01,254
<i>♫ Now you are still with me ♫</i>

831
00:43:02,918 --> 00:43:07,174
<i>♫ Traveling through time together ♫</i>

832
00:43:09,030 --> 00:43:16,966
<i>♫ Someday, I'll be completely
forgotten by the world ♫</i>

833
00:43:16,966 --> 00:43:20,166
<i>♫ Leaving no trace ♫</i>

834
00:43:20,166 --> 00:43:24,198
<i>♫ Only you will still remember ♫</i>

835
00:43:25,958 --> 00:43:28,262
<i>♫ My appearance ♫</i>
