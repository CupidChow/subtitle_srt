<i>You!</i>

<i>Come on.</i>

43
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,660
<i>Tian Tian, let me ask you something about</i>

44
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,080
<i>what I taught you before.</i>

45
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,440
<i>What do the red and the blue</i>

46
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,600
<i>represent?</i>

47
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,640
<i>Red is the artery,</i>

48
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,680
<i>and blue is the vein.</i>

49
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,680
<i>What are the functions of arteries and veins?</i>

50
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,600
<i>Our hearts</i>

51
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:22,040
<i>send blood to arteries throughout the body.</i>

52
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,400
<i>Which is this red string.</i>

53
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,440
<i>Then</i>

54
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,480
<i>it will flow through</i>

55
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,400
<i>this blue string,</i>

56
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,560

<i>Alright.</i>

00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,520
<i>She's just a kid,</i>

59
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,960
<i>and already knows more than me.</i>

60
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,060
<i>Don't be so strict.</i>

61
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:46,480
<i>Tian Tian, go do your homework.</i>

62
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,280
<i>And you,</i>

63
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,600
<i>go do what you have to do.</i>

64
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,800
<i>Come on. Tian Tian, let's go.</i>

65
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,360
<i>Let me teach you more.</i>

66
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,440
<i>Okay then.</i>

67
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,080
<i>Zaizai, I have to do my homework.</i>

68
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,200
<i>I'll play with you after I finish my homework.</i>

69
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,080
<i>During a surgery, make sure
you have a steady hand</i>

70
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,800
<i>with constant and strong force.</i>

71
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,040
<i>For larger incisions in the chest and abdomen,</i>

72
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,000
<i>use bow holding.</i>

73
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
<i>Remember to cut in vertically,</i>

74
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,680
<i>cut horizontally</i>

75
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,600
<i>and pull out vertically.</i>

76
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,320
Cut in vertically,

77
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,560
cut horizontally.

78
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,560
Wake up, Zaizai.

79
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,160
Zaizai, wake up.

80
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,880
You scared me.

81
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,600
What are you thinking?

82
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,880
Are you thinking about Shen Mi?

83
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,340
What?

84
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:59,800
Don't deny it.

85
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,320
You are.

86
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,840
But Shen Mi is funny.

87
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,920
He's either

88
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,280
with an indifferent

89
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,840
and deep look on his face,

90
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,440
or a gentle look.

91
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,280
You can never know.

92
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,360
But that's why you like him.

93
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,680
You haven't gossiped for a while.

94
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,820
Here you go again.

95
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,640
Don't get angry because I spoke your mind.

96
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,120
I don't care about others.

97
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,280
Then you'd stop.

98
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,800
Look at this.

99
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,000
There are only 3,000 views

100
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,640
of Ms. Ju's clarification letter,

101
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,960
and few comments.

102
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,160
That means people are more focused on scandal.

103
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,200
But the customer group has been
a lot more peaceful these days.

104
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,880
The customers keep

105
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,320
asking for a refund.

106
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,840
If it weren't for this incident,

107
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,280
we can meet the performance

108
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,360
within the specific time limit

109
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,240
according to the daily turnover.

110
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,320
Now,

111
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,520
I don't know when.

112
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,880
However, that Ms. Ju

113
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,440
used this to criticize

114
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,920
those bad kennels.

115
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,280
It's a kind reminder.

116
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,720
Like how to get a dog

117
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,160
in a legal kennel.

118
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,320
If anyone wants to keep a pet in the future,

119
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,680
then it is kind of popularization of science.

120
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,040
A reminder, right?

121
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,680
What you said reminds me,

122
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,880
how about we find a kennel to cooperate?

123
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,280
You haven't been swindled
enough by Mr. Fei yet?

124
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,160
Not like that. We'd go find a legal kennel.

125
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,400
Think about it, people
who buy dogs at the kennel

126
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,560
will definitely choose
pet hospital very carefully,

127
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,200
especially those new customers.

128
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,920
If we establish cooperation with the kennel,

129
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,440
then we'll have more customers.

130
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,080
That's kind of a good idea.

131
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,320
But those legal kennels

132
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:45,160
should have long-term cooperative hospitals.

133
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,320
Long-term collaboration.

134
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,520
How do we know if we don't try?

135
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,640
Where there's a will, there is a way.

136
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,680
Are you going to let me eat or not?

137
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,240
I'm very hungry, okay?

138
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,000
You're out of soup, mine's still there.

139
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,800
- You have mine.
- No.

140
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,360
I can't eat my noodles.

141
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,160
This is noodles without soup.

142
00:08:11,069 --> 00:08:14,400
<i>[Tianlin Animal Hospital]</i>

143
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,720
Another house call?

144
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,160
Perfect timing.

145
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,280
Here's something

146
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,440
I want to tell you about.

147
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,320
Go ahead.

148
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,520
You asked me

149
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,640
what I got from Ms. Ju

150
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,960
last time.

151
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,080
I thought of a way to increase revenue

152
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,559
and expand the business

153
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,640
while we can--

154
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,880
To establish more partnerships

155
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,120
with some kennels.

156
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,200
- How did you know?
- With your current intelligence,

157
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,200
what else

158
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,480
can you think of?

159
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,679
You!

160
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:45,240
Have you forgotten

161
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,600
the matter you contacted the charity

162
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,120
about the sterilization?

163
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,280
If you don't want me to come, just say so.

164
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,880
I don't mean that.

165
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,320
I just think it's a tough time
for the hospital right now,

166
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,880
and as the director,

167
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:00,640
you are right to brain storm.

168
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,360
I just want to remind you.

169
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,040
How about you come with me?

170
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,440
I definitely can't make it.

171
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,040
The first of next month is the day

172
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,200
when grandpa will go
to the company to inspect my work.

173
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,640
I have to get the financial report done.

174
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,400
Then I'll find Shen Chen.

175
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,520
No.

176
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,344
Why?

177
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,920
No means no.

178
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,000
No.

179
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,480
Then what should I do?

180
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,320
Nothing I said would work.

181
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,320
Those money-wasting ideas of yours

182
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,520
may work on my aunt,

183
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,760
but not on my sister.

Is there something wrong with this dog?

348
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,360
It makes sense then.

349
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:39,040

The primary characteristic of rickets

353
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,240
is allotriophagia.

354
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,520
You see, it licks the corner and the stairs,

355
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,180
and eats dirt on the floor.

356
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:51,240

00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,760
palpate it.

00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,560
a sinking sternum,

00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,680
These are all major characteristics.

00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,640
<i>here later.</i>

371
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:17,888
I see.

372
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,820
Here is the thing.

373
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:21,640
I used plastic to block the vent

374
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,160
because I didn't want the dog to get cold.

375
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,280
But

376
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,960
what does that have to do

377
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,040
with rickets?

378
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,280
Of course, it does.

379
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,560
Vitamin D deficiency

380
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,400
is the main cause of rickets.

381
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,880
Except for the lack of nutrients in puppy food,

382
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,560
there's the lack of sunlight.

383
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,920
Look, the air vent in those rooms

384
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,160
is blocked,

385
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,720
so the air does not circulate properly.

386
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,120
Plus, there's not even a window,

387
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,120
the sunlight cannot come in

388
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,360
so it will naturally lack calcium

389
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,560
and get sick.

390
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,840
Does that mean the puppy can't be saved?

391
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,480
Girl, don't worry.

392
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,600
It takes more exercise,

393
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,840
gets more sun exposure
and eats well, and it'll be fine.

394
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:53,880
Don't worry.

395
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,640
The dog is in perfect health.

396
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,160
Sir, here you go.

397
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,400
- You come over here.
- She said it's fine.

398
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,120
- What's wrong?
- You!

399
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,600
You said the dog is sick

400
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,120
and interrupted their business.

401
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,880
Sir, goodbye. We're leaving.

402
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,896
Miss Tian.

403
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,400
Miss Tian.

404
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,120
Wait.

405
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,440
I just remembered

406
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,080
I haven't had a chance
to read the contract you gave me.

407
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,280
I think it is necessary for me
to go over the contract carefully.

408
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,424
Let's go, please.

409
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,280
Can you stop walking around?

410
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,820
It's been over 20 minutes.
What's wrong with you?

411
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:36,840
You are blind to my achievement

412
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,280
these past few days.

413
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,360
Then bring it to me.

414
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,040
Check it out.

415
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,960
We have signed contracts with five dog kennels,

416
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,800
and two catteries, how's that?

417
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,080
Really great, right?

418
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,098
<i>[Cooperation Agreement]</i>

419
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,080
Come on. Let me break down

420
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,040
your performance over the last few days.

421
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,320
In four days,

422
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,920
a total of eight customers came,

423
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,560
only three of them bought our package,

424
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,000
the conversion rate is 40%.

425
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,880
40% isn't low.

426
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,080
It's not low,

427
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,840
it's just that the effort
doesn't equal the return.

428
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,500
So why's that?

429
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,920
Actually, there are

430
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,080
certainly many reasons.

431
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,380
But the main one is,

432
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,440
the kennels you work with

433
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,680
are newly opened and don't have many customers,

434
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,760
so their ability to guide the customers

435
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,960
is not good.

436
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,320
There will be fewer people coming here.

437
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,720
So you mean

438
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,280
we should work with
those big and reputable kennels.

439
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,520
Of course.

440
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,680
But big kennels already have
fixed cooperative hospitals.

441
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,320
Who would be interested in us,
a small pet hospital?

442
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,360
Of course.

443
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,800
So isn't there no solution?

444
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,048
Of course

445
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,240
not.

446
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,400
Then tell me.

447
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,120
Are you the director or am I?

448
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,640
Why don't you let me be the director

449
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,160
if you want me to fix everything?

450
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,440
You're always busy,

451
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,120
can you work on the point?

452
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,440
I…

453
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,920
I'm not angry.

454
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,720
What's wrong with you?
You couple are fighting again?

455
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,780
We are not a couple.

456
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:08,240
Just look at him,

457
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,360
all he does every day is to scold me.

458
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,760
He said that again today.

459
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,560
Are you the director or am I?

460
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,340
Why don't you let me be the director

461
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:17,080
if you want me to fix everything?

462
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,080
You have a brain,

463
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,140
but don't know how to use it.

464
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:20,440
He has a mouth,

465
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,600
but just knows how to scold me.

466
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,960
As if he could do a good job

467
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,280
if he were a real director.

468
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,280
Aunt, don't laugh.

469
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,680
I never thought you'd

470
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,480
betray me.

471
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,120
What are you talking about?

472
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,760
I'm looking at this.

473
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,160
Look.

474
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,520
Is this your senior?

475
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,080
Gu Mingze.

476
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,280
Look, he's got

477
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,760
over a million fans now.

478
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,280
Look at those comments.

479
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:53,340
This Dr. Gu is too handsome.

480
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:57,120
I'm a fan now.
I hereby declare Dr. Gu as my favorite.

481
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,460
Aunt.

482
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:02,640
If I could get Dr. Gu

483
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,600
to work at our hospital,

484
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,840
then many customers

485
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:06,960
would be attracted, right?

486
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,600
You deserve credit.

487
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,080
That's a really good idea. Good idea.

488
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,760
Carlo.

489
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,720
Take a shower.

<i>[Tian Tian]</i>

491
00:21:30,592 --> 00:21:31,720

00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,840
<i>Aren't you going to Lvchuan tomorrow?</i>

<i>Can I go with you?</i>

494
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:36,544
Why?

495
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,280
Your grandpa comes once a month.

496
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,840
I think it's not good

497
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,080
if I'm not there.

498
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,820
<i>I'll explain to grandpa. That's it.</i>

499
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:47,680
Wait.

I think

502
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,800
if I can persuade

503
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,000
Dr. Gu Mingze

504
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,680
to work at our hospital,

505
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,760
then customers won't be a problem anymore.

506
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,580
He hung up!

507
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:06,400
He is too arrogant.

508
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,360
If Shen Mi disagrees,

509
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,920
then forget it.

510
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,880
It's right to listen to your man.

511
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,280
What did you say?

512
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,960
Don't say that anymore.

513
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,200
Why should I listen to whatever he says?

514
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,520
Why should I do so?

515
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,960
Hello, I'm here to see Dr. Gu Mingze.

516
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:38,040
Do you have an appointment?

517
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,200
No, how about this?

518
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,840
Please call him for me.

519
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:43,840
Please wait a moment.

520
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,840
I'm sorry, there's no answer upstairs.

521
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,880
Why don't you let me go upstairs first?

522
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,200
I'm really here for him.

523
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,680
You have no appointment
or confirmation from Dr. Gu.

524
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,880
According to the rules here,

525
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,060
I really can't let you go upstairs.

526
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:04,540
I'm really sorry.

527
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:05,880
Actually,

528
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,360
I am the personal doctor of Shen Mi,

529
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,360
your group president.

530
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,280
I'm here to give him a routine checkup.

531
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,440
Just a moment. I need to check with Mr. Mi.

532
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,640
- No need.
- No need.

533
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,840
I can prove

534
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,920
she is indeed the personal doctor of Shen Mi.

535
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,120

Dr. Tian.

538
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:55,000
Do you know where Shen Mi's office is?

539
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,940
I won't guide you.

540
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:58,360
Thanks, Miss Han.

541
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,608
Dr. Tian.

542
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,560
Did Shen Mi

543
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,920
ever mention to you

544
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,760
that he lived in Thailand for a while?

545
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,000
Yes, he did.

546
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,120
What did he say?

547
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,160
It's quite normal,

548
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,000
just some people and things he met

549
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,320
as a child in Thailand.

550
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,420
What is it?

551
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:20,800
Who did he mention

552
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,440
or where did he take you?

553
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,360
Dr. Tian.

554
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,440
What brings you here?

555
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,880
Miss Han.

556
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,480
I'm here to check on Mr. Mi.

557
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,360
Mr. Mi is in a meeting now.

558
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,360
It'll probably take a while.

559
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,380
Why don't we wait for him in the office?

560
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:35,620
Sure, okay.

561
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:37,160
Then I have to go.

562
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,160
Goodbye, Miss Han.

563
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,800
<i>[Pre-sales Data Analysis Statistics]</i>
At this Animal Medicine Summit,

564
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,280
our group's new drug

565
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,920
has received the attention
of the entire industry.

566
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,440
How far is the current development work

567
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,320
going?

568
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,720
Dr. Gu's R&D work

569
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,520
has entered the clinical stage.

570
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,560
If everything goes as planned,

571
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,680
In the middle of this month.

572
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,480
the global launch conference
can be held in the middle of this month.

573
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,560
Shen Mi.

574
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,600
How about you?

575
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:16,920
So far,

576
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,120
the hospital has not yet made a profit.

577
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,360
Shen Mi,

578
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,440
it's been three months.

579
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,520
Still no progress?

580
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:27,960
The medical industry itself

581
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,360
is particularly special.

582
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,760
What does it rely on?

583
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,960
Conscience and reputation.

584
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,560
You can't be in such a hurry

585
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,680
to pursue its short-term gains.

586
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,800
Every industry relies on

587
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,400
conscience and reputation.

588
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,620
We are a business group,

589
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:47,960
with so much upfront investment,

590
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,780
of course, we want profits and returns.

591
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:51,440
Well, you're right.

592
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,960
In the next three months,

593
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:53,960
I will definitely pursue

594
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,200
profits and returns.

595
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,640
But without conscience and reputation,

596
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,200
who would choose us?

597
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,760
If you want to get profits in three months…

598
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,100
Stop arguing, both of you.

599
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:03,600
Isn't there still time?

600
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,520
When the time comes,

601
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,800
let's see what happens.

602
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,072
Carlo.

603
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,984
Let me check on you.

604
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,160
Do you miss me?

605
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,800
Dr. Tian, please have a cup of coffee.

606
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,400
- Thank you, Mr. An.
- You are welcome.

607
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:25,800
By the way, when will
Mr. Mi finish the meeting?

608
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:28,360
Soon. Let's wait a bit longer.

609
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,472
Soon?

610
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,000
What's wrong, Carlo?

611
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,400
Why are you always looking out?

612
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,520
Do you want to go for a walk?

613
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,560
But Mr. Mi will be back soon after the meeting.

614
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,400
Alright then.

615
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,240
Maybe I'll take it for a walk.

616
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,800
But Mr. Mi is about to finish meeting.

617
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,980
It's okay. We'll be back soon.

618
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:52,040
Ok then.

619
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:55,340
By the way, where is Dr. Gu Mingze?

620
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:57,480
Dr. Gu came to the company today,

621
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,240
should be in the office now.

622
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,300
I'm going to take it out for a play.
See you later.

623
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:04,280
- See you later.
- Take your time.

624
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:13,080
These 110 samples are in excellent condition.

625
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,080
If everything goes well,

626
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,240
it will soon enter

627
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,640
the stage of final drug production.

628
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,360
I'm leaving then.

629
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:38,880
Thank you, senior.

630
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,000
Here you are.

631
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:40,722
<i>[Gu Mingze]</i>

632
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:46,440
I am sorry to disturb you

633
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,700
when you are so busy.

634
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:50,400
It's okay. It's still in the R&D stage.

635
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:53,320
So you are not that busy recently.

636
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,520
That's great.

637
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,760
Great?

638
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,160
Actually, I want to ask you

639
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,680
to do me a favor.

640
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,680
Gu Mingze.

641
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,240
I wonder

642
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,920
if you could work at
our hospital for a few days.

643
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,860
Why me?

644
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:08,080
Do I need to explain?

645
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,960
Because your medical skills
are excellent, of course.

646
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,360
When you were in our school,

647
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,400
you were the top in all your major courses,

648
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,720
got the school scholarship,

649
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,080
and studied abroad.

650
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,600
Now you are the head of R&D at Lvchuan.

651
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,040
Of course it has to be you.

652
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,160
I did hear that your hospital
is having a hard time.

653
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,280
But you have to understand

654
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,800
it is not a long-term way
to solve your problem.

655
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,440
Even if I go for a few days,

656
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,800
how much could it help?

657
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,300
That would be huge.

658
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:34,320
To be honest,

659
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:38,200
Shen Mi has set a target for the hospital

660
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,960
that must be achieved within three months.

661
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,600
The time is almost up.

662
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,520
If we don't achieve it,

663
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,860
all our hospital staff

664
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:47,000
have to be fired.

665
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,040
For the hospital,

666
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,640
don't put too much pressure on yourself.

667
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,720
Do it at your own pace.

668
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,680
Don't be influenced by your uncle.

669
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,960
Okay, grandpa.

670
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,680
Tell me about Dr. Gu.

671
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,296
Gu Mingze.

672
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,600
I don't know him very well either.

673
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,000
Then you should.

674
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,160
No matter what.

675
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,120
such a rare talent

676
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,480
is hard to get.

677
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,960
After all,

678
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,600
when you're done at the hospital,

679
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,800
you still have to go back to Lvchuan.

680
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,560
Grandpa.

681
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,856
Dad.

682
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:37,984
Shen Mi.

683
00:29:38,784 --> 00:29:40,160
What are you doing here?

684
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,320
I am going to the R&D department.

685
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,720
I signed some contracts

686
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,220
for the new drug when I was in Thailand,

687
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:45,520
so I'll check the number

688
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,740
with Dr. Gu.

689
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:48,400
Right.

690
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,460
I also want to

691
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:51,120
meet Dr. Gu.

692
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,200
Sure, grandpa.

693
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,200
Shen Mi.

694
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:00,120
Did you see Dr. Tian just now?

695
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,400
Is Dr. Tian also at Lvchuan?

696
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,600
I just ran into her in the lobby.

697
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,000
I brought her up here.

698
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,960
Does Dr. Tian currently check on you

699
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,320
every morning and every night?

700
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,480
Your heart

701
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,600
hasn't been in trouble for years,

702
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:25,200
but it's still a big deal.

703
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,440
You have to take it seriously.

704
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,664
What's wrong?

705
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,780
Grandpa, we just had a meeting.

706
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:37,780
You must be tired.

707
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:39,360
How about I take you back first?

708
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,860
Since I'm here,

709
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:42,368
let's go.

710
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,120
Do you want to use me

711
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,800
to boost the popularity of the hospital?

712
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,100
But I'm not that famous.

713
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:01,900
You're quite famous now.

714
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:03,360
A lot of people know about you.

715
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,560
Everyone on the Internet knows you.

716
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,560
Internet?

717
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,680
You're kind of

718
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,680
an Internet celebrity right now,

719
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,880
very famous.

720
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,200
So it'd be very helpful

721
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,520
if you come to our hospital.

722
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:14,760
I…

723
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:17,900
Tianlin really needs you.

724
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:19,080
For the sake

725
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,120
of the years

726
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:22,200
we've known each other,

727
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,400
please help me.

728
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,760
Please.

729
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,440
So he's an investor in the hospital

730
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,240
and holding you

731
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:31,120
to an unreasonable bully clause, right?

732
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:36,040
Shen Mi is so rude and unreasonable,

733
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,680
so now I have no choice

734
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,040
but to count on you.

735
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:44,000
I'm sorry, I can't do so.

736
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,080
Why?

737
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:50,080
Tian Tian, you can't be humiliated like this.

738
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,500
Humiliated?

739
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:52,840
Not really.

740
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,640
He forced you to be

741
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,360
his dog's personal doctor

742
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,720
because he invested in Tianlin.

743
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,232
Don't you feel humiliated?

744
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,840
Your endurance

745
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,200
will only make him more arrogant.

746
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,280
Your only option now is to resist.

747
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,560
If this is about money, let me help you out.

748
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,360
That's not true.

749
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:24,720
Senior, you may have misunderstood.

750
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,720
Actually…

751
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:26,800
What is it?

752
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:28,800
Okay, you get busy.

753
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,144
Carlo.

754
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:34,520
This is the R&D department.
Why did you bring Carlo here?

755
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,120
You wait for me in the office.

756
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,840
- Okay.
- Wait.

757
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:42,520
Mr. Mi, Tian Tian was my schoolfellow.

758
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:43,980
She came to see me to catch up.

759
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:45,920
It's not appropriate for you to drive her away

760
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,060
in front of everyone.

761
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:48,320
Catch up?

762
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,660
Grandpa.

763
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:52,920
Dr. Gu Mingze and Dr. Tian

764
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,500
knew each other before.

765
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:55,600
Dr. Gu,

766
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,520
this is the Chairman of the Lvchuan Group,

767
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:59,000
Mr. Shen Rongxian.

768
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,040
- Nice to meet you, Chairman.
- Nice to meet you, too.

769
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,720
You were…

770
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,320
Schoolfellows.

771
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,440
Schoolfellows.

772
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:14,840
Pretty good.

773
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,040
Dr. Tian,

774
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:19,680
how is his health at the moment?

775
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,080
Currently,

776
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,440
his physical condition is normal.

777
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,720
Don't worry, grandpa.

778
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:32,000
But I think

779
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:33,760
his disease

780
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:35,720
should be taken seriously.

781
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,640
After all, the heart is no small thing.

782
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,040
I don't think daily checkup

783
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,840
is enough.

784
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,140
Things like

785
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:46,860
diet and sleep,

786
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:49,160
you have to be careful with all these.

787
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,600
Thanks for reminding, grandpa.

788
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,920
I will make a strict diet plan

789
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,160
for him later,

790
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,680
not only to ensure the proportion of nutrients

791
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,760
but also it's not the same every day.

792
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,240
Sorry to interrupt.

793
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,320
If you make it yourself,

794
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:09,140
although you can control
the nutritional ingredients,

795
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:10,600
too much soft food

796
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:11,960
can easily cause food residue

797
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,080
to stay on the teeth.

798
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:15,140
It is easy to breed bacteria over time.

799
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:16,920
So I suggest buying
the finished product instead.

800
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,592
Finished product?

801
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:26,880
Right.
I think the finished product is pretty good.

802
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,480
What's good about it?

803
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,000
Too much salt and oil is not good at all.

804
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:34,120
Grandpa, you should convince him.

805
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:36,040
I made him some healthy meal before,

806
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,400
and he didn't appreciate it.

807
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,400
Diet is very important.

808
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,800
Okay.

809
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:42,960
Dr. Tian,

810
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:46,080
please take good care of him.

811
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,560
I'll go back first.

812
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:52,100
- I-I'll walk you out.
- Grandpa, I'll walk you out too.

813
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:54,460
No need, he will do.

814
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:56,400
Don't you need to

815
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,560
talk to Dr. Gu?

816
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,064
Let's go.

817
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,680
Goodbye, grandpa.

818
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,224
Goodbye.

819
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,608
Mengnan.

820
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,200
Did Mr. Mi have a history of heart disease?

821
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:16,000
Yes, he has congenital heart disease,

822
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,900
so Dr. Tian would be his personal doctor.

823
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:20,200
Didn't you know that

824
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,320
when you were abroad?

825
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,000
<i>He forced you to be</i>

826
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:28,080
<i>his dog's personal doctor
because he invested in Tianlin.</i>

827
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,480
<i>Don't you feel humiliated?</i>

828
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:34,816
Got it.

829
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,440
By the way, take a look at this.

830
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,680
Tian Tian, I've signed another contract.

831
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,400
Here is your stuff, take it.

832
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,880
And here's your receipt, thank you.

833
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:06,960
Neither Tian Tian nor Mr. Shen came?

834
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:10,120
Shen Mi went to Lvchuan.

835
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:12,560
Tian Tian went to see Gu Mingze.

836
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,720
Why did he go to see him?

837
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,260
Do you know Gu Mingze?

838
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,360
I don't know him,

839
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,680
just heard Mr. Shen say

840
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,720
that he sells medicine.

841
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,360
No, he makes medicine.

842
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,600
Then you don't know, right?

843
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:28,360
Our Tian Tian and Gu Mingze

844
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:30,240
were schoolfellows.

845
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,120
You should go back.

846
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,000
Goodbye, grandpa.

847
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,960
I was wrong.

848
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,560
Don't scold me.

849
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,200
I told you not to come here,

850
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,140
because I was afraid something
unexpected would happen.

851
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:10,560
You didn't learn your lesson

852
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,220
at the airport, did you?

853
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:14,480
I didn't expect you'd go to meet Dr. Gu.

854
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,360
That's unexpected.

855
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:20,720
By the way, did

856
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,160
Dr. Gu figure anything out?

857
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,880
I've admitted I was wrong.

858
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,600
Why aren't you eating?

859
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,456
Eat.

860
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,200
What did Tian Tian

861
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,600
come to see you for today?

862
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,920
She just stopped by to see me.

863
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:52,960
Did she mention something

864
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,080
about…

865
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,216
About Shen Mi?

866
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:06,520
No, we just chatted.

867
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,140
Are you two close?

868
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:13,640
She looks like

869
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:16,080
she admires you a lot.

870
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,328
Really?

871
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,640
In general,

872
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:25,800
shouldn't the girl follow

873
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,200
in her idol's footsteps

874
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,880
and apply for vet medicine?

875
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,400
Why did she learn human medicine?

876
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,020
This is life, right?

877
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:39,560
There's no logic at all.

878
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,408
Let's eat.

Look, I'll put it in a bag for you.

881
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:07,760
You might want to check out
our dog food cans as well.

882
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:08,840
Excuse me, I need to make a phone call.

883

I'll check you out soon, sorry.

884

Liu, those roll-up banners and posters

885
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,480
must be delivered within an hour.

886
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,880
Thank you, please.

887
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:19,880
Thank you, okay.

888
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,760
Why are there so many people today? Am I late?

889
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,400
What? Because of Gu Mingze.

890
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:26,920
- I'll check you out.
- Senior?

891
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,720
- Two?
- Thank you.

892
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,480
Senior, why are you here?

893
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:39,080
What? Don't you want me to be here?

894
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,280
Of course yes!

895
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:42,080
On behalf of all my colleagues in Tianlin,

896
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,280
I'd like to express our gratitude.

897
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,400
Thank you for visiting our hospital.

00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:56,040
Welcome. All right.

901
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,320
You all line up a bit further.

902
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,240
All right, I'll record it right away.

903
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,360
And here's the new cat food.

904
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,480
You can have a look.

905
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,480
Yes.

906

The biggest advantage of TCM treatment

907
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,180
is that it has minor side effects.

Thank you.

00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,080

910
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:39,680
Let me tell you.

911
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,720
Don't feed

912
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,280
your cat any other cat food.

913
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,640
Once this brand of cat food is finished,

914
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:45,240
you'd come find me again. Okay, here you are.

915
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:46,720
You can have a look at the cat food over there.

916
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,260
- Goodbye then. Okay.
- Okay.

917
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:51,120
Wen, put Mr. Gu's sign over here.

918
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:53,280
Put it in a more prominent position.
Okay, put it here.

919
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,400
What is this?

920
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:57,280
Even got a sign.

921
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,160
- What are you doing?
- What's wrong? Come over.

922
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:05,360
Let me see.

923
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,760
What do you want to see?
What do you want to do?

924
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:07,920
What do I want to do? I-I want

925
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,000
to protect our Tian Tian.

926
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,600
Protect? Does she need it?

927
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:11,760
Look at them.

928
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,680
They are happy working together.

929
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,200
What do you want to do?

930
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,080
Nothing. Can't you see

931
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:18,200
Tian Tian look unhappy?

932
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:19,720
You're the one who's not happy.

933
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:22,000
- You are not happy.
- Of course I'm not happy.

934
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Peilan, didn't you support Mr. Shen?

935
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,080
Why did you suddenly change?

936
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,600
One is a perfect match.

937
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:30,200
The other is a heaven-made match.

938
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,720
One is a successful businessman.

939
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:34,060
The other is an outstanding scientist.

940
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:35,400
Oh my.

941
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,720
Who should our Tian Tian pick?

942
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,160
Me, of course.

943
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,720
Tian Tian and I are the perfect match.

944
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:41,000
Nonsense!

945
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,920
Look at Mr. Gu's handsome face.

946
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:44,840
I think he looks like a Shar Pei.

947
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,160
You like to daydream. Move.

948
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,400
What did you say?

949
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,120
Go to work.

950
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,016
Cover for me.

951
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:11,800
Who should our Tian Tian pick?

952
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:12,840
Pick what?

953
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,360
I pick work.

954
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:22,040
Yes, it's here, can you see it?

955
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:26,900
Miss Tian, come out.

956
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:28,400
I want to talk to you about something.

957
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,888
Okay.

958
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,640
I'll be right back down.

959
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:37,680
It's pretty busy out there.

960
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,040
Let's cut the chase.

961
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:43,200
Didn't Gu Mingze reject you?

962
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,880
Why is he here?

963
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:46,360
Maybe he has changed his mind

964
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:47,520
and wanted to come.

965
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,440
Isn't it a good thing he's here?

966
00:43:16,390 --> 00:43:19,910
<i>♫ Your gaze is unwavering ♫</i>

967
00:43:21,926 --> 00:43:26,470
<i>♫ Only enough to accommodate me ♫</i>

968
00:43:27,686 --> 00:43:32,358
<i>♫ I have been melted by you countless times ♫</i>

969
00:43:33,318 --> 00:43:36,870
<i>♫ Yet I'm at a loss for what to do ♫</i>

970
00:43:38,822 --> 00:43:41,766
<i>♫ I can only hold on to you ♫</i>

971
00:43:43,846 --> 00:43:47,750
<i>♫ Now you are still with me ♫</i>

972
00:43:49,414 --> 00:43:53,670
<i>♫ Traveling through time together ♫</i>

973
00:43:55,526 --> 00:44:03,462
<i>♫ Someday, I'll be completely
forgotten by the world ♫</i>

974
00:44:03,462 --> 00:44:06,662
<i>♫ Leaving no trace ♫</i>

975
00:44:06,662 --> 00:44:10,694
<i>♫ Only you will still remember ♫</i>

976
00:44:12,454 --> 00:44:14,758
<i>♫ My appearance ♫</i>
