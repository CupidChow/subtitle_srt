It should be an infection

00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:00,400
Give it a shot of ampicillin.

Dr. Chen, take a look at this.

It's an alcohol allergy.

It's a bit malnourished at the moment,

51
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,000
so I fed it an appropriate
amount of canned food.

52
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,480
I'm asking

53
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,860
if you find Professor Guo.

54
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,160
Not yet.

00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,880

56
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,520

61
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,720
Tell me.

62
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,500
Why did Gu Mingze

63
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,520
know about Professor Guo's patent?

64
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,360
I think he found it at
the Animal Medicine Summit.

69

88
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,400

96
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,060
What do you need my patent for?

97
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:46,480
I just want to use it in pet medicine.

98
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,960
After all the talk,

99
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,760
you want my patent

100
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,920
for some lymphoma drug, right?

101
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,740
Professor Guo,

102
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:59,000
what LvChuan mentioned actually--

103
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,608
Get out.

104
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,240
I told you to leave.

105
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,620
- Get out. Leave.
- Professor Guo.

106
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,440
I just want to know

107
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,040
why you didn't make a deal with Lvchuan.

108
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,832
Leave.

109
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,120
Wait, Professor Guo.

110
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,120
Why don't you want to transfer the patent?

111
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,300
My technique is to treat human,

112
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,320
not to save animal.

113
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,760
But pets also have lives.

114
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,960
As a professor of Agricultural University,

115
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,420
you should certainly be aware of it.

116
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,820
Not for me.

117
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,500
Please leave.

118
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,064

119
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,240

128
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,120

129
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,000
I don't know.

130
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,200
Shen Mi, I'm talking to you
about something serious.

131
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,960
Isn't it also related to the new drug research
and development for your Lvchuan Group?

132

Why aren't you anxious at all?

133
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,400
I think you are more

00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,440

135
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,400
Me? I'm worried about Gu Mingze?

136
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,000
It's so sour.

137
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,320
Isn't this thing sour?

138
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,200
I think someone's sourer than this.

139
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,000

Don't scare me.

147
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,040
No, it must be because Lvchuan

148
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,400
has done something wrong to Professor Kuo,

149
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,800

153
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,640
Carlo doesn't want to respond to you.

154
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,400
Maybe you've lost your mind.

155
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,700

What's the bet?

159
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,680
You'd decide.

160
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,000

161
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,600

It's called Pai.

00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,760
the most important thing for us now

188
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,840
is to find out Professor Guo's

189
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,840
heart knot.

190
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,840
In this week, if you cannot…

191
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,960
Do you think

192
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,600
he's had any kind of shock or stimulation?

193
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:48,440
It's similar to post-traumatic stress disorder.

194
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,320
Yes, post-traumatic stress disorder.

195
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,520
So he showed

196
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,080
an extreme disgust towards pets.

197
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,440
I think it's important to find out the reason.

198
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,040
It makes sense.

199
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,980
The bet.

200
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:02,000
Tian Tian.

201
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,080
- I've been looking for you.
- What's wrong?

202
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,680
The name on this tag

203
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,880
must be the dog's owner's.

204
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,400
Guo Fan.

205
00:11:12,993 --> 00:11:14,582
<i>[GF]</i>

206
00:11:15,552 --> 00:11:16,880
<i>How is it?</i>

207
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,320
<i>There's nothing special here.</i>

208
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,800
<i>No one's lived here in a while,</i>

209
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,680
<i>and there are signs of fire.</i>

210
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,400
<i>We also went to your previous house</i>

211
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,280
<i>and found it abandoned.</i>

212
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,440
<i>Was there a fire?</i>

213
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,984
I got it.

214
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,720
Miss.

215
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,020
If you have any questions, ask my father.

216
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,640
Do you recognize this dog?

217
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,840
Come back early.

218
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,304
Professor Guo.

219
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,800
Why are you here again?

220
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,260
Look who I brought for you.

221
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:25,260
Pai.

222
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,440
It's still alive.

223
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,600
I don't even

224
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,740
have a dog.

225
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:39,800
You're making a mistake.

226
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,320
Professor Guo.

227
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,560
What about this tag?

228
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,460
Pai has never taken it off.

229
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:48,160
Whoever tried to

230
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,760
take the tag down,

231
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,920
got rejected by Pai.

232
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,680
It has been waiting

233
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,720
for its owner

234
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,440
and guarding its home in that place.

235
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,920
Go away.

236
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,480
Go away.

237
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,160
Pai.

238
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,800
Let's go back to the hospital with me.

239
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,960
I'll take you to eat something nice.

240
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,424
Don't chase it.

241
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,240
Don't you have a friend
at the Agricultural University?

242
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,060
Yes, so what?

243
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:37,880
Find her and we'll find the answer.

244
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,200
Professor Guo's daughter is also
at the Agricultural University.

245
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,568
Thank you.

246
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,420
You haven't been back in a while.

247
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:58,440
Why don't you come back
to visit me after graduation?

248
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,440
I'm afraid

249
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,120
I don't want to leave when I get back.

250
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,680
I miss those days at school,

251
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,280
all we only had to worry is study.

252
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,680
Now,

253
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,680
things are tough.

254
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,040
I have to shoulder everything myself.

255
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,800
That's impossible.

256
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,120
You have Mr. Shen

257
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,680
to be your strong support, right?

258
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,120
Speak of Guo Jiao,

259
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,320
she's a junior this year.

260
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,480
She's a biology student.
It's kind of follow her father's career.

261
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,440
Guo Jiao, over here.

262
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,320
You guys chat, I'm leaving.

263
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,280
Guo Jiao, right?

264
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,320
Don't be nervous.

265
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,640
You should call me senior.

266
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,600
H-Hello, senior.

267
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,160
What can I do for you?

268
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,640
I just wanted to ask you something.

269
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,160
Please.

270
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,840
Is Pai

271
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,000
the dog

272
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,880
raised by your father, Professor Guo Fan?

273
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,720
Then why didn't he admit it?

274
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,240
Did Pai have anything to do

275
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,960
with that fire in your house?

276
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,880
Can you tell us about it?

277
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,640
Back then,

278
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,680
Pai played with the alcohol on the table,

279
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,640
and then

280
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,280
caused a fire

281
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,220
and burned down the house.

282
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:44,160
The precious toxic strain
my father had nurtured for years

283
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,320
got ruined too.

284
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,740
Since then,

285
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:49,720
my father was always in a bad mood.

286
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,320
He didn't want to see any cats or dogs.

287
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,720
He used to give a lecture
at the Agricultural University,

288
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,600
but

289
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,240
he never came again,

290
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,900
but did research at home by himself.

291
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:03,560
Do you mean it's Pai played with the alcohol

292
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,920
and spilled it,

293
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:05,920
so caused the fire?

294
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,240
<i>Dr. Chen, take a look at this.</i>

295
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,040
<i>It's an alcohol allergy.</i>

296
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,480
Pai is allergic to alcohol.

297
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,440
Why would it play with alcohol?

298
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,760
If there's nothing else, I have to go now.

299
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:29,720
Guo Jiao, I have something to say to you.

300
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:33,360
Would you like to stay and listen?

301
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,760
I had a dog when I was a kid.

302
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:47,720
It's a cute border collie, named Zaizai.

303
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,360
It always followed me around,

304
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,840
just like Pai and you.

305
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,280
One New Year's Eve,

306
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,540
my mom had been busy

307
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:57,040
and preparing the New Year's Eve dinner

308
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,680
all day long,

309
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:01,400
me and Zaizai played around in the house.

310
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,760
But

311
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,240
we accidentally…

312
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,560
<i>Tian Tian, what's wrong with you?</i>

313
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,599
<i>I-It's Zaizai's fault.</i>

314
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,839
<i>Tian Dongqing, come out now.</i>

315
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,079
<i>What happened?</i>

316
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:22,160
<i>Look for yourself.</i>

317
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,760
<i>I've been working all day
and now it's all in vain.</i>

318
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,839
<i>The dog you brought back ruined everything.</i>

319
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,720
<i>Never mind. Dogs don't understand it.</i>

320
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,520
<i>You can cook something
with the ingredients in the kitchen.</i>

321
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,640
<i>Ingredients?</i>

322
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,140
<i>There's nothing left.</i>

323
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:33,760
<i>Look at the time now.</i>

324
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,440
<i>The market is closed.</i>

325
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,080
<i>On this big day, other people are
enjoying delicious meal,</i>

326
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,880
<i>and we can just enjoy nothing.</i>

327
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,840
<i>- Come here.
- What are you doing?</i>

328
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,800
<i>I have to kick it out.</i>

329
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,280
<i>- You'll hurt it.
- Come here. Go.</i>

330
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,400
<i>- Don't drag it.
- Come here.</i>

331
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,600
<i>Zaizai. It's not Zaizai's fault.</i>

332
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,480
<i>I-It was me.</i>

333
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,580
<i>I was the one</i>

334
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:57,180
<i>who knocked over the table.</i>

335
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:59,760
<i>It's not Zaizai's fault.</i>

336
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,480
<i>Tian Tian, are you telling the truth?</i>

337
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,360
<i>Kid, Zaizai can't speak,</i>

338
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,760
<i>so it can't</i>

339
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,920
<i>defend itself.</i>

340
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,000
<i>Dad is so proud of you</i>

341
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,040
<i>for being brave enough</i>

342
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,360
<i>to stand up and admit that you made a mistake</i>

343
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:25,400
<i>and not let Zaizai be wronged.</i>

344
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,200
<i>We all make mistakes</i>

345
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,360
<i>and are afraid of being blamed</i>

346
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,400
<i>for making mistakes.</i>

347
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,280
<i>As long as we are brave enough
to admit our mistakes,</i>

348
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,080
<i>we can overcome</i>

349
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,020
<i>and change them</i>

350
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:41,400
<i>to start over.</i>

351
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,880
<i>Zaizai, I'm sorry.</i>

352
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,240
<i>I was wrong just now.</i>

353
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,960
It has been wearing this necklace

354
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,920
and waiting for you
near the house that's burned down

355
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,120
for five years.

356
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,720
Even though you don't think of it
as your dog anymore,

357
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,400
it has been waiting for you

358
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,080
and thinking of you

359
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,584
in these five years.

360
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,600
I'm sorry.

361
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,280
Pai,

362
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,440
I'm sorry.

363
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,600
Actually I was the one

364
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,820
who caused

365
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,400
that fire.

366
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,520
Guo Jiao.

367
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,760
I know it's hard to admit your mistake.

368
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:56,880
But it's going to be harder
to live with that guilt.

369
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,400
Go home

370
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,440
and explain it clearly to your father.

371
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,000
What are you doing here?

372
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
This is not your house.

373
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,384
Stay away from me.

374
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,520
Don't follow me.

375
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,080
Get away from me.

376
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,640
Why are you following me?

377
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,976
Don't follow me.

378
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,120
Don't follow me.

379
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,360
Stop following me.

380
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,360
Mr. Guo.

381
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,380
Mr. Zhang.

382
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:26,640
- Are you going to go shopping?
- Yes.

383
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,864
Is this your dog?

384
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,360
No.

385
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:34,120
My son bought me a good wine today,

386
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,320
come to my place for a drink tonight.

387
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,180
It's nice.

388
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:38,300
Thank you.

389
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,480
Okay, goodbye then.

390
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,920
- Take care. Goodbye.
- Take care. Goodbye.

391
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,440
It won't even move. Hit it.

392
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,832
Yes, hit it.

393
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,000
Kids.

394
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,800
Kids.

395
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,420
How can you do so?

396
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:02,140
Why are you hitting the dog?

397
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:03,840
Who taught you to bully animals?

398
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,400
Whose kids are they?

399
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,080
Who's their parents?

400
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,336
Well…

401
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,840
I told you not to follow me.

402
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:19,200
Don't follow me. Why don't you listen?

403
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,640
Raising you all these years,

404
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,000
you're really ungrateful.

405
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,968
Don't follow me.

406
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,400
Eat and go.

407
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,320
What's the matter?

408
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,240
Aren't these Mr. Guo's glasses?

409
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,460
Why are they here?

410
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:39,680
I hope nothing bad happened.

411
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:52,200
Dad, why don't you stay in hospital?

412
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,680
I'm fine. Don't worry, I'm fine.

413
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,420
Professor Guo, perhaps you should
stay in hospital for further observation.

414
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:00,960
No need.

415
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,460
I've already received an IV.

416
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:04,000
I'll be fine taking a break at home.

417
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,040
Uncle Zhang, it's fortunate
that you took my dad to the hospital,

418
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,440
thank you for saving my dad.

419
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,720
Don't thank me,

420
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,160
you should thank Pai.

421
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,840
Yes.

422
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:17,960
At that time,

423
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,120
I laid on the ground

424
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,660
and couldn't even move.

425
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:24,220
Luckily I heard

426
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:25,320
Pai's barking,

427
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,520
or I would have fainted.

428
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,280
That would be dangerous.

429
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,000
If Pai hadn't come to me

430
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,080
with your dad's glasses,

431
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,800
I didn't even know your dad was in trouble.

432
00:26:47,716 --> 00:26:51,781
<i>♫ Let's go home after a walk ♫</i>

433
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,920
Dad.

434
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,240
Actually,

435
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,760
it's not Pai's fault

436
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,280
for that fire.

437
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,160
It's all because of me.

438
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,400
That day I went home

439
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:12,400
to try to do the chemistry experiment,

440
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,360
when dealing with metallic sodium,

441
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,240
I dropped sodium metal

442
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,800
on a puddle of water on the bench.

443
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,096
As a result…

444
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,160
Dad.

445
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,920
I'm sorry.

446
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:31,700
I ruined your important experimental materials.

447
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:34,760
I'm sorry, Dad. I was too scared.

448
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:35,860
Jiao.

449
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:36,960
Don't be sad.

450
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,240
Let bygones be bygones.

453

Jiao, I'm not the one
you should be apologizing for,

454
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,720
but Pai.

I'm sorry.

458
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,600

460

but…

462
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:18,960
It's never too late.

463
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,560
Just start over.

464
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,100
Pai is back now.

465
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:25,160
Yes.

466
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,480

475

Professor Guo has agreed
to transfer the patent.

476

What would be the general market price

477
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:22,840
for this patent?

478
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,920
This

479
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,080
is priceless to those who need it.

480
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,400
It's hard to define
in terms of general market prices.

481
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,040
I'm asking you for a price.

482
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:36,160
Do you need to be so strict? Boring.

483
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,800
I'm boring, right?

484
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:41,240
All right, let's do business.

485
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,120
The loser complies with the result.

486
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,760
I want you to throw away
all the pickles in the kitchen

487
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,800
and whatever you're eating right now.

488
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:47,800
Interesting.

489
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,520
You're the most interesting!

490
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,160
No.

491
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,720
You see, I got this patent

492
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:56,920
for Lvchuan today,

493
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,480
you have to spare me.

494
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,080
I contribute a lot.

495
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,640
One and for all.

496
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,192
Alright.

497
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:11,880
Petty,

498
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,160
stingy,

499
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:16,000
never praise me, but--

500
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
What are you saying?

501
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,920
I said…

502
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,580
I said I want to watch TV.

503
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:23,460
I didn't say anything.

504
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:25,080
<i>Hello, everyone.</i>

<i>it will fill the gap

00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,480
Lvchuan is holding
a press launch in a few days,

517
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,280
do you think if Mr. Gu can make it?

518
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,720
Definitely not.

519
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,880
No?

520
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,240
Then what are we going to do?
The press launch is coming soon.

521
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,240
It's a secret.

522
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,680
What?

523
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,300
Do you find it fun to keep it a secret?

524
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:13,000
Yes.

525
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:14,960
Really?

526
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,160
Let me tell you,
these pickled mangoes are the real fun.

527
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,720
I'm going to ask my mom to make many

528
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,920
and put them in your room
as a freshener and a perfume.

529
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:24,040
I start eating them from morning.

530
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,200
I start eating them
right after brushing my teeth.

531
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,400
I eat them in front of you every day.

532
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,880
Childish.

533
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,936
Come in.

534
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:55,120
Mr. Gu, it's time for meals.

535
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,280
Thank you.

536
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,280
You haven't stepped out the door

537
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,600

538
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:02,300
Yes, time is ticking away.

borrow the college lab.

541
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,320
About borrowing the lab,

542
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,680
it was Tian Tian who reminded me.

543
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,200
You should thank her.

544
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,920
Yes, thanks to her,

545
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,480

546
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,000
Well, you go busy.

547
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
I'm leaving then.

548
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,984
Okay.

549
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,392

557
00:33:41,203 --> 00:33:45,989
<i>[Lvchuan Group's Rockfield &
New Pet Lymphoma Drug Press Launch]</i>

558
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,160
Mr. Gu, you haven't had a rest in days, right?

559
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,400
What's the situation now?

560
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,140
The activity of
the protease enzyme is excellent,

561
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:10,860
it can effectively inhibit the toxicity.

562
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:13,920
it's just the current clinical test samples
are not enough.

563
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,060
If I had one more month…

564
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:17,480
One month?

565
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:19,880
That's too late.
The press launch is on tomorrow.

566
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,780
Right. It's a bit late.

567
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:24,560
Mr. Gu, is there anything else we can do?

568
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:27,040
Otherwise all the previous efforts
will be in vain.

569
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,700
Just sleep well first.

570
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:30,440
We've got a tough battle tomorrow.

571
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,639
Okay.

572
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:37,480
Rest assured, all arrangements
have been made inside and outside the venue.

573
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,420
There will be 50 or 60
online and offline medias

574
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:40,520
tomorrow.

575
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,679
Heads of authorities

576
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:42,719
and experts in veterinary medicine

577
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:43,720
will be there.

578
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:47,080
The buffet will be handled by
the Executive Chef of Vision International.

579
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,832
There won't be any problem.

580
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:52,239
Ren Fei.

581
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:54,360
The point is, how's Ren going?

582
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,800
As a precaution, Dr. Ren Fei

583
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,520
is staying at the venue hotel tonight.

584
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,480
I'll be there two hours early tomorrow morning

585
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,520
to perform a detailed inspection again.

586
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,680
When do you plan to get there?

587
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:06,000
T-Two hours early.

588
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:11,160
I'm going to the scene right now with Ren Fei.

589
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,740
Okay.

590
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:19,920
I have to go now.

591
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,568
Bye.

592
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,560
What are you doing here?

593
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:26,960
Didn't you ask me to come?

594
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:30,600
To take the invitation
for some new drug launch.

595
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,280
I asked you to take it a week ago.

596
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,320
Did you?

597
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:35,840
You have no idea

598
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,360
how busy I am.

599
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:39,360
Enough, you are busy at playing games.

600
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,240
It's gone.

601
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:43,120
- Really?
- Yes.

602
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,760
I'm leaving then.

603
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,200
Wait here.

604
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:59,120
This is the group card for the launch.

605
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,160
Don't lose it.

606
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,480
Okay.

607
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,800
Do come tomorrow.

608
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,720
If I'm not busy,

609
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,000
I will definitely come.

610
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,560
What are you busy at?

611
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,400
Why is it so quiet here?

612
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,800
Indeed.

613
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,840
Shen Mi and Tian Tian didn't come.

614
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,900
I'm surprised.

615
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:33,440
The morning rush is already over.

616
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,000
They said they had to take a leave.

617
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,320
Then why didn't Shen Chen come?

618
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,080
He also

619
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:40,360
took a leave too.

620
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,640
How about this?

621
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:42,840
Let's take a leave too.

622
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:45,060
Look at the beautiful spring,

623
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:46,480
let's take a walk by Long Lake

624
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,520
and drink a cup of tea.

625
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,480
It's going to be wonderful.

626
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:50,960
- Wonderful?
- How's that?

627
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,600
Get back to work.

628
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,640
Wonderful.

629
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,140
- Go.
- My cup.

630
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:57,120
- Get to work.
- Alright.

631
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:57,720
- Go now.
- Okay.

632
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,640
- Get to work.
- Alright. Work is wonderful.

633
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,832
Alright.

634
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:07,780
Everyone should be here by now.

635
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:10,000
Director Zhang and his team
should be arriving soon.

636
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:15,280
Director Zhang, it's an honor
to have you with us.

637
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,320
This drug launch event

638
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,840
you Lvchuan has organized

639
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:18,960
is quite grand.

640
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,600
The leaders are all very much interested.

641
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,520
Thank you. Please take a seat
and I'll introduce you around later.

642
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:24,440
- Okay.
- Please.

643
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,580
Please come in. Director Zhang, please.

644
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:26,720
Please come in.

645
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,880
No one is allowed in without an invitation.

646
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,380
If there's any trouble, call the police.

647
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:34,160
I got it, especially Shen…

648
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,944
Okay.

649
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,560
Please come in.

650
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,320
Please come in.

651
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,400
Those three guys over there,

652
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,640
no matter what they say,

653
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:03,680
do not let them in.

654
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,000
- Did you hear me?
- Yes.

655
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,240
Hello, guest card, please.

656
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:12,320
We are Lvchuan's staff, not guests.

657
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,680
- Then staff card, please.
- Staff card?

658
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:16,480
No one can get in without a staff card.

659
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,200
Are you kidding me?

660
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,420
I am Shen Mi from Lvchuan.

661
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:22,520
Let me in.

662
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:24,280
I'm sorry. No one can get in

663
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,560
without a staff card.

664
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:27,680
Don't you recognize Shen Mi, your CEO?

665
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,160
You could recognize his face.

666
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,408
<i>[Shen Chen. Come to the back door. Hurry.]</i>

667
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,344
Go.

668
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:54,976
Go.

669
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,520
Hurry up, follow me.

670
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,200
Why are you here?

671
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,360
I-I'm here to protect you.

672
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,240
Why would I be here if you weren't here?

673
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,600
How did you get these cards?

674
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,160
How is it? Am I amazing?

675
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,360
Amazing.

676
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,480
Admire me. Whatever you want,

677
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,520
I can get it for you.

678
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:28,840
I thought you weren't coming.

679
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,880
I wouldn't be here for you,

680
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:33,900
but for Tian Tian,

681
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:34,920
I definitely have to come.

682
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:37,520
Wait. What did you say?

683
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,600
Are you all clear about

684
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:43,720
the plan for later?

685
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,560
Let's play it by ear.

686
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,160
Okay.

687
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,856
Shen Hongyuan.

688
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:57,200
Okay, I got it.

689
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,120
Hiding here is not a good way.
We'll get caught.

690
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,864
Trust me.

691
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:05,360
Mr. Shen.

692
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:07,200
- What's wrong?
- What a coincidence, Mr. Shen.

693
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,240
- Come on.
- What's wrong?

694
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,520
Wait. Talk about it later.

695
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,640
What are you doing? You're acting weird.

696
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:17,760
Now I am a staff member.

697
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:18,760
Shouldn't I show

698
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:21,400
the enthusiasm of the staff

699
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,560
and the spirit of the staff

700
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,680
at Lvchuan Group?

701
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:26,740
Right. It's good.

702
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:28,400
Nice attitude. Just listen carefully later.

703
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:30,840
Dad.

704
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,800
Don't you want me to see

705
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,880
how you beat my brother to a crawl?

706
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,400
What?

707
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,760
Is your dad that narrow-minded?

708
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:41,840
I've told you

709
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:44,360
I'm fighting for Lvchuan Group for you.

710
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,520
How many more years can I work?

711
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:48,000
Okay, well, I'll be right down there.

712
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,520
I'll clap

713
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:50,920
and dance for you.

714
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,520
Be serious.

715
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:54,640
I-I'll beat you up.

716
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:57,280
It's an honor to be here today

717
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,360
- to…
- Dr. Ren, I'm done.

718
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,360
Please take a look.

719
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,400
Done, right?

720
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,400
Okay.

721
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,400
Well, then I won't bother you anymore.

722
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,880
- We're leaving.
- Okay.

723
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:07,520
Xin, let's go.

724
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:10,720
Everybody knows…

725
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,240
Mr. Gu.

726
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:16,840
You go straight down this passageway

727
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,460
and then turn right,
then you'll arrive the backstage.

728
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:19,560
I'll go to the control room.

729
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:22,048
Got it.

730
00:41:23,776 --> 00:41:25,120
Have you remembered it?

731
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:27,200
I'm afraid I'm going to mess it up.

732
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,960
Tian Tian, you have to trust yourself.

733
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,160
Think about it,

734
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:33,560
Ren Fei knows me and Gu Mingze.

735
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:35,280
There's no one else
who can get this done right now

736
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,740
but you.

737
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:39,040
We all have faith in you, okay?

738
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:40,760
- Okay?
- Trust me.

739
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:42,816
Keep it up!

740
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:46,464
Then I'll go.

741
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:43,750
<i>♫ Your gaze is unwavering ♫</i>

742
00:42:45,766 --> 00:42:50,310
<i>♫ Only enough to accommodate me ♫</i>

743
00:42:51,526 --> 00:42:56,198
<i>♫ I have been melted by you countless times ♫</i>

744
00:42:57,158 --> 00:43:00,710
<i>♫ Yet I'm at a loss for what to do ♫</i>

745
00:43:02,662 --> 00:43:05,606
<i>♫ I can only hold on to you ♫</i>

746
00:43:07,686 --> 00:43:11,590
<i>♫ Now you are still with me ♫</i>

747
00:43:13,254 --> 00:43:17,510
<i>♫ Traveling through time together ♫</i>

748
00:43:19,366 --> 00:43:27,302
<i>♫ Someday, I'll be completely
forgotten by the world ♫</i>

749
00:43:27,302 --> 00:43:30,502
<i>♫ Leaving no trace ♫</i>

750
00:43:30,502 --> 00:43:34,534
<i>♫ Only you will still remember ♫</i>

751
00:43:36,294 --> 00:43:38,598
<i>♫ My appearance ♫</i>
