[Episode 30]

26
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,960
Don't you remember this instrument?

27
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,480
It was originally yours.

28
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:53,120
I just helped to restore
and refurbish it to its original state.

29
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,960
Yes, it's that instrument.

30
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,240
I remember now.

31
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,440
No, the main thing is,

32
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,920
you refurbished it so well

33
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,160
that I didn't recognize it.

34
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,280
So you don't remember.

35
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,120
The words you said to me back then.

36
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,480
Do you not remember them either?

37
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,112
Mengnan,

38
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,160
back then,

39
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,360
we were both so little.

40
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,000
As for what I said at that time,

41
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,912
don't

42
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,520
take it too seriously, okay?

43
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,280
Don't take it too seriously?

44
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,640
Was it that the feelings
you had for me back then,

45
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,920
the words you said about liking me,

46
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,520
were all lies to me?

47
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,704
Shen Mi,

48
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,560
you promised to be with me forever.

49
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,320
I'm sorry, Mengnan.

50
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,000
In fact, I should have

51
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,520
explained things to you a long time ago.

52
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,200
Since returning to the country,

53
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,520
I've always regarded you as my family,

54
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,160
like my younger sister.

55
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,600
That me who said

56
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,320
I liked you before

57
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,120
is no longer here.

58
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,600
Stop talking.

59
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,720
Forget about the things when we were little.

60
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,960
Stop talking.

61
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,200
I don't want to hear it.

62
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,600
Mengnan…

63
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,880
Stop talking. Please leave.

64
00:05:33,312 --> 00:05:34,640
Mengnan, actually I…

65
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,680
I beg you, please go.

66
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,616
I'm sorry.

67
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,000
What are you doing?

68
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,720
Packing up to go home.

69
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,480
Why?

70
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,920
There's no reason.

71
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,840
It's not good for me
to always live at your place.

72
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,400
Besides, I sleep on this hard
and narrow coach every day,

73
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,440
it's uncomfortable.

74
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,720
I have a big and soft bed at home.

75
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,080
Why wouldn't I go back to live?

76
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,820
Also, I don't want the rest of the stuff.

77
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:46,840
You can throw them away.

78
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,248
Wait.

79
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,520
Do you have anything else to say?

80
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,760
After you go back, remember to eat on time.

81
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,640
Eat fewer snacks.

82
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,760
Your stomach is not good.

83
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,080
Eat less spicy food.

84
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,960
Thank you for your concern, Mr. Shen.

85
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,640
You don't have to worry about me in the future.

86
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,392
I'm leaving now.

87
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,744
Stop waiting.

88
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,920
She's already left.

89
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,620
Hello, this is your delivery.

90
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:55,960
Please sign for it.

91
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,232
Alright, thank you.

92
00:11:03,232 --> 00:11:04,920
Could you close the door, please?

93
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,400
Okay.

94
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,000
What's wrong?

95
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,320
I ordered hot pot base,

96
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,560
but it was not delivered.

97
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,480
I wanted to make hot pot for you this evening.

98
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,000
All these purchases are useless now.

99
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,480
It's okay,
just put everything in the refrigerator.

100
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,680
It won't spoil immediately.

101
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,960
We can have it some other day.

102
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,760
Watch your hands.

103
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,800
Be careful.

104
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,840
All right, watch out, watch out.

105
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,640
Done and dusted.

106
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,680
It's okay, isn't it?

107
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,320
- Have a sip of water.
- Thank you.

108
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,980
Miss Tian, take a look.

109
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,160
How's the decoration?

110
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,760
Is the festival atmosphere there?

111
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,760
Very nice.

112
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,320
I appreciate your effort.

113
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,440
Why didn't she come with Shen Mi?

114
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,520
Deeply in love,

115
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,000
but fate is shallow.

116
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,280

00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,880
- Just a little bit.
- Only a bit?

121
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,520
That's not good, I have to gloat!

122
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,640

Now that you mentioned it,

130
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,720
she's moved out.

131
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:15,160
It seems this relationship is irreparable.

132
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,920
Can't you wish for something better?

133
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,920
I'm neutral.

134
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,000
Besides,

135
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,440
it's not just Shen Mi who woos Miss Tian

136
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:27,000
at our Tianlin Hospital.

137
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,376
Maybe…

138
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,960
There is even a group.

139
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:32,960
What do you mean?

140
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,240
Everyone,

141
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,120
are you? Are you…?

142
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,560
The destination of navigation is here?

143
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,480
We are here for the kids' beauty treatment.

144
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,680
Didn't we arrange it yesterday?

145
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,120
You have an appointment?

146
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,260
Casual Beauty?

147
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:44,400
Yes.

148
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,740
Casual Beauty?

149
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:47,440
Why do you want to try Casual Beauty?

150
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:52,280
Hello, I am the director of this hospital.

151
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,760
May I ask why you are here today

152
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,400
to experience Casual Beauty?

153
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:56,960
Isn't it Qixi Festival?

154
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,560
Loft 49 will host

155
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,400
a Love Your Pet Qixi Party.

156
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,200
So, I wanted to make our fur baby

157
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,160
look a bit more elegant and shiny.

158
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,000
We don't want those common things.

159
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,020
You understand?

160
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:08,600
We

161
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,208
don't really understand.

162
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,520
Look, look, it's this kind.

163
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,016
This kind.

164
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,888
Well…

165
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,760
Why do they all seem
to have no idea about this?

166
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,400
Did we go to the wrong place?

167
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,600
You really did…

168
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,800
come to the right place.

169
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,480
Get Yuxian to work quickly.

170
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,400
Quick, quick, quick.

171
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,800
Peilan, can you register everyone?
We will prepare for a bit.

172
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,160
Come on, come on.

173
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,480
Please this way, this way.

174
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,160
Please line up in order, line up neatly.

175
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,000
There is no rush.

176
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,440
Don't push each other, don't push.

177
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,160
Don't push.

178
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,440
Take your time, line up please.

179
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,200
Line up, line up.

180
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,340
Can you follow our reference images?

181
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:05,600
What reference?

182
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,160
The images of Casual Beauty.

183
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,800
I just love these colors.

184
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:10,960
This color scheme.

185
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,480
It's Casual Beauty.

186
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,120

A surprise sounds good.

All right, bring it on.

All right, we'll wait to see your surprise.

You've done this to us.

Let's hear your explanation.

221
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,720
Our hospital

222
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,640
has never had Casual Beauty service,

223
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,240
and we won't offer it in the future.

Poor thing.

00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,320
The puppy you see before you

239
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:00,480
is a victim of irrational beauty treatments
like Casual Beauty.

240
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,560
Oh my god.

241
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,960
This is its picture before the treatment.

242
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:04,960
This is too pitiful.

243
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,640
Indeed, the damage is too great.

244
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,760
Dyes contain a large amount of chemicals,

245
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:11,200
which can cause irritant impact on pets' skin.

246
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,840
Especially as they have a keen sense of smell,

247
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:13,840
it can lead to

248
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,280
irreversible consequences.

00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,880
Is this okay? Look.

373
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,880
Look how good this angle is, look.

374
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:51,940
And this way, come on.

375
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:52,960
Okay, come on.

376
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,320
- Take a few more pictures.
- Let's go, okay.

377
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,880
Be careful, don't slip.

378
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,160
Little Q, do you see, is it lively?

379
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,560
Is it fun?

380
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,440
This kitten is so cute.

381
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,480
I hope these can all be distributed today.

382
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,840
So many people.

383
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,240
So many people.

384
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,360
Can they listen to us in this mess?

385
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,960
It's okay, everything is up to us.

386
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,800
Yes, take it as it comes.

387
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:38,800
Let's get to work first.

388
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,560
Let's split up.

389
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,120
- Go for it.
- You guys go over there.

390
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,320
Keep going.

391
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,600
- Over there.
- Go.

392
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,080
Grandpa, the wind is too strong.

393
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,160
How about we go inside the car?

394
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,420
It's fine.

395
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:58,880
Walk with me more.

396
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,744
Shen Mi,

397
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,060
today when I got home,

398
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:16,120
your mom was making a fuss.

399
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,840
She wanted me to hire
a new private doctor for you.

400
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,480
When asked why,

401
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,560
she didn't give a straight answer.

402
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,480
Can you tell me

403
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,720
why this is?

404
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,200
A few days ago,

405
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,480
Dr. Tian came to our house for dinner.

406
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,560
There's nothing wrong with that.

407
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,480
Mengnan was there too.

408
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:50,440
I can feel what the scene was like.

409
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,312
Grandpa,

410
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:55,840
I didn't expect

411
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,840
that something like that
would happen that night.

412
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,800
Originally I wanted to formally introduce

413
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,400
Dr. Tian to my mom.

414
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,000
It was my fault that messed all up.

415
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:12,160
Shen Mi,

416
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,320
let me ask you,

417
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,320
do you know

418
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,400
what the hardest thing in life is?

419
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,960
Peace of mind.

420
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,080
Shen Mi,

421
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:33,040
you grew up with me watching over you.

422
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:36,280
I know you're a good child.

423
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,880
Do

424
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,640
as you wish.

425
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,760
No need to overthink.

426
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,040
With me here,

427
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,280
I support you.

428
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,600
Thank you, Grandpa.

429
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,792
Thank you.

430
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:35,640
Would you like to learn about the harm
caused by Casual Beauty? Please learn about it.

431
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:38,280
I want to talk to you
about the risks of Casual Beauty.

432
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,960
Hello, how about understanding the dangers
of irrational beauty treatments?

433
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,760
Hello, hello, can you take a look?

434
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:51,880
This is our hospital's brochure.

435
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,400
- No need.
- Would you take a look, please?

436
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,400
Hello, hello.

437
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:58,040
This is about rejecting
irrational beauty treatments.

438
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,440
Can you have a look, please?

439
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:14,960
Still eating, there are so many people.

440
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,240
Give me face.

441
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,720
You came here to eat?

442
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:20,920
Handle serious matters.

443
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,360
Rejecting irrational beauty treatments.

444
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,440
Starting with myself.

445
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,640
Must be rational.

446
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:36,280
You dyed this,
definitely not as good as what we do.

447
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,320
- No need, no need.
- Get to know it, get to know it

448
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,800
No need, really no need.

449
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,200
Really not necessary? Don't need it? Forget it.

450
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:43,280
- Come on, Bro, take a look.
- Let me see.

451
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:45,040
Right, look at the dog that you dyed.

452
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,600
The fact that it's dyed
doesn't necessarily mean it's healthy.

453
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,160
- Alright, no need, no need.
- Dye less in the future.

454
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,640
If you want to dye, you can go to our hospital.

455
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,200
Tianlin Hospital.

456
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,600
Hello, get to know this.

457
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,960
This project called Casual Beauty

458
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:56,160
could possibly cause ulceration

459
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,320
on the dog's skin.

460
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,640
- Get to know it.
- Let's go.

461
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,720
Get to know it.

462
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,000
Hello, you also have a pet.

463
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,040
Here is our flyer, please have a look.

464
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,160
What's this?

465
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,440
Let's go shoot over there.

466
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,620
Doudou is so well-behaved.

467
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:20,880
Miss,

468
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,000
the fur of your dog…

469
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,160
Isn't this color beautiful?

470
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,000
I just dyed my baby this afternoon.

471
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,920
Do you also want to dye your dog?

472
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:31,480
Shall I send the phone number
of that beauty shop to you?

473
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,960
No need.

474
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,560
Actually, what I want to say is,

475
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,680
dyeing the small dog like this

476
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,720
will cause serious harm to its body.

477
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,600
What do you mean?

478
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,480
Doudou is like my own child.

479
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,920
Could I possibly harm it?

480
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,240
Who are you?

481
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,840
You are criticizing people here.

482
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,560
I am a pet doctor from Tianlin Hospital.

483
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:50,320
Our hospital

484
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,400
has this irrational

485
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,680
beauty promotion.

486
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:55,280
You can take a look.
There are a lot of cases on it.

487
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:57,560
Honey, the pet obstacle race
seems to be about to start over there.

488
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,640
Let's go and watch, come on.

489
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,960
Please have a look.

490
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,560
It's very helpful.

491
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,200
This little dog is too pitiful.

492
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,984
Ladies and gentlemen,

493
00:30:09,984 --> 00:30:12,700

Get to the front of the stage.

497
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:19,360
So next,

498
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,940

- a special contest.
- Look.

507
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,560
That is, the selection of the best couple.

508
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:41,360
Bravo! Bravo!

509
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,680
Our competition will test comprehensively

510
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,240
the intimacy,

511
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,600
mutual understanding, and trust between lovers.

What are you doing?

515
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,680
Participating in the competition.

516
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,640
- Where is Lele?
- Lele is with Wen Jing.

517
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,960
Why are we participating?

518
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,840
Real couples are the ones who participate,

519
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,060
but we are not.

520
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,640
If we participate,

521
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,520
we can become the best couple.

522
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,120
If we become the best couple,
we can take the main stage.

523
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,320
On the main stage,
you can say whatever you want.

524
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:13,200
Right? Wouldn't it be worthwhile
after a night's efforts?

525
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,432
Right?

526
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,720
Understood? Let's go, let's go.

527
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,240
- But…
- Let's go, let's go.

528
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,640
Our competition is about to start.

529
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,200
One last slot left.

530
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,920
- We want to play too.
- Okay.

531
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,400
Then hurry onto the stage.

532
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,720
How do we play this?

533
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,200
Help hold this. Okay, thank you.

534
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,000
Come on.

535
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,440
Okay now, all eight couples on stage

536
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,940
are ready.

537
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:40,040
Our competition will officially start then.

538
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,840
The first round is going to test

539
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,200
the degree of cooperation between a couple.

540
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,080
First, please have our eight couples

541
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,760
sit back to back.

542
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,000
Okay, everyone please be careful.

543
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,680
Okay, place both legs flat.

544
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,440
Then cross

545
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,880
your arms.

546
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:00,880
The rule is very simple.

547
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,840
Stand up within ten seconds

548
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,000
and you pass.

549
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,380
Get ready.

550
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:06,440
Countdown.

551
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:09,280
Three, two, one, start.

552
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,680
They're all up.

553
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,460
Soon, soon.

554
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:19,000
Not good, young people.

555
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,640
Not as fast as us old comrades.

556
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,440
Hang in there, Tian Tian.

557
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,336
We're up.

558
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,480
It's really a pity.

559
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,760
Let's say goodbye to the three couples
who didn't make it.

560
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,520
Congratulations

561
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,680
to our five successful couples.

562
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,880
Next we enter

563
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,200
the second round of testing.

564
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,560
Please have our staff

565
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:41,760
bring the props onto the stage.

566
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,440
Okay our props on stage

567
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,080
are all in place now.

568
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,160
- You know?
- I believe the couples on stage

569
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,560
are very curious.

570
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,000
Next, let me introduce

571
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,800
the rules for the second round of our game.

572
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,120
In this round, what is to be tested is

573
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:58,260
the level of trust between a couple.

574
00:32:58,260 --> 00:32:59,520
For gentlemen, it's very simple.

575
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,520
all you need to do is

576
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,480
to reliably catch your loved one.

577
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,840
Okay, let's welcome
our first pair of contestants.

578
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,200
- Let's go.
- Come on stage please.

579
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,120
Congratulations to our first pair

580
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,120
on successfully completing the challenge.

581
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:18,200
Next, let's welcome
our second pair of contestants.

582
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:21,520
- We give up.
- Okay, take a rest then.

583
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:24,280
- Let's go.
- Who are our brave second pair?

584
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,360
Please take your places.

585
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,820
Tian Tian, trust me.

586
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:28,860
The highest one.

587
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:30,528
Let's go.

588
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,280
The highest one?

589
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,080
Come on.

590
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,120
This, this is a little high.

591
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,920
Be careful, be careful.

592
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,760
Can you catch me?

593
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:51,280
It's okay if I die.

594
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,320
Put me down.

595
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,880
Trust me, let's go.

596
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,808
Come on.

597
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,360
Chen Yifan, I will do this

598
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,719
once in my lifetime.

599
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:23,040
If you dare not to catch me…

600
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,472
I definitely can.

601
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:29,080
Come on, come on.

602
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,980
My hand, my hand.

603
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:38,640
You are lying on my hand.

604
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:40,320
Why are you so heavy?

605
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:42,920
Heavy, my foot.

606
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:44,896
I was wrong, I was wrong.

607
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:51,400
Next, please have our staff

608
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,360
bring the props onto the stage.

609
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:56,040
Congratulations to our two pairs of contestants

610
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,600
on advancing to the final round.

611
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:00,120
This round is called Guess the Candy challenge.

612
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,740
The rules are very simple, too.

613
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:04,000
The gentleman passes the flavor of the lollipop

614
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,280
to the blindfolded lady

615
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,480
through a kiss.

616
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,640
If the lady is right about more flavors,

617
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:12,040
the winner will be determined.

618
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,840
It's all for work.

619
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,160
It's all for the mission.

620
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,328
I give up.

621
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,920
Why?

622
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,000
Give up?

623
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,600
What's the situation here?

624
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,840
Because they are not real couples at all.

625
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,880
I'm sorry to interrupt everyone's game.

626
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:49,960
What I want to say is

627
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,600
the people left on the stage

628
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,040
are not real couples at all.

629
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,740
Doudou,

630
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:56,840
what's wrong with you?

631
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:02,480
Doudou, why are you vomiting so violently?

632
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,320
Lie it down on the ground,
don't touch it for now.

633
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,480
Is it okay?

634
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,664
Doudou.

635
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:11,808
Casual Beauty.

636
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,640
What should I do?

637
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:19,320
Did you use water-based paint for its dyeing?

638
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,216
Yes.

639
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,680
Does anyone here have water?

640
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:25,800
Do you have any wet wipes

641
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,240
or saliva towels?

642
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:29,080
Is there any water? Thank you, thank you.

643
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,480
- What should we do?
- Thank you for this.

644
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,256
Quick.

645
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,960
Come over.

646
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,560
It's okay.

647
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,560
All the color has faded.

648
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,104
It's okay.

649
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,912
It's almost done.

650
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:45,320
Is Doudou's condition related

651
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,520
to the dyeing we did for it today?

652
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:48,040
It must have licked its own fur,

653
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,280
which means it swallowed the dye.

654
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,560
It caused irritation in its stomach,

655
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,640
which led to stress-induced vomiting.

656
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:55,960
We just treated it

657
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,000
for the dye on its floating fur.

658
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,960
But we haven't been able
to completely clean it up.

659
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,200
When you go home, feed it some probiotics

660
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,160
to help it excrete the remaining dye
in its stomach.

661
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:05,280
We suggest you take it to a pet hospital

662
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,000
for treatment after the event.

663
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,520
Okay, thank you.

664
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,040
Good.

665
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,300
Good

666
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:13,000
- Glad it's not too late.
- Thank you.

667
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,320
First of all,

668
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,840
I would like to apologize

669
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,120
to the organizers once again.

670
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:27,000
We are doctors from Tianlin Animal Hospital.

671
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,360
We pretended to be couples

672
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:32,560
just to participate in this event.

673
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,260
We wanted to take this valuable opportunity

674
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:37,080
to educate all of you
who participated in the event

675
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:40,640
about the harm of animal hair dyeing

676
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,280
and knowledge about pet grooming.

677
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:48,080
We hope we can help everyone
raise pets scientifically

678
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,240
rather than being blinded

679
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,680
by irrational marketing methods,

680
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,240
causing danger and harm

681
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:54,560
to your beloved pets.

682
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,120
In fact, the puppy just now

683
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,640
is the best proof.

684
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:01,360
Well said!

685
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,000
Good!

686
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,480
Good talk.

687
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:07,160
I'm moved, I've learned, I've learned.

688
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,240
Why are you here?

689
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:47,520
Didn't you have something to do
and couldn't come?

690
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,600
I've come to apologize to you.

691
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,528
What for?

692
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,480
For all the misunderstandings
I've had about you,

693
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:06,120
all the biases,

694
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:08,840
my arrogance,

695
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:13,120
and all the harm I've caused you.

696
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,720
I'd like to say I'm sorry.

697
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,760
Okay, I got it.

698
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:22,800
You can go now.

699
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,344
Tian Tian,

700
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,376
I like you.

701
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,860
I'm sorry I should have said it earlier

702
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:34,960
to you.

703
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:46,880
Why

704
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,680
are you saying it now?

705
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,320
Because I was really scared.

706
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,720
I was afraid to realize that I cared.

707
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,000
I was also afraid to fall

708
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:01,280
into a relationship
that I may not be able to control at all.

709
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,000
This is too strange for me.

710
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,280
I'm not as strong as you.

711
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:11,000
I don't even know if

712
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,080
the real me deserves you or not.

713
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:17,440
I'm scared to know the answer.

714
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:25,160
Then why can you say it now?

715
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,540
Because I found out that compared to the above,

716
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:31,280
I'm more afraid of losing you.

717
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,400
Can I ask you a question?

718
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:40,941
♫ Just like me and you ♫

719
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,760
If I am nothing like you imagined,

720
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,960
would you still accept my affection?

721
00:40:47,334 --> 00:40:51,254
♫ You're on the left, popcorn on the right ♫

722
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,656
I…

723
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,920
I want to be with you forever.

724
00:40:58,854 --> 00:41:01,536
♫ They watch over each other ♫

725
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:08,016
♫ I think you would do the same ♫

726
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,496
Is that okay?

727
00:41:12,038 --> 00:41:16,051
♫ Now you are still with me ♫

728
00:41:17,766 --> 00:41:21,598
♫ Traveling through time together ♫

729
00:41:23,264 --> 00:41:26,016
♫ I have seen so many separations ♫

730
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:31,681
♫ Which makes me more aware
of the value of companionship ♫

731
00:41:31,681 --> 00:41:34,357
♫ It's worth cherishing ♫

732
00:41:34,357 --> 00:41:38,192
♫ We exchange each other's time ♫

733
00:41:39,872 --> 00:41:43,936
♫ Maybe it's not that long ♫

734
00:41:45,894 --> 00:41:48,558
♫ No matter how things change ♫

735
00:41:48,558 --> 00:41:54,346
♫ It can't take away
your innocence and kindness ♫

736
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:57,800
The Qixi Festival is coming soon.

737
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,720
Let's count down together.

738
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,520
Ten,

739
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:03,136
nine,

740
00:42:03,136 --> 00:42:04,160
eight,

741
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:05,440
seven,

742
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,740
six,

743
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:08,120
five,

744
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:09,560
four,

745
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,040
- three,
- Happy holiday!

746
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,280
two,

747
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:13,960
one.

748
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:19,936
♫ Someday, I'll be completely
forgotten by the world ♫

749
00:42:19,936 --> 00:42:22,767
♫ Leaving no trace ♫

750
00:42:22,767 --> 00:42:27,092
♫ Only you will still remember ♫

751
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:30,160
It's so beautiful.

752
00:43:14,726 --> 00:43:18,246
♫ Your gaze is unwavering ♫

753
00:43:20,262 --> 00:43:24,806
♫ Only enough to accommodate me ♫

754
00:43:26,022 --> 00:43:30,694
♫ I have been melted by you countless times ♫

755
00:43:31,654 --> 00:43:35,206
♫ Yet I'm at a loss for what to do ♫

756
00:43:37,158 --> 00:43:40,102
♫ I can only hold on to you ♫

757
00:43:42,182 --> 00:43:46,086
♫ Now you are still with me ♫

758
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:52,006
♫ Traveling through time together ♫

759
00:43:53,862 --> 00:44:01,798
♫ Someday, I'll be completely
forgotten by the world ♫

760
00:44:01,798 --> 00:44:04,998
♫ Leaving no trace ♫

761
00:44:04,998 --> 00:44:09,030
♫ Only you will still remember ♫

762
00:44:10,790 --> 00:44:13,094
♫ My appearance ♫
