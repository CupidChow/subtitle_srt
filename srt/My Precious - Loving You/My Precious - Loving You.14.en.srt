1
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,160
Are you hungry?

2
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,320
you chinese

3
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,400
I am

4
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,480
Then I'll give you half of it.

5
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,200
Thank you

6
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,760
It's okay. Eat quickly.

7
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,160
That was the first time I saw Gao Zhuo

8
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,560
He is also a Chinese

9
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:07,960
when I was five years old

10
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:08,960
Gao Zhuo's mother

11
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,240
He died in a car accident

12
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:12,560
He has been wandering here since he was a child

13
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,640
I couldn’t go home after that.

14
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,280
It was Gao Zhuo who took me in

15
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,480
Have you ever gone to the police?

16
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,280
Have looked for

17
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,480
But there has been no result

18
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,000
Even if there are well-meaning people

19
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:31,560
They can't be contacted either

20
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,400
family in my country

21
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,280
I have only one name

22
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,560
I don't have any evidence

23
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,320
be able to prove my identity

24
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,480
Then did you mention Midorikawa to them?

25
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,840
They should know

26
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,760
Midorikawa at that time

27
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,920
With Midorikawa now

28
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:50,960
Totally incomparable

29
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,160
Midorikawa at that time

30
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,160
Just one struggling

31
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,840
Small company

32
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,360
And I was so young at that time

33
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,080
Don't know at all

34
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,440
What is the name of grandpa's company?

35
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,320
sorry

36
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,720
The phone you dialed is switched off

37
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,240
Please call again later

38
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:38,960
Excuse me

39
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,640
Thank you

40
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,280
Look at that lady, she's beautiful

41
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,200
yes

42
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,400
Walk

43
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,520
let's have a drink

44
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,640
No thank you

45
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,760
It's too noisy here

46
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,320
It's better to go to a quiet place over there

47
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,560
i don't know you

48
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,360
I don’t want to drink with you either

49
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,560
please stay away from me

50
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,080
Thank you

51
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:12,840
good

52
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,120
hello madam

53
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,560
Didn't hear what this lady said

54
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,520
Doesn't she want to drink with you?

55
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,680
OK let's go

56
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,080
although

57
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,080
When I was with Gao Zhuo

58
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,160
Life was extremely hard

59
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,640
But we are very free

60
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,120
also very happy

61
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,000
in order to survive

62
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:53,720
Traveled almost everywhere

63
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,480
every city around here

64
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,480
Looking back now

65
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,320
That time, that memory

66
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,760
It's me who has lived until now

67
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,240
in life

68
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,840
The happiest time

69
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,600
don't let me catch you

70
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,360
This little guy is still alive

71
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,960
It must be hungry too

72
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:37,400
give

73
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,560
Let's go find something to eat

74
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,080
good

75
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,880
It turns out Carlo

76
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,360
It was you who saved me there

77
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:48,920
Then later

78
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,640
What happened to Gao Zhuo?

79
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:00,880
When I was young

80
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,160
I have always had a wish

81
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,760
I just want to go to sea

82
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,680
I'll give you a gift too

83
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,280
OK

84
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:14,760
look

85
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,880
Where did you get so much money?

86
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,120
This is my half year

87
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,560
Secretly saved

88
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,760
Don’t you want to go to sea?

89
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:22,760
right

90
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,160
This money is enough

91
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,240
You can go to sea now. That’s enough.

92
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,720
Great, right

93
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,280
Going to sea

94
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,280
Great. Let's go to sea.

95
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,440
We will always be good brothers

96
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,840
never separate

97
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,640
we are good brothers

98
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:40,320
never separate

99
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:44,520
we will never separate

100
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,400
That's when Gao Zhuo saved me

101
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,280
had an accident

102
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,800
Wait until you send him to the hospital

103
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,120
everything is too late

104
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,240
doctor doctor

105
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:12,920
How is it

106
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,000
we have tried our best

107
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,200
But we can't help you anymore

108
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,200
sorry

109
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,440
Get up

110
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,360
Wake up

111
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,800
Don't scare me

112
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,400
Wake up

113
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,760
Shen Mi, are you okay?

114
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:49,920
later

115
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,160
I carry Gao Zhuo's ashes

116
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,760
come back to this place

117
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,000
Buried him under this tree

118
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,120
Because here we are

119
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,000
favorite place ever

120
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,680
I also brought it to you

121
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,720
The place where we are most happy

122
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,000
I left him

123
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,600
This was during his lifetime

124
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,520
This was during his lifetime

125
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,920
favorite place

126
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:25,840
you say

127
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,560
Will he blame me?

128
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:36,120
Anyway

129
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,039
You are finally back home

130
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:39,559
I can be reunited with my family

131
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:40,360
Isn't it?

132
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,799
If I don't raise the sea

133
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,920
He won't die

134
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,840
You can't think like that

135
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,640
you do not know

136
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,520
you just mentioned

137
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,360
Memories with Gao Zhuo

138
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,960
the smile on your face

139
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,120
It's been so long

140
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,440
I've never seen it

141
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:59,920
You also said

142
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,160
This is what you have lived till now

143
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,800
happiest time

144
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,960
Just looking at your expression

145
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:07,840
I knew it

146
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,560
How deep is your brotherhood?

147
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,680
He just wanted to help his good friend

148
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,720
Fulfill your wish

149
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,160
I want him to go to sea

150
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,880
In his heart at that moment

151
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,040
Must be very proud

152
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,080
very happy

153
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,920
So how could he blame you?

154
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,360
If it were you

155
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,320
You must also hope

156
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,280
He can replace you

157
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,480
live happily

158
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,320
Hope he is happy

159
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,400
thank you

160
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,360
Right

161
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,200
Brother Gao Zhuo

162
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,320
Although I don't know you

163
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,160
But thank you really

164
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,600
Thank you for saving Shen Mi

165
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,200
thank you sincerely

166
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,120
I thought I would bring Tian Tian here

167
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,320
Just tell her

168
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,560
Over the past ten years

169
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,800
My most unspeakable secret

170
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,560
But the words come to my lips

171
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,400
But

172
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,680
I can't say it at all

173
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:43,800
Mengnan

174
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,800
what are you doing

175
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,400
I'll take you back to your room

176
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,920
I won't go back

177
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,720
I'll be alone when I go back

178
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,720
I'm alone here too

179
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,800
This can still drink

180
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:54,840
you have drunk too much

181
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,640
Stop drinking

182
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,560
Leave me alone

183
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,920
Or you can drink with me

184
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,480
Why do you always care about me

185
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,120
Walk

186
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:09,920
What are you doing?

187
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,200
give

188
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,000
Thank you

189
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:31,760
do you know

190
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,520
Shen Mi and I have known each other since we were three years old.

191
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,560
Just when the three of us met

192
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,160
In that little noodle shop

193
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,920
from a very young age

194
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,160
adults

195
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,600
whether it's true

196
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,360
Still fake

197
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,360
It's a joke

198
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,560
Or do you really think so?

199
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,240
they always talk about me

200
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,040
He and Shen Mi are a couple

201
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,840
Will get married in the future

202
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,640
everyone

203
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,640
everyone says that

204
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,000
They still say that to this day

205
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,160
I admit

206
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,280
Marry Shen Mi

207
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,080
Entering the palace of marriage

208
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,240
with the blessings of all

209
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,440
say i do

210
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,680
This scene is in my mind

211
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,640
has appeared countless times

212
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,680
Marry Shen Mi

213
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,040
in my life

214
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,440
the most important thing

215
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,280
I don’t know when it started

216
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,920
It seems that after he comes back

217
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,320
Everything has changed

218
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,840
come back

219
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,160
where has he gone

220
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,320
Why

221
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,880
why everything changed

222
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,200
The saddest thing is

223
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,120
no one told me why

224
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:42,600
Remember when I was a child

225
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,560
while studying

226
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,440
Encountered a question that I can’t solve

227
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,400
I will be particularly annoyed

228
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,600
Do you know how I solved it?

229
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,720
Someone like you, doctor

230
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,800
Are there still questions that I can’t answer?

231
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,040
PhD

232
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,960
Just an ordinary person

233
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,480
I'm just comparing

234
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,320
Most people are more diligent

235
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,280
good

236
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:12,720
you say

237
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:23,880
close eyes

238
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:29,920
Believe me

239
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,120
close eyes

240
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,440
Give me your right hand

241
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,600
you start thinking now

242
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,360
you at this moment

243
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,680
The most annoying thing

244
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,640
The more specific the better

245
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,880
Now imagine

246
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,520
put these worries

247
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,800
Hold it firmly in your hand

248
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:05,840
The tighter the better

249
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,400
Now is the most critical step

250
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,920
Throw it hard into the sky

251
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,160
quick

252
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,520
Can you open it?

253
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:44,960
Open it

254
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,600
Do you see that star?

255
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,640
All your worries at this moment

256
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,560
They were all thrown on that star

257
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,000
it's away from you now

258
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,560
Tens of millions of light years away

259
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,280
this life

260
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,160
It won't come to you again

261
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,360
How is it

262
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,320
Do you feel better?

263
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,040
childish

264
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,800
Allow me to be childish for a moment today

265
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,560
Give it to you

266
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:46,600
rest assured

267
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,400
not a ring

268
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,280
I'm going to faint from hunger

269
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,760
Where have people gone?

270
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,880
No calls, no messages returned

271
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,160
Carlo

272
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,720
Carlo Wait a moment

273
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,160
never mind

274
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,040
Carlo

275
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,920
I'm so hungry

276
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,480
You didn't leave any for me either

277
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,840
Come here and give me a hug

278
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,680
Are you hungry?

279
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,440
I'm really hungry

280
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,640
Where do you think these two people went?

281
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,880
Just go on a date behind my back.

282
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,040
Not answering the phone

283
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,480
No reply to messages

284
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,040
what do they want to do

285
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,440
Food is back

286
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:21,680
food food

287
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,560
Come on Carlo

288
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,600
You two are finally back

289
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,360
Is there anything to eat?

290
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,480
what do you mean

291
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,640
No answering calls, no reply to messages

292
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,800
What do you two want to do?

293
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,040
I'm going to starve to death

294
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,600
Now there is no money at all

295
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,560
You're so noisy

296
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,880
Why am I noisy? I'm hungry.

297
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:40,920
I haven't eaten it all day

298
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,000
Didn't eat dinner either

299
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,040
I don’t know how to click.

300
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,200
How can I have money?

301
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,680
Will it be possible to hang up the house account?

302
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,680
Why is my credit card blocked?

303
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,840
It’s not like you don’t know

304
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:55,920
The boss comes out

305
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:56,600
Why are there so many people?

306
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,120
At the entrance of our hospital

307
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:02,520
collusion kennel

308
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:05,800
Selling sick dogs

309
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,720
God cannot tolerate it

310
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,880
I'll call and ask

311
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,200
Tian Peilan

312
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,680
What's going on at the hospital?

313
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:16,920
Something happened in the hospital

314
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,120
It's about to be torn down

315
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,720
Come back quickly, come back quickly

316
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,360
what

317
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,560
Contact me when you wake up

318
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,120
Have breakfast together

319
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,880
I'm going back to my country first

320
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:29,960
Did you sleep well?

321
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:32,880
not bad

322
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,080
right

323
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,560
I don't know what you like to eat

324
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,760
So I got some for you

325
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,720
Very good thank you

326
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:41,560
Eat quickly

327
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,240
Does it look good?

328
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:58,680
nice

329
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:01,880
I mean the earrings

330
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,720
I mean the earrings too

331
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,600
Dr. Gu

332
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,480
Thank you for taking care of me yesterday

333
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,680
It doesn’t matter

334
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,520
It's all small things

335
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,720
Dr. Gu

336
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,600
Do you have any plans today?

337
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:35,880
can you accompany me

338
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:36,680
go to a place

339
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,080
OK

340
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,280
Where are we going?

341
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:12,880
What about this matter?

342
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,240
You need to be more attentive

343
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,960
okay, I get it

344
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,120
Must be firmly remembered

345
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,760
Responsibilities on one's own shoulders

346
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,000
good

347
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,880
I understand what you mean. Remember it.

348
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,120
You will know soon

349
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:43,840
look

350
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,960
1998 to 2014

351
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,480
Two thousand and fourteen

352
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,480
Two thousand and fourteen

353
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,040
Does this have any special significance?

354
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,800
It's the day when Shen Mi returns to China

355
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,320
The scenery here is really nice

356
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:40,600
If only I could be here

357
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,560
Life would be fine

358
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:46,800
Dr. Gu

359
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,480
It seems you like it here very much

360
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,320
want to live here

361
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,440
If I could live here

362
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,720
Also a good choice

363
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,200
Dr. Gu

364
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,000
can you do me a favor

365
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:18,920
Say it

366
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,160
Today's things

367
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,680
I don't want anyone to know

368
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,640
Especially Shen Mi

369
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:28,800
Do not worry

370
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,160
I am the director of Tianlin Hospital

371
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,280
What's the matter with you

372
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,440
tell me directly

373
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,000
Come, you drink tea first

374
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,920
Get rid of the anger, get rid of the anger

375
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,320
your pet

376
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,440
Killed by the hospital

377
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,680
Can you have a cup of tea?

378
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,560
Just to calm down?

379
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:19,960
No No

380
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:20,920
That's it

381
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,560
Because I just came back from overseas

382
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,240
So these days

383
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,480
What exactly happened

384
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,960
I don't know at all

385
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,200
How about you start from beginning to end

386
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,840
Tell me in detail

387
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,120
If it is our hospital's responsibility

388
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,640
We will never shirk

389
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,120
This is your hospital

390
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,200
The one named Chen

391
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,800
He killed my Beibei

392
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,000
This animal hospital is called Tianlin

393
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,480
Extremely bad

394
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,360
Evil Doctor Chen Yifan

395
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,240
Secretly colluding with the kennel owner

396
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,880
Together with the Black Heart Kennel

397
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,920
Sell ​​dogs together to customers

398
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,240
my babe

399
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,840
Didn't even last two days

400
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,360
Just die from these black-hearted doctors

401
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,800
And in the hands of the black-hearted boss

402
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:02,280
they are

403
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,400
A profiteer without any bottom line of conscience

404
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,080
That chrysanthemum sister

405
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,160
I remembered

406
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,680
Don't worry

407
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,080
my biological sister

408
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,400
Our little guy from the kennel

409
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,520
Everyone is healthy

410
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,320
Let’s talk about Dr. Chen, my buddy

411
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:17,800
He didn't even give it to Beibei

412
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:18,720
Have you checked?

413
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,920
The report is here, isn't it?

414
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:20,760
Don't worry, don't worry

415
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:22,480
Beibei

416
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,640
I'm really a match for you.

417
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,480
So right

418
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,240
That Chrysanthemum sister last time

419
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,360
Brought a man with me

420
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,240
There is also a dog

421
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:31,240
That dog's disease

422
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,360
It was Lao Chen who showed me

423
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:33,120
Right, Lao Chen?

424
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,040
Didn't you say that day

425
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:38,640
Did you take time off when your dad was sick?

426
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,480
That's what I said

427
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,880
Then he got better later

428
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,320
If your father is really

429
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,760
If you are seriously ill

430
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:46,400
I suggest you still

431
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,360
Go to the hospital

432
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,200
Where are we?

433
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,040
No need for you to worry

434
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,000
You're of no use here anyway

435
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,360
This is wrong

436
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,880
He just misdiagnosed

437
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,400
No, he, that day, you

438
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,560
aunt

439
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,800
This is what it is now

440
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,080
Don't worry about this

441
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,040
It’s all on fire

442
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:06,040
Let's talk about something serious

443
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,320
You are talking about such unfortunate things

444
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,840
How did it happen to me?

445
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,000
What's going on

446
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,200
She just slandered me

447
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,520
Slander my innocence

448
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:19,520
Come in

449
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:21,800
Doctor Chen

450
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,720
Lao Fei, why are you here?

451
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,400
Long time no see

452
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,280
Long time no see Long time no see

453
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,480
Really getting younger and younger

454
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,160
How do you maintain it?

455
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:29,800
What then?

456
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,760
I came here to sell a little border collie.

457
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,400
The customer said that he must check

458
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,840
No problem, pay again

459
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:35,320
No problem

460
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,040
Just do a physical examination

461
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,600
Yes, call me over

462
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,320
Sister Ju

463
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,400
Come, come, come

464
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,760
Please come in. Please come in. Please come inside.

465
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:42,920
sit

466
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:43,560
Sister Chrysanthemum sits

467
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,000
hello sit

468
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:45,800
sit

469
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,000
Let me introduce Dr. Chen

470
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,200
This is Sister Ju

471
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,040
self-media people

472
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:51,480
That public account has become very popular.

473
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,400
Let's do a physical examination. Come on.

474
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:54,520
Come

475
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,280
good

476
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,880
Little cute

477
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,400
What's your name?

478
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,520
Our name is Beibei

479
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,120
Beibei

480
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,440
So good

481
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,040
OK

482
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,200
Let’s register first

483
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,120
Owner's name

484
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,400
Zhao Ju

485
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,200
What chrysanthemum

486
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,280
A chrysanthemum as pale as a chrysanthemum

487
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,120
The little cutie is called Beibei

488
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,320
What about this pet checkup?

489
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,160
Just check

490
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,440
Does it have any infectious diseases?

491
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:26,200
Dog plague, tiny or something like that

492
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,960
Do another blood routine

493
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,160
no problem

494
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,120
Do whatever you can

495
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,080
good

496
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,760
What about the test results?

497
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,880
The man named Chen said

498
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,440
There is nothing wrong with the inspection results.

499
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,000
This nest

500
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,520
Beibei is the best

501
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,040
It seems to be quite destined to me.

502
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,080
Particularly fateful

503
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:49,120
You are elegant, he is well-behaved and a perfect match

504
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,200
The report is out

505
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,040
Very good

506
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,680
Canine distemper and microscopic disease are all negative

507
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,040
Blood oxygen routine is also normal

508
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,040
That means there's no problem

509
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:58,520
no problem

510
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,080
It seems there is no problem now

511
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,120
Just no problem

512
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,720
Don't worry

513
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:03,720
My biological sister

514
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,480
give me give me

515
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,040
Our little guy from the kennel

516
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,400
That's all regular breeding

517
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:07,840
None of those

518
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:08,800
A mess of problems

519
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:09,800
Right

520
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,080
I just helped you choose a dog house

521
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:11,840
Very beautiful

522
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:12,480
I almost want to live

523
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,760
Let's go take a look, let's go, let's go

524
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:17,160
Lao Chen, I told you a long time ago

525
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,520
Smallness has an incubation period

526
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,280
What do you mean?

527
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:23,720
No, what are you doing?

528
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:24,960
Am I not clear about this?

529
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,360
I need you to teach me

530
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,480
No, that's all I said

531
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,120
You're so serious, I'm shocked

532
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:35,880
Then what on earth are you doing?

533
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,000
I told the customer

534
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:37,800
what can i say

535
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,440
Of course I told the truth

536
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,840
Beibei is the most well-behaved in this litter.

537
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:42,160
yes

538
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,520
It seems to be more destined to me

539
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:44,280
Particularly fateful

540
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:45,920
You are elegant, he is well-behaved and a perfect match

541
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,360
The report is out

542
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:47,840
Coming

543
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:48,440
Do not worry

544
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:49,960
Canine distemper, parvovirus, etc.

545
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:50,880
All negative

546
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,280
Blood test is also normal

547
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,080
That means there's no problem

548
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,040
no problem

549
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,360
Can't say

550
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,600
No problem at all

551
00:31:59,000 --> 00:31:59,760
Didn't you just say

552
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:00,800
everything is normal

553
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,440
These infectious diseases

554
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,640
They all have an incubation period

555
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:05,280
The short one is three to seven days

556
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,880
It's long, more than twenty days

557
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,400
So is there something wrong with it?

558
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,520
Still no problem

559
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:10,800
There seems to be no problem so far

560
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:11,800
No problem. Look.

561
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:12,400
That

562
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,840
Isn't that no problem?

563
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,480
Because of this incubation period?

564
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,400
I can't guarantee

565
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,120
no

566
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:20,800
Are you

567
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:21,960
Professional doctor

568
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,480
How did I find you talking?

569
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,040
Confused

570
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,120
Avoiding the important and taking the easy

571
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:26,760
Since I brought it

572
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:27,440
Just want to get one

573
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,840
your exact answer

574
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,600
I'm a doctor

575
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,120
I can only theoretically

576
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,560
Let me tell you clearly about this

577
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:34,680
clear clear

578
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:35,280
clearly

579
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:35,600
clear

580
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,000
my biological sister

581
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,320
There's nothing wrong with this test sheet

582
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,800
It's just okay

583
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:40,480
Right

584
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,280
You know

585
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,120
Tell me something, don't mind it

586
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:43,840
These doctors

587
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,480
Don't speak too full of words

588
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,640
I had a tooth extraction two days ago

589
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,360
What else do you want me to sign?

590
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,160
What about the disclaimer?

591
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,160
Don't worry

592
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,160
Beibei

593
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,560
Our little baby

594
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,360
It reproduces normally

595
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:55,840
There won't be anything

596
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:56,480
A mess of problems

597
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,480
Don't worry

598
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:57,880
now

599
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,480
Now let me help you choose a dog house

600
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,560
I just saw a really nice one

601
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,480
I want to live, go, go, go

602
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,520
This result is not clear yet

603
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:03,280
The result is here

604
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,840
Why did you say you were in the doghouse?

605
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,280
You can see clearly

606
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,240
Don't be impatient

607
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,240
speak slowly

608
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,600
What happened next?

609
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,640
later

610
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,360
later

611
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:33,520
Beibei

612
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:36,640
Beibei

613
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,520
Why don't you eat?

614
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:46,920
Beibei

615
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,840
Beibei, what's wrong with you?

616
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,760
Are you feeling uncomfortable?

617
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,360
What's wrong with you

618
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:00,720
What's wrong with you

619
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,080
Why do you have blood in your stool?

620
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,520
What's wrong with you

621
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:07,120
Don't scare mom

622
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:10,199
okay

623
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,159
sister

624
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:14,320
The most important thing now is

625
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,080
Let Beibei get treatment

626
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,560
The day before yesterday you said it was fine

627
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,760
No infectious diseases

628
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,520
Why are you saying it now?

629
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:21,719
It's tiny now

630
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,480
Are you with that one?

631
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,320
Boss Fei of the pet shop

632
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,320
We're in a group

633
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,440
Don't talk nonsense

634
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,480
I reminded you

635
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,040
Canine distemper and parvovirus

636
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,120
There is an incubation period

637
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,760
I think you have a problem at all

638
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,120
you look like a liar

639
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:35,159
I tell you

640
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,840
If there is a problem with my Beibei

641
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:38,239
I'll give you this pet hospital

642
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:38,800
Can't drive

643
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:39,440
Do you believe it?

644
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,280
You make trouble again

645
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,239
You're just delaying me by making trouble

646
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:42,280
Save your dog

647
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:44,920
Gentle and quiet

648
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,320
Send to intensive care and get blood transfusion immediately

649
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:46,920
I read

650
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,159
Sister, give it to me

651
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:50,040
Where do you want to take it?

652
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:51,960
It's okay It's okay

653
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:53,520
Me, don’t worry, don’t worry

654
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,280
this happens

655
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,520
We are also very worried

656
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,679
But the doctor will

657
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:57,600
Try to save it

658
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,880
Don't worry, don't worry

659
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,120
Prepare a room for me

660
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:02,400
I want to be escorted

661
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,040
Brother Chen

662
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,400
I sell a dog

663
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,000
How much money can I make?

664
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,640
Give your dog a full range of treatments

665
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:44,840
How much will it cost?

666
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,160
You know better than me, right?

667
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,640
Let’s not talk about this yet

668
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,080
This is my little idea

669
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:49,840
Please accept it first

670
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,120
Why is this

671
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,360
That's what I thought

672
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,680
Come to our kennel

673
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:55,760
All newbies

674
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:57,640
I want to get rid of those dogs quickly

675
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:58,440
Get rid of it

676
00:35:58,760 --> 00:35:59,920
If another client pulls me

677
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:00,960
Come for a checkup

678
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,160
As for you, just hold your hand high

679
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:02,960
Same as the previous two days

680
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:03,880
Fool him

681
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,040
do not worry

682
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:07,400
Your hard work will never be in vain

683
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:14,440
OK

684
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:15,960
You two profiteers

685
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:16,560
Sister Ju

686
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,160
Let me catch you

687
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,760
I've already told you that there's something fishy between you two.

688
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:19,960
No

689
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:20,600
You still don't admit it

690
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,840
Don't, don't say that

691
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:22,920
No he

692
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:24,200
Please explain

693
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,720
No, that's not what happened

694
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,960
This Chen Yifan is too much

695
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,280
Not only is he excessive

696
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,560
He's just crazy

697
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,520
Wait for me here

698
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,400
I'll be right back

699
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,560
this is the case

700
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,160
solved

701
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,640
What to solve

702
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:48,440
Chen Yifan

703
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,160
You and Boss Fei from that kennel?

704
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:50,800
Collusion

705
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:51,520
deceive customers

706
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:52,560
Is there such a thing?

707
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,720
I colluded with Lao Fei

708
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:57,360
How is that possible, Dean Tian?

709
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:58,120
not possible for me

710
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,040
For this physical examination fee

711
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,440
Riding on the reputation of our Tianlin

712
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,600
Dean Tian

713
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:02,600
Sister Ju told me

714
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,480
You should collude with Boss Fei privately.

715
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,400
to kennel them

716
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,320
all sick dogs

717
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,840
Take me to our hospital for examination

718
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:08,320
Then you give it to him

719
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,520
Open a fake order

720
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,520
A gift someone gave you

721
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,520
You accepted it all

722
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,680
Is there such a thing?

723
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,480
Dean Tian

724
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,240
Do you believe me or her?

725
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:25,360
Lao Chen

726
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,000
let me go

727
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,160
I risked my life today

728
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:27,840
Must make it clear to her

729
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:28,760
Don't, don't, don't

730
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:29,920
No need No need

731
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,680
Don't be so impulsive

732
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,720
Can't you even make a joke?

733
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:43,160
Put on a show in front of her

734
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:44,880
What about you?

735
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,200
Although I usually pick a little

736
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,680
A bit greedy for petty gains

737
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:48,680
But the big question is right and wrong

738
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,120
We still recognize you very much

739
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:51,560
After all, you have been in Tianlin for so many years

740
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,120
But why Sister Ju?

741
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,720
How could I misunderstand you so much?

742
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:55,600
That evening

743
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,560
what happened

744
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,200
Lao Fei why?

745
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,280
Come to the hospital late at night

746
00:37:58,520 --> 00:37:59,440
Dean Tian

747
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:00,920
I'll invite Lao Fei over

748
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:01,640
Just want to do this

749
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,080
Please make it clear

750
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:07,600
Doctor Chen

751
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:08,960
Come to me for something

752
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,840
You were talking to a dog owner a few days ago

753
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,400
I brought a little border collie for a physical examination.

754
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,640
Is there such a thing?

755
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:17,920
A few days after Bian Mu was discharged from the hospital

756
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:18,840
Just get fine

757
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,000
Can it be saved now?

758
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,080
Still a problem

759
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,200
Did you already know

760
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,280
There's something wrong with this dog

761
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:25,440
I

762
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,440
Where was I before that?

763
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,680
There is a litter of little border collies

764
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:28,840
Don't know what's going on

765
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,240
One of them had parvovirus

766
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,120
may be

767
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:32,560
Maybe it's infected

768
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,480
Take this nest

769
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,200
I tell you

770
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,120
you clearly know

771
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:37,160
This dog may be infected

772
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,640
You're still selling takeout without telling me

773
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,200
He was even taken to my hospital

774
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,040
Come for a physical examination

775
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,640
Now my dog ​​has a problem

776
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:43,520
Just come to our hospital

777
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,240
do you know

778
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:45,840
Dr. Chen No

779
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:46,760
Brother Chen

780
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,440
The dog is out of the kennel

781
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,240
Nothing to do with me

782
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:49,960
No more

783
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,000
Same reason

784
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,280
When you check it

785
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,320
Are the indicators

786
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,040
All normal

787
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,520
Say it again

788
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,640
Did you follow it when it went out?

789
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:57,920
Contact with other plague dogs

790
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,360
How do you know?

791
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,560
What is right or wrong?

792
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,320
If a dog is sick, it must be treated as soon as possible

793
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,920
You tricked the dog owner

794
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,440
Brother Chen

795
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,480
I sell a dog

796
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,080
How much money do you earn then?

797
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:13,840
These dogs are treated

798
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:14,920
How much does it cost for a complete set?

799
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,800
Don’t you know better than me?

800
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:17,800
Let’s not talk about this yet

801
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,560
This is my little care

802
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,720
You accept it first

803
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:21,480
What is this for?

804
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:24,160
That's what I think

805
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:25,600
Come to our kennel

806
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,720
Basically all newbies

807
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,480
I just want to hurry up

808
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,600
Put those sick puppies

809
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,400
Get rid of it

810
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,840
If there are any more customers

811
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:31,800
Pull me over for a checkup

812
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:32,840
You're just like you were two days ago

813
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:33,560
show your dignity

814
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:34,560
Fool him

815
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:35,640
do not worry

816
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,880
Your hard work will never be in vain

817
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,440
Stop doing this

818
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:42,760
I tell you

819
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:43,240
What to say

820
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,680
You can talk to the dog owner yourself.

821
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,360
Brother Chen, you

822
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:48,160
Don't be in a hurry to reject me

823
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:48,880
OK

824
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,440
You two profiteers

825
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:51,720
Sister Ju

826
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:52,600
Let me catch you

827
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:53,040
No

828
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,080
Still don't admit it

829
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:55,320
What else do you have to say

830
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,800
Don't, don't say that

831
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,920
No he

832
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,200
Please explain

833
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,720
No, that's not what happened

834
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:02,880
That's wrong

835
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,600
How did you and Sister Ju describe this matter?

836
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:05,760
completely different

837
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,480
That must be one of them

838
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,400
You lied

839
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,600
Who is lying?

840
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:11,960
I didn't tell you

841
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:13,480
what i just said

842
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,800
As long as there is half a lie

843
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:15,880
I will leave Tianlin

844
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:16,560
this life

845
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,160
Don’t step into the pet world

846
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,280
If what I said is false

847
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:24,840
My whole life, Chen Yifan

848
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:25,880
Can't get a wife

849
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,160
Not that much

850
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:28,040
Not to the point

851
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:31,040
I'll prove that

852
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,000
That was the day Sister Ju

853
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,440
When I brought Beibei here

854
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,840
Then Chen Yifan told her

855
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,520
It's canine distemper

856
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:38,520
That means there is an incubation period

857
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
These infectious diseases

858
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:40,960
There is an incubation period

859
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,400
The short one is three to seven days

860
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:42,680
The short one is three to seven days

861
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:43,800
It's long, more than twenty days

862
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:49,560
That means someone lied

863
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:50,920
She must be lying

864
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:51,880
She just framed it

865
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,000
She wants to extort money

866
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:54,280
That's it

867
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,760
Everyone, please calm down.

868
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,040
Where are we now?

869
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:57,520
Not entangled

870
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,040
When who is right and who is wrong

871
00:40:59,480 --> 00:40:59,960
But we want

872
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,360
Let's think of a solution together

873
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:01,800
How to do it

874
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:02,880
The harm of this matter

875
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:03,840
drop to lowest

876
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,000
Do you understand?

877
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,320
Let go

878
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:07,880
Sister Ju

879
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,120
You can't take Carlo away

880
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:10,000
I said it

881
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,120
As long as you apologize to me

882
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,160
I'll give it back to you

883
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,560
Don't go too far

884
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:14,440
This is not your home

885
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,480
Who is going too far?

886
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:16,360
Release your hands

887
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,600
Let me go

888
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,320
You quickly let go of my dog

889
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:20,480
what's going on

890
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,680
Can't we discuss it carefully?

891
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:22,600
I tell you

892
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:23,920
Let you publicly apologize to me

893
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,400
I'll give it back to you

894
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,280
this is my dog

895
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,520
Why do you take it away?

896
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:28,480
What do you mean?

897
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:29,640
You not only framed me

898
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:30,960
Are you going to steal our dog?

899
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,400
Tian Yuxian Closed

900
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:39,160
You are all in the same group

901
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,400
Back then I took my Beibei with me

902
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:41,680
for appraisal

903
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,240
Didn't you say it was okay?

904
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:44,880
then it got sick

905
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,360
I also brought it here for treatment.

906
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,520
You killed it

907
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,520
If I don’t look for you, who do I look for?

908
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:49,280
I told you

909
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,600
There is an incubation period

910
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:51,920
No, you're going too far

911
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:52,560
your dog died

912
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:53,760
Why don't you find a dog seller?

913
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:54,440
I already said

914
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:56,040
You guys are obviously in the same group

915
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:57,760
OK, close the door

916
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:58,440
what do you want to do

917
00:41:58,560 --> 00:41:59,560
Do you want to hit someone?
