1
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,840
What are you doing

2
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,000
What if you don't decide

3
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,000
This Tian Lin is really surnamed Hu

4
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,479
No

5
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:09,720
The two of us are

6
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,280
There is really no way to cooperate

7
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,080
The money hasn't come in yet

8
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,040
I've already used his style

9
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,640
Fallacies and heresies have come to educate me

10
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,120
He's teaching me how to do things

11
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,400
What if the money comes in

12
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,480
Have you ever thought about it

13
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,800
What does Tianlin have to become

14
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,240
Isn't that what business is all about

15
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,880
Tian Tian, you have to learn now

16
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,840
Is to seek common ground while reserving differences

17
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,600
Grasp the big and let go of the small

18
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:31,480
It's like getting married

19
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,400
Live the same life

20
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,720
Is it not normal to fight and fight

21
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:35,960
I think

22
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,040
Tianlin should be a warm one

23
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,520
A place with human touch

24
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:40,760
But what about him

25
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,640
He wants to turn this into a

26
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,600
It will only make money

27
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,520
Cold-blooded machine

28
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,040
Then the two of us fight from the roots

29
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,920
It's different. There's a difference

30
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,920
Like a couple

31
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,840
Three views disagree

32
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,920
Can't live together

33
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,080
Tian Tian's current situation is

34
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,000
You two must get married in place

35
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Otherwise, the hospital will be gone

36
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,080
Don't be impulsive either

37
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,400
You solve it first

38
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,400
The urgent need of Tianlin

39
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,920
Running in such a thing

40
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,000
Take your time

41
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,320
Man-made things

42
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,280
Maybe

43
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,760
It's grinding, grinding, grinding

44
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,120
He was caught by you after three views

45
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,080
It's broken over

46
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,400
What if you can't break it back

47
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,600
Then you two will leave again

48
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,200
See where you run

49
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:56,560
Hit you

50
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,120
What to do

51
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,000
Don't learn well at a young age

52
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Bully a puppy

53
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,400
I told your parents to go

54
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,640
Go home

55
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,200
Walk, walk

56
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,720
I see you are not very old either

57
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,480
Wandering like this again

58
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,040
It's not the case either

59
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,920
Grandpa, I have no home either

60
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,360
You're a stray dog, too

61
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,000
Then we

62
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,160
Just take a companion

63
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,000
Huzi

64
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,560
You know your name is Huzi

65
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,200
In the future

66
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,720
Just follow the uncle

67
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,760
Huzi, let's go

68
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,160
Let's go

69
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:54,880
Huzi

70
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,320
Comfortable, huh

71
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,520
In the future

72
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,440
I'll wash it for you every day

73
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,760
We Huzi

74
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:02,400
I also have a home

75
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,840
Someone hurts a dog

76
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,520
Out of the door

77
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,720
Clean and clean

78
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,480
Beautiful

79
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,320
No one dares to bully you, do they

80
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,560
Washed clean

81
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,920
Grandpa gave you a new nest

82
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:57,760
In the future

83
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,280
You're comfortably

84
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,160
Living here

85
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,760
Huzi is eating

86
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,400
When you grow up and become energetic,

87
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,880
Follow the uncle to collect junk

88
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,560
Let's buy steamed buns to eat

89
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,360
Buy you ham sausage

90
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,320
How about it

91
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,480
One two three

92
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,400
Come on, Huzi

93
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,880
One two three

94
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,760
Huzi goes

95
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,040
Has Uncle Zhou been here these two days

96
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,320
No

97
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,320
We agreed to let him take Huzi

98
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,200
To review

99
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,000
It's probably nothing

100
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,680
So you don't want to bother us

101
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,600
Huzi's wound infection is very serious

102
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,080
I have to go and see it

103
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,880
This and this

104
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,160
I'll tear it down completely later.

105
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,720
Go and have a look

106
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,080
And this way

107
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,200
Remember Wang Ge here, too

108
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,200
It was also changed into an operating room

109
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,840
What are you doing

110
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,160
I didn't call you last time

111
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,000
Did you say it

112
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,120
The design of this hospital is unreasonable

113
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,480
See for yourself

114
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:47,680
This space is wasted

115
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,560
It's too big

116
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,440
I asked the designer to come over

117
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,640
Design it in advance

118
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,280
That's too urgent, isn't it

119
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,520
It's not yet a day

120
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,640
Don't worry, okay

121
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,080
One less day is one less day's money

122
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,240
See for yourself

123
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,240
What's the date today

124
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,040
It's time to talk

125
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:03,960
Go over there and have a look

126
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,200
No

127
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,840
Beautiful, quick, quick

128
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,560
I slipped first. I slipped first

129
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,000
Just give me a second

130
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,920
Wait for me. Wait for me

131
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,320
Beautiful what beautiful ah

132
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,720
Play games every night

133
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,320
If you can put this energy

134
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,280
Put it in business

135
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:30,680
Nor will it

136
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,960
Has been complained by customers

137
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,440
There is not even a person now

138
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,520
Even if I put all my energy into it

139
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,280
Put it on the job

140
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:35,960
What's the use

141
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,360
You talk back. You

142
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,440
What is it

143
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,640
Send this to Shen Mi

144
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,919
I'll give you my address later

145
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,280
Don't go

146
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,880
Didn't I break up with you

147
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:46,800
He doesn't care about us anymore

148
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,800
What do we care about him

149
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,280
No trouble, no trouble

150
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,640
I don't think this dog food should be

151
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,200
You can send it yourself

152
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,240
Just in time, you can sit down and talk

153
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,080
Then maybe this

154
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,800
It's easy to talk about anything

155
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,280
I'm not going

156
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,760
And this delivers dog food

157
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,280
And signing a contract are two different things

158
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,720
Carlo is innocent again

159
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:15,760
How do you think of it

160
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,800
Called me

161
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,000
Are you free tonight

162
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,480
Lin Xiaoqin saved a game

163
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,200
You come over here

164
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,120
Who Lin Xiaoqin

165
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,440
Then I won't go

166
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,720
I have nothing to talk to her about

167
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,520
Come on

168
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,760
Since graduating from college,

169
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,360
How long has it been since we've seen each other

170
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,800
And your male god is coming

171
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,280
Male god cut

172
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,520
I have many male gods

173
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,400
Which one do you say

174
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,720
Who else can

175
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:35,480
Just us

176
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,080
The male god of all the girls in the school

177
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,720
You said Gu Mingze

178
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,240
Go and go

179
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,960
I'll see you tonight

180
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,240
Go, just relax.

181
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,240
This is a good mood

182
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,440
Ga boom

183
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,240
Maybe something happened

184
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,400
It's all figured out, right

185
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,560
Eating sugar can't stop your mouth

186
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:56,920
Just go

187
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,360
And send it to him

188
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,400
I see

189
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,320
I see

190
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,680
Stop playing games

191
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,320
Serve it right

192
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,240
Little guy

193
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,120
You don't eat or drink

194
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,160
I've been waiting for so long

195
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,600
Go back to rest, too

196
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,760
Takeaway, right

197
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,240
OK, I'll come and get it later

198
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,520
Go home quickly. Be obedient

199
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:13,960
This layout in your home

200
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,360
It's really shabby

201
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,480
Not as many things as my house

202
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,200
Have a drink of water

203
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,240
Thank you

204
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,200
You are Tian Tian's brother

205
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:23,000
That's right

206
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,680
My sister asked me to give this to you

207
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:38,960
Why doesn't she come

208
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,200
My sister, that rotten good man

209
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,440
She doesn't want to see you

210
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,960
I don't want your dog to starve

211
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,400
What else did you say

212
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,680
And said that dogs are good dogs

213
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,600
People don't know

214
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,640
What the hell is it

215
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,000
What else did she say

216
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,360
You say it all. Come on, come on

217
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,440
That's a lot

218
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,880
I can't finish talking for three days and three nights

219
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,000
I have to go

220
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,040
Right, right, right. What about you

221
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,400
What nice earrings you have

222
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:27,080
Let's have a toast

223
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,280
Long time no see

224
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:28,920
I miss you so much

225
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,840
Come on, come on, cheers, cheers

226
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,080
Oh, my God. What a shiny diamond ring

227
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,480
Such a big diamond ring

228
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,920
My eyes are shaken blind

229
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,800
What's the point here

230
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,160
My fiance

231
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,760
I was going to buy a bigger one

232
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,680
It's a pity that the order cycle

233
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,760
It's been too long

234
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,920
When I think about it,

235
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,200
Let's just forget it

236
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,280
Make do with it.

237
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,440
Tian Tian, drink less

238
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,160
Senior Ming Ze hasn't come yet

239
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,320
Don't gaffe for a while

240
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,280
Tian Tian

241
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:06,680
Heard

242
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,680
The condition of Tianlin is not very good recently

243
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,000
Is this true or not

244
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,320
Everyone finally had a hard time

245
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,520
We all got together today

246
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,120
Let's just talk about something else

247
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,080
Tian Tian

248
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,040
You were in college

249
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:23,960
So excellent

250
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,880
You've always been me

251
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,040
The goal of life

252
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,840
I swear to live like you

253
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,320
But ah

254
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,880
I didn't know until I entered the society

255
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,040
It's too tired to live like you

256
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,520
It's better to take advantage of your youth

257
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,440
Have capital

258
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,920
Marry a better husband

259
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,200
What's the saying here

260
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,600
What's the use of mixing well

261
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,360
Women anyway

262
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,000
You always have to go back to your family

263
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:47,880
Isn't it

264
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,440
Right, right, right, it makes sense

265
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,200
People have to stick to something

266
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,520
I want to toss and turn again

267
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,640
What about ten thousand lines

268
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,640
What if it doesn't work

269
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,200
Your youth time

270
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,400
It's not all consumed

271
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,320
Tian Tian

272
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,360
I'm looking at it

273
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,480
For the sake of old classmates

274
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,480
To remind you

275
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,640
That can only be said to be

276
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,240
Everyone's courage is different, right

277
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,120
Like me

278
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:13,920
There is no such thing as you

279
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,560
Lie flat if you want

280
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,720
The courage to accept fate when you say it

281
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,320
Tian Tian

282
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,040
You see

283
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,760
Our classmates are all here now

284
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:24,600
Hospital

285
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,880
If anything is really difficult,

286
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:26,800
We can all

287
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,000
Let's help you find a way together

288
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,040
Right, right, right, right

289
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:29,960
You can talk about it

290
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,320
No, no, really no

291
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:32,880
At present, everyone is also

292
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,720
It's not easy

293
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,000
I won't bother everyone

294
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,600
Thank you all

295
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,720
I received my heart

296
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,120
Sogeum is still here

297
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,480
Her husband has money

298
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,600
It's really impossible

299
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:44,640
Let her husband

300
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,640
Find you some investment

301
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,360
It will do

302
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,080
It's not impossible

303
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,440
In fact, it's not that there is no one

304
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,240
Invest in me

305
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,400
It's just that I haven't said yes yet

306
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,960
Who? Who wants to invest in you

307
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,080
Why don't you say yes

308
00:15:58,880 --> 00:15:59,680
Is

309
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:04,960
I don't want to say

310
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,640
Tian Tian, I know you are stronger

311
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,560
But all of us

312
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,440
So familiar

313
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,320
What's so good about you

314
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,800
Dead to face and suffer

315
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,800
If the hospital is really in trouble,

316
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,360
You came to me a day early

317
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,280
It's not that you can't talk

318
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,480
Isn't it

319
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,840
I really didn't lie

320
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,320
Is Shen Mi going to vote for me

321
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,040
Shen Mi

322
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,760
Shen Mi of Lvlvchuan

323
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,040
Tian Tian

324
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,880
You are so interesting

325
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,560
A group as big as Lvchuan

326
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:37,880
With your hospital

327
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,200
It can be related

328
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,000
Funny, huh

329
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,000
Excuse me, excuse me

330
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,880
Senior, senior is here

331
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:46,960
Quick, quick, quick

332
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,840
A seat reserved for you

333
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,200
Why are you here so late

334
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,320
That's right

335
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:51,800
I'm terribly sorry

336
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,520
There was a bit of a traffic jam on the way here just now

337
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:54,560
How about this

338
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,200
How about I punish myself for three cups later

339
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,320
What for a while

340
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,400
It will be punished now

341
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,160
Isn't it

342
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,560
Penalty now penalty now

343
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,200
Full, full, full

344
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:01,960
Fill it up directly

345
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,200
So this is it

346
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,160
This first drink

347
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,119
Let's have a drink together

348
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:05,839
Good or not

349
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:07,760
Come on, come on, have a drink. Cheers

350
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,520
Open a pet hospital

351
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,920
Stealing and selling dogs

352
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,640
Don't deserve to talk to me

353
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:50,240
You damned bad guy

354
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,120
You bully people

355
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,280
That's right

356
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,240
Shen Mi, right

357
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,920
I'll pull you black

358
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,960
Delete you delete delete delete

359
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,400
I deleted you

360
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,040
I see what you still have

361
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,120
What are you, ox? You

362
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,160
I deleted you

363
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,560
Is it that delicious

364
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,560
I made it for you. How did you

365
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,800
It doesn't taste so good

366
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,840
And lick and lick

367
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,320
Eat it all and lick it

368
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,080
Look at your promise

369
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:13,600
Tian Tian

370
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:15,840
If you think about it,

371
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:16,760
I talked to you the other day

372
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:17,800
The words of that remark

373
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,840
Why don't you send me a message right away

374
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,080
We can re-establish

375
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,400
Agreement on a signing method

376
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,080
Is that all right

377
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,120
The other person is not your best friend yet

378
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,520
Delete me

379
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,640
What to do

380
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,920
Why did you delete my WeChat

381
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,360
I'll delete it if I want to

382
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,000
This

383
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,360
Is that the reason

384
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,240
Yeah, that's not a reason

385
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,440
I did it on purpose

386
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,000
You are a man with a high head

387
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:06,840
Unreasonable

388
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,640
I hate it when you look like this

389
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,280
Who do you think you are

390
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,640
Are you God or who? Are you

391
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,600
Why are you telling me what to do

392
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,400
Why are you always so

393
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,240
Self-righteous

394
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,120
Drink

395
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,600
I asked if you were drinking

396
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,080
Answer me

397
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:24,680
I give

398
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,560
Hello, the subscriber you dialed

399
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,120
Unable to connect temporarily

400
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,280
Would you please wait a moment

401
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:46,240
Delete my WeChat and don't answer my phone

402
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,200
And blacked out my phone

403
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:49,840
You are really good at it

404
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,440
I delete your WeChat

405
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,560
I also deleted your phone

406
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,560
You're mad, aren't you

407
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,120
Let you bully people

408
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,320
Do you have one like her, Carlo

409
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,400
You still eat what she gave you

410
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,480
Hello, Tianlin Animal Hospital

411
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,440
But I'm sorry

412
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,480
We're already off duty

413
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,560
It's me. I know

414
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:32,200
I'm Shen Mi

415
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,680
How do you do, Mr. Shen

416
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,600
What's the matter

417
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,000
That, that

418
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,560
Do you know where Tian Tian is now

419
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,000
She-she took me

420
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,840
WeChat has been hacked

421
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,840
Can you let her

422
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,600
Add it back to me

423
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,720
Blacken you

424
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,600
Why would she want to hack you

425
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:50,960
She

426
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,040
Drink too much

427
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,720
She was originally

428
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,720
Trying to delete someone else

429
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,960
I was wrong and deleted me

430
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,480
Drink and drink

431
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,280
Mainly, she is going today

432
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,880
Attend a class reunion

433
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:05,760
Those students are all

434
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,080
I haven't seen it for many years

435
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:07,960
Old schoolmate

436
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,680
This will this will definitely be

437
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,720
You propose a toast. He mentioned a toast

438
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,120
Mainly

439
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,240
Our Tian Tian is just

440
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,400
The capacity for drinking is particularly bad

441
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,360
When she drinks too much,

442
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,120
You will be unconscious

443
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:21,040
It's dangerous to be unconscious

444
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,720
So Sister Perrin, you

445
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,640
Then can you

446
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:27,720
Contact her quickly

447
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,040
And bring her back

448
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,200
Me

449
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,480
That Shen Zong

450
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,520
I still have some

451
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,360
Something of particular importance

452
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,320
It's not finished yet

453
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,080
Is this good

454
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,560
Is to trouble you to make a trip

455
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,760
You bring her back

456
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,480
Then I went back and got things done

457
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,480
I'll pick her up again

458
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,520
Then I'll put it first

459
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,400
Here's the address

460
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,360
It's very close to your home

461
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,200
What's it called North Shore Restaurant

462
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,840
That's it. Thank you

463
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,600
What I mean

464
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,600
Can't hear, can't hear

465
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,000
I can't hear. I can't hear

466
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,000
What are you looking at me for

467
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,440
You want me to go

468
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,560
All right, wronged myself

469
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,400
Wait for me at home

470
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,360
Come on, have another drink

471
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,840
Come on, come on, let's do it

472
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,400
Senior Ming Ze

473
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,200
How long will you be back this time

474
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,320
Come back this time

475
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:52,520
I'm not leaving

476
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,440
Really

477
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,600
Then we will

478
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,120
You can get together often

479
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:56,720
Isn't it

480
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,280
You are a man about to get married

481
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,000
Pestering single men every day

482
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:01,920
Aren't you afraid

483
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,520
Your fiance is jealous

484
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,480
Can you chat

485
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,320
I only need one day without a license

486
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:11,200
The choice is in my hands

487
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,160
Drink, drink, drink

488
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,360
Laogu, you reveal it

489
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,560
What the hell are you doing back this time

490
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,560
Is

491
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,600
Can make senior Ming Ze

492
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,280
Fly back from abroad

493
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:23,880
There's definitely something

494
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:24,880
A great event

495
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,280
Yeah, talk about it

496
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,480
Guarantee confidentiality

497
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,160
All right

498
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,800
Actually, it's not a big deal

499
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,600
I'll come back this time

500
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,920
It is with the R&D department of Lvchuan

501
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:35,760
Cooperate to develop a

502
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:36,640
A new type of drug

503
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:39,840
Lvchuan Lvchuan Lvchuan

504
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,320
Tian Tian

505
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,800
Didn't you just say

506
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,800
Do you want to talk about cooperation with Lvchuan Group

507
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,280
Senior Ming Ze

508
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,000
Come back this time

509
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,760
I also want to talk about cooperation with Lvchuan

510
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,960
You two communicate with each other

511
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:52,600
No

512
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,280
I'm telling you I really can't

513
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,600
I advise you to say a word, senior

514
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,000
For the sake of you being my senior

515
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,280
Leave Shen Mi that guy in the future

516
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:04,960
Farther away

517
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,520
Don't get involved in anything

518
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:07,600
Dry

519
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,160
You slow down Tian Tian

520
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,480
Listen to my advice

521
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:18,720
More

522
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,320
A lot more, a lot more

523
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,800
How are you? Yes, yes

524
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:26,600
I'm okay

525
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,520
See you next time

526
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,360
Senior, let me take you home

527
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,880
It's okay. I'll go back by myself

528
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,040
Take her home by the way

529
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,520
It doesn't matter. I can go by myself

530
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,480
I didn't drink too much

531
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:38,880
Is it any better

532
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,280
I'm better. It's okay

533
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:42,320
It's all right

534
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,520
Who ah who ah

535
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:51,760
That

536
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:52,800
Just that one

537
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,240
It's really Shen Mi, right, right, Shen Mi

538
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,080
That

539
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,600
She's my friend

540
00:25:59,120 --> 00:25:59,880
Leave it to me

541
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,280
Who are your friends

542
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,480
I have deleted your WeChat

543
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,040
I also blacked out the phone

544
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,080
Don't you ever come to me again

545
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:09,400
Between me and you

546
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,440
There's nothing to say

547
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:11,880
I've already talked to

548
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,360
What you do, what you do

549
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,560
You put me down

550
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:19,280
Why are you letting me go

551
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,080
Who wants to get in your car?

552
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,040
You gotta let me down

553
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:26,800
Don't move

554
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,520
Can you be honest

555
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,680
How can you be like this

556
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,640
Tian Tian is a liar

557
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:47,840
The two of them are clearly

558
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:48,840
Boyfriend and girlfriend

559
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:50,920
WeChat didn't reply

560
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,560
The phone has been blacked out

561
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,560
It's our Tian Tian

562
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,840
Dumped Shen Mi

563
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,240
Sure

564
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:57,520
Go away

565
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:10,840
Tian Tian

566
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:13,960
Tian Tian

567
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,720
Master, drive slowly

568
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,440
A little disgusting

569
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,120
Where does your family live

570
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,400
Just follow the navigation

571
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,320
Drive slowly

572
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,840
Can you give me a specific location

573
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,240
Master

574
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,520
You just follow the navigation and it's over

575
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,800
What's your home address

576
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,200
Master, just follow the navigation

577
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,960
What navigation can I press if I don't have an address

578
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,240
Where exactly is your home

579
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,960
You tell me I'll go again

580
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,120
Press Navigation

581
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:12,760
Drive quickly

582
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,840
Or I'll complain to you

583
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,960
I follow the navigation

584
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,760
Master, you follow the navigation

585
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,960
Call me when you get there

586
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,840
What's your cell phone password

587
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,040
Who is this man

588
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,160
Sleep and snore

589
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,920
It smells good

590
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,840
Don't move your fingers, will you

591
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:05,960
I really am

592
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:34,680
I can't. Oh, my God

593
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,120
Be calm

594
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,280
Think of a way

595
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,760
It hasn't arrived yet

596
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,320
What are you, what are you doing

597
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:07,600
What did you do

598
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,440
You treat me

599
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,360
Are you out of your mind

600
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,320
What have you done to me

601
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,120
What about you just now

602
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,640
You man, just shut up

603
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:14,880
I'm looking for your aunt's phone number

604
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:15,680
How else would I know

605
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,920
Where exactly does your family live

606
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:20,280
You said you called my aunt

607
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,040
Or else

608
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:22,880
Then I thought

609
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,120
You're gonna do something to me

610
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:24,600
What

611
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,920
Who did anything to you

612
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,360
You sleep like this and snore

613
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,520
And I did something to you

614
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,440
You are so

615
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,960
What are you, what are you doing

616
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,960
What's going on

617
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,360
I also want to know what's going on

618
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,200
Why am I with Shen Mi

619
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,760
If you two really become

620
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,200
You must thank me later

621
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,880
How much brain cell did I spend

622
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:54,440
To put you two

623
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,560
Matched together

624
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,760
How did you become an elder

625
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:58,840
How to kiss your niece

626
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,080
Push into the fire pit

627
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,080
What's going on

628
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,600
Who is the fire pit?

629
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:08,360
Early

630
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:17,840
That

631
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,760
I really hit you yesterday

632
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:22,680
What do you say

633
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,960
Looks like a fight

634
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:28,520
No

635
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,600
I mean, I apologize to you

636
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,320
I'm sorry

637
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,200
The boss pays the bill

638
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,560
Boss, I'll pay the bill

639
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,200
You keep eating this

640
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,360
I'm not used to letting women pay the bill

641
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:52,880
Then I'll pay for the meal

642
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:53,680
You pay the fare

643
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,680
We're even

644
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,440
Who is even with you

645
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:57,640
You slapped me twice

646
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,400
And he went drunk and tossed me all night

647
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,280
Qing Dynasty

648
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,640
Don't you feel any guilt in your heart

649
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,240
I do. What do you have

650
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,760
What do you want me to do

651
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:06,960
If you really feel guilty

652
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,320
Just accept my offer quickly

653
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,120
That's impossible. That's two different things

654
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,280
Wait a minute, Uncle Zhang

655
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,160
Uncle's car this week

656
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,480
Why did you stop in front of your house

657
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:21,960
You don't know

658
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:22,960
What's the matter

659
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:23,680
Lao Zhou

660
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,680
Fainted in the street the other day

661
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,320
It has long been taken away by the hospital

662
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,800
Not in hospital

663
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:48,480
Miss Nurse

664
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,080
Excuse me, there is a big uncle who collects rubbish

665
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,000
Which ward do you live in

666
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:51,880
It's right ahead

667
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:56,920
Is he just

668
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:57,960
The man you are looking for

669
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,840
Yes, how is he now

670
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,240
At present, it has just passed the dangerous period

671
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,880
But still in a coma

672
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:10,360
That's quite serious

673
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:10,880
Why put him

674
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:11,840
Put it in the hallway

675
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:13,800
The hospital has been unable to contact

676
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,600
His family

677
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,920
All costs currently incurred

678
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,040
They all take the green channel

679
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,440
We already have a lot of pads

680
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,520
Besides, as you can see,

681
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,400
The hospital really doesn't have it

682
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,440
There are extra beds

683
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,159
Do you know the patient's family

684
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:27,600
Or can I get in touch with you

685
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:28,280
If you can

686
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,400
If you pay the medical expenses,

687
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,679
Maybe we can do something about it

688
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,120
He is from out of town

689
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,080
No relatives

690
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:34,639
How much is it

691
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,360
Just arrange a bed for him

692
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,239
Then you and I come here

693
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:38,199
Pay the fee

694
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,280
Have you explained it yet

695
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:27,960
Let's go

696
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,080
Wait a minute

697
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,360
Give me your hand

698
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:33,760
What to do

699
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,120
Give it to me

700
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:37,680
Give you a reward

701
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:42,520
All right

702
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,400
What the hell is this

703
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:45,800
Tradition of Tianlin Hospital

704
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:46,720
Reward love

705
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,280
Some people just have different opinions

706
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,200
Forget who before

707
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,880
Tell Tianlin Free Clinic what to do

708
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:55,960
Make irresponsible remarks again

709
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:56,840
Then you forgot

710
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:57,880
He said a word

711
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,280
Call for emergency instead of saving the poor

712
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,040
Thank you

713
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,560
Uncle Zhou's side

714
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:38,440
It's all right now

715
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:40,760
What are you worried about

716
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,480
I'm worried about Huzi

717
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,240
After all, it has been injured before

718
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:45,960
Uncle Zhou is still ill

719
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,400
Why don't we go now

720
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,800
Look at the place where Uncle Zhou lives

721
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,880
Maybe Huzi will guard over there

722
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:51,640
But

723
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,080
I don't even know where he lives

724
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,400
There is one person who should know

725
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,800
Who is it? My aunt

726
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,240
Her information on hospital customers

727
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,120
I know everything like the back of my hand. Let's go

728
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,640
Oh, really, really pathetic

729
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,600
Covered with blood

730
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,320
Wait a minute

731
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,240
Stop the car

732
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:13,880
Parking

733
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:17,520
Yeah, it's pathetic. How pathetic

734
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,280
Look at this blood on my body

735
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:25,760
Huzi

736
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:28,440
Huzi

737
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,920
Huzi is me

738
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,440
Don't lean forward

739
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,760
It's okay. Don't worry

740
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:40,640
I know it

741
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,560
Huzi, take it easy

742
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:47,600
Don't be afraid

743
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:49,640
It's me

744
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,720
What's wrong with you

745
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,600
I'll take you to Grandpa

746
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:54,280
Good or not

747
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:13,960
Huzi

748
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:16,360
What's wrong with you

749
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:16,960
Huzi

750
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:18,960
What's the matter with you, Huzi

751
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,200
Huzi

752
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:21,680
What's the matter? This is

753
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:53,600
What's the matter? Where is this

754
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:54,520
Second floor

755
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,120
Wen Jing Chen Yifan

756
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:06,560
What happened to Huzi

757
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:07,960
Enlargement of abdominal circumference

758
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:08,600
Hardening

759
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:09,280
Barrel-shaped

760
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,960
I'm going to have a splenectomy on it

761
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:11,880
What about Chen Yifan

762
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,720
They won't come to the hospital until nine o'clock

763
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:14,760
Go and call him

764
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:15,920
All right, I'll make a phone call

765
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:21,760
I'll do it

766
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:23,960
It's yours

767
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,480
Have you finished the operation

768
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:30,400
What's wrong with you

769
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:32,880
How are you

770
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:37,720
What the hell is wrong with you

771
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:38,800
Can you tell me something about it

772
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:43,680
I'm okay
