<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">[Episode 33]</font></font></i>

26
00:01:40,192 --> 00:01:41,560
Do you know how to answer this question?

27
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,000
I knew something about it when I was at school,

28
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,360
but I'm not sure about the answer.

29
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,640
Shen Chen, can you answer?

30
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,240
The contestant in Tianlin team,
who has been silent for the whole competition,

31
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,400
finally seized the right to answer.

32
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,480
Please answer.

33
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,200
Because there are a large number
of bacillus bacteria,

34
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,320
staphylococcus toxins,

35
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,040
salmonella enterotoxin,

36
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,480
and botulinum toxin in the food.

37
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:11,120
Due to the pollution of bacillus in fish,

38
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,400
it leads to protein decomposition,

39
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,400
producing a large number of histamines.

40
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,600
The incubation period for histamine poisoning

41
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,120
does not exceed two hours.

42
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,740
So the dogs have shown
signs of poisoning in the stem.

43
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:23,720
Do you understand, Xichong?

44
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,320
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">[Please explain the causes of this phenomenon]</font></font></i>

45
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,760
The answer is

46
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,320
correct.

47
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:38,380
Congratulations to Tianlin team
for winning this round.

48
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:40,240
A round of applause for them.

49
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,800
I knew you could do it.

50
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,520
Tianlin must win!

51
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,520
Tianlin!

52
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,872
Bravo!

53
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,536
Bravo!

54
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,256
Bravo! Great!

55
00:02:52,256 --> 00:02:53,300
Bravo!

56
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,336
Bravo!

57
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,968

59
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,480
Bro, the conditions are limited
during the war period.

60
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,040
You mustn't be picky.

61
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,600
Not picky.

62
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,240
What's there to be picky about?

63
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,640
How could I be picky?

64
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,200
You might as well stay when you come back.

65
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,400
Why leave?

66
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,960
You've already come, stay.

67
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,560
I haven't approved your resignation yet.

68
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,960
We all welcome you back.

69
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,320
What I just did for you
was already extremely improper.

70
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,900
If I continue,

71
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:46,000
my father is going to disown me.

72
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,776
Right, my brother?

73
00:03:53,664 --> 00:03:54,680
Brother?

74
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,744
Brother?

75
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,640
Dear audience,

76
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,040
the third round of competition
that is about to take place is

77
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,640
mock internal medicine clinical examination.

78
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,720
As for this competition project,

79
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,000
I believe many friends

80
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,860
are not very familiar with it.

81
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:25,440
Now let's give a round of applause
and invite Mr. Lin to the stage

82
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,760
to explain to us

83
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,800
the content and process of the competition.

84
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,240
Please welcome Mr. Lin.

<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">[Final, Mock Internal Medicine
Clinical Examination]</font></font></i>

86
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,720
Hello, Mr. Lin.

87
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,560
Hello, host.

88
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,520
Hello to the audience
in front of the TV and on location.

89
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,040
The mock internal medicine
clinical examination is

90
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,880
a special assessment in veterinary hospitals.

91
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,040
It's a very traditional one

92
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,400
and also a very classic one.

93
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,720
I think everyone knows the mock examination

94
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,240
is definitely not practical operation.

95
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,960
First, we will give the contestants

96
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,360
a description of a case.

97
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,160
Then, the contestants will do questioning,
simulated palpation,

98
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:04,080
and analysis of test results
and cause of disease.

99
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,760
Eventually, they will give

100
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,680
a very clear diagnosis

101
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,880
plus an appropriate treatment plan.

102
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,000
So, this is the content and process

103
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,860
of our contest today.

104
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:15,080
Thank you, everyone.

105
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,200
Thanks, Mr. Lin.

106
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,520
Please take a seat and have a short rest.

107
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,680
Now our audience on site

108
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,120
have already seen these two rooms.

109
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,120
We have two rooms on site.

110
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,800
Our third round contestants

111
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,600
will compete here.

112
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,120
None of our contestants

113
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,120
can hear any discussions from each other.

114
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,880
The contestants will ask their own examiners

115
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,000
any questions about the disease.

116
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,160
Then analyze and judge
based on the information received

117
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,120
and come up with the correct diagnosis
and treatment plan.

118
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,680
The competition is set for thirty minutes.

119
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,280
Those who can arrive at the correct conclusion

120
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,080
in the shortest time

121
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,200
will be the final winners.

122
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:58,920
Both overtime and incorrect results
will be deemed fail.

123
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:02,480
Likewise, to ensure the fairness and integrity
of the competition,

124
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:05,880
each group is allowed up to three contestants.

125
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,360
Once the number of participants is decided,

126
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,080
no one is allowed to leave the room

127
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,120
before the competition ends.

128
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,520
Also, you can't bring

129
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,840
any internet-enabled electronic devices.

130
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,280
Otherwise, you will be deemed
to have withdrawn.

131
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,280
The competition is about to start.

132
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,000
The contest will soon begin, please stay tuned.

135
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,200
Who would have thought
our little Tianlin Hospital

136
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,272
actually ended up involving a family feud

137
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:38,200
with father and son at odds.

138
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,800
Shen, you've had a hard time.

139
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,840
Love, oh love is the devil.

140
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,160
No, no, don't, see right after I say that.

141

Not all love is devilish.

142

Yuxian, I didn't mean to hide it from you.

143
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,480
Don't resent me.

144
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,920
My mind is a bit muddled.
I'm going to cool down.

145
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,760
I'm going out too.

146
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,072
Thanks.

147
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,740
Come on, spare me this, I can't afford it.

148
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:33,900
Moreover, I didn't come back for you.

149
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,120
Right, Tian Tian?

I will provide corresponding clues

161

00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,559
is caused by gastrointestinal problems.

172
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,000
We request a clinical examination.

173
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,040
In fact, this nine-year-old dog,

174
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,560
by its weight,

175
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,700
its physical condition should be okay.

176
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,140
Dr. Zhao, what do you think?

177
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:55,960
You see, the mucous membranes are pink.

178
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,240
Body temperature is 38.5 degrees.

179
00:09:04,576 --> 00:09:06,176
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">[Tianlin Animal Hospital]</font></font></i>

180
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,440
This is the result of the clinical examination.

181
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,320
It might be acute gastric dilation.

182
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,980
We can request an X-ray examination.

183
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:18,440
Look, it has this abdominal pain

184
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,280
and the vomiting mentioned above.

185
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:23,000
Is there a possibility
of gastric dilation or gastric volvulus?

186
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,160
Why don't we first take a film
to see the situation?

187
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,720
We request to do an X-ray examination.

188
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,360
If it is acute gastric dilation,

189
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,340
why would the mucous membranes be pink?

190
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:33,200
Maybe the problem is not
in the stomach and intestines.

191
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,560
We would like to request a blood test
and biochemistry test.

192
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,680
For blood and biochemical tests,

193
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,936
eight minutes need to be deducted.

194
00:09:39,936 --> 00:09:40,960
Are you sure you want to do it?

195
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,480
How long does the X-ray examination take?

196
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,520
Deduct five minutes.

197
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,600
Eight minutes is eight minutes.

198
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,720
I also agree to do blood and biochemical tests.

199
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,360
You make the decision.

200
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,400
We decide to do blood tests
and biochemistry tests.

201
00:10:02,016 --> 00:10:03,120
Results are out.

202
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,720
Deduction of five minutes
for your wrong diagnosis.

203
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:09,080
Look at you. It's all your nonsense.

204
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,280
It affected my judgment.

205
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,680
You insisted to do the X-ray.

206
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,560
Isn't this a blatant waste of time?

207
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,160
It's your decision.

208
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,400
What does it have to do with me?

209
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,920
Want to blame me for your problem!

210
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,000
- If you didn't talk nonsense,
- Quiet, please.

211
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,740
- I couldn't have made an incorrect judgment.
- Calm down.

212
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:21,760
Dear audience,

213
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,880
it seems that the contestants in Group B
are arguing due to disagreements.

214
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,160
They have already started fighting.

215
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,520
But look at the contestants from Group A.

216
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,480
It's harmony all around.

217
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,216
Give it to me.

218
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,120
This is the result of blood tests
and biochemical tests.

219
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,440
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

220
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:45,960
The report shows a noticeable increase
in both urine sugar and blood sugar.

221
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,880
I think the dog is vomiting
due to ketoacidosis.

222
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,720
Let's draw a conclusion.

223
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,640
We believe the poisoning
of the West Highland White Terrier is

224
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,720
ketoacidosis.

225
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,128
Correct.

226
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,800
Next, you can prepare for treatment.

227
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,040
Actually, it's fine.

228
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,160
If we miss this step,

229
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,720
we can solve this problem, right?

230
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,300
Let's hurry up. What do you think, Xian?

231
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,320
I don't know.

232
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,360
Based on what you just said,

233
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,480
it has been neutered.

234
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,520
This rules out the possibility of pregnancy.

235
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,160
Tian Tian's phone.

236
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,784
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">Dr. Tian.</font></font></i>

237
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,600
Hello, this is not Miss Tian's phone.

238
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,520
- She is…
- <i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">I have an urgent matter for Dr. Tian.</font></font></i>

239
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,400
What's wrong?

240
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,000
You, you just wait.

241
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,280
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">Dr. Tian, is Dr. Tian there?</font></font></i>

242
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,360
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">Cookie, Cookie isn't doing well.</font></font></i>

243
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,840

244
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,320
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">Dr. Tian, what should I do?</font></font></i>

245
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,800
What's going on with him?

246
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,960
Dear jury members,

247
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,120
ladies and gentlemen, we now have

248
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,600
an unexpected situation on site.

249
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,960
A stray dog being treated off-site
by Tianlin Hospital

250
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,400
is now in a life-threatening condition.

251
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,960
They need to execute emergency aid.

252
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,920
Tianlin Hospital hopes to request a pause
in the competition

253
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,200
to treat it.

254
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,680
Saving lives is important.

255
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,640
I agree to let Tianlin Hospital
pause the competition.

256
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,560
Let them go and start the rescue quickly.

257
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,800
I disagree.

258
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,920
I don't think it's fair to Xichong Hospital.

259
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,520
Who knows if they will take the opportunity
to review the materials

260
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,800
when they return to the hospital?

261
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,560
Will it ultimately affect
the competition result?

262
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,720
Tianlin was the one
who drew the conclusion first.

263
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,480
How could you suspect they would cheat?

264
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,880
Diagnosis is diagnosis.

265
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,080
Treatment is treatment.

266
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,280
They are two different things.

267
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,520
A correct diagnosis but incorrect treatment.

268
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,160
This kind of thing isn't rare, is it?

269
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,720
I agree with Dr. Shi's opinion.

270
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,080
It seems that the opinions of the jury

271
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,920
are not quite uniform.

272
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,160
Why don't we ask Xichong for their opinion?

273
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,040
If Xichong also agrees

274
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,864
Tianlin Animal Hospital's
pausing the competition…

275
00:13:24,864 --> 00:13:26,080
I disagree!

276
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,600
What a joke,

277
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,120
how could they possibly pause the competition?

278
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,880
Exactly as Dr. Shi said,

279
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,880
if people from Tianlin leave now,

280
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,880
wouldn't that be extremely unfair

281
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,520
to us, Xichong?

282
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,480
Yes, unfair.

283
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,080
Now it precisely demonstrates

284
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,880
that the medical resources in Tianlin
are very lacking.

285
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,680
To participate in such a small competition,

286
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,840
they deployed their entire medical team,

287
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:05,040
without leaving even a resident doctor.

288
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,840
With such a hospital, they still want to win
the championship of the competition

289
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,760
and become a pilot hospital in Lvchuan?

290
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,120
Ridiculous to the extreme.

291
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,856
Exactly, what qualifies them
to compete with us?

292
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:25,040
I suggest they send one doctor back

293
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,160
and let the others stay
and continue the contest.

294
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,640
That's even more unacceptable.

295
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,000
Isn't there a rule for the competition?

296
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,160
Leaving means forfeiting the competition.
It means losing.

297
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,200
Anyway, we don't agree.

298
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,000
What nonsense are you talking about? Get down.

299
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,960
Get down! What qualifies you to sit there?

300
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,056
Get down!

301
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,720
Now that Xichong does not agree
to pause the contest,

302
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,808
well,

303
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,680
I announce

304
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,320
the competition continues.

305
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,260
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">It's Cookie. It, it can't make it anymore.</font></font></i>

307
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,480
No, I must rush over right now.

308
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,880
Even if we forfeit the game,
we have to go. Let's go.

309
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,464
Let's go.

310
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,320
Shen Mi, stop competing, let's go quickly.

311
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,520
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

312
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:32,720
The situation is urgent. We, Tianlin,
temporarily withdraw from the competition.

313
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,480
Whether we can return to the competition
is up to everyone.

314
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,800
As a representative of the judging panel,

315
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,720
I'll follow up
on the real situation of Tianlin.

320
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,840
Tian Tian, we are almost ready here.

321
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,880
How is the situation there?

322
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,680
Shen Mi and I are on our way.

323
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,560
I preliminarily judge
that it should be postpartum hypocalcemia.

324
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,040
You guys should prepare everything first.

325
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,640
Okay, hurry up.

326
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,720
Ms. Zhang, why are you here?

327
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:34,280
I will livestream your entire treatment process

328
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,360
to prevent cheating.

329
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,740
Just concentrate on treating the dog.

330
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:37,960
Go back to the competition after the treatment.

331
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,008
Thank you.

332
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:44,896
Dr. Tian.

333
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,680
Cookie, cookie, hang on there!

334
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,360
No, we have to find something
to stuff its mouth quickly.

335
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,920
Otherwise, it will bite off its tongue.

336
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,160
- Where is the toilet?
- There.

337
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,088
Come on.

338
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,119
Shen Mi, how did you hurt your hand?

339
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,040
Never mind the hand,
let's go to the hospital first.

340
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,680
Mr. Chen, Mr. Chen.

341
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,800
Hurry up, hurry up, it's here, it's here.

342
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:44,960
Come on.

343
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,000
Come on, give me.

344
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,240
Let go.

345
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,280
Go.

346
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,080
Go, slower, slower.

347
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,128
No problem.

348
00:17:52,992 --> 00:17:54,016
Enter.

349
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,744
Come on.

350
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,096
Come on.

351

352

Blood analyzer.

353
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,600
Prepare to draw blood.

354
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,200
Don't worry.

355
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,560
They will treat Cookie well.

356
00:18:31,712 --> 00:18:34,304
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">[Test Record (Blood)]</font></font></i>

357
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:40,000
Thirty milliliters of calcium gluconate.

358
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,440
Everyone, under this situation,

359
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:05,040
Dr. Tian's needle placement
is indeed very steady.

360
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,720
Without being 100% certain of the diagnosis,

361
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,960
they didn't rashly follow experience to treat.

362
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:13,580
Instead, they prescribed medicine
according to this analysis result.

363
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:16,200
Their operation is really professional.

364
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,240
It's okay now. It's okay now.

365
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,120
Cookie is out of life-threatening danger.

366
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:04,040
Tianlin, cheer up.

367
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,400
Tianlin, cheer up.

368
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,220
Bravo! Bravo!

369
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,400
Good job!

370
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,680
Good job, Tianlin!

371
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,960
Great.

372
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,040
Incredible!

373
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,560
Bravo!

374
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:45,000
Everyone has been waiting for you
to come back and continue the competition.

375
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,760
OK, hurry up and get in position.

376
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,960
Now, you can continue to answer.

377
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,160
Our treatment plan is as follows:

378
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,720
Administer short-acting insulin
via intravenous drip.

379
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,920
Dissolved in 250 milliliters of saline,

380
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,240
inject seventeen units of short-acting insulin.

381
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,400
10 milliliters per hour intravenous infusion,

382
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,520
correcting ions and body fluids.

383
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,040
Use Lactate Ringer's solution
to correct fluids as needed.

384
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:29,360
The injected volume is 1170ml every 24 hours.

385
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,600
Prevent secondary infections
and symptomatic treatment.

386
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,520
Cefoperazone sodium, Zofran.

387
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,200
When the dog's condition stabilizes,

388
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,960
we can use long-acting insulin.

389
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,376
Correct.

390
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,600
Dr. Tian,

391
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,240
although just now,

392
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,360
your act of rescuing the puppy

393
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,440
was very touching and commendable,

394
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,520
according to the competition rules,

395
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,120
even though both of your answers are correct,

396
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:24,160
in terms of time, Xichong did give the scheme

397
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,300
earlier than you.

398
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:28,040
So, I declare

399
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:32,480
the champion of this match is Xichong team.

400
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:39,480
Xichong, Xichong, strive for the first!

401
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,960
Wait a moment.

402
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:59,600
I think the champion of this match
should be awarded to Tianlin.

403
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,040
They found out the correct cause of the disease
earlier than Xichong.

404
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,680
If it wasn't for this sudden incident,

405
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:07,000
I believe they would have
finished the match earlier.

406
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,576
I think

407
00:23:08,576 --> 00:23:10,880
the audience should think the same as me.

408
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:11,936
Don't you agree?

409
00:23:11,936 --> 00:23:13,840
Yes, right, yes.

410
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:14,848
Agreed.

411
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,776
I object.

412
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,920
There is a saying that nothing can be
accomplished without norms or standards.

413
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,760
Once the rules are set up,

414
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,600
we should implement them.

415
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,520
Xichong International Animal Hospital

416
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,640
finished all the examinations

417
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:43,560
within the time set for the competition.

418
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,920
Although during this period,

419
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:49,840
Ms. Zhang Lin live-streamed
the dog's treatment process,

420
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:53,360
from the time

421
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:58,380
the dog was sent to the hospital by Dr. Tian
from its owner,

422
00:23:58,380 --> 00:23:59,640
we didn't see.

423
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,920
Therefore, I can't confirm

424
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:06,200
whether they violated the rules
during this period.

425
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,020
Therefore, I think

426
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:10,920
the championship should be awarded

427
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,920
to Xichong International Animal Hospital.

428
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,800
What are the opinions of other judges?

429
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,800
I think

430
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:24,600
Xichong finished the competition
in accordance with the rules.

431
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,440
The trophy deserves to be awarded to Xichong.

432
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,960
But today

433
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,560
is no longer as simple as a competition.

434
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,840
Everyone can see

435
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,960
whether it is the process or the result,

436
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,000
Tianlin is more deserving of this championship.

437
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Do you think I'm right?

438
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,680
Yes.

439
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,640
Among the judges
who support Tianlin and Xichong,

440
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,200
each accounts for two places.

441
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:53,320
So now I need to ask for the opinions
of Mr. Lin

442
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:54,920
and Mr. Liu.

444
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,780
Hello, everyone. I am Shen Mi
from Lvchuan Group.

445
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:25,440
I would like to represent Tianlin Hospital

446
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,920
to speak a few words to all of you
who support us

447
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:30,920
here and in front of the screen.

448
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,440
When I joined Tianlin eight months ago,

449
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,200
Tianlin was just a small hospital

450
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,760
facing bankruptcy due to the debt crisis.

451
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:42,880
But today we stand here with our strength.

452
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,800
We made it to the stage of the final.

453
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,120
What I want to say is,

454
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,040
regardless

455
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,380
of whether we are the champions today,

456
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:53,440
I'm proud of everyone at Tianlin.

457
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,520
Perhaps some people might think,
after hearing this,

458
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,300
that I am boasting for Tianlin.

459
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:04,680
Or maybe some people would think

460
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:07,560
it's because of my joining that changed Tianlin

461
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,720
and saved Tianlin.

462
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,240
In fact, at first,

463
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:12,960
I thought so too.

464
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,360
We Tianlin people

465
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,200
at the beginning,

466
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,000
some are slack,

467
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:22,920
disobedient to management;

468
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:33,280

476
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:08,080
who are even more outrageous:

477
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,360
his aim to join Tianlin from the beginning

478
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,360
was not pure.

possess the simplest hearts

482

for rescuing the dying and healing the wounded.

483

They respect life.

484
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:36,040
They gain satisfaction and joy

485
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,400
from helping small animals.

486
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,320
They taught me the equality of life

487
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,560

Is, is it necessary?

522
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,960
Are you just afraid of pain?

523
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:00,960
Who's afraid of pain?

524
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,800
I'm just asking if it's necessary.

525
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,920
If it's not necessary,
we don't need to stitch it up.

526
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,384
Then get it stitched up.

Why are you smiling?

533

Mr. Shen

534
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,440
is filled with the aura
of a domineering boss in public.

535
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,360
I didn't expect he had such a childish side.

536
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:41,720
You are a child.

537
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,640
You fear injections and ghosts.

538
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,800
I am not scared of injections.

539
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,320
Alright, alright, you are not scared.

540
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:54,480
Then you should go home.

541
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,920
Go back and recuperate.

542
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,280
I am also going home. See you tomorrow.

543
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,368
Wait for a while.

544
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,384
My hand

545
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,160
is like this.

546
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:05,400
It hurts so much that I really can't drive.

547
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,264
Could you

548
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,840
please drive me home?

549
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,080
Carlo, come here.

550
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,720
Let me look at your teeth.

551
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:46,020
Carlo, you have tartar on your teeth.

552
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:48,400
It must be that your brother
didn't brush your teeth well.

553
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,600
That's why your teeth are like this.

554
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,480
We have to visit the hospital one day
and let Yuxian

555
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,160
take a good look at you, okay?

556
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,520
What were you whispering to Carlo about?

557
00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:00,320
I'm saying, you haven't brushed
its teeth for a long time.

558
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,000
It has developed tartar.

559
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,480
What's that in your hand?

560
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:08,280
Isn't it the hot pot base you bought
and then didn't want?

561
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:10,880
You left it here.

562
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,560
I don't want the rest of the stuff.

563
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,560
You can throw it all away.

564
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,000
There are still so many vegetables in here.

565
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,920
If we don't eat it,
I'm afraid it will be wasted.

566
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:32,880
How about we have hot pot tonight?

567
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,152
Try this.

568
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:51,680
I

569
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,520
would like to ask you for a favor later.

570
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:56,320
You see, my hand is injured
and I cannot get it wet.

571
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,200
Could you

572
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,320
help me take a bath later?

573
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,480
Take a bath?

No, what are you doing?

578
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,600
Are you shampooing my hair
or digging a hole in the ground?

579
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,400
You are such a man.

580
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,720
Being so picky about shampooing.

581
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,400
You have almost dug a pit in my scalp.

582
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,920
I'm being picky?

583
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,000
Since your hand is injured,

584
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,480
you can only let me wash your hair.
So bear with it.

585
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,600
The shampoo got in my eyes.

586
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,080
Sorry, sorry.

587
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,360
I will be more gentle.

Your clothes are not wet.
I'm keeping an eye on them.

601
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,400
Washing my hair or giving me a bath?

602
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,239
You joked with me just now

603
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:17,600
that you wanted me to bathe with you.

604
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,760

Don't wash the two sides.

608
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,239
Wash the middle part, too.

609

I'm afraid it will get into your eyes.

Great.

688
00:40:43,648 --> 00:40:45,248

689
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:10,760
Why are you standing so straight,

690
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,352
giving me a send-off?

691
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,520
That's inauspicious.

692
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:17,880
Bro, I'll look at these clothes
when I miss you in the future.

693
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,240
Are you really sending me away?

694
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:23,520
If you miss me, come and see me.

695
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,560
We can still play games

696
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:25,640
and group up.

697
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,040
But to be serious,

698
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,240
are you sure you don't want to consider again?

699
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:30,720
We are always welcoming you to come back.

700
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:39,920
Seriously consider this,

701
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,040
if he doesn't treat you well,

702
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,200
I'll be nice to you any time.

703
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,600
What are your future plans?

704
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:59,060
For me, it'll definitely be success
at every turn.

705
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:01,820
All right, we have to say goodbye anyway.

706
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:02,920
Goodbye, everyone.

707
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,120
I hope you all find joy every day.
