1
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,640
How's your head, brother

2
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,480
It's so good that you don't need to worry about it

3
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,240
You see what you said

4
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,760
Don't I care about you

5
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,720
You care about me, right

6
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,560
You care about yourself first

7
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,600
You made my dad mess today

8
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,080
Isn't it awkward

9
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,280
I didn't give him any steps, did I

10
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:27,800
Do you think

11
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,280
Uncle has been busy dealing with me

12
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,280
I don't have time to take care of you

13
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,640
You see what you say about me

14
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,160
What kind of person have I become

15
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,440
I'm not that kind of person

16
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,800
Let me tell you something serious

17
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,600
I was at the hospital today

18
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,160
Meet a girl

19
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,280
Special, special

20
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,680
Special, special

21
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,320
Anyway, when you have time,

22
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,680
Why don't you come with me and have a look

23
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,720
Come on

24
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,240
I have something to do now

25
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,160
I don't want to listen to your nonsense

26
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:55,880
Hang up

27
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,120
Is that how to save the phone bill

28
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,160
You'll be fined five drinks

29
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,840
Let me have a drink for you first

30
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:16,840
Carlo

31
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:19,520
Carlo

32
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,440
Sit down

33
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,000
What are you saying you're running around for

34
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,200
Do you have any idea how much I worry about you

35
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,120
If I hadn't come in time,

36
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,800
I don't even want to talk about it

37
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:32,960
You said you were killed by that woman

38
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,600
Caught and sold to a dog dealer

39
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,840
How can I find you later

40
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,480
What do you mean

41
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,440
Stop licking

42
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,320
I know

43
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,800
You're worried about me, aren't you

44
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,200
But I'm a big living person

45
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,120
Strong-bodied

46
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,080
What's there to worry about

47
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:54,920
You should be more worried about that

48
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:55,880
Background panel

49
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,600
Do you know

50
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:05,720
I'm telling you

51
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:06,960
Carlo

52
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,000
You really can't run around anymore

53
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,680
You look at some people

54
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,240
Simple on the surface

55
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,680
Grow a silly white sweet

56
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,000
The harmless appearance of people and animals

57
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,200
In fact, their hearts are darker than anyone else's

58
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,880
Why don't you listen to me

59
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,400
Dinner will be served soon

60
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,840
I really miss you so much

61
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,400
I missed you so much

62
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,560
Don't do this again

63
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,200
Do you know

64
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,760
Eat when you listen to it

65
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,360
You are more excited than anyone else

66
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:49,920
Isn't it

67
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,560
Cute cute

68
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,920
Are you all right

69
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,400
Rocky, it's okay. It's okay

70
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,000
Are you all right Wen Jing

71
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,880
Rocky

72
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:08,960
Pick up the dog gently

73
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,200
Rocky

74
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,600
Rocky

75
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,680
It's okay. It's okay

76
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,120
Come, come, give it to me

77
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:14,960
Look what's wrong with it

78
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,840
You guys wait here. Okay

79
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,680
Dad, is he gonna be all right

80
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,120
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay

81
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,560
Our hospital doctor

82
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,800
It's the best

83
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,080
Is it going to be all right

84
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:27,880
Nothing, nothing

85
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,000
Silver Fox Rocky Male

86
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,840
Four and a half years old and thirteen kilograms

87
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,400
Reconstruction of gastric volvulus

88
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,520
Silver Fox Rocky Male

89
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,360
Four and a half years old and thirteen kilograms

90
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,720
Preparation for gastric volvulus reduction operation

91
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:14,960
Dr. Oda

92
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,520
I'll go out first

93
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:04,880
Dr. Oda

94
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:05,840
How's Rocky doing

95
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,800
Loki is preparing for surgery normally

96
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,600
But

97
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,600
We're going to have to do it with another doctor

98
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,480
Change doctors

99
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:16,960
Where is it on the operating table

100
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,160
Temporary substitution

101
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:20,880
I

102
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:21,880
I'll do it

103
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,800
Dr. Tian Tian, she is the first

104
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,600
Check it

105
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,200
A basic situation of Rocky

106
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,200
Our operation

107
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,720
It was originally scheduled to be done by Dr. Chen

108
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,520
You see Dr. Chen

109
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,280
He's all set, isn't he

110
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:41,880
Dr Chan

111
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,080
Give it to me

112
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,000
Is it okay for her to just leave

113
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,560
Don't worry

114
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,840
Little sister, do you know

115
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,600
This Dr. Chen Yifan

116
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,320
In our place, there are

117
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,840
The title of Hundred Flowers Hand

118
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,320
Do you know what a hundred flower hand is

119
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,960
Is to have done hundreds of operations

120
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,320
Every time he had an operation

121
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,240
Are all successful

122
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,000
Our hospital

123
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,800
Except for that

124
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,360
Outside Dean Laotian

125
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,800
Just count Dr. Chen Yifan as

126
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,000
The best

127
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,560
Just for the sake of

128
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,240
Saving Rocky is more sure

129
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,680
That's what Dr. Oda asked for

130
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,360
Uncle Chen came to take charge

131
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,200
Of course

132
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,680
Just say if you guys

133
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,320
If you don't want Dr. Chen to do it,

134
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,200
We can also

135
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,159
Change Dr. Oda back

136
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:35,760
No, no, no

137
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:36,720
We need Dr. Chen

138
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,000
That line

139
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:38,919
Don't worry about it

140
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:39,840
Dr Chan

141
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,320
I'm sure the operation will be successful

142
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,360
Okay, it's okay this time

143
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:44,480
Dr. Chen is very powerful

144
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,920
Don't worry, don't worry

145
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,000
Nothing

146
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:05,680
Carlo

147
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,400
Carlo has eaten

148
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:13,920
Carlo came

149
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,320
Eat

150
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,080
Eat

151
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,720
Why aren't you hungry

152
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:24,960
Then eat it

153
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,720
What do you mean

154
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,040
Do you know that

155
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,440
How much effort did I go to

156
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,560
Cook this meal

157
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,640
What's the matter

158
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:53,960
It's not all about you

159
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,120
Do you like food

160
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,040
Still don't eat, do you

161
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,760
Are you going to eat or not

162
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,240
You, you, you don't even look at it

163
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,720
You don't respect me very much

164
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,000
Okay, you won't eat, will you

165
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:13,680
I eat

166
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,200
Shall I eat

167
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,360
Dad

168
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,920
I can't save Zaizai

169
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,160
Zaizai is gone

170
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,560
It's all my fault

171
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,880
It's all my fault

172
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,720
Children

173
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,840
You did your best

174
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:10,840
Don't cry

175
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,360
Still can't

176
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:46,640
So

177
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,080
I want to take advantage of your father's rest

178
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:50,960
Escape

179
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,520
This is not an escape

180
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:54,880
The matter of resigning

181
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,000
I will officially

182
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,320
I went home and mentioned it to my dad

183
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,320
Tianlin Hospital has just been expanded and renovated

184
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,640
It's only been a few days since it opened

185
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,760
Your dad's down

186
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,640
You're quitting, too

187
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,640
What would your father think

188
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:15,680
Aunt

189
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:17,920
One can't afford it

190
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,520
Attending physician of scalpel

191
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,240
It's just a decoration

192
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,320
It's no use

193
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,880
Your dad told me

194
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,080
What about Zaizai's operation

195
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,160
Even if it were for him to do it

196
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,440
Neither did he

197
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,280
A hundred percent assurance

198
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,120
He was comforting me

199
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,520
My dad, he never

200
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,200
Failed any surgery

201
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,040
But your dad

202
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,360
He's always going to retire

203
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:53,640
Aunt

204
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,480
I've been around since I was five

205
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,680
My dad took me with him

206
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,600
Treat all kinds of small animals

207
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:02,760
At that time

208
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,400
I also believe what my dad said

209
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,520
Think you have talent

210
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,400
But what if my dad is wrong

211
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,320
I have no talent at all

212
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,800
Stop imagining things, baby

213
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,440
Thank you, aunt

214
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,560
Still don't eat, do you

215
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,400
What are you looking at

216
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,080
Why don't you eat

217
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,200
Mi Zong

218
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,720
I'm on the hot search in Weibo

219
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,120
I saw this video

220
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,280
It seems that we really misunderstood

221
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,040
That girl

222
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:16,680
Carlo

223
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,560
She really saved you

224
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,920
Am I really wrong about her

225
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:35,760
All right, all right

226
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:41,160
I got it. I got it

227
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,480
So what do I do now

228
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,720
It's so late now

229
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,760
The hospital must be closed

230
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,640
If I want to apologize,

231
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,280
I can't go empty-handed either

232
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:54,520
Isn't it

233
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,480
Row

234
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,720
I see

235
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:07,640
Lao an

236
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,240
Buy me a new mobile phone

237
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,520
As soon as possible

238
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:14,840
Are you satisfied

239
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,200
Are you satisfied this time

240
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,040
Tian Tian, why are you here

241
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,280
I'm not saying let your aunt

242
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,280
Is it all right to bring things here

243
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,520
My dad had a stroke like this

244
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,400
Why only tell me

245
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,560
He's hypoglycemic

246
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:58,320
No

247
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:58,960
Then my dad

248
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,720
How is he now

249
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,480
How's it going

250
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:01,800
Sit down

251
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,920
Mom is not mom is not trying to hide from you

252
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:09,839
I just want to

253
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:11,800
I wanted to tell you later

254
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,000
I'm I'm afraid

255
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,160
Afraid of what

256
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,680
You make me worry more like this

257
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,240
I'm more afraid. Do you know

258
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,079
That

259
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,640
My dad is ill

260
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,520
He's already lying inside

261
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,640
I don't even know what's going on

262
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,200
This is

263
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:24,920
I'm afraid

264
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,319
When you know it,

265
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,440
And forced myself to embarrass myself

266
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:35,920
Mom

267
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,320
You know everything

268
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,000
Your aunt told me

269
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,680
She said that originally

270
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,160
Are you going to tell your dad today

271
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,640
The matter of resigning

272
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,960
Since Zaizai disappeared,

273
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,240
You go to work every day

274
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,560
They are all unhappy

275
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,000
I heard Yu-hyun say

276
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,760
You can't even do surgery

277
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,800
It's been half a year

278
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,320
You come home from work every day

279
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,680
Not even a smiling face

280
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,160
You know

281
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,000
How worried Dad is about you

282
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,560
Mom, I was wrong

283
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,360
Mom, stop it. I was wrong

284
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,280
It's my fault

285
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,440
I'm too ignorant

286
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:32,640
Don't blame you

287
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,000
Things you decide for yourself

288
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,400
Just do it

289
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,720
No matter what decision you make

290
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,760
Both parents support you

291
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,280
How did you guys

292
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:53,480
Mom

293
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,040
Tian Tian

294
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,800
No matter what decision you make

295
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,880
Your father will understand

296
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,240
And those who support you

297
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,000
We will all support you, too

298
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,080
Xiaowen

299
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:30,480
Doctor Chan

300
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,280
How is the turnover today

301
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,480
Today

302
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,360
Doctor Chan

303
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,040
You are usually free

304
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,160
Don't they all hide in the office

305
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,120
Do you look at stocks

306
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,560
How come all of a sudden today

307
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,440
Concerned about the operation of the hospital

308
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,480
I'm not right away

309
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,800
Are you going to be the dean

310
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,960
You have to get familiar with the business in advance

311
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,080
Experience life

312
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,920
Good dean of the hospital

313
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,680
Help me change the tea leaves

314
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,440
OK, thank you

315
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:08,720
Dean

316
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,960
Excuse me, who sealed this dean

317
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,480
I'm not asking your brother

318
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,640
Do you feel at ease to recuperate

319
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,560
Our hospital is now

320
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,440
When there is the most shortage of people

321
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,280
Critical moment

322
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,720
Someone must be on top

323
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,080
It's up and down, inside and out

324
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:22,960
I've counted it all

325
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,640
Come on, you go over there and take pictures

326
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,160
You two go over there

327
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,840
Give me that medical equipment

328
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,720
Don't move. This has just been set up

329
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,720
Hold fast, hold fast

330
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,840
What do you guys do

331
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:36,840
My last name is Wang

332
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,360
Where are we, Mr. Hu

333
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,600
Is an investor in your hospital

334
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,680
I want to inform you now

335
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,080
We Hu always have to withdraw our funds

336
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:44,760
Your hospital account

337
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:45,640
Has been frozen

338
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,120
This is for money

339
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:51,800
What to do

340
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,320
Which one of you is in charge of this

341
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,640
You're in charge

342
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:00,640
I

343
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:03,440
No

344
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:07,320
No

345
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,280
Our dean has just been ill in hospital

346
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,400
You will make trouble

347
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,480
This is too much

348
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:12,760
Say so

349
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:13,880
You're in charge

350
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,040
A lot of talk, you

351
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,280
Who is in charge

352
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,040
I am

353
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,360
Brother Wang drinks tea

354
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:47,720
At the beginning

355
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,440
Mr. Hu decided to invest in your Tianlin

356
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,760
That's also a fancy to your dad

357
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,720
This golden signboard

358
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,000
Yes

359
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,280
Half the customers in your field forest

360
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,480
It's all for him

361
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,920
But now your dad's down

362
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:01,800
This brand is just

363
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:03,680
Pour down

364
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,080
Although my dad is not here,

365
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,200
But there's me

366
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,560
I grew up following him

367
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,080
Words and deeds

368
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:10,960
Don't say you can

369
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,120
100% true biography

370
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:12,720
But I

371
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,960
But can you do the surgery

372
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,320
Girl, I've already looked into it

373
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,200
But there are still many in our hospital

374
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:22,960
Stop it

375
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:25,960
Don't say it either

376
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,560
I bully you little girl

377
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,480
In this way

378
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,440
I'll give you seven days

379
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:31,880
Two choices

380
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,560
You can either raise the money

381
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,320
Buy back your Tianlin

382
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,160
All the shares

383
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,240
Or

384
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,280
I'll put you Tianlin

385
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,240
Bankruptcy liquidation

386
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,040
Don't forget

387
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,120
You broke the contract first

388
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,280
I can follow the contract

389
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,680
Let you pay liquidated damages

390
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,640
Think about it, you

391
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,800
Group second quarter

392
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,800
Profits in various industrial chains

393
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:03,680
They all appeared

394
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,920
Different degrees of growth

395
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,480
But what about the total profit of the group

396
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,320
But there has been negative growth

397
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:12,960
What's the problem

398
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,160
The problem lies in the research and development department

399
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,600
In recent years, the group

400
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:17,960
For the R&D department

401
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:18,960
Invested one after another

402
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:19,960
More than 80 million

403
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,360
Of course

404
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,760
It is normal to invest in research and development

405
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,320
As a group

406
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,840
Head of audit department

407
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:29,840
In line with shareholders

408
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,360
Responsible attitude of employees

409
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,400
Actually, what I'm most worried about is

410
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,800
Or did Mi always put forward it

411
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:36,960
Pilot hospital scheme

412
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,240
According to the general statement,

413
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,800
After the targeted drug came out,

414
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,360
It should be used by pilot hospitals free of charge

415
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:46,560
Then

416
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,440
This piece

417
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,720
Costs borne by the group

418
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,240
Have you ever thought about it

419
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,720
Can you explain it to everyone

420
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,120
Is there any explanation for this

421
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,880
Any enterprise group company

422
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,080
There are no more than two results

423
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,040
Either make a profit

424
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:02,800
Or a loss

425
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,360
That is to say

426
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,800
It doesn't matter if the group loses money

427
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,280
Cancer in cats and dogs

428
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,560
The fatality rate is very high

429
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,240
Our new drug

430
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,520
Once the research and development is successful,

431
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,760
Put it on the market

432
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,520
It will cause a great sensation

433
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,600
And social effects

434
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,120
That's why

435
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,000
Our Lvchuan Group has been

436
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,960
You can still stand still

437
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,080
Root cause

438
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,440
What about the pilot hospital

439
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,120
Do charity work

440
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,320
Shen Zong

441
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:51,720
You know

442
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,120
We are in the same city

443
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,640
Pet hospitals large and small

444
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,960
How many do you have altogether

445
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,080
You must not know

446
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,200
Then I'll tell you

447
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,160
A total of 126

448
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,120
Every pilot hospital

449
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,160
Will be on the front line

450
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,720
Connected with countless pets

451
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,840
And the owner behind them

452
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,240
Do you know what this concept is

453
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:16,920
Once our

454
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,200
Pilot hospitals are open

455
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,680
All pet hospitals will

456
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,680
In order to be in the first time

457
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,920
Get our medicine

458
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,840
Try your best

459
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,840
To fight for the pilot hospital in Lvchuan

460
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:27,880
This brand

461
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,360
Isn't this

462
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,320
The profits of the company

463
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,160
Isn't this money

464
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,280
And this brand

465
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,480
Will go from a city

466
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:40,240
To the whole province and even to the whole country

467
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,280
But that's not the point

468
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,360
What's the point

469
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:48,920
The point is

470
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,080
We just need to

471
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,520
Within a year's time

472
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,040
Let Lvchuan Group

473
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,640
All medicines produced

474
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,680
Occupy the market in an all-round way

475
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,400
End the mixed fish and dragons

476
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,920
The mixed situation

477
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,640
I don't know if you understand me

478
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,680
Am I going into enough detail for now

479
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,600
Get out of the way and let me in

480
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:15,880
Everybody wait a minute

481
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,480
I have something to make clear today

482
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,120
Manager Zhao, what are you fooling around about

483
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:19,880
Shen Zong

484
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,960
I would like to express my gratitude to you and all the senior officials

485
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,880
Report and expose Shen Mi

486
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,480
Abuse of power for personal gain

487
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,120
The thing that framed me

488
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:29,640
Don't spit on people

489
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,520
Out

490
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,280
Uncle Hang on

491
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,360
I need to know

492
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,640
What did I set him up for

493
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:34,960
I'm curious to know

494
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:35,960
You go on

495
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,840
OK, then I'll say it

496
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,360
Not long ago

497
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:40,720
I handled it

498
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,320
A contract from the R&D department

499
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,200
There is a mistake

500
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:44,880
Does cause the company

501
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,160
Lost hundreds of thousands

502
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,680
But I dare not neglect

503
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,080
The first time

504
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,320
Report to the audit

505
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:52,600
But he told me

506
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,800
Recently, the audit department has been keeping a close eye on him

507
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,360
Want me to admit

508
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,280
These hundreds of thousands are me

509
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,800
Kickbacks taken by individuals without permission

510
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,560
And let me write in black and white

511
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,200
Write it down

512
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,640
I worked hard in the company

513
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,680
I have worked for more than ten years

514
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,160
A family of old and young

515
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,200
Waiting for me to feed

516
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:08,960
That's good

517
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,160
There's no way

518
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,760
I can only write it down without conscience

519
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,120
I didn't expect this to be written down

520
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,680
He turned his face against others

521
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,440
You have to force me to say

522
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,240
Unless at your behest

523
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,400
Or I'll be fired

524
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,840
Does Shen Mi have such a thing

525
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,720
What do you say

526
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,280
Let me explain it for the manager

527
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:53,440
Shen Zong

528
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,680
What is this

529
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,080
Is this the material you wrote

530
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,840
Yes, I made it up

531
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,040
But he made me write it

532
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,120
That's a bit of a coincidence

533
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,000
According to Manager Zhao

534
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,760
A story made up in the material

535
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,400
It was verified one by one

536
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,680
As a result, every account

537
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,840
I found out everything

538
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,120
In everyone's hands

539
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,360
There are details I have listed

540
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,160
Record of every rebate

541
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,200
And transfer records

542
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,480
It's all clear

543
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,440
Clear and clear

544
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,600
Good boy, you cheat me

545
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,200
Manager Zhao

546
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,400
Find always let you leave safely

547
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,440
It's already for old employees

548
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,400
The last tolerance

549
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,640
If you don't cherish this opportunity,

550
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:49,760
Then I have to represent

551
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:50,720
Group Legal Department

552
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,840
To file a lawsuit against you

553
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,480
When the time comes, check it out

554
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,880
Look who's behind it

555
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,160
Gave you the courage

556
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:01,440
Zhao Jianguo

557
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,160
Go out and wait for treatment

558
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,000
Shen Zong

559
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:04,760
Get out of here

560
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:11,440
Meng Nan

561
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:13,640
I think so

562
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,160
How much did he eat

563
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:17,320
Make him throw up

564
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,520
As for litigation

565
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,720
I think forget it

566
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,200
Old employees

567
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,960
Don't expose your family's ugliness

568
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,640
I said too much just now

569
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,800
My throat is a little uncomfortable

570
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,480
But what you said is too reasonable

571
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,280
That's true

572
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,320
Don't publicize your family's ugliness

573
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,320
Bring it here

574
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:54,400
Carlo is so good

575
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,080
Go

576
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,280
It's time to eat

577
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,360
Do you want a vegan

578
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,120
Animal fat and protein

579
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:10,960
Bad metabolism

580
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:11,760
It will hurt your heart

581
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,800
Burden-causing

582
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,320
You're not fit to eat those

583
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:17,400
Play by yourself

584
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,000
I'm not really particularly hungry

585
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,400
Why don't you eat it

586
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:27,600
Just now

587
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,400
You cut Shen Hongyuan some slack again

588
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,800
What do you think I can do

589
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,240
He is my uncle after all

590
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,200
But I'm afraid

591
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,960
He didn't want to recognize you as a nephew

592
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:43,360
That's right

593
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,480
Grandpa asked you to take time off to go home

594
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:46,400
I'll give you a ride

595
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,240
What is it

596
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,080
He knows you

597
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,240
About being hospitalized yesterday

598
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,440
How did he know

599
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:51,480
I said that

600
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,040
Why are you saying this

601
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:55,560
You have to let

602
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,720
Is his old man worried

603
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:58,680
Then can you in the future

604
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,560
Don't do anything that worries us

605
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,120
All right

606
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:05,280
Advance

607
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,040
Han lawyer

608
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,240
Find the total things and buy them

609
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,480
Let's go. Okay

610
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,120
I'll get busy first

611
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:14,680
Where are you going

612
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:16,920
I have something to take care of

613
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,120
Change the time

614
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:18,720
Can't be changed

615
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,480
I'll see Grandpa myself

616
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,440
That's it

617
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,040
Goodbye, Carlo. Gone

618
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:40,720
I seem to have been for a long time

619
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:41,840
I didn't apologize to anyone else

620
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:45,920
I didn't say I wasn't going to apologize

621
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,440
I didn't say I wasn't going to apologize

622
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,760
Why are you so excited

623
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:50,600
Really

624
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,000
Okay, okay, I know

625
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,320
Why is he here again

626
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:12,760
Don't you talk

627
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,200
Don't talk

628
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,080
Don't scream

629
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:38,840
No one is here

630
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:40,840
Where did you go

631
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,840
Is that Carlo

632
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,000
Carlo

633
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:12,480
Carlo, are you in there

634
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:15,920
Carlo

635
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:17,840
Carlo

636
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:22,400
It's the sound of it

637
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:23,719
Carlo

638
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,480
Carlo, are you in there

639
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:27,120
Carlo

640
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:28,639
Carlo

641
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,440
Carlo, are you in there

642
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:33,199
Carlo Carlo

643
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,480
Why are you here again

644
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:42,760
What a coincidence

645
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,040
Don't scold me

646
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:45,719
I'm all day today

647
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:46,679
It's bad luck enough

648
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:48,600
Give me a break

649
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:52,800
I brought Carlo to see a doctor

650
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,239
See a doctor

651
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,600
Carlo, come and have some

652
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,120
Why doesn't he eat like this at home

653
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:13,360
Is it that hard to understand

654
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,320
Everyone likes to eat something better

655
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,280
What's more, dogs

656
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,080
You know I'm at home

657
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,280
Was it fed anything

658
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,120
Whatever it is

659
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,440
Facts speak louder than words

660
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,920
It just loves my cooking more

661
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,680
Okay, there's nothing wrong with it

662
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:36,760
You can take it back

663
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:46,920
A total of 205 grams

664
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:47,760
Give you a change

665
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,720
Here's thirty yuan for you

666
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,320
How to pay

667
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:50,840
Scan code

668
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,120
The machine won't work after work

669
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,080
What about swiping your card

670
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,280
The card reader is even more useless

671
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:56,840
You, you open a hospital

672
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:57,800
I can't even settle the bill

673
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:58,600
What hospital do you run

674
00:35:58,920 --> 00:35:59,880
I can't even settle the bill

675
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,280
You're still so tough

676
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:01,880
That

677
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,520
I'll pay you personally

678
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,560
I don't have a cell phone

679
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:09,320
You forgot

680
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,680
After you scolded me yesterday

681
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:11,960
It's time for dog thieves

682
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:14,000
It's broken

683
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,560
That's why I

684
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,600
No, I can't give up

685
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,560
Carlo, come on, Carlo

686
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,240
Carlo Carlo's awake

687
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:36,240
You were the year

688
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,320
The man who saved Carlo

689
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:42,200
It's me

690
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,680
Then what do you mean by this

691
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,160
Do you remember when

692
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:53,920
You are in our school

693
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:54,840
Is it particularly famous

694
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,360
Everyone takes you as an example

695
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,520
So do I.

696
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:58,760
So I put this pen every day

697
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,600
Take it with you

698
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,720
But now I don't take it

699
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:02,680
I don't want it either

700
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:03,720
Because I didn't think

701
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:05,040
You are an indiscriminate

702
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:05,720
Use stray cats and dogs

703
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:06,440
A man who earns dirty money

704
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:08,920
And

705
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:09,840
I don't want the money

706
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:10,960
Thirty yuan is for you

707
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,280
Dogs are also healthy

708
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,240
Why don't you take it back

709
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:13,920
And

710
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,440
Don't come to me again

711
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,040
Go back with your master

712
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,640
Thank you for saving Carlo

713
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:11,800
Should

714
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:13,880
Here you go

715
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,440
No, I'll give it to you

716
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:27,840
Lao an

717
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:28,840
You look into it for me

718
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,160
Information of Tianlin Animal Hospital

719
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:31,440
Send it to me

720
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:34,000
Thank you as soon as possible

721
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,680
Miss Tian, I'm sorry

722
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,240
The information you provided

723
00:38:59,440 --> 00:38:59,920
Fail to pass

724
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,400
Our company's guarantee audit

725
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,040
I'm really embarrassed

726
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,000
Why don't you take a closer look

727
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,160
No, no, no

728
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,040
That's nothing

729
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:08,960
I'll get busy first

730
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:09,720
Good

731
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:43,560
Refueling

732
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:13,760
I'm too hard, aunt

733
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,600
It's really hard for me

734
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,880
You are crying and robbing the land now

735
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,360
The one who gave up me before

736
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:21,480
Where's the momentum

737
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,560
That's not driving ducks to the shelves

738
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:24,480
Be ordered in the face of danger

739
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,160
I have to go up.

740
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:28,560
There are customers now

741
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,680
Stabbed this matter into the group

742
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,640
Do you know how many people

743
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:33,800
Shouting to return

744
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,080
Our stored value card

745
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:36,280
How much

746
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,720
More than 130

747
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,360
The WeChat group has exploded

748
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,800
They all told us to refund the money

749
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:45,240
No, the account has been frozen

750
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:47,400
We have no money to refund if we want to refund it

751
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:50,320
And

752
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:52,480
Is

753
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:55,000
Those new doctors who have just arrived

754
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,640
It seems that it is also discussed in private

755
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:57,840
Say you want to leave

756
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:04,280
This is my dad's painstaking efforts

757
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,120
Who's on the phone

758
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:19,000
Sister-in-law Tian Tian, where is she

759
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:22,680
Good good

760
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,120
I'll put her on the phone

761
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,640
Mom, it's okay

762
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:36,200
I broke my cell phone

763
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,120
I forgot to tell you

764
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,600
Am I worried

765
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:40,800
I ran to Tianlin to have a look

766
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:42,800
Rest assured

767
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,560
You have to trust your daughter

768
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,200
I'm done in a minute

769
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,120
Just go and see Dad

770
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:48,880
I'm still busy here

771
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:49,800
I gotta go

772
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:50,440
Hang up, hang up

773
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,600
Did Grandpa really make a decision

774
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:04,800
I've been with the old man for so many years

775
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,760
It can be said that many of his decisions

776
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:08,280
I looked through his eyes

777
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,520
You can understand

778
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:11,480
This time

779
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:14,080
He is absolutely serious

780
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,440
Grandpa is at his age

781
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,600
I really can't continue like this

782
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:22,800
Worried about the company

783
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:25,720
But if he is like this now

784
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:27,080
Give me the position of president

785
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:29,920
I'm afraid some people won't agree

786
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:31,600
This is our common

787
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:32,480
Things to worry about

788
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,080
Arguably

789
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:36,800
His position

790
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:38,320
It really should be

791
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:39,560
Your uncle will sit down

792
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:41,800
But the old man didn't choose him

793
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:43,560
I chose you

794
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:45,800
I think this in your heart

795
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,040
Should know better than me

796
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:52,240
Shen Hongyuan said in particular today

797
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:56,200
There will be a research and development meeting for new drugs

798
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:57,880
He may have heard it

799
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:59,200
Something about it

800
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:01,680
If he plays this game of chess,

801
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:04,400
Coming up is bound to storm

802
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Do you want to think about it

803
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,320
How should we deal with it

804
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:09,800
If you only attack but not defend in chess,

805
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:12,520
I'm afraid it will just be easy to fold
