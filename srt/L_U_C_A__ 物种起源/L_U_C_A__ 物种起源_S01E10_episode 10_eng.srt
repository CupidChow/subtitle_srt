Won Yi!

10
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:54,270
Won Yi.

11
00:00:56,950 --> 00:01:04,020


12
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:12,010
I told you to run away.

13
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:16,510
Run, you bastard!

14
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:21,320
Hey, I didn't sell you out this time.

15
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,550
Is he your friend?

16
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,340
I asked if he's your friend.

17
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:29,650
Don't do that. He is my friend.

18
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:32,390
Got it.

19
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:41,360
Don't do that!

20
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:05,670
I killed him because he's your friend.

21
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,660
I will kill everyone who is precious to you.

22
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:24,590
That girl and your daughter.

23
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:05,440
Won Yi.

24
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,420
I'll take you to the hospital. Hold on just a little longer.

25
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:12,230
Ji Oh, Ji Oh, Ji Oh.

26
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:14,430
So we...

27
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:19,140
killed each other once.

28
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:24,320
I d-d-didn't s-s-sell you out.

29
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:28,230
Be well.

30
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:30,400
Don't talk.

31
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,140
Hold on, just a little more. Hold on.

32
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:35,190
Just a little longer.

33
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,550
Won Yi.

34
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:42,420
Come on, Won Yi.

35
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,730
 Monoon Boutique Hotel, Room No. 502 

36
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:53,430
 Did she die? Did you confirm it? 

37
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:56,960
Okay. Stand by.

38
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,820
Yu Na apparently died.

39
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:03,920
Then what about the embryo?

40
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,250
She was supposed to give it to me today

41
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:10,060
in exchange for getting rid of Director Kim and giving freedom to that guy.

42
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,270
We can't find it without inside information.

43
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:15,650
And who do you think leaked this information? Obviously it was that old man.

44
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:17,640
But there's no reason to send Ji Oh there.

45
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,700
It's what we've always done.

46
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:24,440
To send their enemy into the enemy camp and let them fight until they are exhausted. Then we take care of the aftermath.

47
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:30,160
But, is Gu Reum's child really Ji Oh's?

48
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,110
It seems like it. She hasn't said anything for sure yet.

49
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:35,040
Let's bring that baby here to examine it.

50
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:38,390
If that baby's is really Ji Oh's, we don't need that embryo or anything else.

51
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:42,350
Even if it's Ji Oh's, what if it's not as capable as him?

52
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:44,190
We just have to increase its strength.

53
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:49,620
A newborn has more room for development, and won't be difficult to control like Ji Oh.

54
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:54,830
If we rope in his family, Ji Oh will follow, too.

55
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:58,330
Can you handle that? He destroyed our last lab.

56
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:02,600
So we have to do it differently this time. Get him on our side.

57
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,870
Is that possible?

58
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:07,070
He fathered a child, in any case.

59
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:12,870
All the fathers in the world are held hostage by their family. So he can be tamed now.

60
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,950
I feel like this would be gambling.

61
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:21,240
We have a good hand.

62
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:30,740
Keep this in mind, Spiritual Leader. Your goal is money, but my goal is the future of this nation.

63
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:33,800
Do not go beyond the scope of my control.

64
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,330
But I will catch Gu Reum for you.

65
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,750
What is he doing, this bastard?

66
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,570
Team Captain still can't be contacted?

67
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:57,020
It's me. I've texted you a phone number. Find its location.

68
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,630
Who are you guys?

69
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:11,850
Get her.

70
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:13,760
Stop them!

71
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:16,780
The baby will die. Listen to us.

72
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,300
Ji Oh.

73
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,670
Ji Oh!

74
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:10,720
Ji Oh!

75
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,610
Let me go!

76
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,790
Ji Oh!

77
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:36,220
Isn't this our first time meeting?

78
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:39,300
Who are you guys? What are you trying to do?

79
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,120
Should we introduce ourselves?

80
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,450
I don't need introductions or to hear what you want. Just tell me the conclusion.

81
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:47,600
So what was the conclusion? Our mutual happiness?

82
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:51,120
The person behind you threatened to kill my baby.

83
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,590
How can you talk about happiness with that guy standing behind you?

84
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:58,180
Playing word games, feeling me out and testing me to see what I will say? Is that happiness?

85
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:01,530
Don't expect to be able to manipulate me indefinitely because of the baby.

86
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:07,570
When you think you are at your happiest, I'm going to smash your smiling faces into pieces.

87
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:13,340
Very nice. Let me tell you the conclusion. I am Ji Oh's mom.

88
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:18,280
I'm Ji Oh's mom. And you're my daughter-in-law.

89
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:21,590
And this is Ji Oh's father.

90
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,860
Can we hold our granddaughter once?

91
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:28,250
Just a minute.

92
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:35,240
Ji Oh told me that he met his father who tried to kill him.

93
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:40,320
Did Ji Oh say that? He met his father?

94
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,140
He definitely did.

95
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:48,390
That's a relief. At least he called me his father.

96
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:53,110
We have to examine how the baby is.

97
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:55,730
We must figure out how much of Ji Oh's genes were inherited—

98
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:57,920
No one can touch my baby.

99
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,300
If you put even a finger on my baby, I will kill you all.

100
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:04,450
Whatever you do, whatever you say, you will never touch my baby.

101
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:07,740
So don't you dare say such a thing again.

102
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:12,700
It's nothing for us to wring your neck in one second.

103
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:17,460
We can throw your dead body by a roadside, and we have the power to make sure the media never reports it.

104
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:22,210
We are letting you live because you are useful, not because we are afraid of you. So stop being cocky.

105
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:26,060
And until you get down on your knees and beg us to examine your baby

106
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:31,540
we will not do anything to your baby. I will promise that to you as your mother-in-law. Happy now?

107
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:45,580
 Human Rights, Impartiality, Kindness  

108
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,270
Having fun looking at me?

109
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:55,970
- What are you looking at, instead of working?
 - Team Captain.

110
00:13:55,970 --> 00:14:00,370
Don't call me Team Captain. You can't handle one guy and get yourselves beat up? And you call yourselves detectives?

111
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:03,270
I don't recall having guys like you on my team.

112
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:12,810
How can you dare to hold your head up?

113
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:16,950
The other guys are so sloppy because you are so clumsy.

114
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:19,710
I'm sorry.

115
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:22,470
But please speak with me privately.

116
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:25,540
- About what? 
 - Just a minute.

117
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:28,080
- Let go.
 - Just a minute, Hyeong-nim.

118
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:31,200
You guys all pack your bags. Never mind the investigations. Prepare to go to Marine Corps Training Camp.

119
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,470
Oh, come on.

120
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:39,250
 Juan Metropolitan Police Agency 

121
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:42,420
What happened?

122
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:44,220
What do you mean?

123
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:48,280
You guys were beaten to the ground, Ji Oh ran away, and I've been looking for him until now.

124
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:53,270
Not that. Why would Ji Oh ask you where Gu Reum is?

125
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:56,470
Why are you asking me that? You should ask him.

126
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:01,340
Do you really not know... where Gu Reum is?

127
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:08,600
Are you asking me or interrogating me?

128
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:12,020
When we woke up, you were gone.

129
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:14,180
So I kept the guys on emergency standby

130
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:17,550
and tracked your phone by GPS. Do you know where the signal stopped?

131
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:21,010
I don't know. I lost my phone.

132
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:23,360
A villa outside of the city.

133
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,160
A bunch of guys in black suits would not let me enter, saying that it was privately-owned land.

134
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:32,350
So I found out who owns that villa, and it belongs to a strange religious organization.

135
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:35,180
First, you should file a loss/damage report for my phone for me—

136
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:37,700
Actually, I haven't gotten to the important part.

137
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:48,190
After that, I reverse-tracked your phone's locations.

138
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:51,000
Before meeting me, you went to a hotel.

139
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,400
So I looked at the CCTV from the lobby and parking lot of the hotel. And do you know who I saw?

140
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:00,600
-Who? 
 -Gu Reum.

141
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:09,870
Did you see where she went? It is really her?

142
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:14,540
I went up to look, and the room was a mess and there were blood stains.

143
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:18,840
So I looked at the hotel guest list, and the room was paid for by an annual membership belonging to that religious organization.

144
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,190
So what is your conclusion?

145
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:23,240
I looked into that religious organization, and they own a lot of buildings.

146
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:29,590
The really strange thing is that the biotech lab where Gu Reum allegedly killed people

147
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:31,830
also belonged to that religious organization.

148
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:36,600
So there is some connection between that religious organization and Gu Reum, isn't there?

149
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,320
- I don't know.
 - Ah, Hyeong-nim.

150
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:42,890
I've been a detective for over 10 years.

151
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:44,880
Just tell me everything.

152
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:50,160
You may be involved, but I'm sure you didn't do anything wrong, did you?

153
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:02,660
Tell me, who knows about what you just told me?

154
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:05,110
No one else knows yet.

155
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:07,900
If I told the other team members, they would only suspect you.

156
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:10,780
-You? 
 -I trust you.

157
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:13,150
How much?

158
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:15,450
Everyday 100%.

159
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:25,980
Don't tell anyone.

160
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:33,100
I will tell you everything regarding Ji Oh, Gu Reum, and that religious organization. So come to that place at 8 p.m. tonight.

161
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:37,010
That place we used to hang out in the past, after making excuses that we were doing off-site work.

162
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:41,480
- Ah, Yangmi-chon Parking Lot.
 - Yes, that place.

163
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:46,180
Now that I'm old, I can't remember that place or even its name.

164
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:51,860
Don't tell anyone and come alone.

165
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:53,450
Yes.

166
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:59,730
You're not perhaps planning to kill me without a trace, are you?

167
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,600
I'm just kidding.

168
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,840
You bastard. There are things you shouldn't ever joke about.

169
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,320
-See you later. 
 -Yes.

170
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,920
What about dinner? Should I bring some food?

171
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,390
How about those twisted donuts from the street market that we used to eat in the past?

172
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:14,830
So there is something to this case, isn't there?

173
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:17,190
I said something was off from the start.

174
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:20,940
The bosses all know about it, don't they? So whose 'line' are you on right now?

175
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:23,310
Let's breathe a little.

176
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:28,200
We all breathe every day. Why set aside time for it?

177
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:32,030
What is that? I bought twisted donuts.

178
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,810
They are from that grandma's place that you like. The taste is the same as ever.

179
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:39,320
- Give that to me, I'll put it in the back.
 - It's alright.

180
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:42,400
Give it to me. It's not like you're hiding your belly from me.

181
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:47,100
What is this?

182
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,590
Yu Cheol.

183
00:19:56,710 --> 00:20:02,380
It's been about... 10 years since we worked together, right?

184
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:07,230
Team Captain, why are you being like this suddenly?

185
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,790
I'm sorry, Yu Cheol.

186
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:21,400
Why? No way...

187
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:30,470
Bastard.

188
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:33,960
He should've stayed still. He doesn't know how scary the world is.

189
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:54,950
Yu Cheol... Yu Cheol...

190
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:59,180
Wake up, Yu Cheol.

191
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:07,130
Come on, wake up!

192
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:11,090
What am I doing, dammit.

193
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:14,960
I'm sorry, Yu Cheol.

194
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,870
If you want him to live, move.

195
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:41,870
You said it was the room next door.

196
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:45,980
I'm not going anywhere without the baby.

197
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:50,090
So you heard how Ji Oh was born as a result of genetic experiments, right?

198
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:55,690
Aren't you curious about what will happen if those genetics are passed down to your child?

199
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:22,760
Everyone leave.

200
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:34,590
In the history of mankind, there are exactly two things that have not progressed.

201
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:40,280
Philosophy, and humans themselves.

202
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:46,660
Humans created machines and technology to do work in their place. But they stopped evolving.

203
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:50,270
A species that has stopped evolving is bound to become extinct.

204
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:54,560
However, humans are too foolish to realize that.

205
00:24:54,580 --> 00:25:00,590
They're the ones in pathetic fear over a mere virus.

206
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:12,020
So I decided to create a new human race in order to prevent extinction.

207
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:14,750
Faster and stronger than the current species of human.

208
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:19,450
A new human race with superior immunity.

209
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:28,430
 Z-06, Z-07 
 Z-01, Z-0, Z-02 

210
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:34,510
When designing genes, the first thing to do is to combine the most superior features.

211
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:39,880
First, you extract cells from the red jellyfish which possesses such excellent cell regeneration abilities that they are said to live forever.

212
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:44,790
- Stop.
 - The strong immune system of bats that live embracing several hundred varieties of viruses.

213
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:47,290
Add the superior spatial sensory perception of the common fruit fly.

214
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:49,720
I get it, so stop.

215
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:57,360
What's really horrendous is not human arrogance.

216
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:04,800
Humans are just a weak and unstable combination of cells.

217
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:09,130
That's why I put in all the genes I physically could.

218
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:12,820
With the most superior sperm and the most superior ovum.

219
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:19,820
Even the cells the electric eel that can generate its own electricity.

220
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:26,920
Those right there are Ji Oh's siblings.

221
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:30,730
Take a good look.

222
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:35,450
See how Ji Oh is perfect and beautiful compared to them.

223
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:11,000
No one knows how your daughter will change as she grows.

224
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:19,920
Killing people is nothing to you people, isn't it?

225
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:26,920
And in order to beat you guys, I need to do the same.

226
00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:34,440
You can't win. You don't know how scary those people are.

227
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:38,130
They'll learn to fear me more.

228
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:41,560
The villa was a trap and I was one step late at the hotel.

229
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:47,120
No matter how strong you are, one individual can't win against an organization.

230
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:51,000
No matter how strong an organization is, they can't win against a person's spirit.

231
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:54,260
Tell me where Gu Reum is.

232
00:27:57,650 --> 00:28:02,750
Let me ask you one thing. Do you really love Gu Reum?

233
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:07,690
You don't know if your daughter's fingers will one day just fall off like a jellyfish.

234
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:10,510
Or like an electric eel—

235
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:18,180
I can save you. Give me everything. Your entire family.

236
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:24,790
Why is there no answer? Do you still love Ji Oh?

237
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:31,940
And if you find her? Will you continue to live by hiding with fake identities?

238
00:28:31,970 --> 00:28:36,480
Okay, let's say Gu Reum can do that. What about your daughter? How is that fair to her?

239
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:41,260
I don't intend to live in hiding. I'm going to find everyone who framed us

240
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:44,850
-and live boldly under our names.   
-Do you think that's actually possible?

241
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:48,400
Then should I live like you? Fearing them,

242
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:53,240
while living a dirty life where I kill my own coworkers? Is that how a human should live?

243
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,680
At least I have the will to live like a human.

244
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:10,950
A church. I don't know if it's a real church or not,

245
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:14,800
but there's a spiritual leader there.

246
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:21,710
Someone who knows everything. She'll probably know where Gu Reum is.

247
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:37,980
 He's a monster. A frightening hybrid. 

248
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:41,920
 If he ever gets married and has a kid, you never know what thing will be born.  

249
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:58,190
By tomorrow she'll probably beg us to do some testing on her daughter, right?

250
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:03,170
She'll beg on her knees, asking us to make her child into a normal person.

251
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:08,230
That's what humans are like. They become anxious when they are different from others.

252
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:11,750
Not even realizing that's it's actually a blessing to be unique.

253
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:13,940
That is how they maintain lower standards.

254
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:18,890
And that is why you are ringing the alarm bells to the world.

255
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:23,740
What do you want to do after the project is over? I'll do anything for you that you want.

256
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:29,350
- I must research. 
 - What else is there to research?

257
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:32,400
I must make something better than Ji Oh.

258
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:37,250
And if that succeeds I need to make it even better and after that I'll make it more perfect.

259
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:40,470
Until the humans I create dominate this earth,

260
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:43,690
my research will not end.

261
00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:48,280
My dream is to just become god's messenger,

262
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:51,960
but it seems like you really want to become a god.

263
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:58,200
-  Why? 
 - I made Ji Oh.

264
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:04,040
I am already a god.

265
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:07,300
Let's sleep.

266
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:20,280
My child, you're not a monster.

267
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:23,410
You will never grow up as a monster.

268
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:28,230
Whatever happens, Mommy will protect you.

269
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:32,540
I'll never hand you over to those people.

270
00:32:36,170 --> 00:32:38,180
Look at you.

271
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:45,130
Hey, get up.

272
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:48,340
Get up!

273
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:21,590
Are you awake?

274
00:33:27,930 --> 00:33:30,530
It took me forever to find you.

275
00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:33,160
Looking at your phone locations, and it got cut off around here.

276
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:37,860
Once the digital tracking ended, it was manual labor. I had to go house-to-house looking for you.

277
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:39,620
And I—

278
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:43,710
What the... you bastard.

279
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:45,460
Hey.

280
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:48,800
Why did you send that bastard Ji Oh there?

281
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,970
Hey, hey! Bastard.

282
00:33:51,970 --> 00:33:54,070
Why did you send him there?

283
00:33:58,710 --> 00:34:01,770
Yu Na died because of you.

284
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:05,790
You killed her.

285
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:07,910
You bastard!

286
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:10,450
You should die too!

287
00:34:14,410 --> 00:34:17,020
You need to get your revenge on Ji Oh.

288
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:19,190
Why are you doing this to me?

289
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:26,700
You dumb bastard. You should kill Ji Oh first then come to me.

290
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:32,080
You think you can win against Ji Oh without me? You lose whenever you fight him.

291
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:39,190
Even if I die—

292
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:42,190
Does your will determine whether you will win or lose?

293
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:45,960
The only person who can give you strength is me.

294
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:49,500
If you have the confidence to do this on your own, hit me again.

295
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:05,990
Don't do that again. Even if it weren't for you, there are plenty of people who want to kill me.

296
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,640
Who ordered the hotel job?

297
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:13,120
The Great Spiritual Leader. And my bold and tiny junior.

298
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,670
What was the reason?

299
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:16,560
They're riding the Seoul-Busan train and I'm riding the Seoul-Mokpo train.

300
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:20,180
There is only one train ticket, but we are headed towards different destinations.

301
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:24,440
Both Gu Reum and the organization were taken from me. Everything was taken from me except for you.

302
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:28,090
I no longer belong to you.

303
00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:30,990
Were you ever?

304
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:33,720
Did you ever follow me with sincerity?

305
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:37,440
You stuck with me so you can make money and fix your arm.

306
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,480
- There was a time—
 - Forget it.

307
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:43,850
There were times you trusted and followed me. That's what they all say.

308
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:47,770
I don't need all that.

309
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:53,230
We're just people who use each other when we need to then throw each other away, aren't we?

310
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:56,510
So?

311
00:35:57,590 --> 00:36:00,750
How do you plan on using me this time?

312
00:36:04,090 --> 00:36:06,820
I know someone in the Cabinet Intelligence and Research Office in Japan.

313
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:11,460
I sent them a few research files and they contacted me saying they want to buy Ji Oh.

314
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:16,110
They said they would give me over 10 billion won ($10 million), so that should be good enough for my retirement.

315
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:18,510
You want to catch him and sell him off to Japan?

316
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:21,560
Do you think you can catch him alive?

317
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,680
Are you at  least capable of doing that?

318
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:28,140
If I were to fight with my life on the line—

319
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:30,410
Then you would be the one to die.

320
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:35,960
What do you want me to do?

321
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:39,510
I still have some drugs that Dr. Ryu Jung Kwon gave me.

322
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:43,370
I will make your physical strength five to six times stronger.

323
00:36:43,370 --> 00:36:45,950
Of course, if your body can't handle it you could die.

324
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:50,940
If it means I can kill that bastard, then I don't need to live.

325
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:55,050
Then let's get those shots.

326
00:36:55,050 --> 00:36:57,250
And kill Ji Oh.

327
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:58,550
Just give me the corpse.

328
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:00,230
Will the corpse still make money?

329
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:05,100
We just need to freeze him within 24 hours of his death and hand it over.

330
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:09,110
Of course the price will be 10% less than if he were alive.

331
00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:11,760
But we have no choice but to take that if we can.

332
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,820
I make money and you get your revenge.

333
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:20,700
With this, don't you think it's enough to use each other then throw away?

334
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:25,550
Once everything is over,

335
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:30,050
have you considered that I will kill you?

336
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:43,000
Eleven times.

337
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:51,190
You hit me eleven times today. You didn't know, right?

338
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:57,750
People who remember exactly how much they were attacked survive until the end.

339
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,260
How many times have you been beaten by me?

340
00:38:03,330 --> 00:38:05,090
You don't know, right?

341
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:09,900
You can't beat me.

342
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:11,680
Follow me.

343
00:38:16,090 --> 00:38:19,160
The time to make a choice is drawing near.

344
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:21,130
The representative of the gods has descended

345
00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:24,640
to distinguish between right and wrong, on my side or the other

346
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:28,670
and divide this world into heaven and hell.

347
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:31,490
If you die, there will be no heaven.

348
00:38:31,490 --> 00:38:34,900
The world we live in will be split into heaven and hell,

349
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:37,770
and only those who follow me will make it to heaven in this lifetime

350
00:38:37,770 --> 00:38:41,080
and be able to have eternal life.

351
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,900
101 baby angels

352
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:51,270
will grab one person's hand to guide them.

353
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:53,930
And only those who enter my church

354
00:38:53,930 --> 00:38:56,450
and abandon everything,

355
00:38:56,450 --> 00:39:01,830
with nothing but a pure soul, you will be able to feel enough happiness to fill the universe.

356
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:18,050
Spiritual Leader!

357
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,780
Are you the Spiritual Leader?

358
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:27,370
You're here, my Ji Oh.

359
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:29,570
Where's Gu Reum?

360
00:40:29,570 --> 00:40:31,540
I've been waiting for you.

361
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:33,800
I missed you, always.

362
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:37,840
Nice to meet you.

363
00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:55,300
Child, what's wrong?

364
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:58,860
Don't cry. Mommy's here.

365
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:01,530
I'm right here.

366
00:41:01,530 --> 00:41:04,750
I didn't think we'd greet each other like this.

367
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:06,580
Ji Oh,

368
00:41:07,610 --> 00:41:12,110
Ji Oh, I'm your mother.

369
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:17,870
I'm your mom.

370
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:25,230
That seems plausible. Since you've been trying to kill me.

371
00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:28,330
My so-called father also did the same.

372
00:41:28,330 --> 00:41:32,790
You people aren't my family. Just tell me where Gu Reum is.

373
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:39,500
You might think this is the end, but it's not.

374
00:41:39,570 --> 00:41:44,450
The moment you leave here with Gu Reum, everything will begin again.

375
00:41:44,450 --> 00:41:46,840
Gu Reum is still a murderer.

376
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:51,160
And wherever you go, I'll make sure that everyone will call you and your daughter monsters.

377
00:41:51,170 --> 00:41:52,950
I'll kill you before you do any of that.

378
00:41:52,950 --> 00:41:57,270
Just because you kill me, the results won't change.

379
00:41:57,270 --> 00:41:59,930
I'm the only one who can save you all.

380
00:41:59,930 --> 00:42:02,480
Gu Reum knows that too.

381
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:05,740
She probably won't accept you again.

382
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:21,920
Mommy's here.

383
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:26,100
Let's be happy. I'm here.

384
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:54,700
Gu Reum! Gu Reum! Gu Reum!

385
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:56,350
Gu Reum!

386
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:08,790
Dr. Ryu, Ji Oh is here.

387
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:24,890
Don't come near me.

388
00:43:24,890 --> 00:43:27,160
Go away. Don't come near me.

389
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:28,450
Gu Reum, it's me.

390
00:43:28,450 --> 00:43:32,220
I said go! Get out!

391
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:35,350
Get out! Get out!

392
00:43:35,350 --> 00:43:38,590
Get out! Get out! 
 ♫  I hope we can stay  ♫

393
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:40,100
♫  together  ♫

394
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:45,300
♫  We don't have to run away  ♫

395
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:48,680
Stop. Open it.

396
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:52,800
Open it. Let him lock it himself.

397
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:30,320
Hyeong, did Team Captain really resign?

398
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:32,410
Team Captain resigned? When?

399
00:44:32,410 --> 00:44:34,920
Officers working the night shift saw everything.

400
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:36,950
He came at dawn, cleared out his things,

401
00:44:36,950 --> 00:44:41,070
and left his resignation letter on the desk. Did something happen?

402
00:44:49,670 --> 00:44:54,210
 I'm sorry. I'm leaving. Don't look for me. 

403
00:45:00,070 --> 00:45:03,760
I've already called. The number doesn't even exist. 
  The number you have dialed does not exist. 

404
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:06,710
 Please check it and dial again. 

405
00:45:06,710 --> 00:45:09,120
His wife isn't answering our calls either.

406
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:12,050
We asked the security office in his building and his whole family

407
00:45:12,050 --> 00:45:16,900
left in the middle of the night, each carrying a suitcase like they were running away. Something is going on, isn't it?

408
00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:20,730
You met with Team Captain last night, didn't you?

409
00:45:20,730 --> 00:45:22,940
Did Internal Affairs find something?

410
00:45:50,810 --> 00:45:52,480
Yes, darling?

411
00:45:54,150 --> 00:45:57,560
Why are you getting angry? I'll be gone only for a few days.

412
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:02,990
Where else would I go? I've come to church to repent and become a new man.

413
00:46:06,310 --> 00:46:10,050
Why are you yelling at me for that?

414
00:46:10,050 --> 00:46:14,700
Anyway, just stay there, don't go anywhere. Don't call me either.

415
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:20,460
Also, no matter who comes, don't open the door. Okay?

416
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:22,070
I'm hanging up.

417
00:46:40,620 --> 00:46:42,990
I know you're being like this because of the baby.

418
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,070
We are the only ones who need to know. We can hide it without anyone knowing.

419
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:50,450
I can do that. Look.

420
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:00,480
If I'm determined, I can control it.

421
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:03,450
I can live like someone with no special abilities at all.

422
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:08,420
That is not an ability. It's a sin.

423
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:12,580
You may say that because you were created that way, but not the baby.

424
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:15,580
Her only sin is to be born with your cursed genes.

425
00:47:15,580 --> 00:47:21,590
And you and I committed a sin which we can never atone for.

426
00:47:22,410 --> 00:47:26,760
No. Our baby was not born because we sinned. Don't say that.

427
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:30,590
But you knew what kind of person you were.

428
00:47:30,590 --> 00:47:33,030
Didn't you know?

429
00:47:33,030 --> 00:47:35,110
But still...

430
00:47:38,050 --> 00:47:40,620
I still thought you were a human being.

431
00:47:40,620 --> 00:47:44,780
But now, I really don't know.

432
00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:48,170
I am a human being. I may be different, but I am a human being.

433
00:47:48,170 --> 00:47:50,190
That is how I've lived my life.

434
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:59,340
- Why did you kill my parents?
 - What?

435
00:47:59,340 --> 00:48:02,580
Do you know what I think every time I look at the baby? 'That's my baby.'

436
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:06,300
No, 'That is the baby of the man who killed my parents.'

437
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:09,380
Why did I love you?

438
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:13,960
Why did I meet you? Every night, I want to die but I can't.

439
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:16,750
So I feel like an awl is burrowing into my brain. Do you know how that feels?

440
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:18,670
I did not kill your parents. I never did that.

441
00:48:18,670 --> 00:48:23,350
I want to believe that it's not true. But no matter how much I deny it, it was you. You did that!

442
00:48:23,350 --> 00:48:25,520
It was not me!

443
00:48:27,860 --> 00:48:30,830
Okay, all done.

444
00:48:30,830 --> 00:48:34,050
- Once Ji Oh comes out, bring him to my room. 
 - Yes.

445
00:48:34,050 --> 00:48:38,000
Let's go, Dr. Ryu. Let's have some wine.

446
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:52,670
Even if I am a monster, I didn't do that.

447
00:48:52,670 --> 00:48:54,940
I may not have memories, but it doesn't mean I can't feel things.

448
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:56,880
Truth is more important than your feelings.

449
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:02,420
Those guys can fabricate facts, but they can't fabricate my feelings.

450
00:49:02,420 --> 00:49:04,620
Gu Reum, it's not true. Please go with me.

451
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:07,720
I can solve everything. I can set everything right.

452
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:11,020
Don't come near me, Ji Oh. Please don't.

453
00:49:11,020 --> 00:49:15,880
You and I shouldn't be together. No, we can't be together.

454
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:18,390
Don't ever think about seeing me or the baby again.

455
00:49:18,390 --> 00:49:21,130
Just live here with your parents.

456
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:24,790
- Can you step out of the way? 
- Where are you going?

457
00:49:24,790 --> 00:49:27,420
- Out of the way. 
 - If you leave now, you will become a wanted murderer.

458
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:30,400
- That is better than staying here! 
 - Please don't do this.

459
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:33,060
You are the one who should stop doing this.

460
00:49:34,470 --> 00:49:36,400
Get out of the way.

461
00:49:38,890 --> 00:49:42,600
What are you doing now? Are you going to lock me in, too?

462
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:46,260
Everything is a mess right now.

463
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:50,500
You will be on the run for the rest of your life and our baby will become like me.

464
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:52,150
So let me do this.

465
00:49:52,150 --> 00:49:56,630
I will set everything right. I can do it. Just wait.

466
00:49:56,630 --> 00:49:58,600
I will take care of myself.

467
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:03,400
I will do anything I can to get rid of your genes in my baby and raise her as a normal person.

468
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:07,330
I just need you to leave. Just you.

469
00:50:11,170 --> 00:50:13,220
So all you need is for me to leave?

470
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:16,680
Yes, all you need is for you to leave.

471
00:50:18,820 --> 00:50:23,900
Just wait. I will set everything right.

472
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:31,050
Ji Oh. Ji Oh?

473
00:50:34,970 --> 00:50:37,550
Ji Oh.

474
00:50:37,550 --> 00:50:40,640
Don't do this. Open this door.

475
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:42,920
Open this door!

476
00:50:48,070 --> 00:50:49,980
Ji Oh.

477
00:50:51,570 --> 00:50:53,160
Ji Oh?

478
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:57,870
Ji Oh, open this door! I told you to open this door!

479
00:51:16,130 --> 00:51:20,230
You've been through a lot. Have a seat.

480
00:51:20,230 --> 00:51:22,020
Sit down.

481
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:31,800
Clear Gu Reum's false accusations of murder.

482
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:34,430
And don't touch Gu Reum or our baby from now on.

483
00:51:34,430 --> 00:51:37,550
That is the reason why I am not killing both of you right now.

484
00:51:37,550 --> 00:51:38,980
Then what about you?

485
00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:40,990
I don't care, so just clear Gu Reum's name.

486
00:51:40,990 --> 00:51:42,820
But what will that change?

487
00:51:42,820 --> 00:51:45,500
Is that something a mom should say?

488
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:48,670
How can you say that after doing this to a child you gave birth to?

489
00:51:48,670 --> 00:51:52,240
I said I was your mom. I never said I gave birth to you.

490
00:51:56,410 --> 00:51:59,240
I never gave birth to you.

491
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:02,970
I just supplied my ovum.

492
00:52:02,970 --> 00:52:07,250
And he supplied the sperm. A surrogate mother is the one who gave birth to you.

493
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:14,300
I've been curious.

494
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:18,790
What kind of people were my parents that they would leave me to become this way?

495
00:52:18,790 --> 00:52:23,920
But seeing you two, I can see that you two were more than capable of doing this.

496
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:27,590
What a relief that I won't feel any regret for abandoning you.

497
00:52:29,910 --> 00:52:33,620
I was worried that you might whine. So I'm glad.

498
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:38,330
Listen carefully.

499
00:52:40,030 --> 00:52:42,810
It's a piece of cake for me to clear the false accusations of the baby's mom.

500
00:52:42,810 --> 00:52:44,970
But what about your daughter?

501
00:52:44,970 --> 00:52:48,870
The world is not prepared to accept a child like that.

502
00:52:48,870 --> 00:52:51,940
She will be rejected, just as you were.

503
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:55,130
She won't be able to attend school or have friends.

504
00:52:55,130 --> 00:53:00,420
The Secret Intelligence Service will be chasing her all her life, trying to do experiments on her and dissect her.

505
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:05,140
Do you think you can protect your family on your own?

506
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:08,050
I won't be victimized anymore.

507
00:53:08,050 --> 00:53:10,830
I will protect my family even if I have to turn this world upside down.

508
00:53:10,830 --> 00:53:14,550
Alright, so how will you do that?

509
00:53:14,550 --> 00:53:17,500
You're going to shoot electricity at all the people who come to capture you

510
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:21,240
and kill them all? Is that how you will turn the world upside down?

511
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:28,040
Unless you become a god, you cannot change the world.

512
00:53:29,150 --> 00:53:33,920
Just acknowledge the fact that you are not an ordinary person.

513
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:36,820
So don't live an ordinary life.

514
00:53:36,820 --> 00:53:40,360
Why should you, with the dominant gene, live being persecuted by those who possess recessive genes?

515
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:43,670
Just dominate those people.

516
00:53:49,530 --> 00:53:54,650
Just do what I tell you. How we choose to live is our decision.

517
00:53:57,070 --> 00:54:00,900
You get your stubborn streak from me.

518
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:03,230
I'll clear her name tomorrow.

519
00:54:03,230 --> 00:54:08,490
The courts, police, and prosecutors are all done with their work for the day, anyway.

520
00:54:20,110 --> 00:54:22,530
How about taking a walk together?

521
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:29,820
Dominating the world. Sounds like gibberish, doesn't it?

522
00:54:29,820 --> 00:54:32,800
I'm not interested in such word games.

523
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:35,040
You are correct.

524
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:40,670
Becoming President or a chaebol doesn't mean that you dominate the world.

525
00:54:40,670 --> 00:54:46,360
But what if there was a way? What will you do?

526
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:50,250
You mean, become a god or something?

527
00:54:50,980 --> 00:54:52,920
Who knows?

528
00:54:53,820 --> 00:54:56,440
That would certainly be the easiest way.

529
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:59,930
I'll give you until tomorrow. I won't wait longer.

530
00:54:59,930 --> 00:55:02,850
Do you want me to tell you an interesting story?

531
00:55:02,850 --> 00:55:05,290
There was a lion living in the meadow.

532
00:55:05,290 --> 00:55:09,290
But there were 100 hyenas.

533
00:55:09,290 --> 00:55:12,330
The lion ran away every day, avoiding the hyenas.

534
00:55:12,330 --> 00:55:16,040
No matter how strong the lion was, he could not defeat 100 hyenas alone.

535
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:21,860
So the lion prayed every day. 'Please give me companions.'

536
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:25,900
'Please give me more lions that are just like me.'

537
00:55:25,900 --> 00:55:31,030
Perhaps the prayer worked, because now there were ten lions.

538
00:55:31,030 --> 00:55:34,950
That was enough to defeat 100 hyenas.

539
00:55:34,950 --> 00:55:38,740
And that was how the lion became the king of the jungle.

540
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:47,720
In the end, dominating the world is about increasing the population, at the very least.

541
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:53,360
Think about it. What if there were 100 people like you? 1,000 or 10,000?

542
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:57,530
If that happened, no one would call you a monster.

543
00:55:59,130 --> 00:56:02,240
That could take hundreds or thousands of years.

544
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:05,560
If your cells can be copied, I could make hundreds of you every year.

545
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:10,210
And if that happened, you and your daughter will no longer be alone.

546
00:56:10,210 --> 00:56:12,390
So that was how you created me.

547
00:56:12,390 --> 00:56:16,000
Not a fruit of love, but the result of experiments.

548
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:19,940
Whatever the method was, I loved you.

549
00:56:19,940 --> 00:56:23,300
You loved the result of your experiment, you mean.

550
00:56:24,310 --> 00:56:27,940
And that's all it is. You can't forget the taste of success that you tasted only once.

551
00:56:27,940 --> 00:56:31,220
And your greed for making more human beings like me.

552
00:56:31,220 --> 00:56:35,570
Yes, let's say that is my greed. Don't you have any greed?

553
00:56:35,570 --> 00:56:39,160
Even if that's the only way you can protect your family?

554
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:42,010
People who were created that way cannot be accepted in this world.

555
00:56:42,010 --> 00:56:45,200
Why does anyone need to be accepted? Everyone lives wanting acceptance.

556
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:48,490
By their parents, their teachers, their family, their jobs, everyone.

557
00:56:48,490 --> 00:56:51,930
Somehow, becoming by accepted by others became the goal in life.

558
00:56:51,930 --> 00:56:56,290
But not you. Instead of acceptance,

559
00:56:56,290 --> 00:56:59,410
you are worthy of receiving worship.

560
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:02,730
Who would anyone worship someone like me?

561
00:57:02,730 --> 00:57:08,560
That will happen. Because you are the beginning of a new human race.

562
00:57:09,590 --> 00:57:12,110
So what you need more than anything is survival.

563
00:57:12,110 --> 00:57:19,020
The lions on this earth are you and your daughter, just two.

564
00:57:19,020 --> 00:57:24,820
And there are 7 billion hyenas.

565
00:57:50,070 --> 00:57:56,200
 What if the baby is born and it is a monster like me? What do we do? 

566
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:57,720
 Ji Oh. 

567
00:57:57,720 --> 00:58:00,350
 I won't let it live the way I did. 

568
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:07,360
 Even if I have to destroy this world and make a new world, I won't let it live the way I did. 

569
00:58:43,550 --> 00:58:47,120
Divine One, we have faith!

570
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:49,560
Please save us.

571
00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:53,120
Divine One...

572
00:58:57,640 --> 00:59:01,710
Divine One, your words are the truth.

573
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:12,150
I will receive your grace, Divine One.

574
00:59:12,150 --> 00:59:16,590
Please hear my prayer, Divine One.

575
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:23,280
Divine One...

576
00:59:28,670 --> 00:59:30,130
It's time to pray.

577
00:59:30,130 --> 00:59:31,930
Let's deal with Gu Reum's problem before we go.

578
00:59:31,930 --> 00:59:35,980
- No, let's pray first.
 - I don't intend to wait. If you want to live, do what I say.

579
00:59:35,980 --> 00:59:39,560
It is a time that was promised with the gods. It is more important than life.

580
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:41,040
'Spiritual Leader.'

581
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:44,970
You said it means that you guide souls.

582
00:59:45,820 --> 00:59:48,680
I wondered if such a word really existed in this world.

583
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:52,140
There must be powerful people among those who have faith in you and follow you.

584
00:59:52,140 --> 00:59:55,830
You must have worked with them and conspired to do all sorts of things.

585
00:59:55,830 --> 01:00:00,420
So the first thing I will do is to break your foundation.

586
01:00:00,420 --> 01:00:04,090
If we leave now, I will attend your prayer session.

587
01:00:04,090 --> 01:00:08,790
If they see the Great Spiritual Leader on her knees and crying, begging for her life,

588
01:00:08,790 --> 01:00:11,170
will those people still kneel before you?

589
01:00:11,170 --> 01:00:15,970
No. I am their spiritual guide, not their ruler.

590
01:00:15,970 --> 01:00:19,170
And the faithful do not kneel unless they are ruled.

591
01:00:19,170 --> 01:00:21,940
If you are curious, confirm it for yourself.

592
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:45,040
The representative of the gods are already watching all of you who have already descended.

593
01:00:49,050 --> 01:00:51,360
He is distinguishing between those who are right, and those who are wrong

594
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:56,730
and drawing up a list of those who will receive a baby angel.

595
01:00:57,530 --> 01:01:03,490
Only those with their name on that list will enjoy eternal life in heaven during their lifetimes.

596
01:01:03,490 --> 01:01:10,380
And those removed from that list will suffer eternal torment in hell during their lifetimes.

597
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:40,670
You trust Mom, don't you?

598
01:01:40,670 --> 01:01:42,760
It will be alright.

599
01:01:45,260 --> 01:01:47,040
Let's go.

600
01:02:14,560 --> 01:02:18,630
That being shines brightly even in darkness.

601
01:02:18,630 --> 01:02:21,930
And he can see all of you, wherever you hide.

602
01:02:21,930 --> 01:02:26,670
And he will condemn all your sins, whether you've committed them by action or by thought.

603
01:02:26,670 --> 01:02:29,380
That was his vow!

604
01:02:39,790 --> 01:02:43,000
Stop with these ridiculous lies!

605
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:47,960
Baby angel or whatever. I gave you every cent I had.

606
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:50,460
But you've babbling the same thing over and over again for ten years!

607
01:02:50,460 --> 01:02:54,960
Cult leaders like you need to be killed right now!

608
01:03:57,360 --> 01:03:59,610
He has come!

609
01:04:13,490 --> 01:04:16,550
Divine One! Divine One!

610
01:04:33,790 --> 01:04:40,720


611
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:45,290
♫  Look at me, voice to me  ♫

612
01:04:45,290 --> 01:04:48,800
♫  Find tree.  ♫

613
01:04:49,910 --> 01:04:58,440
♫  Please let me sleep on it, so I can breathe in.  ♫

614
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:03,150
♫  I’m searching for something that’s beautiful  ♫

615
01:05:03,150 --> 01:05:04,380
♫  The scent  ♫

616
01:05:04,380 --> 01:05:06,950
 L.U.C.A.: The Beginning 
 ♫  takes me there, I will never fall  ♫ 

617
01:05:06,950 --> 01:05:09,500
 I will take the path of evil. You take the good path. 

618
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:11,400
 Just what are you planning to do? 

619
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:14,290
 I will show them that it's okay to live a life with just what you have. 

620
01:05:14,290 --> 01:05:18,590
 - In a few days, your arm will explode. 
 - I don't care. I just have to kill Ji Oh. 

621
01:05:18,590 --> 01:05:21,960
 Tell them to sacrifice their most precious thing to prove their true faith. 

622
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:25,910
 Ji Oh. Your baby is not well. There is only one method of treatment. 

623
01:05:25,910 --> 01:05:28,300
 So did you decide to become a real monster? 

624
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:31,370
 Is the agony you are suffering right now more important than the agony your baby will suffer? 

625
01:05:31,370 --> 01:05:32,270
 Kill them all. 

626
01:05:32,270 --> 01:05:35,770
 I am grateful, and I loved you a lot. 

627
01:05:35,770 --> 01:05:39,510
♫  Look at me, voice to me  ♫
