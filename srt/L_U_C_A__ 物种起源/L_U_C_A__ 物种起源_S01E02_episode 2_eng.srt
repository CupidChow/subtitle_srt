♫  Look at me, voice to me, find tree.  ♫

00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:18,170

 L.U.C.A.: The Beginning  

5
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:36,410
 This is a work of fiction. Any resemblance to actual names, places, organizations, religious references, and incidents is entirely coincidental.  

6
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:42,970
 The episode was filmed with adequate accommodations to ensure the safety and the emotional well-being of the infant and minor actors used. 

7
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:45,180
 Previously  
 My sweet baby, don't forget. 

8
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,270
 You are not a monster.  

9
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:48,950
 I'm sorry. 

10
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:51,950
 Why? You don't remember? 

11
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:54,890
 You succeeded once, as you said. 
  Z-0 

12
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:56,710
 Let's make something like this one more time.  
 Exit. 

13
00:00:56,710 --> 00:01:01,180
 If something doesn't emerge at the next human sacrifice, close the lab.  

14
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:03,710
 They're either dead or missing. 

15
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:05,860
 Hey, you! 

16
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:09,030
  Is there any human who can do this with his bare hands? 

17
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,680
 Ji Oh, this bastard. 

18
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,720
 It's Ji Oh alright.  

19
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:14,880
 What a miracle! 

20
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,430
 He was your savior today. Get some beverages on your way to see him. 

21
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:19,050
 It's okay. I have money. 

22
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:21,550
 This is from our expense fund. You're part of my team now. 

23
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:25,120
 The information is from the police. It's  called Dagyeong Resources. It collects waste. 

24
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,070
 It's been a while. Has it been a year? 

25
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:28,230
 Run away.  

26
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:30,400
 I said don't do it! 

27
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:38,540
What's that? Hey, what's wrong?

28
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:49,550
 Episode 2 

29
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:56,580


30
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:05,210
 Sae Han Ave. 54th St. 8 

31
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:09,340
Sir, it's Sae Han Ave. 54th St. 8.

32
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:11,500
I need backup right away.

33
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:27,290
Don't come at me!

34
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,330
Run away again,

35
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:19,920
if you can walk.

36
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,220
Why on earth are you doing this to me?

37
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:25,510
Because you won't listen. I asked you to come quietly.

38
00:05:56,300 --> 00:06:01,400
There are too many people watching right now. This isn't the way we do things.

39
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:28,050
Gu Reum!

40
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:30,000
Gu Reum, hey!

41
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:33,990
Gu Reum, are you okay?

42
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:39,650
This is Sae Han Ave. 54th St. 8. An officer is injured.

43
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:41,690
Send an ambulance quickly!

44
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:45,690
What happened here?

45
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:30,590
You're saying he's at the hospital right now?

46
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:34,650
We have our guys on standby there. He's connected to a ventilator.

47
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:36,500
According to the doctors, he might not make it.

48
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,750
Did you do that to him?

49
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:40,790
Did you try to kill him for what he did to your arm?

50
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:41,860
It wasn't on purpose.

51
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:44,410
You dealt with him once!

52
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:48,390
Don't you have the slightest idea how to catch him?

53
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:51,120
With a situation like that, you should've reported to me.

54
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,960
Didn't you say you trust my judgment when I'm out in the fields?

55
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,930
Damn you!

56
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:00,330
What happened?

57
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:04,090
What exactly happened?

58
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:06,520
Things got complicated.

59
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:11,330
- He's in the hospital.  We need to assess the situation first. 
 - How is his condition?

60
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:12,590
He's in critical condition.

61
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:14,680
We have no time to assess the situation!

62
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,560
They can't treat him there.

63
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,140
We must bring him in.

64
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:20,520
Shouldn't we first make sure he's out of danger before we bring him in?

65
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,120
He can't even get a blood transfusion there!

66
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,980
They wouldn't even have the matching blood type.

67
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:27,430
He wouldn't die, would he?

68
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:32,850
Although his cells  regenerate better than normal human cells, in a critical condition he's still at risk of dying.

69
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:36,020
And if he dies?

70
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:41,960
If we can bring him in before his cells die, there might be something we could do.

71
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,490
Can you get him here?

72
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:47,360
Detectives are on standby in front of his hospital room.

73
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,660
Bring him here.

74
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:53,620
Even if he's dead, bring me his body. As soon as possible, in the freshest condition.

75
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:57,700
Okay, sir.

76
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,640
Take Yoo Na with you.

77
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,080
My team can handle this.

78
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:07,600
Just take her with you. She has improved now, so she'll be of use to you in one way or another.

79
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:20,130
You should stay in bed. They'll soon work on you.

80
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:22,620
What do you mean?

81
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:23,830
Did you eat?

82
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:26,360
I'm fasting, so I haven't eaten anything.

83
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:34,990
Will I really be able to use this leg again?

84
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:36,620
We can make it stronger than before.

85
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:39,680
I don't need it to be strong. Being able to walk would be enough for me.

86
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,480
That won't be enough for me, though.

87
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:47,140
If I receive the surgery, what are the chances of success?

88
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:49,060
Didn't I tell you?

89
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:51,950
You aren't getting a surgery.

90
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:54,130
To be precise, you'll be experimented on.

91
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:01,260
Say hello. He's the director of this research institute.

92
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,360
Your leg is in a worse condition than I thought.

93
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,210
Can you fix it?

94
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:21,020
Don't you know? We don't fix things here. We improve them.

95
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:30,180
Don't think too much. You entrusted your life to me, after all.

96
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:32,940
Let's proceed.

97
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:00,080
Aren't you hot running in this hot weather?

98
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,190
I wanted to test my leg.

99
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:03,810
How far did you run?

100
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:05,610
Twelve kilometres.

101
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:07,580
Your legs seem to function just fine. Let's go.

102
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:10,700
Right now? But my car is parked in the parking  lot over there.

103
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,040
Go and get it. We don't have much time.

104
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:15,670
It's going to take some time. The parking lot is twelve kilometers away.

105
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:18,260
Follow me. We'll take my car.

106
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:21,280
-What about my car? 
- Get it later.

107
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:26,770
 Daeyeong Hospital 

108
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:28,770
This way.

109
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:44,210
 Can't you send him somewhere else? We have Gu Reum here, too. 

110
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:46,580
 How could you bring him here? 

111
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,570
 One day is enough. Just one. 

112
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:50,390
 What if they come looking for him here? 

113
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:52,210
 No one knows. 

114
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:53,740
 I'm telling you. No one knows. 

115
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:55,140
 Really? 

116
00:11:55,140 --> 00:12:00,040
 Let him just stay the night here. I will send him away tomorrow. Please.  

117
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,970
 Mom. 

118
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:05,820
 Sweetie, are you awake? Let's go back to bed. 

119
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,940
 Dad, who's that? 

120
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:13,240
 Go back to bed. I'll tell you tomorrow. Let's go inside. 

121
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:16,640
 Mom, do I have a baby brother now? 

122
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:59,360
 Hey, you. 

123
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:06,970
 Who are you? 

124
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:09,700
 Why are you in my house? 

125
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:13,080
 What's your name? 

126
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,920
 What's wrong? 

127
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,700
 Don't do that. 

128
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:25,390
 Don't do that. You're scaring me! 

129
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:29,850
 Dad! Dad! 

130
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:57,530
Are you here, sir?

131
00:13:57,530 --> 00:13:59,940
- Where? 
 - In the Intensive Care Unit.

132
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,920
What the hell did you do to the kid? ICU?! Seriously.

133
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,230
Sorry, sir.

134
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:05,780
The kid was injured already. Radio standby would've been enough. Where's the ICU?

135
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:08,380
This way.

136
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:12,530
I wanted to avoid the guys when they jumped into the street. I ended up getting my driver's side door jammed.

137
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:15,670
Luckily, my passenger side door still opened. So I told her to wait, but she wouldn't listen.

138
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:18,380
If you'd kept her in your car, she wouldn't be in the ICU!

139
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:21,540
The one in the ICU isn't her. The suspect is.

140
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:25,030
I thought you were asking where the suspect was.

141
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,240
- What about Gu Reum?
 - She's in the emergency room.

142
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,720
What did you do to her? In the ER?!

143
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,960
She has a slight concussion. It's nothing too serious.

144
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:38,520
Team Leader. Team Leader. This way, please.

145
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,280
Are you taking that off, or putting it on?

146
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,460
Are you worried about me? Or, are you just looking?

147
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:53,500
- I told you not to get hurt. 
 - I got a scratch. That's all.

148
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,700
You should stay in bed.

149
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,180
I'm alright. What happened to the suspect?

150
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:58,560
You worry about yourself. Stay in bed.

151
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,930
I said I'm fine. Team Captain!

152
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:10,100
He has some herniated vertebrae and severe internal bleeding.

153
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,860
The doctors said there wasn't much they could do for him.

154
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,610
They said he might not survive the night.

155
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:16,760
What happened to the CCTVs on the scene?

156
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:19,900
At the time of the accident, more than a block of the street got a blackout.

157
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:23,540
The hard disks all got burned, and I could save nothing.

158
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,570
Why would a blackout burn the hard disks?

159
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:28,530
You can say that again. How strange.

160
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:30,480
Anything from the dashboard cams of the vehicles that were there at that time?

161
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,710
That's funny, too. All their memories were erased.

162
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:38,230
I wanted to hand them over to the Cyber Unit for restoration.

163
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:41,380
I find this strange, too. From the radius of the accident scene,

164
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:44,640
the cars looked as though they were pulled away in all directions.

165
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:47,260
As if there was an explosion. How strange.

166
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:48,890
What's stranger than that is

167
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:52,670
we can't identify his blood type and give him a transfusion.

168
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:54,680
I sent a sample of his blood to NFS (National Forensic Service) for now.

169
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:58,220
The doctors are amazed and dumbfounded all at once.

170
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:00,500
- Hey.
 - Yes?

171
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:04,590
Are you a reporter? It isn't your job to spread the seed of doubt.

172
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:07,840
- Just strange.
 - Investigate if you find things strange.

173
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:10,570
I'll kill you if you say "strange" one more time.

174
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:14,750
Nothing makes sense about the crime scene either.

175
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,820
That isn't a crime scene. It's a scene of an accident.

176
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,950
It   is  a crime scene.

177
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:22,440
The doctors told me he got stabbed in both of his knees.

178
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,360
- Did he get stabbed?
 - Yes.

179
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:30,110
His workmate was thrown into the incinerator, and he was stabbed.

180
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:32,870
In other words, both of them were the targets?

181
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:36,990
I'm not entirely comfortable saying that when the suspect was stabbed right here and here.

182
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:39,630
If he was meant to be killed, he should've been stabbed here and here.

183
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:41,910
Seriously, everything is so strange.

184
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:44,710
I warned you not to use the word, 'strange.'

185
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:46,140
Team Leader!

186
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:47,590
I told you to rest. Why are you out here?

187
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:49,100
I didn't get hurt, really.

188
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,340
Blood means you got hurt.

189
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:53,430
You told me not to bother you even if I got hurt.

190
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:55,010
Having fun talking back to me?

191
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:57,230
- Yes, sir.
 - Yes?

192
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:58,770
How's the suspect?

193
00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:01,390
I'm not sure whether he's a suspect or a victim at this point.

194
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:03,580
They say he might not make it through the night.

195
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,690
Can I see him quickly?

196
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:49,730
You were the last witness. Did you see anything strange?

197
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:53,940
I didn't see anything too strange except on the rooftop.

198
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,340
There was a man.

199
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,110
Did you say there was a man?

200
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,410
What did he look like?

201
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:02,610
It was too dark and far away to get a good look, but was definitely a man.

202
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:07,690
I'm right with this one. He stabbed the suspect and threw him off the rooftop, right?

203
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:11,240
I'm not sure if that's what actually happened or if he slipped and fell.

204
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:16,220
But something stranger than that is...

205
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:24,050
What's stranger than that?

206
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,700
It looked like

207
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:32,470
an explosion happened.

208
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:36,200
Hey, you saw it, too? I told you I was right.

209
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,930
The spot where the suspect landed looked as though a bomb went off. He wouldn't believe me.

210
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:42,950
- Are you sure?
 - Yes, sir.

211
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:45,240
Are you sure about the man being on the rooftop?

212
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,080
Yes, I'm sure.

213
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:55,510
A probable scenario is the culprit, after killing Mr. Kim, went after the victim in the ICU for having witnessed his murder.

214
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:59,720
See if the victim has enemies and money troubles.

215
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:04,090
- You two canvass the accident scene for witnesses.
 - Yes, sir.

216
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:07,910
You, see if there's been an explosion accident within the incinerator plant.

217
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:12,350
And find out if the accident has anything to do with the blackout and the burning of the memory chips in the CCTVs.

218
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:14,930
You need to strengthen our surveillance effort and stand guard here 24/7.

219
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:16,440
Understood. Let's go.

220
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,150
And you.

221
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:19,920
Go home.

222
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:23,430
Why?

223
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:25,840
Why, Team Captain!

224
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:29,590
Come on, Team Leader!

225
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:36,040
Get in.

226
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,720
Seriously, you're overprotecting me.

227
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,990
If you keep ignoring a little injury here and there, you end up like me.

228
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:44,540
I won't end up as bad a physical condition as you.

229
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:57,650
Rest a few days. I'll kill you if you show up earlier than that.

230
00:19:57,650 --> 00:20:01,380
By the way, I'm not as physically bad off as you think.

249

Possession of a hidden weapon.

252
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:26,280
Causing bodily injury and aggravated assault. A gangster?

254
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:40,220
Not registered in the family registry system.

255
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:46,420
That means he's an orphan. His birthdate is January 3, 1988.

256
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:50,740
His birth was registered on January 3, 1998.

257
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:58,050
So his birth was registered ten years after he was born.

258
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:02,110

 Dad! 

263
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:39,840
 Code blue, code blue for an adult patient. Report to the ICU on the tenth floor. 

264
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:49,350
He has no pulse. Doctor, CPR, please.

265
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:09,400
Step back. 200 joules charged.

266
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:12,460
One, two, three. Shot!

267
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:15,250
One more time. 300 joules.

268
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:19,490
One, two, three. Shot!

269
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:22,950
360 joules.

270
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:25,730
One, two, three. Shot!

271
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:36,000
- Doctor!
 - This won't come off him!

272
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,610
A blackout?

273
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,360
 With the explosion of the PDB (power distribution board), 

274
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:32,010
 the five hundred or so households in the nearby area lost their electricity, causing much inconvenience. 

275
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:35,320
 The residents on the scene reported a man lying unconscious. 

276
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:39,710
 The police remain largely silent except to say they're investigating if the man's state was caused by the explosion. 

277
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:44,050
 Although the authorities involved claim a PDB isn't likely to explode,  

278
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:48,440
 to the discrediting of their claim, they're forming a special task force for an internal investigation. 

279
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,980
 The explosion caused all the nearby CCTVs to malfunction.
      

280
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:54,680
 Many reported their cell phones became inoperable. 

281
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:57,190
 I suddenly heard an explosion. 

282
00:26:57,190 --> 00:27:00,750
 When I came out startled, I saw the situation and a man lying unconscious.  

283
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:05,230
 So I tried to report it, but my cell phone did not work. 

284
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:06,620
 I'm positive my phone had been fully charged. 

285
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:09,920
 The number of service requests to nearby phone repair centers today alone 

286
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,790
 has reached hundreds.  

287
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:17,010
Yes, it's me.

288
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:23,800
Don't talk nonsense. How can a blood type be strange?

289
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:29,300
Well, listen.

290
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:34,430
If it's not human blood, are you saying we sent you a wrong blood sample?

291
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:40,800
Alright, I understand. I'm on my way there, so wait.

292
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:46,860
Careful, careful, everyone please be careful.

293
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:48,950
So that child appeared again?

294
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:52,810
Yes, we are doing our best to retrive him.

295
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:55,630
- The left side is too high. 
 - Yes.

296
00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:59,620
I heard quite a large area lost power. It means his functionality improved, correct?

297
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:02,310
That appears to be the case.

298
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:07,180
Director, this may be a great opportunity, but...

299
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:11,170
Oh, be careful. This time, the left is higher.

300
00:28:11,170 --> 00:28:14,650
You do realize this is the last chance, don't you?

301
00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:16,790
How could I not know that?

302
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:22,480
It's been a while since I've heard such a confident response from you.

303
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:26,480
This project should have been successful decades ago.

304
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:30,680
Do you realize how much time and money I wasted because that kid ran away?

305
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:33,640
Even God Himself would not give anyone such an ordeal.

306
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:37,220
He's in the hospital now, but I'll soon take him to the lab.

307
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:41,870
Rather than "I will do this or that," I would prefer to hear, "I have done this or that."

308
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:47,200
Do you know how many babies and pregnant women I've supplied you so that you can extract L.U.C.A. cells?

309
00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:54,960
Please, work as hard as I do. We've got to create the Age of Glory together, don't we?

310
00:28:54,960 --> 00:29:00,230
I'll make sure to collect Ji Oh this time.

311
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:03,770
You can go. I will await good news.

312
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:08,310
The left side, a bit higher.

313
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:10,300
The right side.

314
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:15,570
Glorious Age, my ass. You cult leader...

315
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,250
 Did you set the trap? 

316
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:36,030
 I did. Now I'm adding the noise to erase the images. 

317
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:49,680
Oh, hold on.

318
00:29:53,010 --> 00:29:55,090
Thank you.

319
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:04,180
Hey, I told you to rest. Why are you here?

320
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:06,490
What's going on in there?

321
00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:08,930
His heart stopped for a moment a while ago.

322
00:30:08,930 --> 00:30:12,010
They say only Jesus and the game of go can be resurrected.

323
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:13,830
I guess they're wrong.

324
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:17,380
Can I go in for a moment?

325
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:20,710
What for? He's not even awake.

326
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:22,590
I just need to.

327
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:25,180
Alright. Go in.

328
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:30,650
He's saved your life after all. Whether he's awake or not, you should go thank him.

329
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:32,610
Thank you.

330
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:45,600
  Intensive Care Unit
 Visiting not allowed 

331
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:10,100
We've met before, haven't we?

332
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:23,020
I clearly remember who you are now.

333
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:30,370
So you, too, have to get your memories back.

334
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:36,090
You have to remember what happened to my mom and dad.

335
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:54,540
They're transferring him to the ICU in the annex.

336
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:19,230
How do we get to the annex from here?

337
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:23,720
Go down to the lobby and past the storage room and the supply office. You'll see the passage to the annex.

338
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:26,070
Third floor, please.

339
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:27,590
Do you think we can ride with you?

340
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:29,250
This one's reserved for patients only.

341
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:33,880
You can take the regular elevator and meet us in the lobby.

342
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,440
Okay.

343
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:38,000
- Let's go, Gu Reum! 
- Okay.

344
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:44,110
Why don't you go ahead?

345
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:45,390
Hey, why? Come with us.

346
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:47,230
Hey, Gu Reum!

347
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:56,520
Don't you have a chart?

348
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:57,400
Pardon?

349
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:00,630
You know, those charts that nurses always have on them.

350
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:04,330
I'm not on rounds. I'm just transferring the patient, so I don't need a chart.

351
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:09,140
If a patient gets transferred, shouldn't his chart get transferred with him?

352
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,440
I'll meet you up at the ICU in the annex.

353
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:26,000
You can't take the elevator reserved for patients.

354
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,440
It'll only take a second. Besides, nobody's around.

355
00:33:33,290 --> 00:33:35,270
Get in then.

356
00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:43,380
 Runs on all floors (B3-10F) 

357
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:47,610
Aren't we going down to the lobby? Why did you press 3 for ground level?

358
00:33:47,610 --> 00:33:50,190
You won't shut up, will you?

359
00:34:11,990 --> 00:34:14,130
What are you people?

360
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:43,020
- Split up and find them! 
- Yes, sir! That damn kid!

361
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:04,210
Sorry.

362
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:16,080
Hey, Gu Reum!

363
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:35,500
 1st Prize 
7 successful heart transplant surgeries in a row  

364
00:37:50,850 --> 00:37:53,240
 Limited access to personnel only 

365
00:38:57,090 --> 00:39:00,240
Gu Reum! Hey, what's wrong?

366
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,890
What happened?

367
00:39:01,890 --> 00:39:04,320
I'm not sure. I've lost them.

368
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,970
Lost them? Lost who?

369
00:39:05,970 --> 00:39:10,540
The doctor, nurse and Ji Oh. All of them.

370
00:39:12,290 --> 00:39:13,740
Hey, I'm going to the security office.

371
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:16,710
You guys, close all the entrances and exits in the hospital and search the surroundings.

372
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:18,810
Set up checkpoints all over the surrounding area.

373
00:39:18,810 --> 00:39:21,050
Are you okay?

374
00:39:21,050 --> 00:39:23,760
Let's get going.

375
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:27,830
 Limited access to personnel only 

376
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:45,970
 Linen Room 

377
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:04,270
Gu Reum, what are you doing in there? Hurry, come!

378
00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:30,240
Damn it.

379
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:33,280
Damn.

380
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:24,040
Do you understand even if you look at it?

381
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:25,750
Didn't you tell me to look?

382
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:29,920
You wouldn't know, but that is the suspect's blood sent from the hospital.

383
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,770
But why can't you identify the blood type?

384
00:41:32,770 --> 00:41:35,370
Isn't this defective or something?

385
00:41:35,370 --> 00:41:37,750
It can't be as defective as you are.

386
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:38,990
The blood wasn't switched at any point?

387
00:41:38,990 --> 00:41:41,890
That couldn't have happened. But even if it did, we should get a blood type, right?

388
00:41:41,890 --> 00:41:43,200
So why is there no blood type?

389
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,560
I don't know if I can call it human blood.

390
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:47,260
So it's an animal's blood?

391
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:49,260
- No, not an animal.
 - Then what?

392
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:51,750
How can I explain this?

393
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:54,880
Say, the father's blood type is A, and the mother's is O. Then what is the blood type of their child?

394
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,250
A or O, of course.

395
00:41:56,250 --> 00:41:57,380
But what if the child is AB?

396
00:41:57,380 --> 00:42:00,290
Obviously not their biological child. How can an AB come from an A and an O?

397
00:42:00,290 --> 00:42:02,320
But that really happened.

398
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:05,730
The parents were A and O, but their son was AB.

399
00:42:05,730 --> 00:42:07,730
So everyone said he wasn't  their biological child.

400
00:42:07,730 --> 00:42:10,020
But a genetic test confirmed that he was their biological child.

401
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:14,290
- How?
 - The father's blood type wasn't  A, but Cis AB.

402
00:42:14,290 --> 00:42:19,970
It has characteristics of both A and B. A rare mutation that only exists in Korea and Japan.

403
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:23,950
So this is human blood.

404
00:42:23,950 --> 00:42:26,360
Its properties are a bit too different for me to say that.

405
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:30,040
Human or animal, there should be distinct blood properties matching its species, but there are none.

406
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:32,710
So it's human blood, but not human blood?

407
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:33,560
Right.

408
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:34,700
Are you joking with me?

409
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:37,080
- Can you do something for me?
 - What is it?

410
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:40,070
Let me see the owner of this blood. I will have to examine a few things.

411
00:42:40,070 --> 00:42:43,110
I can't. The process is complicated, and I don't know if he'll live or die.

412
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:45,080
What is it?

413
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:48,850
Does that make sense? How can someone near death run away?

414
00:42:50,830 --> 00:42:53,850
What are you saying? Did he run away? Or, was he abducted?

415
00:42:57,300 --> 00:43:01,640
Gu Reum, I'll take charge here. You guard the back gate with the other guys.

416
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:03,810
-   Yes, sir. 
 - Be careful.

417
00:43:03,810 --> 00:43:06,110
Let's go.

418
00:43:06,110 --> 00:43:08,060
Come this way.

419
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:11,760
Damn it, really.

420
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:23,090
 Police

431
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:40,230
It's me. The wall by the other side of the hospital.

432
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:50,070
What is this? Oh...

433
00:46:52,790 --> 00:46:55,290
Team Leader, he's headed towards Singi  Station.

434
00:46:55,290 --> 00:46:58,800
Hey, Gu Reum, just follow him. Don't take him on by yourself.

435
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:02,190
Mobilize everyone in the nearby police stations and set up checkpoints.

436
00:47:02,190 --> 00:47:05,540
Here we go.

437
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:19,220
He was near death, but he got up and ran away!

438
00:47:19,220 --> 00:47:21,820
You said his rate of recovery is two to three times faster than regular humans.

439
00:47:21,820 --> 00:47:23,550
He's exceeded the threshold.

440
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:27,920
What's the threshold?   What's his breaking point?

441
00:47:29,510 --> 00:47:31,660
That can't be calculated.

442
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:36,200
Feel free to calculate or speculate. But for now, can't you guess what the threshold may be?

443
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:39,810
An electric eel releases about 600 volts of electricity.

444
00:47:39,810 --> 00:47:42,960
It can release more, but it doesn't. Do you know why?

445
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:45,790
Because its body can't withstand the impact.

446
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:49,640
There is no animal that uses enough strength to destroy its own body.

447
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:51,620
That's instinct.

448
00:47:51,620 --> 00:47:54,410
But Ji Oh isn't an animal.

449
00:47:54,410 --> 00:47:56,000
He isn't human, either.

450
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,820
Ji Oh would've used all his power even if that meant his death.

451
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:05,600
With each repetition, he inadvertently kills the weak cells in him, preserving only the strong ones.

452
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:10,590
Likely, by now, he's burned up all his brain cells, too.

453
00:48:10,590 --> 00:48:14,330
So he probably doesn't remember who he is now.

454
00:48:40,350 --> 00:48:42,280
Excuse me. Sorry.

Team Leader, I can't reach Gu Reum on her cell.

465
00:50:28,140 --> 00:50:30,450
I'll scan the area with the guys. You go up to the situation room.

466
00:50:30,450 --> 00:50:31,460
Yes, sir.

467
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:33,270
You, follow me.

468
00:51:19,510 --> 00:51:22,550
 No Unauthorized Entry 

469
00:51:23,290 --> 00:51:24,450
I've been waiting for you.

470
00:51:24,450 --> 00:51:26,610
- Why? 
- Because I was curious.

471
00:51:26,610 --> 00:51:30,130
- Curious about what? 
- Your eyes.

472
00:51:30,130 --> 00:51:34,620
I wonder what horrible things I've done to you for you look at me like that.

473
00:51:34,620 --> 00:51:36,260
In what way do I look at you?

474
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:38,590
Like you seem glad to meet the one you want to kill.

475
00:51:38,590 --> 00:51:40,220
You got it.

476
00:51:40,220 --> 00:51:42,020
What have I done to you?

477
00:51:42,020 --> 00:51:47,900
That's what I want to ask you. It's what I wanted to know, so I've searched for you my entire life.

478
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:51,610
I waited only because I wanted to hear what you'd say.  I have nothing to tell you.

479
00:51:51,610 --> 00:51:54,690
I'll get going.  Don't follow me, or you'll get hurt.

480
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:58,020
Hey!

481
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:15,270
What happened to my mom and dad?

482
00:52:15,270 --> 00:52:17,400
What are you talking about?

483
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:20,100
My mom and my dad!

484
00:52:41,740 --> 00:52:44,810
Don't move. Don't move!

485
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:07,180
Get away!

486
00:55:11,170 --> 00:55:13,600
  Driving in Reverse Prohibited 

487
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:17,440
   Driving in Reverse Prohibited 

488
00:55:32,790 --> 00:55:35,790
   Driving in Reverse Prohibited 

489
00:55:48,020 --> 00:55:50,220
 Driving in Reverse Prohibited 

490
00:56:00,850 --> 00:56:04,120
I've confirmed her going down to the platform, but I can't find her anywhere.

491
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:06,360
Oh, and I just received a report from a conductor.

492
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:07,610
What report?

493
00:56:07,610 --> 00:56:11,930
They think someone is on the 11-3 train platform, but there is no camera, so we can't confirm it.

494
00:56:11,930 --> 00:56:13,880
11-3? Where is that?

495
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:17,010
It's an unused platform due to some architectural changes.

496
00:56:17,010 --> 00:56:18,500
It functions as the place where the trains rotate their routes.

497
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:20,420
So where is it?

498
00:56:20,420 --> 00:56:22,790
Well, I'll just go down and meet you.

499
00:56:22,790 --> 00:56:26,050
Why bother? You have to stay and watch the situation. Just explain it to me.

500
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:31,770
Team Leader, look behind the pole in front of you. See a grey door?

501
00:56:32,660 --> 00:56:34,550
Okay, got it.

502
00:56:49,860 --> 00:56:52,110
He's dead.

503
00:56:52,110 --> 00:56:54,480
So humiliating.

504
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:57,080
I think the police are here.

505
00:57:04,660 --> 00:57:06,430
Hey there!

506
00:57:09,110 --> 00:57:11,110
Mister.

507
00:57:11,110 --> 00:57:13,520
Are you the one who called?

508
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:15,060
Is this where you saw the person?

509
00:57:15,060 --> 00:57:18,530
Yes, I saw the person over there.

510
00:57:18,530 --> 00:57:20,610
No one ever comes down here.

511
00:57:20,610 --> 00:57:22,470
What is this?

512
00:57:24,230 --> 00:57:27,000
This looks like blood! Blood!

513
00:57:28,130 --> 00:57:31,070
I see a trail of blood. It's human blood.

514
00:57:31,070 --> 00:57:32,880
Looks like someone just got hit.

515
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:35,490
Did you hit someone with the train?

516
00:57:35,490 --> 00:57:38,790
No, no, no. There was a person.

517
00:57:38,790 --> 00:57:42,310
No, no. I don't know.

518
00:57:43,750 --> 00:57:47,480
Come to your senses, and block any trains from coming this way.

519
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:49,050
What are you waiting for? Hurry and search along the tracks.

520
00:57:49,050 --> 00:57:50,780
- Starting from over here.
 - Yes, sir.

521
00:57:50,780 --> 00:57:51,840
Do not erase anything down there.

522
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:53,210
- Du Cheol.
 - Yes?

523
00:57:53,210 --> 00:57:55,290
You've blocked the platform front and back, right?

524
00:57:55,290 --> 00:57:56,170
Yes.

525
00:57:56,170 --> 00:57:57,820
- And?
 - Yes?

526
00:57:57,820 --> 00:58:01,020
Hurry and find Gu Reum. Phones don't work down here.

527
00:58:02,510 --> 00:58:06,280
Would she have come down here? I told her to request assistance and wait.

528
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:08,270
But I'll go and see.

540
00:59:32,260 --> 00:59:33,350
 Is this possible? 

541
00:59:33,350 --> 00:59:35,600
 Modifying in so many different ways is impossible. 

542
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:37,090
 What if I won't go? 

543
00:59:37,090 --> 00:59:38,370
 Live like this for the rest of your life. 

544
00:59:38,370 --> 00:59:40,500
 Can he have the heart of a human? 

545
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:42,300
 This is the first time I've seen him rescue someone. 

546
00:59:42,300 --> 00:59:45,290
 Once we bring Ji Oh in, I'll give you one of his arms and put it on you.

 Do you think I killed them?

 What I saw was the devil. 

549
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:51,930
 I was human until I was called a monster. 

550
00:59:51,930 --> 00:59:55,220
 Even if I have to dig through your brain, I'll find out what happened for sure.

 A devil is inside that kid.

 Stop it. 

553
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:01,060
 Don't do it!
