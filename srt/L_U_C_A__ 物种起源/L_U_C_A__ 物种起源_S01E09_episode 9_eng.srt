 L.U.C.A.: The Beginning  

2
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:05,520
♫   Voice to me.  ♫

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,010
♫   Find tree.  ♫

4
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:14,050
♫  Please let me sleep on it,  ♫

5
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:18,040
♫   so I can breathe in.  ♫

6
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:30,150
 L.U.C.A.: The Beginning  

7
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:36,530
 This is a work of fiction. Any resemblance to actual names, places, organizations, religious references, and incidents is entirely coincidental.  

8
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:43,680
 The episode was filmed with adequate accommodations to ensure the safety and the emotional well-being of the infant and minor actors used. 

9
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,310
 Episode 9 

10
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:57,190


11
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:04,080
I've never been married, nor do I have a kid.

12
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,960
So I don't know what it feels like to be a parent.

13
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:12,100
So I can do anything.

14
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,680
If you even lay a hand on my baby, I'll kill you.

15
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,510
Are you confident you can do that?

16
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:22,950
Can you fight holding a baby?

17
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:26,630
Don't act up and just listen.

18
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:29,590
If you obey, you both can live.

19
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:42,870
Send him in.

20
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,230
I grabbed a few things I thought you might need.

21
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:04,130
These are diapers for the baby.

22
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:06,900
Some clothes for her.

23
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,620
And some toys.

24
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:12,480
- I heard babies need powder, too. So I bought some.
 - Team Captain.

25
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,730
- And the baby's father?
 - Come on, Team Captain.

26
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:20,270
What is all of this about?

27
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:24,550
- Hey, rookie. 
 - Don't call me that.

28
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:26,900
What are you, Team Captain? Just what kind of man are you?

29
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:29,550
Why bother asking when you already know everything?

30
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,430
I'm a policeman who catches criminals.

31
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:34,840
As a policeman now, whose orders are you following?

32
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,520
I don't know the answer to that either.

33
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,910
Because I have so many bosses above me.

34
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:43,220
Where is Ji Oh?

35
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:51,860
- A car was towed in from an accident a few days ago, right?
 - Yeah.

36
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:54,840
It was the car Ha Yeong Jae and his wife were in. Your parents, right?

37
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:58,230
It was Detective Yu Cheol I called.

38
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:01,170
but why did you and that guy show up?

39
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:03,550
Is Detective Yu Cheol in cahoots with you, too?

40
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:07,110
Did you just say, "in cahoots" to a police officer? We are a team.   You know you were on the team too.

41
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:08,810
That's not what I'm talking about now.

42
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:10,450
How is that important?

43
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:12,680
Of course, it is.

44
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:16,300
He was my father who went missing for over 20 years. Then he surfaced out of nowhere.

45
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:19,450
- Whether that is real or not— 
 - It's real.

46
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:23,410
They  really  are your mom and dad.

47
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:27,810
They were accidentally found by a hiker. And as soon as it came on the news, you called.

48
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:32,360
Before other police made a move, we retrieved them.

49
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:37,360
"We?" Who's we?

50
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,540
Where is Ji Oh?

51
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:51,490
He's what you're really after.  Having found my parents is a lie, isn't it?

52
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:53,770
Didn't you fabricate everything to use me as a bait to get to Ji Oh?

53
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:55,730
You wanted to catch the killer.

54
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:58,800
Ji Oh's the killer. When you know that well, why are you like this?

55
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:02,640
No. That can't be.

56
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:13,900
Is it  that you don't want to believe, or you can't?

57
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:16,910
Is there any reason why Ji Oh can't be the killer?

58
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:19,960
Why are you being like this? Is Ji Oh the father of your baby?

59
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,460
- No.
 - If not, why?

60
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:27,380
I said no. It just isn't.

61
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:42,700
Take care of this. It was difficult to take this out of the evidence storage room.

62
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:45,920
Don't think about anything else except for your family.

63
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:16,880
That incident. No, that  accident .

64
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,100
Can you confirm they were indeed my parents?

65
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,640
- Their IDs were found. 
 - Besides that.

66
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:26,880
What else? Do you want to see their remains in person?

67
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,200
A DNA test.

68
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:34,520
If they're really my mom and dad, we can talk again at that point.

69
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,730
I don't want to say anything right now.

70
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:38,680
Alright.

71
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:43,820
Let's. I imagine how upset you must be. You've got to get your questions answered, too.

72
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:53,030
Gu Reum wants a DNA test.

73
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:56,860
Tell her we will kill her baby. Then she will listen.

74
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:59,920
Nothing good comes out from the desperation of a person getting cornered.

75
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:03,460
With just one phone call, the test results won't even take a full day.

76
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:06,890
She is making things so difficult.

77
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:20,050
Here. Go,  get the test.

78
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:55,130
Did you give her the family photo?

79
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:56,440
Yes.

80
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:00,510
What did she say when she saw the photo? She asked for a DNA test. Right?

81
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,490
She did.

82
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:05,590
She's so predictable.

83
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:08,850
Whenever any human remains were found, she would ask Dr. Oh at the National Forensic Service

84
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:13,420
to compare DNA samples. I'm sure she will do the same thing now.

85
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,310
I brought this for you.
  Collection from the crime scene 

86
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,820
Why did you pluck so much hair?

87
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,750
I know, right?

88
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:28,390
Here is the DNA test result.

89
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:31,300
Blood relationship confirmed with a probability of 99.999%.

90
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,980
Was this already prepared?

91
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:36,480
Give that to her sometime tomorrow morning, and convince her

92
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:39,130
that Ji Oh killed her parents.

93
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:42,480
You've got to crush her soul in order to make her a slave.

94
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:48,290
I will do my best, but Gu Reum no longer trusts me, after the incident.

95
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:51,950
Should I give you a piece of advice on how to cheat people?

96
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:57,130
Before deceiving someone else, deceive yourself first.

97
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:02,530
If you pack a lie with sincerity, it becomes true.

98
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:06,350
Perhaps, shouldn't you do this yourself?

99
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,720
People like me do not work on the front line.

100
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:13,340
Does your brain do the work? No, your hands and feet do.

101
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:26,870
Yes, Manager Sung.

102
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:30,620
Why would the Internal Affairs call me? That's just scary.

103
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:42,000
Vicious bastards.

104
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:49,360
This is the right place.

105
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,330
Ji Oh?

106
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:59,490
Where did he go?

107
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:08,070
Jeez, you startled me!

108
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:11,450
I told you not to pop up like this.

109
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:15,330
What, no one's here. When there's a decent neighborhood,

110
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:18,360
why did you call me out to a place like this?

111
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:23,650
What's wrong? Did something happen?

112
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:26,020
So she paid the hospital bill  before she left?

113
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:31,680
Then, doesn't it mean that she left you, and was  not kidnapped?

114
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,090
To be honest, this isn't the first time we got abandoned.

115
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:40,090
Good riddance. When a woman or a cat leaves you, they say you shouldn't bother looking for them.

116
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:43,330
No. I think she was forced to go because of the baby.

117
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:48,120
Don't use your logic as you think this through. Use your emotions.

118
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,490
Have you ever had the hope of living like a decent human being?

119
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:55,920
I have. But fat chance in this life. I shall give it a try in the next one.

120
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:04,130
I met Gu Reum and even had a baby with her.

121
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:07,920
For the first time in my life, I have the hope and the desire to live. And courage, too.

122
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,780
Can you just forget her and the baby? The guys are merciless.

123
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:14,460
You could die, you punk.

124
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:16,760
It doesn't matter now.

125
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:27,890
The guy with the  black hand, the one who looks vicious. Is he with the detectives?

126
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:31,540
I'm not sure if all of them are. But the Team Captain is, for sure.

127
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:38,190
He was trying to kill Gu Reum then.

128
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:42,820
I think I can get to their organization once I get that Team Captain.

129
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:44,910
I'm going to start by waiting in front of the police station.

130
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:47,560
Will you do a stakeout just as a police would in front of the police station?

131
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,990
To catch a police officer?

132
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:51,680
- Let me borrow your car. 
 - No.

133
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,190
- I'll repay you. 
 - I said no.

134
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:55,200
- I promise I'll repay. 
 - No. Absolutely not.

135
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,860
Your face is known to every cop.

136
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:01,690
What's the point of a stakeout? You might as well turn yourself in. You're crazy.

137
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:04,540
That's the only way.

138
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:07,050
You have me, you bastard.

139
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:11,030
They were the cops who barged into my house, looking for you last time.

140
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:14,950
I know their faces more or less. Whether it's a stakeout or whatever,

141
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:18,530
I'll do it.

142
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:20,430
I'll be putting you in danger for nothing.  I can't.

143
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:22,230
Let's just say you owe me one.

144
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:28,230
Pay me with the kind of outlandish money you get when you win a lottery.

145
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,670
Don't you remember saying this to me before?

146
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:38,870
We wouldn't have lived as we did if only we had one person who helped us.

147
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:44,460
To be honest, I want to see your daughter. We have nothing, much less a family or whatnot.

148
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:50,370
Besides, I'm her uncle. Uncle, you know.

149
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,830
Thank you, Won Yi.

150
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,460
Hey, Ji Oh.

151
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:02,810
But I won't even think twice about selling you off, when I get caught or in danger.

152
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:05,640
After all, my life comes way before friendship or loyalty.

153
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,760
Hey, don't. Let go of my hand.

154
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:11,660
- Don't do anything dangerous. 
 - Okay.

155
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:17,720
Anyhow, don't you even have the slightest inclination to forget everything and live alone?

156
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:22,170
Well, I brought it up since you're alone, anyway.

157
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,840
Why am I alone? I had you all along.

158
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:36,100
Oh gross. Don't say a thing like that. You're grossing me out.

159
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:40,930
When I find a perfect place for kidnapping,

160
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:45,740
I'll call you. So lay low somewhere near me and stay invisible.

161
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:47,470
Alright.

162
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:12,420
What is this?

163
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,530
What's this picture?

164
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:20,940
A new person in charge. I believe you two have met.

165
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:28,180
What do you think you two ladies are doing? Turning things over to her?

166
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:32,940
Doesn't look like you've done anything significant enough for a turnover.

167
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:38,560
Hey, Manager Jeong, who taught you? Don't you have manners?

168
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,730
Well, I'm not a manager.

169
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:44,980
I was promoted. We're in the same rank now.

170
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:51,250
It must be wonderful to be an auditor.

171
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:55,770
Whose weakness did you step on to get promoted this time?

172
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:58,120
Your weakness, Sir.

173
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:03,440
Your list of dirty laundry was just endless. Apparently, you've lived your life quite recklessly.

174
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:09,520
- Hey, Manager Jeong—
 - Correction. Director.

175
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:15,640
Anyone who climbs as high as you have at your age goes blind with their ego.

176
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:20,670
Get cocky all you want. But watch whom you're dealing with.

177
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,460
Should I tell you why I'm, say, "cocky"?

178
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:29,440
- Should I start with Ha Yeong Jae, the father of the  detective?
 - Dare you, Punk.

179
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:35,940
Ha Yeong Jae joined in the research, believing it was to engineer humans free of diseases.

180
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:38,440
But that wasn't Ryu Jung Kwon's intention.

181
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:43,200
With the pretext of advancing the human race, he created a dangerous hybrid known as Ji Oh.

182
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,690
To stop the research, he took Ji Oh away with him and contacted another team at the National Intelligence Service.

183
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:53,480
 Why are you doing this to me? Why? Stop! 

184
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:59,410
 - He's the child I told you about. 
  -  Won't you regret this? 

185
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:04,590
 As you promised, I need your assurance for my family's safety and funds for us to settle abroad. 

186
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:07,150
 Ha Yeong Jae was a whistle blower.  

187
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:12,160
Officially, he's supposed to have been killed in an accident on the day of his rendezvous with NIS.

188
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:18,250
 Don't. Please don't.  

189
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,210
Was that really how Ha Yeong Jae died?

190
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:42,650
Of course, his vehicle and ID were found a few days ago.

191
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:51,160
Come on, Director.  You  killed him. Such a good man he was.

192
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:09,160
 The engine hasn't even cooled yet. Check out the surroundings. 

193
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:07,050
 Where did you take the goods? 

194
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:10,240
 Stop it. Anything further than this is a sin. 

195
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,820
 Where is that kid? Damn it. 

196
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:15,010
 Stop. You must. 

197
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:20,210
 I have your wife, and I'll kill her if you don't fess up. 

198
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:22,930
 Do you want to make your daughter an orphan? 

199
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:24,940
 Damn you, Bastard! 

200
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:27,540
 Seriously, you- 

201
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,910
 Hey! 

202
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:51,320
So, do you think you got me with what little you have on me?

203
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,840
Hardly.

204
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:58,910
The problem isn't you committed a murder, but you made a mistake.

205
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:02,590
Our organization can't afford an error.

206
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:05,930
Besides that, regretfully,  there are many more.

207
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:09,900
- Hey, how dare you now—
 - Take good notes.

208
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,330
Number one.

209
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:17,010
Stop at once what you're up to. We're aware  you fabricated the circumstance of Ha Yeong Jae's death.

210
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:19,390
Number two.

211
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:24,480
Retire all the kids whom you turned into slaves  by framing them for murder.

212
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,790
Especially, Team Leader Lee Son.

213
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:39,660
I'm offering this on the condition that you'll acquiesce.

214
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:45,050
I bent over backwards to get you this. So live the rest of your life happily and in comfort.

215
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:47,680
Are you telling me to go away with a few dimes?

216
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:50,550
I remind you, I've dedicated my whole life to this project.

217
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,600
Do you think money can take care of everything?

218
00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:00,790
Money can. But we don't waste money on traitors.

219
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:07,230
At your age, getting audited or terminated or arrested is an ugly thing to face.

220
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:11,060
 Letter of Resignation  

221
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:13,850
 Non-Disclosure Agreement on Security Measures for Retirees  

222
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:15,670
We've given you a great deal of consideration.

223
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:20,170
Submit your letter of resignation. And why not enjoy your hiking in the mountains?

224
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:22,320
You, seriously—

225
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:27,710
Inside or outside of the organization, you won't find anyone on your side.

226
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,500
I suppose three days will be enough to get your desk cleaned out.

227
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,510
Sign that letter of resignation and bring it to me.

228
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,400
Did you hear?

229
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:12,820
Will he do as he's told to?

230
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:17,930
A member is nothing without the support of their organization. He'll be submissive.

231
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:20,420
Then he'll set free the Team Leader, won't he?

232
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:23,820
Of course. And in three days, all will be over.

233
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:28,020
Of course, we'll come to a clean end once you bring me the fertilized eggs.

234
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:31,810
I will, so long as I make certain Team Leader Lee got his freedom.

235
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:34,000
Do you like the man that much?

236
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,400
When all is over, go with him, have a baby, and live happily ever after.

237
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,160
I don't wish anything as big as that.

238
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,900
Men are simple.

239
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:45,060
When they see women, they think about women. When they see babies, then babies.

240
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:48,530
He'll untimately follow what you show him.

241
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,360
What, Darling?

242
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:30,760
 You're hoping I'm the one who killed your parents, aren't you? 

243
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:33,660
 Because all will be over if I'm the murderer. 

244
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:37,040
 If I'm not, that means you've got to keep looking. 

245
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:25,660
Don't you think kidnapping a cop is a little too much?

246
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:27,440
I'm heading there now.

247
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,350
 No, no. Wait. 

248
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:32,890
 I'll let you know if he goes somewhere good to be kidnapped. Hanging up now.  

249
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:38,410
No traces of fire, yet the seats all melted and the wiring inside burnt as well.

250
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:43,680
The NFS suspects  an enormous voltage of electricity ran through the vehicle, but they aren't sure.

251
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:47,180
Because they can't know who's capable of releasing that amount of electricity.

252
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:51,000
Where is Ji Oh?

253
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:59,510
I'll catch him for you. You've got to avenge the blood of your parents.

254
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,240
 Report of DNA Test Result  

255
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,160
Is everything here for real?

256
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,930
You're seeing it with your own eyes. Why can't you believe?

257
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:09,390
They framed me as a murderer to perfection.

258
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:14,700
They even created an overseas bank account I didn't have. This, too, could've been easily forged.

259
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,620
Then ask.

260
00:23:17,410 --> 00:23:19,860
Ask Ji Oh when you see him.

261
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:21,860
I asked him already.

262
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,680
He said he didn't, for sure.

263
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:28,680
Did you ever see a criminal who admits he is, without denying it first?

264
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:35,870
Ji Oh isn't like normal people. It's not just a few people he killed.

265
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:40,890
Gu Reum.

266
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:48,950
If you hold out longer,  you might put your baby in danger.

267
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:50,830
Don't threaten me. It won't work.

268
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:53,700
Who is important to you  now?

269
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,780
Your baby, or Ji Oh?

270
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:58,950
Why are you holding out like this?

271
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:02,050
It's not that I'm holding out.

272
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:05,850
If, indeed, Ji Oh did that—

273
00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:08,540
What if he did? Then it's simple, isn't it?

274
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:12,270
Call him. Tell him to come. I'll watch your back.

275
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:16,340
If you want, you can even punish him yourself. Isn't that what you want?

276
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:19,260
Isn't it?

277
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:23,940
Then what is it? Does Ji Oh mean something to you?

278
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:36,780
Is Ji Oh the father of the baby?

279
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:49,640
My, he is.

280
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:59,350
What were you thinking? With the guy who killed your parents,

281
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:03,050
you dared to have a child?

282
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:29,770
 Spiritual Leader 

283
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:32,680
Yes, Leader.

284
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:37,300
Here, right now?

285
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:46,220
Yes, I got it.

286
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,560
What do you mean?

287
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:54,050
It's exactly as I said. I'll excuse myself from this task.

288
00:25:54,050 --> 00:25:55,370
Says who?

289
00:25:55,370 --> 00:26:00,440
The Spiritual Leader called and said you'd be resigning in two days, and I shouldn't work with you.

290
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,700
Is there something going on between you two?

291
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,530
So you won't listen to me, but her?

292
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:08,880
Am I not the child of the Spiritual Leader?

293
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:13,750
How much did you tell that cult leader? I hope you didn't bring up Gu Reum, did you?

294
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:17,100
I heard you would also quit the NFS (National Forensic Service).

295
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:21,880
It'll be better for you to do nothing and live quietly in your retirement.

296
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:24,760
Don't contact me anymore.

297
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:30,450
Oh, one more. Let go of Gu Reum already.

298
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:34,510
There's nothing more for you to get out from her. Stop harassing her.

299
00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:53,320
How's Gu Reum?

300
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:57,700
She's still holding out, but looks like she'll soon break down.

301
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,420
Okay.

302
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:02,550
Is there any problem?

303
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:08,700
Smart, cruel kids. Gather them up as many as you can.

304
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:11,050
What's the target?

305
00:27:11,050 --> 00:27:13,830
The mountain villa and the lab.

306
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:18,470
Clean up everyone in the villa, and burn down the church and the lab, too.

307
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:21,710
By cleaning up, to what extent, do you mean?

308
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:23,930
Kill them all.

309
00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:26,620
All of them. Don't leave a single trace behind.

310
00:27:27,670 --> 00:27:29,580
Go there straight away.

311
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:38,010
I will, tomorrow.

312
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:40,970
Gathering the kids can be done in no time. But gaining access

313
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:44,620
and cleaning up the mess is something  I need to think about for a day or so.

314
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,980
Hurry up as much as possible.

315
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:50,310
I'll circulate the flyers.

316
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:53,600
We don't know who may show up. Move Gu Reum to another room.

317
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,580
Who's coming?

318
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:59,080
That detective just turned his back on me.

319
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:02,600
Going forward, it's war.

320
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:10,170
Who's side are you on?

321
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:14,640
Pardon?

322
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:19,570
Never mind the others. You stay on my side till the end.

323
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:24,600
What about you, Director?

324
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,840
I'm on our side.

325
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:34,330
It's almost over. Let's put our fate on the line.

326
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:57,660
Auntie, a bottle of soju, please.

327
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:59,530
Okay.

328
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:06,260
 Grilled pork belly, large bowl of kimchi stew 

329
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,370
He's just got into a tavern.

330
00:29:13,370 --> 00:29:18,380
Nobody's here. The detective's  alone. Isn't this an opportunity?

331
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:32,840
Ji Oh, hurry up.

332
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:39,380
Ji Oh, why aren't you here already?

333
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:42,590
- Won Yi.
- Jeez, you scared me.

334
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:46,080
Hey, I told you not to creep up behind me like this.

335
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:50,010
- What about the car?
- At the end of the alley.

336
00:29:50,010 --> 00:29:51,930
Okay, good.

337
00:29:51,930 --> 00:29:55,280
First, you go in and get the detective by his collar.

338
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:58,470
Then shoot him with your electricity. That should knock him out.

339
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:00,660
Then I'll go right in,

340
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:04,600
and say, "Sir, what's wrong, why did you drink so much?"

341
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,740
and I'll carry him out on my back.

342
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:10,180
Then I'll take him to the car and lay him nicely in the back seat.

343
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:14,120
If we put him in the trunk, people will get suspicious right away. Got it?

344
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:18,150
You stay out of this now.

345
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:20,540
I'm so grateful that you've come this far with me.

346
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:23,020
Shut up, you bastard. What are you going to do alone?

347
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:26,470
I'll use the brains. You just use your electricity.

348
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:28,200
- Follow me.
- Hey!

349
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,320
We've got to finish this sometime today.

350
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:33,100
Do you know how scary it is to trail someone?

351
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:36,260
I've peed twelve times already, you bastard.

352
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:50,820
Soju's the best.

353
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:52,830
Are you here already?

354
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:00,540
Damn, what a fright. There's a whole lot of them.

355
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:03,290
Look at me. I've got the goosebumps all over.

356
00:31:03,290 --> 00:31:05,510
- That's the guy I was looking for.
- Who?

357
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:07,770
The one in the very front.

358
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:12,080
You mean the one who looks like a hunk of a cave man?

359
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:16,180
Let's quit here for now. Today isn't the day, I should think.

360
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:18,570
Wait a minute. Let me think.

361
00:31:18,570 --> 00:31:20,640
I told you. You don't do the thinking.

362
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:26,170
Anyhow,  I've seen the face of the Team Captain. I'll set up another day.

363
00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:29,610
Okay. Let's do that. Thanks

364
00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:32,730
Of course, you should be thankful.

365
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:36,850
I'll pay you back all that I owe you for the rest of my life.

366
00:31:36,850 --> 00:31:39,270
Hey, what's up? You're grossing me out.

367
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:41,270
I'm so happy that you're my friend.

368
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:43,440
Yeah, I'm happy, too.

369
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,770
Hey, hey. No, Ji Oh. No.

370
00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:02,980
 Narae Sculpting  

371
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:04,810
Are you having a third child?

372
00:32:04,810 --> 00:32:06,280
No.

373
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:08,960
Are you getting a divorce?

374
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,540
It's not that either.

375
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:14,330
Then why did you call us out? We have no money to eat out like this.

376
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:15,120
I'm buying.

377
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,550
Exactly, why are you buying?

378
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:21,590
Because of Gu Reum.

379
00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:28,530
Sir. Sir.

380
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:30,990
Talking about Gu Reum is banned.

381
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:36,050
I thought about it for a few days. She was the youngest in our team.

382
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:42,950
Stop. She assaulted the Team Captain and took his gun. He suffered enough already.

383
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:46,260
-I know that—
-If you know, then stop. Enough.

384
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:48,420
Gu Reum called.

385
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:50,820
Really? When?

386
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:55,850
A few days ago. I tracked the call. Turned out she called from an ob-gyn ward.

387
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:58,210
Is she working there now?

388
00:32:58,210 --> 00:32:59,220
She had a baby.

389
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:03,020
-Who?
-Gu Reum, of course.

390
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:08,850
I visited the ob-gyn ward, and it was Gu Reum indeed.

391
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:11,420
Since she's a fugitive, she changed her name too.

392
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:16,580
She had the kind of insurance for foreigners, so I visited the multi-cultural center and realized they left the country last year.

393
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:19,200
She forged an ID of another. Did you track the source?

394
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:24,750
No, but something's strange. I think she was kidnapped.

395
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:26,650
Stop it.

396
00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:30,620
It isn't a case that belongs to us anyway.

397
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:36,790
Also, when you got that call from Gu Reum, you should've reported it to me first.

398
00:33:36,790 --> 00:33:38,710
Do you want a reprimand?

399
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:41,060
I'm saying Gu Reum was kidnapped.

400
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:45,390
Her husband didn't bother reporting and vanished. Don't you think it strange?

401
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:48,200
Didn't I tell you not to use the word, 'strange'?

402
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:53,410
Then it's suspicious, isn't it?

403
00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:57,360
I went to Gu Reum's house. Look at this. This is what I found.

404
00:33:59,890 --> 00:34:02,490
What's this? Is it burnt?

405
00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:08,570
No. Don't you get that feel of  the electric sizzle from before?

406
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:11,020
His name was Ji Oh, was it?

407
00:34:11,890 --> 00:34:14,000
Stop talking nonsense.

408
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,920
Write up a report, and get your hands off this. I'll hand it over to the team in charge.

409
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:22,250
Team Captain, something is strange. Isn't it?

410
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:23,420
Put that away.

411
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:25,660
There's really something fishy going on here.

412
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:29,960
It's got to be us if anyone's to catch Gu Reum or help her.

413
00:34:33,450 --> 00:34:35,650
It is Ji Oh, Sunbae.

414
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:44,830
Team Captain.

415
00:34:48,090 --> 00:34:49,990
Catch him.

416
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:56,540
-You, Bastard!
-Stop right there!

417
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:58,170
Hey!

418
00:34:58,170 --> 00:35:00,880
To the right! To the right!

419
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:08,590
Wait, wait.

420
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:11,380
Hey, don't cause problems.  Just come with us quietly.

421
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:16,090
The rest of you, stay out of this. You, let's talk for a second.

422
00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:19,340
We're a big fan of talking things out. Come with us and talk.

423
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:21,460
Be a good boy and listen to me.

424
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:24,580
Do they know what kind of a person you really are?

425
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:28,200
What are you talking about?

426
00:35:29,450 --> 00:35:31,360
Get him quickly!

427
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:22,130
Where is Gu Reum?

428
00:36:52,330 --> 00:36:54,690
Did you forget the basic rules?

429
00:36:54,690 --> 00:36:57,230
A runaway should never stand by a window.

430
00:36:57,230 --> 00:36:59,290
I thought maybe.

431
00:36:59,290 --> 00:37:02,750
That way, I thought I might see you if you came looking for me.

432
00:37:10,850 --> 00:37:14,000
Since when did you know that I was here?

433
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:20,190
Why haven't you killed me already? Getting past this level of security is nothing for you.

434
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:22,000
The research data and the fertilized eggs?

435
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,190
Is that what's important right now?

436
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:25,870
That's the reason we became what we are today.

437
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:32,330
We killed and did all sorts of bad things. But we failed to protect ourselves because we were busy protecting them.

438
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:39,630
Everyone here will die tomorrow. Run away.

439
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:41,720
-What do you mean?
-It's just as I said.

440
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:45,410
Nothing like that would happen. Director Kim was pushed out.

441
00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:48,370
I'm warning you. Run away.

442
00:37:48,370 --> 00:37:51,190
If you see me tomorrow, you'll die.

443
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:53,670
Did you come here to tell me that?

444
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:59,350
Then come with me. We can run away together.

445
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:03,540
Leave here today.

446
00:38:04,430 --> 00:38:08,460
Does your arm mean that much to you?

447
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:11,830
You could forget about that arm and just live with me.

448
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:17,620
Do I really mean nothing to you, Team Leader?

449
00:38:23,570 --> 00:38:29,820
If I go, Director Kim will hunt you down even if he has to hire someone else for that.

450
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:34,150
The only way you can live is for me to continue working for them.

451
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:37,260
Then we can die together.

452
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:39,660
Live for yourself.

453
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:43,550
Don't live for me.

454
00:38:43,550 --> 00:38:47,000
I've warned you. I'm leaving now.

455
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:50,720
Hey, I think this is the first time

456
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:55,320
we are talking close, face-to-face.

457
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:58,350
You're on the same side with those guys who took Gu Reum, right?

458
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:09,620
Why didn't you bind me up?

459
00:40:12,310 --> 00:40:17,960
It's because you think you can easily beat me. Is that it?

460
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:31,760
What are you talking about? No call-backs? Are you messing with me?

461
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:35,030
There has been an order not to respond to your calls.

462
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:37,590
They are the guys  I  use. Who ordered them, but me?

463
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:39,520
You should find that out yourself.

464
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:44,630
I can't get in touch with Team Leader Choi or the detective. And the organization is at a full stop.

465
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,370
What is going on, Sir?

466
00:40:56,360 --> 00:41:00,180
What about you? Did you hear anything from them?

467
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:03,940
They contacted me and said I could stop working for you.

468
00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:09,080
And?

469
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:14,010
I don't intend on living out the rest of my life, getting shots for this arm.

470
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:16,630
Tae Oh has decided to stay, too.

471
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:22,250
If we can catch Ji Oh, we can strike up a deal with some people in Japan. The deal is worth tens of billions.

472
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:24,420
You and I will be rich together.

473
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:27,060
I'm not in this for money.

474
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:33,990
I'll fix your arm. All you need is regenerated cells once they're extracted, right?

475
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:47,790
Did you get some rest?

476
00:41:47,790 --> 00:41:49,830
Did you eat?

477
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:55,810
Gu Reum's all grown up. You've become a mom, too.

478
00:41:55,810 --> 00:41:58,440
Who are you?

479
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:02,820
I work for the government. I got your father a job.

480
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:04,980
I asked who you were.

481
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:06,720
Get me a cup of coffee.

482
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,670
Coffee?

483
00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:11,360
What's your deal?

484
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:14,490
You know who Ryu Jung Kwon is, right?

485
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:18,330
I saw his name written  on the wall in your living room.

486
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:23,590
Please let me go. I don't know anything.

487
00:42:23,590 --> 00:42:26,430
Then I'll tell you.

488
00:42:26,430 --> 00:42:34,150
Dr. Ryu was arrested for embezzling research funds and illegally collecting egg cells.

489
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:40,300
He got released after about a year and a half. A flurry of overseas calls began coming in.

490
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:42,140
Our company thought about it carefully.

491
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:46,010
It was an unethical  technology, but it'd benefit our nation.

492
00:42:46,010 --> 00:42:51,690
Around that time, we were approached by a strange organization called The Institute of Science and Progressive Creation.

493
00:42:51,690 --> 00:42:54,340
What is the place you just referred to as "Our Company"?

494
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:56,360
National Intelligence Service.

495
00:42:57,750 --> 00:43:01,730
I figured it is a cult group, so it could assist us in safeguarding secrets.

496
00:43:01,730 --> 00:43:04,820
You can't just conduct experiments on the human body.

497
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:12,090
We funded their first research and guarded the personal information of the researchers and their safety.

498
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:18,960
We also supported their growth. And your father joined the organization as Ryu Jung Kwon's partner around that time.

499
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:25,390
The two collaborated and  created a monster.

500
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:28,750
Where is Gu Reum?

501
00:43:33,970 --> 00:43:36,050
Why did you do that?

502
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:40,410
What did you intend to do?

503
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:48,150
To a poor girl who lost her parents out of all people, why a monster like you—

504
00:43:48,150 --> 00:43:50,350
I'm not a monster.

505
00:43:57,980 --> 00:44:00,050
Where is Gu Reum?

506
00:44:02,970 --> 00:44:05,770
Are you saying it was my father who made Ji Oh?

507
00:44:07,210 --> 00:44:09,340
Don't lie to me.

508
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:14,540
Guess why his name is Ji Oh.

509
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:21,250
DNA combination model Z-series, prototype number 0. 0, Z0.

510
00:44:21,250 --> 00:44:23,030
Z1, Z2.

511
00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:27,310
That's how the numbering went. Z1 and Z2 died whereas Z0 alone survived.

512
00:44:27,310 --> 00:44:29,630
That became his name.

513
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:38,070
When Ha Yeong Jae took Ji Oh with him, Ji Oh exploded in the car.

514
00:44:38,070 --> 00:44:42,450
You know that when he's nervous or angry, he emitts the blue rays.

515
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:48,740
You've got to go away.

516
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:51,770
That's how Gu Reum lives.

517
00:44:51,770 --> 00:44:53,540
Just leave.

518
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:56,450
Even if I have to kill you, I'll make you talk.

519
00:45:08,730 --> 00:45:13,530
It was those blue rays that killed your father.

520
00:45:13,530 --> 00:45:15,600
Your mother too.

521
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:19,480
That can't be.

522
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:26,110
Ji Oh said my father adored him.

523
00:45:27,170 --> 00:45:28,850
What you're telling me is all a lie.

524
00:45:28,850 --> 00:45:33,230
is that what Ji Oh said? That Ha Yeong Jae adored him?

525
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:38,810
Right, that's what it comes down to.

526
00:45:38,810 --> 00:45:43,150
Your father adored Ji Oh like his own son.

527
00:45:43,150 --> 00:45:47,860
It's a given when you're loved, you repay that love.

528
00:45:49,050 --> 00:45:54,820
But Ji Oh didn't. Do you know why he didn't?

529
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:58,790
Because he isn't human.

530
00:46:00,690 --> 00:46:03,550
Last chance. If you don't talk, you die.

531
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:16,670
He was born through genetic engineering.  The half of him is an animal.

532
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:20,520
There's a saying in  Myeongsimbogam  the ancient book of ethics for children.

533
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:24,500
 "Sugong zeokhwa ingong zeoksa." 

534
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:30,030
An animal cornered attacks; a man cornered lies.

535
00:46:30,030 --> 00:46:33,690
That's precisely what Ji Oh did. He attacked your father.

536
00:46:33,690 --> 00:46:37,040
And he lied to you.

537
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:41,910
Was it really Ji Oh who did that to my mom and dad?

538
00:46:46,050 --> 00:46:48,770
If he were human, he couldn't have.

539
00:46:50,370 --> 00:46:51,610
You know it, too.

540
00:46:51,610 --> 00:46:56,370
With Ji Oh's ability, he had enough in him to kill even an adult in one fell swoop.

541
00:47:02,030 --> 00:47:04,220
Think about when you were a child.

542
00:47:04,220 --> 00:47:08,900
How did you survive alone without knowing whether you mom and dad were alive or dead?

543
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:15,760
Your daughter's destiny will be like yours. Are you going to make her like you?

544
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:17,840
Handing her over to some adoption agency,

545
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:22,710
and making non-existent any records of her, even about to which country she was shipped off isn't what I want to do.

546
00:47:23,790 --> 00:47:27,790
Just call in Ji Oh here. That'll solve everything.

547
00:47:27,790 --> 00:47:30,830
You'll be cleared of the false accusation that brands you as a murderer.

548
00:47:30,830 --> 00:47:34,330
I'll support you so that you can go and live comfortably with your baby.

549
00:47:34,330 --> 00:47:39,680
It really is Ji Oh. It's him who did that, right?

550
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:46,730
What do you think?

551
00:47:50,830 --> 00:47:54,450
Give me your cell phone. I'll call him.

552
00:47:58,490 --> 00:48:00,870
My heart aches, too.

553
00:48:07,770 --> 00:48:09,750
Oh, wait a sec. 
 Team Captain, Choi Jin Hwan 

554
00:48:11,270 --> 00:48:14,260
What's up? You said you wouldn't contact me anymore.

555
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:16,050
Do you have Gu Reum?

556
00:48:16,050 --> 00:48:19,550
- Who is this? 
 - The one you're looking for.

557
00:48:20,780 --> 00:48:23,960
- Let go of Gu Reum. 
 - Hey, it's been a while.

558
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:25,880
Good to hear from you.

559
00:48:26,670 --> 00:48:28,500
Have you been well?

560
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:30,790
Well, well.

561
00:48:32,250 --> 00:48:33,860
Is this really Ji Oh?

562
00:48:33,860 --> 00:48:36,540
Where is Gu Reum?

563
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:39,510
- I'm taking good care of her. 
 - Where are you right now?

564
00:48:39,510 --> 00:48:44,850
Ji Oh, apparently, you're going through something like this for the first time. You're going about it all wrong.

565
00:48:44,850 --> 00:48:48,290
 You've got to ask first whether Gu Reum and the baby are safe. 

566
00:48:48,290 --> 00:48:52,350
Then next, you ask what I want and where you should come. Don't you think?

567
00:48:52,350 --> 00:48:55,490
You all die if you touch my Gu Reum and baby.

568
00:48:55,490 --> 00:48:58,870
Should I go ahead and kill the mother and the baby?

569
00:48:58,870 --> 00:49:02,620
Don't think that you've won just because you stumbled on my number.

570
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:06,170
Don't get cheeky with me, you jerk.

571
00:49:06,170 --> 00:49:08,040
Where? Where do I need to go?

572
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:10,840
Wait. I'll call again.

573
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:31,450
- Tell me.
 - I'll name the time and the place of our meeting. See you there.

574
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:40,980
Give up.

575
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,990
You can't win.

576
00:49:43,990 --> 00:49:46,980
I haven't even held my baby yet.

577
00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:09,330
Give me the phone. I'll make the call.

578
00:50:10,230 --> 00:50:13,240
Whichever way you slice it, what irony this is.

579
00:50:14,110 --> 00:50:18,770
your father made a monster, and the monster killed your father.

580
00:50:18,770 --> 00:50:22,900
And his daughter produced a child with that monster.

581
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:24,050
What are you anyway?

582
00:50:24,050 --> 00:50:27,480
Never mind what I am or what we are. Just give me that damn cell phone.

583
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:32,880
I'll get Ji Oh myself. And you, just stay put quietly.

584
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:35,040
If you pull anything silly, even a little,

585
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:40,140
I'll give away your child to an adoption agency and ship her off abroad with no paper trail.

586
00:50:53,660 --> 00:50:57,280
Once we wrap up the matters concerning Director Kim, we'll begin with the fertilized eggs.

587
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:59,810
You're going to make a lot of money.

588
00:50:59,810 --> 00:51:03,250
The most profitable business in the world is that of selling faith.

589
00:51:03,250 --> 00:51:05,480
That's blasphemy.

590
00:51:06,970 --> 00:51:11,280
I'll be reverent, so you keep your promise about improving human immunity.

591
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:14,280
Did the Corona pandemic change your mind?

592
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:16,340
It did.

593
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:21,710
Whenever there's a virus outbreak, it shakes up the world economy with medicines and vaccines.

594
00:51:21,710 --> 00:51:25,900
Develop an antibody which is invulnerable to at least 200 bat-like viruses.

595
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:30,680
We'll devour the world economy, and you get the Republic of South Korea.

596
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:42,730
Team Leader, there's a problem in the mountain villa.

597
00:51:49,620 --> 00:51:53,460
- Where are we headed? 
 - To the den of that cult leader. The mountain villa.

598
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:56,430
Just two of us are going? The manpower there is quite substantial.

599
00:51:56,430 --> 00:51:58,610
We have backup.

600
00:51:58,610 --> 00:52:01,100
Isn't that all cut off from you?

601
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:04,710
I called Ji Oh to come over there.

602
00:52:04,710 --> 00:52:08,580
- Ji Oh? 
 - By now, he's killing the guys in the mountain villa on our behalf.

603
00:52:08,580 --> 00:52:12,620
They probably thought I couldn't kill them because I'm stripped of manpower

604
00:52:12,620 --> 00:52:15,540
but this is how you use an enemy's own tactics against him.

605
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:17,450
Did Ji Oh really go to the mountain villa?

606
00:52:17,450 --> 00:52:19,760
All we have to do is get there later and collect Ji Oh.

607
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:23,430
He's got to obey me if he wants to save his wife and kid.

608
00:52:24,260 --> 00:52:27,280
Hey, Team Leader!

609
00:52:29,510 --> 00:52:31,570
You've got to leave here.

610
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:21,610
 Director Kim Cheol Su 

611
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:04,620
Gu Reum!

612
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:51,880
Where's Gu Reum?

613
00:54:55,810 --> 00:54:57,960
Where is she?

614
00:55:47,710 --> 00:55:51,040
Baby, what's wrong?

615
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:54,200
Everything's fine. Mommy's here.

616
00:55:58,790 --> 00:56:00,970
It's okay.

617
00:56:02,770 --> 00:56:05,710
Mommy's here.  It's okay.

618
00:56:05,710 --> 00:56:07,540
Everything is alright.

619
00:57:50,330 --> 00:57:52,360
Yu Na.

620
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:56,560
Why?

621
00:58:14,750 --> 00:58:17,460
 Cannot be connected... 

622
00:58:48,350 --> 00:58:51,790
Didn't I tell you you wouldn't be able to escape from my grasp wherever you went?

623
00:58:51,790 --> 00:58:54,060
Get lost. I did nothing wrong.

624
00:58:54,060 --> 00:58:56,420
Call Ji Oh.

625
00:58:58,150 --> 00:59:00,950
I'm sorry. Please don't kill me.

626
00:59:00,950 --> 00:59:04,850
I- I really don't know.

627
00:59:04,850 --> 00:59:09,230
I don't see him anymore. We aren't even friends anymore.

628
00:59:16,910 --> 00:59:18,940
Your cell phone?

629
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:25,160
Unlock it.

630
00:59:27,510 --> 00:59:28,930
 Friend 

631
00:59:28,930 --> 00:59:29,990
Your friend, is he?

632
00:59:29,990 --> 00:59:34,940
No, no, he really isn't. It's the truth. Please believe me.

633
00:59:34,940 --> 00:59:36,860
Call him. Say you want to meet.

634
00:59:36,860 --> 00:59:39,790
Please don't kill me.

635
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:52,350
Yeah, speak.

636
00:59:52,350 --> 00:59:55,890
Ji Oh, you see—

637
00:59:55,890 --> 00:59:57,970
Why is your voice like that? Is something wrong?

638
00:59:57,970 --> 01:00:00,950
No, nothing.

639
01:00:00,950 --> 01:00:03,170
I need to see you now.

640
01:00:03,170 --> 01:00:06,280
All right. Let's meet at the reconstruction site.

641
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:11,160
Yeah...about that reconstruction site, Ji Oh, run away!

642
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:13,290
You can't come here!

643
01:00:13,290 --> 01:00:16,400
Run away! Run!

644
01:00:35,420 --> 01:00:38,020
♫  Do I  ♫

645
01:00:42,510 --> 01:00:45,800
♫  What should I do?  ♫

646
01:00:58,450 --> 01:01:01,540
♫  I wish you were here.  ♫

647
01:01:01,540 --> 01:01:03,820
Is this the right place?

648
01:01:03,820 --> 01:01:06,880
This place was in the GPS records of your phone.

649
01:01:07,990 --> 01:01:11,780
No. This isn't it.

650
01:01:11,780 --> 01:01:14,250
Then call him again. Tell him to come here.

651
01:01:14,250 --> 01:01:20,180
Please let Ji Oh live. He became a father of a little baby.

652
01:01:20,180 --> 01:01:23,260
So,

653
01:01:23,260 --> 01:01:27,240
please stop and let him live.

654
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:28,940
♫  To our own shelter  ♫

655
01:01:28,940 --> 01:01:31,020
Won Yi!

656
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:33,320
Won Yi!

657
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:35,970
♫  To our own shelter  ♫

658
01:01:35,970 --> 01:01:37,990
Won Yi.

659
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,760
I told you to run away.

660
01:01:57,430 --> 01:02:00,150
Run, you bastard!

661
01:02:00,150 --> 01:02:04,900
I didn't sell you out this time.

662
01:02:04,900 --> 01:02:07,230
Is he your friend?

663
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:11,020
I asked you if he's your friend.

664
01:02:11,020 --> 01:02:13,580
Don't do that. He's my friend.

665
01:02:13,580 --> 01:02:15,700
Got it.

666
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:21,830
Ji Oh.

667
01:02:24,490 --> 01:02:27,560
Don't do that!

668
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:32,000
♫  I'm sorry, I will be with you  ♫

669
01:02:35,410 --> 01:02:38,990
♫  I swear.   ♫

670
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:52,720
I killed him because he's your friend.

671
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:58,760


672
01:02:58,760 --> 01:03:03,760
♫  Let me hold you in my arms.  ♫

673
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:12,020
♫  I hope we can stay together.  ♫

674
01:03:12,020 --> 01:03:17,040
♫  We don't have to run away.  ♫

675
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:21,960
♫  As we do now.  ♫

676
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:24,770
 L.U.C.A.: The Beginning  

677
01:03:24,770 --> 01:03:26,350
 Can you handle it? 

678
01:03:26,350 --> 01:03:27,860
 We should do things differently this time. 

679
01:03:27,860 --> 01:03:30,360
 Is Gu Reum's baby really Ji Oh's? 

680
01:03:30,360 --> 01:03:32,280
 Is he dead? 

681
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:36,100
 Whatever you do, whatever you say, you'll never touch my baby. 

682
01:03:36,100 --> 01:03:38,130
 They'll come to fear me more. 

683
01:03:38,130 --> 01:03:40,170
 I'll make money, and you'll get your payback. 

684
01:03:40,170 --> 01:03:41,480
 Just die, damn it. 

685
01:03:41,480 --> 01:03:44,560
 You're like that because you're made that way, but not our child. 

686
01:03:44,560 --> 01:03:47,530
 I've already called. The number doesn't exist. 

687
01:03:47,530 --> 01:03:48,660
 All will be fine as long as I'm gone. 

688
01:03:48,660 --> 01:03:49,750
 All will be fine as long as you're gone. 

689
01:03:49,750 --> 01:03:53,530
 Wait, till I'll set everything right.
