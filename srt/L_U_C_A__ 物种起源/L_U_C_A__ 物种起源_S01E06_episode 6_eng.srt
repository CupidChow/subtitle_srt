 L.U.C.A.: The Beginning  

2
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:08,850
♫   Look at me. Voice to me, find tree.  ♫

3
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:17,840
♫  Please let me sleep on it, so I can breathe in.  ♫

4
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:22,180


5
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:30,490
 L.U.C.A.: The Beginning  

6
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:36,910
 This is a work of fiction. Any resemblance to actual names, places, organizations, religious references, and incidents is entirely coincidental.  

7
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:43,750
 The episode was filmed with adequate accommodations to ensure the safety and the emotional well-being of the infant and minor actors used. 

8
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:48,070
 Episode 6 

9
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:02,630
 HUMAN TECH 

10
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:19,360
You used your head, but not quite skillfully.

11
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,880
After all, our speciality is leading and tailing people.

12
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:37,520
Since we've come this far, we should see the end of each other.

13
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,990
 If you can beat me, 

14
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:42,750
 Exit 

15
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:49,570
then you can come in here.

16
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:54,150
In here is everything that tells you who you are.

17
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:57,980
Who you are, where you come from,

18
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:00,240
didn't you come here to find the answers to those questions?

19
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,410
Is that all? Everything about me is in there?

20
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:08,630
Did you think you were some great person?

21
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:14,430
This is all you know how to do, isn't it?

22
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:45,630
Get ready to treat him.

23
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:46,620
Just leave him.

24
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,960
We must treat him right away.

25
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:51,160
He has the power to heal himself. Let's see what he's capable of.

26
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,510
But still-

27
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:54,520
We need to test his performance anyway.

28
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,770
Whether it's his ability to regenerate or restore himself,

29
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:59,550
let's see just what he can do.

30
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:04,230
I'm very relieved to have him back in the condition he is. It means one less test for us to do.

31
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:10,710
After his performance is tested, we'll dismantle him for mass production. Prepare the assembly lines for production.

32
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:14,670
And record everything starting now til his full recovery. I need to keep management informed.

33
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:35,860
Before you break down Ji Oh, make several copies of his somatic cells.

34
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:36,720
Pardon?

35
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,860
It's easy to make clones these days.

36
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:42,030
Well, it's not particularly hard.

37
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:45,390
Make them without anyone knowing about it.

38
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:46,760
Without anyone knowing about it?

39
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:50,940
Only you, the head of research, and I should know about this.

40
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:54,220
Why are you saying this all of a sudden?

41
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:57,930
What do you think will happen if our research is revealed to the world?

42
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:04,220
The entire research staff here will be arrested. Right?

43
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:09,500
Well, as long as we're sworn to keep the secret—

44
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:13,000
All the research personnel here will  go missing

45
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,260
once the experiment is over, and we begin mass production.

46
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:22,740
You as head researcher have to stay alive.

47
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:44,840
Are you okay?

48
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:52,580
Is it all over now?

49
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:58,560
No. This is only the beginning.

50
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:04,050
The war has just begun.

51
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:10,770
Come on, Team Captain. Stop this and give her some time to collect herself.

52
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:13,720
We have no idea what she's been through.

53
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,160
Stay here and watch over her.

54
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:18,740
Don't let anyone come in here. And no recording, either.

55
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,530
What is going on?

56
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:26,820
She shouldn't have joined my team in the first place.

57
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:39,540
What's this about, Team Captain?

58
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:48,500
It's quiet and nice here. I want to ask you some questions.

59
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:53,240
I came in without reporting to you because I think they already know my daily coming  and going.

60
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,420
Is that so?

61
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:57,430
Last time there was even a tail stuck on me.

62
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:59,200
Really?

63
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:05,910
Where's Ji Oh?

64
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:08,070
Why do you act surprised?

65
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:10,980
Why are you asking me that?

66
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:13,490
You know the punishment for harbouring a criminal, right?

67
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:15,810
I do. The punishment isn't anything severe.

68
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:18,260
Don't play with words.

69
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:22,340
I heard that Uicheon Convent was burned in a fire recently.

70
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:28,050
The call came in from the church to report the fire, and we needed to investigate if it was arson or an accident.

71
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:30,630
The nun at the church testified

72
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:35,600
that a detective named Ha Gu Reum and a man named Ji Oh came to see her together.

73
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:39,960
I will save my investigating what you are going around doing for later.

74
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:43,710
Where's Ji Oh right now?

75
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:55,530
Shall we start with you in handcuffs?

76
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:02,200
You're treating me like a criminal.

77
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,700
Are you afraid?

78
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:06,260
Shall I start in handcuffs?

79
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,300
Let's start.

80
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:57,780
Ji Oh, it's me.

81
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:59,980
Do you remember?

82
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,450
Don't you remember me?

83
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:18,250
It's alright, Ji Oh.

84
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:21,890
You're back home.

85
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:26,110
This is our home.

86
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:28,460
Don't talk nonsense.

87
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:35,650
Ji Oh.

88
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,640
I'm sorry I left you alone for so long.

89
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,220
You must have been very lonely.

90
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:43,520
Who are you?

91
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:47,130
I thought I lost you forever.

92
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:49,370
Just who are you?

93
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:00,410
I am,

94
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,090
your father.

95
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:18,270
And you're my son.

96
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,520
Don't we need to tie him up?

97
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:31,000
- He already is. 
- Where?

98
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:38,010
You don't think we can physically tie him up and drag him to the lab by force, do you?

99
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:42,250
He's not hugging him out of love, he's trying to tie him down by draining his emotions.

100
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:46,380
By sweet talking to him saying that he's the father, he's simply disarming him.

101
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:49,640
I must say Dr. Ryu is truly  the epitome of evil.

102
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:54,100
Would you like a glass of water?

103
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,730
You little-

104
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:57,260
You seem frustrated.

105
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:59,540
Hey, harbouring and abetting a criminal on the run,

106
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:03,430
- and obstruction of justice—
- It wasn't obstruction of justice.

107
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:07,400
The only person who was enforcing justice at the time was me.

108
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:11,140
How can I obstruct myself from carrying out justice when I was the one doing it?

109
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:14,210
In the greater scheme of things, what you did was interfering an investigation.

110
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:17,220
Since when did we have a vision of any kind, or work with any structure?

111
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:19,060
What about the rules we must follow as police officers when carrying out our duties?

112
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:21,950
I didn't violate any because

113
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:26,200
following up on a report, I went to the church to arrest Ji Oh, but he ran away.

114
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,430
The nun said you two came in together.

115
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:32,040
Do you believe the nun or me?

116
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,040
I could do a cross-examination.

117
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:40,100
At a time like this, cross-examination isn't what you should be suggesting.

118
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:43,060
Instead, you should be understanding with words like, "Is that so?" Or, "That's what happened."

119
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:45,410
You could gloss over things.

120
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:49,900
You should be protecting your own. Since you are not, we can't ever compete with the prosecution.

121
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:52,600
We're the best in the industry  when it comes to protecting our own.

122
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,050
I don't envy the prosecution.

123
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:56,790
- Then, can you release me? 
 - Where is Ji Oh?

124
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:59,410
- I don't know. 
 - Where did you hide him?

125
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:03,090
You said it yourself he wasn't our case anymore, and that you turned it over.

126
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:08,170
I really don't know where he is.

127
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:12,590
Do you want some beef soup?

128
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:14,760
- No, thanks.
 - Eat.

129
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:18,130
Eating a bowl of beef soup is a thing criminals usually do in a place like this.

130
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,020
What are you going to do, Team Captain?

131
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:33,030
She's the youngest in the team.

132
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:36,880
Order some beef soup for her and follow me.

133
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,010
Pardon?

134
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:42,120
Are you saying you're my father?

135
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,700
How can you be my father? How?

136
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:48,320
You're probably disappointed with me about many things.

137
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,610
I have no parents. I grew up in an orphanage.

138
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:57,770
You probably don't remember anything.

139
00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:01,210
But that doesn't change the fact that I'm your father.

140
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:05,200
Just because you don't remember doesn't mean you don't exist.

141
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:10,490
  This man is the key to finding your memories back. 

142
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:12,410
 Ryu Jung Kwon? 

143
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:15,830
Do you know who Ryu Jung Kwon is?

144
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:17,720
I do.

145
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,750
Can I meet him? I want to.

146
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:22,170
He's the only one I can trust.

147
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:25,190
Before I meet him and hear from him, I'm not going to trust anyone.

148
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,440
You're seeing him right now.

149
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:35,740
I'm Ryu Jung Kwon.

150
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:40,690
You even forgot your father's name.

151
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:49,030
I'm sure you have many questions for me.

152
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:51,430
Why was I abandoned?

153
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:53,180
Why didn't you come and look for me sooner?

154
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:56,270
Why did you hunt me down as if you were going to kill me?

155
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,290
Why am I different from others?

156
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:01,600
Am I, perhaps, a monster?

157
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,860
None of that is important.

158
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,380
Am I capable of loving someone?

159
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,630
Apart from that question, all others are mere gabarge.

160
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:17,490
I risked my whole life

161
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:21,730
on loving you.

162
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:25,020
You're the only one I love.

163
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,850
Hence, I'm not asking any questions.

164
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:35,150
Why did you leave me?

165
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:39,440
Why did you forsake your father?

166
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:47,040
My love for you won't change regardless what your answers may be.

167
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,600
Do you think he's here?

168
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,460
I doubt it.

169
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:11,050
But why are we here?

170
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:13,160
I thought maybe.

171
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:35,580
He isn't here.

172
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:38,990
Of all places, she wouldn't have hid him in here.

173
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:51,100
Isn't this not Gu Reum's hair?

174
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:53,370
Well, your eyes are super fine. That's for sure.

175
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:56,680
Let's just go. Quit poking around.

176
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:10,390
I said let's go. What on earth are you doing now?

177
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:16,340
Are you even listening to me?

178
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:18,640
Come on, he wouldn't be hiding behind the screen.

179
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:25,290
What's all this?

180
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:27,590
- Take a picture.
 - Okay.

181
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:30,360
What on earth has she been doing?

182
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:41,770
 Name / Resident ID No. / Address 

183
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:45,000
I don't remember anything.

184
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,300
I don't know the meaning of the few memories I do have.

185
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,620
You probably emitted a massive amount of electricity  while unconscious.

186
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:56,640
More than your body could handle.

187
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,010
When that happens, all the cells in your body burn.

188
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:03,070
The same goes for your memory cells.

189
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:08,010
What's left in your body are now the strongest of your cells and the most powerful of your memories.

190
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:11,450
If so, why don't I have any memories of you, Father?

191
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:15,170
Still if you're my father, shouldn't I have some memories of you?

192
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,240
Let's eat.

193
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:25,780
Do I have a mother?

194
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:30,870
You do.

195
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:33,480
Where is she?

196
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,750
She isn't here anymore.

197
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:36,960
Did she die?

198
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,400
She left.

199
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,520
Did she because of me?

200
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:50,380
Some people generate static more than others.

201
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:55,640
Because of that, they get startled when changing clothes or touching door knobs.

202
00:18:55,640 --> 00:19:00,990
People who generate more static than that tend to make their notebooks or handphones go unusable.

203
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:04,030
You were one of the more severe cases.

204
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:08,320
That's why we brought you here and began treatment.

205
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,200
Because of me?

206
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,570
Why did I leave?

207
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:24,650
It wasn't your fault.

208
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:27,180
Then, whose fault was it?

209
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:31,050
-Ha Yeong Jae. 
 -Ha Yeong Jae.

210
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:34,160
Was it Haneul Ae Gu Reum?

211
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,790
He liked to show me the pictures of his daughter and bragged.

212
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:48,700
What happened to him?

213
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:52,480
He set the lab on fire. Then he took you and ran away.

214
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,410
You didn't resist and followed him obediently.

215
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:57,220
 Catch them! 

216
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:10,410
He tried to sell you off.

217
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:12,580
Why would he want to sell me off?

218
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:15,800
Because you're special.

219
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,780
You were much coveted as a living and breathing object to be experimented on.

220
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:22,480
-Then what? 
 -You know the rest.

221
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,600
I'm aware that you met with the daughter of Ha Yeong Jae.

222
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:30,950
Did I- did I kill him?

223
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,410
You have the power to kill anyone.

224
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:41,800
Thus, it isn't  strange even if you've killed before.

225
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:45,510
I...

226
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:47,970
Not Ha Yeong Jae.

227
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:49,780
You were fond of him.

228
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:52,540
He wanted you to see the sky and hear the sound of rain.

229
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:54,470
Not to mention, the rainbows.

230
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:57,450
He moved you with the sweet words of his.

231
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,840
You aren't anyone who can kill those you're fond of.

232
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,270
Then, who killed him?

233
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:08,710
It's time.

234
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:11,680
- How is he?
-  His recovery rate and ability to regenerate

235
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:14,660
is ten times as much as that of a normal human being.

236
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,040
Great.

237
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:34,880
I'll tell you everything later.

238
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,180
I'm asking you. Who killed him?

239
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:37,840
It's time.

240
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,880
Time for what? Just tell me who killed him.

241
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:45,540
Remember what I, your father, tell you.

242
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:47,010
You have to find the answer.

243
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:48,610
What answer?

244
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:51,630
Is the existence of the human race justified?

245
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:56,660
Are we going to be  the last generation of the human race?

246
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:01,580
Two questions, but one answer.

247
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:04,150
Before you find the answer,

248
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:08,780
you must withstand all that comes your way no matter how hard.

249
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:25,610
What is it?

250
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:32,350
Who are you?

251
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:44,620
You—

252
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:46,750
What are you?

253
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:51,410
I'll kill you. I'll kill you!

254
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:07,460
No!

255
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:14,870
Ah, F-Father!

256
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:32,150
Wow, he's incredible!

257
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:35,210
That's enough to take down an elephant.

258
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:06,040
Take him to the lab and get him ready for the tests.

259
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,030
Yes, sir.

260
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:12,720
Good job. You just fed your son. I say you've done enough as a father.

261
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,210
Ji Oh didn't take even a bite.

262
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:20,140
He's a grown-up. Setting the table for him is enough.  You can't spoon-feed him.

263
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:23,260
Come on, getting sentimental isn't our thing.

264
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:25,130
Let's go.

265
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:06,950
You didn't eat.

266
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:14,490
What is it?

267
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:16,640
Take a look before you ask.

268
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:33,520
Any question?

269
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:40,240
If not, then let me ask you  a question. What are you?

270
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:49,440
Given your timeline, I guess you didn't bother to get a search warrant when you went into my place.

271
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,260
That's tresspassing.

272
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:54,410
That isn't the answer I want to hear.

273
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:57,930
Trespassing at night is an offense subject to special punishment.

274
00:25:57,930 --> 00:26:01,550
That isn't the answer I want, either. What are you?

275
00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:05,730
I'm Haeul Ae Gu Reum.

276
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:08,010
Are you looking for your mom and dad?

277
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:14,190
Nice to see you so demure and docile for a change.

278
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:18,950
Come with me. Let's have a drink.

279
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:56,230
Who drinks as you do nowadays? It's just uncivilized.

280
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:15,650
Has it been 20 years already? There was this case I was working on.

281
00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:17,910
The husband went missing.

282
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:23,790
Only his blood was found in the house.  It was a textbook case of murdering a person and then cutting off his body in pieces.

283
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:26,720
In the eyes of all, the wife was the murderer.

284
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:33,110
The husband and wife were in their early 20s.

285
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:39,780
All I needed was one piece of evidence. Just one.

286
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:41,260
But I couldn't.

287
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:42,800
What evidence?

288
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,930
The body.

289
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,620
I clung to that case over ten years.

290
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:56,530
I searched for the body whenever I could. Sometimes I'd feel bad about going off on vacations, so I'd cut them short.

291
00:27:56,530 --> 00:28:00,490
I vowed to myself upon finding the murderer, I'd kill him or her with my own hands.

292
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:08,620
I couldn't say if I was investigating a case or simply being stubborn.

293
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:10,590
Did you know the victim?

294
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:13,460
If that had been case, I wouldn't have been called crazy.

295
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:16,120
He wasn't related to me in any way.

296
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,190
Then why?

297
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:20,920
Everyone has  that  one thing they want to hang on to.

298
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,730
Don't you agree?

299
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:28,090
You know what I thought later? I wished the statute of limitations would expire soon.

300
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:32,910
Since hanging on to the case was pointless, I wished I'd be forced to quit it.

301
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:39,290
Since I couldn't solve the case, I wished it'd come to an end on its own.

302
00:28:39,290 --> 00:28:40,920
Right?

303
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:43,130
Don't you agree that would make me feel at ease?

304
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:45,070
By now, the statute of limitations should've been over.

305
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:48,680
It did. A long time ago.

306
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,850
Do you now feel at ease?

307
00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:53,070
What do you think?

308
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:54,430
I guess you don't.

309
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:58,470
I feel completely at ease now that I can quit investigating.

310
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:00,770
Looking back, I wonder why I was like that.

311
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:03,290
Well, why were you like that?

312
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:10,090
It's you in that photo, right? That kid?

313
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:12,050
Yes.

314
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:13,680
And your parents went missing.

315
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,360
Did you see the records?

316
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,660
How long have you been investigating?

317
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,650
Nine years.

318
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:24,120
-What does Ji Oh have to do with your parents' case?  
-I don't know.

319
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:29,920
If you don't, why is his personnel card stuck on your wall? Is he a suspect in your parents' case?

320
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,970
I don't know that yet.

321
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:35,970
Whether it's a murder case or a missing persons case, the statute of limitations for your parents' case has expired too.

322
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:38,220
I know that.

323
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:43,200
Even if I catch the murderer, he can't be punished.

324
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:50,610
But, Team Captain.  Don't you find funny? I mean the statute of limitations.

325
00:29:50,610 --> 00:29:53,830
It's there to tell you, by law, how many years you're allowed to grieve.

326
00:29:53,830 --> 00:30:00,690
It tells you you can get angry over the death of your loved one, but you should be done with it in so many years.

327
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:04,770
That's the law. So stop it.

328
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:09,820
If you promise to stop, I won't report you to internal affairs.

329
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:14,470
I can't promise you that.

330
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:18,990
I ruined myself because of that one case. And I don't want you to.

331
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:23,360
Promise that you'll stop.

332
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:37,560
Gu Reum, it's time to let go.

333
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:44,070
Let your parents go. And the murderer, too.

334
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:49,610
Let go of the time you've been hanging on to. That's how you can go on.

335
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:34,430
Okay.

336
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,440
If I have to, I'll get censured by Internal Affairs.

337
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,310
That could end your career in  the police force.

338
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:46,180
Even if I get fired and have to work as a private eye, I'll continue with my investigation.

339
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:49,380
You stubborn brat.

340
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:53,760
What do you want me to do for you?

341
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,310
You've already done all that you can for me.

342
00:31:58,730 --> 00:32:01,110
You don't have to anymore.

343
00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:17,070
 I know nothing of what you've done so far. 

344
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:19,740
 I don't know about you and Ji Oh visiting that church, either. 

345
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:21,600
 Plus, 

346
00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:26,270
 I'm going to delete this photo, too. 

347
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:31,090
 In return, whatever you do here from now on, don't let anyone catch you. 

348
00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:33,530
 I can't protect you if you get caught. 

349
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:39,420
 Okay? 

350
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:49,380
 Ryu Jung Kwon (missing)
 Male, about ten years old - blue light? 

351
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:02,050
 National Forensic Service 
Professor Oh Jeong Hwan: Deceased 

352
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:15,420
 Where are you now, Ji Oh? 

353
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:12,390
How long has it been since the three of us got together?

354
00:34:12,390 --> 00:34:17,450
It's been a while. I guess a happy occasion calls for a happy gathering.

355
00:34:17,450 --> 00:34:19,850
How was our kid?

356
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:24,570
The first round of the testing was done.

357
00:34:24,570 --> 00:34:26,730
Shall I say, a bit impure?

358
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:28,780
His body has many impurities.

359
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:32,680
If he'd stayed here, he would've been well taken care of. But he's lived like a stray dog—

360
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:34,700
Can you refine him?

361
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:38,050
With shock treatments, I'm going to burn all the weak cells in him.

362
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:40,830
Once his body is completely filled with healthy cells,

363
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:44,580
I'm planning to clone his cells.

364
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:49,690
Those cells will become the Son of Angel and stand on our altar.

365
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:53,370
Ten million saints on the coming of the son of God

366
00:34:53,370 --> 00:34:55,210
would be nothing.

367
00:34:56,430 --> 00:35:01,070
We need  surrogate mothers for that to happen. Can you have them ready?

368
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:06,140
That isn't anything a human can do.

369
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:09,140
That's what faith does.

370
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:12,880
I trust you, Spiritual Leader.

371
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,320
I'll look forward to good news.

372
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:18,840
Please take good care of our child.

373
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,180
Excuse me.

374
00:35:33,370 --> 00:35:35,640
We'll test to see how strong his cells are.

375
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:38,680
We'll continue to shock him til he can't handle it.

376
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:41,180
In case of a cardiac arrest,  get ready for immediate CPR.

377
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:44,030
Until the test is over, you must keep him alive by all means.

378
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:48,970
Once we confirm his cells have evolved, we'll test his immune system and antibodies. So get ready for that.

379
00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:51,460
Yes, sir.

380
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:08,440
Once we clone his cells, we'll kill Ji Oh, right?

381
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:11,820
Yes, that's the plan. We can't control him so he might cause a problem somewhere.

382
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:14,380
Please kill all the researchers, too.

383
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:16,330
Including Dr. Ryu?

384
00:36:16,330 --> 00:36:21,620
They're supposed to be God's children. We can't risk the world knowing they're made by a scientist.

385
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:27,270
I take it that you're telling me to clean up everyone  involved.

386
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:29,370
Should I die, too?

387
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:38,850
We should enjoy the time of glory together.

388
00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:52,260
That vicious bitch.

389
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:28,240
It'll hurt a lot for a few weeks.

390
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:31,390
What the hell are you doing? Why are you doing this to me?

391
00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:34,650
Remember what I, your father tells you.

392
00:37:34,650 --> 00:37:36,800
How can you call yourself a father?

393
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,650
Even if you are, I don't need you.

394
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:44,250
I need  you. 

395
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:51,520
One-kay (1K) has been injected.

396
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:54,180
I'll kill all of you.

397
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:59,480
Dr. Ryu.

398
00:38:04,690 --> 00:38:06,350
Charge.

399
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:36,480
Just before 1K, electricity stopped.

400
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:41,370
Good job, Ji Oh.

401
00:38:41,370 --> 00:38:42,760
Let's increase the voltage a little more.

402
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,430
Stop it. What are you doing?

403
00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:47,680
We're experimenting what voltage of electricity your body can handle.

404
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,850
The maximum voltage your body handles

405
00:38:49,850 --> 00:38:51,990
is the total voltage you can produce.

406
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:54,000
Why are you doing this to me?

407
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,120
Increase the voltage to 2K.

408
00:38:57,930 --> 00:39:00,150
Don't-

409
00:39:58,310 --> 00:40:01,440
Sure you're my father.

410
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:06,140
You're the same monster I am.

411
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:10,700
Are you familiar with  Pavlov's dog?

412
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:16,510
He rang a bell everytime he fed the dog. Later, the dog produced saliva at the mere sound of the bell.

413
00:40:16,510 --> 00:40:19,410
Most people are acquainted with that  story.

414
00:40:19,410 --> 00:40:26,050
But not many know he drilled a hole into the dog's jaw and used a hose to collect its saliva.

415
00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:31,390
Even if they knew, none would've dared to call Pavlov a monster.

416
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:50,060
 Even when their skin gets severely irritated and their eyes go blind, 

417
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:56,500
 the company witholds even a drop of antibiotics or painkiller until the dogs die. 

418
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:58,560
 The company is invested in seeing the test results. 

419
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:02,280
 I feel we humans have no right to treat animals as we do. 

420
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:06,540
 We don't do it because we have a right. We do it because we have  power. 

421
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:29,900
 Juan Metropolitan Police Agency 

422
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,010
What are you doing?

423
00:41:39,010 --> 00:41:42,160
Well, it's that photo we took.

424
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:44,430
I just sent it to you.

425
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:50,780
What?

426
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:04,950
I saw it and sent it to Gu Reum, too.

427
00:42:04,950 --> 00:42:08,370
- What did Gu Reum say? 
 - What do you think? She dared me to send it to Internal Affairs.

428
00:42:08,370 --> 00:42:11,610
Looks like I've done a good job grooming a junior detective.

429
00:42:11,610 --> 00:42:13,880
To belong with Criminal Investigation, one ought to be as audacious as she is.

430
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:16,510
If she needs to face Internal Affairs, do you think she will alone?

431
00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:19,810
It's our case. All of us will be censured.

432
00:42:19,810 --> 00:42:21,240
Why is it our case?

433
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,590
Not that, but the case of Ji Oh.

434
00:42:23,590 --> 00:42:27,170
She said she went to the church with him and let him go.

435
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:28,500
Come on, seriously. Team Captain.

436
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:31,850
Couldn't you persuade her somehow?  Now all of us are in trouble.

437
00:42:31,850 --> 00:42:36,410
Getting censured is just the thing that follows you around for the rest of your life.

438
00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:39,050
It can't be helped.

439
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:43,570
No, wait. There's always something we can do.

440
00:42:43,570 --> 00:42:48,460
You see, you and I are the only people who know anyway.

441
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:51,560
So long as we keep our mouths shut, no one in Internal Affairs will find out.

442
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:56,470
Am I right or what?  That's what I'm saying!

443
00:42:57,590 --> 00:43:00,800
-Should we? 
 -Of course, we should.

444
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:05,880
No. I've done enough investigation to know keeping silent is the hardest thing to do.

445
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:07,510
Come on, seriously.

446
00:43:07,510 --> 00:43:11,750
That's my specialty.  You just need to be careful on your end.

447
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:15,210
Then, delete the picture.

448
00:43:15,210 --> 00:43:17,720
Okay, I'm deleting it.  What about you?

449
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,920
I already deleted it.

450
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:30,250
Hey, Gu Reum.

451
00:43:31,390 --> 00:43:33,040
Thank you.

452
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:36,800
You don't know how they look or their license plate number, do you?

453
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:41,480
They were the same guys from the subway platform before.

454
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:43,440
What?

455
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:48,160
I ran the plate number, and it beloned to an unregistered vehicle.

456
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:50,880
Those bastards. Apparently, they're experts.

457
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:54,830
Are they not only experts, I feel they have an organization behind them.

458
00:43:54,830 --> 00:44:00,630
I suspect that my car was stopped that day via ECU  (engine control unit) hacking done remotely.

459
00:44:00,630 --> 00:44:03,410
You know, I'm getting more and more sucked into this case.

460
00:44:03,410 --> 00:44:05,800
- There is something. 
 - You feel it, too, right?

461
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:08,690
I told you how strange the case was from the start.

462
00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:10,950
- Shall we do it together? 
 - Do what?

463
00:44:10,950 --> 00:44:14,460
I need to find  someone, and I can use your help.

464
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:16,120
No, I can't.

465
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:21,150
Don't cause problems. Let's take it easy with the case, okay?

466
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:28,200
Anyhow, who is it you are looking for?

467
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:31,570
You can keep a secret, can't you?

468
00:44:31,570 --> 00:44:34,140
This is a covert investigation. It's no longer an investigation if I can't keep secrets.

469
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:37,590
You must keep it to yourself. You can't let  Team Captain know, either.

470
00:44:37,590 --> 00:44:38,930
Fine, I get it.

471
00:44:38,930 --> 00:44:43,350
I've fooled Team Captain many times.  So, who is it?

472
00:44:43,350 --> 00:44:45,870
Wait, wait. Don't tell me.

473
00:44:45,870 --> 00:44:48,630
- If get involved— 
 - It's Ryu Jung Kwon.

474
00:44:48,630 --> 00:44:51,050
Ryu Jung Kwon?

475
00:44:51,050 --> 00:44:52,950
Who is he?

476
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:57,120
Do something!

477
00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:11,310
His breathing is back.

478
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:18,640
Are you awake?

479
00:45:22,210 --> 00:45:24,230
You did well.

480
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:30,090
You held up well. Hang in there a bit longer.

481
00:45:31,990 --> 00:45:34,020
Please save me.

482
00:45:38,630 --> 00:45:40,290
Increase the voltage.

483
00:46:25,450 --> 00:46:31,650
 A week later 
 Juan University of Science and Technology - Alumni Center 

484
00:46:31,650 --> 00:46:35,720
Can I know anything about this man, Ryu Jung Kwon?

485
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:40,930
In support of protecting personal information, we can't tell you anything.

486
00:46:46,910 --> 00:46:51,680
You were his public defender at that time. He's gone missing.

487
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:53,880
I remember him.

488
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:59,390
Because of the public criticism at that time, no one was willing to defend him.

489
00:46:59,390 --> 00:47:02,900
 At issue was his trading of female reproductive cells, but his case lacked evidence.  

490
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:07,320
 Because there was no related laws then, he was sentenced for embezzlement and fraud. 

491
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:09,690
Can I see the trial records from then?

492
00:47:09,690 --> 00:47:13,670
The prison where he served might still have the records.

493
00:47:13,670 --> 00:47:15,680
The prison?

494
00:47:15,690 --> 00:47:19,090
 Two weeks later 

495
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:36,520
How are the surrogate mothers coming along?

496
00:47:37,290 --> 00:47:39,550
Since you're here anyway, come see youself

497
00:47:39,550 --> 00:47:43,490
 how great the faith of the heavenly mothers is. 

498
00:47:56,650 --> 00:48:01,520
 Three weeks later 

499
00:48:17,770 --> 00:48:21,930
 Inmate - Ryu Jung Kwon 

500
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:27,760
During his time here, he had no visitors.

501
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:30,600
I can't know since it was such a long time ago.

502
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:33,430
He didn't even send out a single letter.

503
00:48:33,430 --> 00:48:37,570
I'm told he received a lot of letters from all over the country.

504
00:48:37,570 --> 00:48:40,770
All of the letters told him to die, though.

505
00:48:40,770 --> 00:48:44,600
I guess the letters were like malicious online comments these days.

506
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:48,960
This record of his lawyer's visitation, was it stopped, or...? 
 Lawyer visitations - 3 times, Jan.30,1987 to May.3, 1987 

507
00:48:50,370 --> 00:48:52,760
A situation like this sometimes happens.

508
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:57,230
Probably the inmate fired his lawyer.

509
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:05,440
 Records of money kept in custody 

510
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:10,020
 #12. Jun. 9th - ₩2,000,000 (about US $2,000)
Inmate#4887 Ryu Jung Kwon 

511
00:49:10,020 --> 00:49:15,750
On this date, quite a sum of money was deposited under his name. How could there be no record of his lawyer's visitation?

512
00:49:15,750 --> 00:49:20,820
Let me see. Ah, it's obvious.

513
00:49:20,820 --> 00:49:24,140
The visitor probably didn't meet him but just deposited the money,

514
00:49:24,140 --> 00:49:27,770
not wanting to see him, or just running an errand for someone else.

515
00:49:27,770 --> 00:49:30,510
That happens once in a while.

516
00:49:30,510 --> 00:49:36,300
These days, all inmates have their virtual accounts. But back then, a visitor had to come and make deposits in person.

517
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:39,750
Can I know who came in?

518
00:49:39,750 --> 00:49:43,090
Let me see, the date was...

519
00:49:44,870 --> 00:49:48,100
Here it is.  Kim Ji Suk.

520
00:49:49,190 --> 00:49:53,020
- Kim Ji Suk?  
  - Kang Yong Su received money from Kim Ji Suk. 

521
00:49:53,020 --> 00:49:58,480
 When I looked into Kim's bank account, I realized the money was deposited by Human Tech. 

522
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:03,200
 Jun 9th - Sender: Kim Ji Suk - ID# 601112-2089945, Tel.01-823-0547, Recipient: Inmate#4887, Ryu Jung Kwon 

523
00:50:34,250 --> 00:50:38,320
 Ryu Jung Kwon  (missing) 
 Male, about 10 years old, blue light? 

524
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:40,810
 Kang Yong Su: Deceased 

525
00:50:40,810 --> 00:50:42,460
 Kim Ji Suk (missing) 

526
00:50:42,460 --> 00:50:45,320
 Human Tech: A creditor, a private equity fund? 

527
00:50:49,230 --> 00:50:51,370
 Human Tech: A creditor, private equity fund? 

528
00:50:57,880 --> 00:50:59,440
 Human Tech Corp.:  An audit report on financial statements 

529
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:06,370
 Statement of financial status 

530
00:51:06,370 --> 00:51:09,530
 Electricity Cost (unit: ₩1,000) - Current Quarter: 500,021 (about US $500K) / Previous Quarter: 385,260 (about US $385K) 

531
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:15,550
 KEPCO (Korea Electric Power Corporation) 

532
00:51:15,550 --> 00:51:18,300
This is the electricity cost.

533
00:51:18,340 --> 00:51:21,770
With this much, how big should I think the building is?

534
00:51:21,770 --> 00:51:23,170
Oh, this is quite a lot.

535
00:51:23,170 --> 00:51:26,960
When the cost is this high for one building, I should think it has, at least, 20 to 30 levels.

536
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:30,000
What if it's a twin-building with two levels?

537
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,790
That may mean it has some refrigeration storage units or something like that in its basements.

538
00:51:32,790 --> 00:51:35,480
It can happen with a meat processing factory.

539
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:38,750
If you formally request for the release of information, we can give more details.

540
00:51:38,750 --> 00:51:41,980
No need. This is more than enough.

541
00:51:41,980 --> 00:51:43,970
Thank you.

542
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:53,510
- How is the security? 
 - We put all the manpower inside and out.

543
00:51:53,510 --> 00:51:57,490
Today's the last day. If he acts unruly before he dies, we have no solution for that.

544
00:51:57,490 --> 00:52:03,110
We must completely subdue him from the get-go. It's okay to kill him. All will be over today.

545
00:52:03,110 --> 00:52:09,450
- Excuse me, sir. Is today the day we kill Ji Oh? 
 - Yeah.

546
00:52:09,450 --> 00:52:14,500
- What happens with what you promised me?
 - A promise? What promise?

547
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:17,550
You said you would cut Ji Oh's arm and give it to me.

548
00:52:17,550 --> 00:52:19,330
Did I?

549
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:24,160
Oh, right.

550
00:52:25,210 --> 00:52:28,980
- I'll put in a good word to Dr. Ryu. 
 - Will it be done as long as you put in a good word?

551
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:31,070
I guess it will.

552
00:52:32,330 --> 00:52:34,610
Let's make sure we don't mess up today.

553
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:52,480
Do some more. I dare you to not stop.

554
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:54,570
It's all done.

555
00:52:55,410 --> 00:53:02,530
We extracted the L.U.C.A (Last Universal Common Ancestor) cells from you, and also made fertilized eggs to be just like you.

556
00:53:02,530 --> 00:53:07,520
All those children will be properly bred so that they won't run away like you did.

557
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:10,500
I was mistaken.

558
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:15,910
If scumbags like you bastards are humans,

559
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:20,510
I should've lived as a monster in the first place.

560
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:25,500
You are going to die today.

561
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:29,160
With one injection, you'll go to heaven without any pain.

562
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:33,910
Try and kill me. I won't die.

563
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:40,890
I'm going to survive till the end and kill all of you.

564
00:53:41,870 --> 00:53:46,670
I like that mindset of yours.

565
00:53:46,670 --> 00:53:49,870
- The preparation is done, sir. 
 - Okay.

566
00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:09,690
We extracted the best  of the cells and made fertilized eggs of the highest quality.

567
00:54:09,690 --> 00:54:14,150
Two weeks later, if we implant them into the surrogate mothers, it'll all be over.

568
00:54:14,150 --> 00:54:19,680
Not the end, but the beginning.  What about that kid? Are we going to send him off today?

569
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:22,060
We've, so far, extracted everything we needed to.  He's no longer useful.

570
00:54:22,060 --> 00:54:25,560
Besides, he's grown quite willful and rebellious. We'd better discard him.

571
00:54:29,270 --> 00:54:33,830
The more I see him, the more his eyes look just like mine.

572
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:48,190
Hello, we meet again.

573
00:54:48,220 --> 00:54:50,570
What brings you here again?

574
00:54:50,570 --> 00:54:52,510
Is this all there?

575
00:54:53,870 --> 00:54:57,980
- Pardon me? 
 - I'm asking if the first and second floors are all you have in this building?

576
00:54:58,030 --> 00:55:01,490
- Why do you ask?
 - Let me have a look.

577
00:55:04,530 --> 00:55:08,240
What's this about? Do you have a search warrant?

578
00:55:08,270 --> 00:55:11,140
Is there any refrigeration storage unit?

579
00:55:13,930 --> 00:55:15,670
Pardon me?

580
00:55:19,250 --> 00:55:23,780
The electric bill of this building is almost that of a building that has 20 to 30 stories.

581
00:55:23,810 --> 00:55:29,180
With this size and this manpower, can you use that much of electricity?

582
00:55:30,620 --> 00:55:32,880
I asked if you have a search warrant.

583
00:55:36,590 --> 00:55:42,260
The warrant is on the way. So are the seventeen policemen from my team.

584
00:55:42,260 --> 00:55:45,610
-Look, I have to get off—
-Lead me to the basement.

585
00:55:45,610 --> 00:55:48,180
Let me see the person in charge quietly.

586
00:55:50,620 --> 00:55:55,240
There is no basement here. Look around.

587
00:55:57,880 --> 00:56:00,700
Look at that, you can't steady your eyes.

588
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:04,450
Okay. I'll find it.

589
00:56:12,230 --> 00:56:15,670
It won't hurt as this is a potent drug.

590
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:27,470
Okay.

591
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:30,930
I got it.

592
00:56:37,410 --> 00:56:39,560
This bastard.

593
00:56:41,490 --> 00:56:46,000
Tell me. Where's the passage to the basement?

594
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,570
You bastard.

595
00:56:48,570 --> 00:56:50,640
If you don't tell me, you die.

596
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:52,690
Tell me already.

597
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:56,800
Tell me!

598
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:58,720
You little-

599
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:05,450
I'll do it.

600
00:57:05,450 --> 00:57:07,820
No, it's okay.

601
00:57:07,820 --> 00:57:09,970
He's my son.

602
00:57:11,070 --> 00:57:13,660
If anyone's going to kill him, it'll be me.

603
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:17,420
And I want to say goodbye.

604
00:57:17,420 --> 00:57:19,880
Yes, sir.

605
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:24,360
They're waiting outside. Let's dispose of him right away.

606
00:57:53,250 --> 00:57:56,320
I was born with seven fingers.

607
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:59,060
I was made fun of when I was little.

608
00:57:59,060 --> 00:58:03,320
When I was in junior high, I had the extra fingers cut off.

609
00:58:04,300 --> 00:58:07,800
But, because of the aftereffect, my hand got paralyzed.

610
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:15,150
Only an extremely small number of people have a hand that has  seven unimpaired fingers.

611
00:58:15,150 --> 00:58:18,470
But, just because  I was different from others,

612
00:58:18,470 --> 00:58:21,730
I threw away my superiority.

613
00:58:29,820 --> 00:58:34,120
I know how hard your life has been.

614
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:41,160
Yet, it wasn't pain that clung to you, but you clung to that pain.

615
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:43,130
Just as I am,

616
00:58:44,930 --> 00:58:46,920
you're more superior than anyone.

617
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:52,090
Your existence testifies to the fact that  I was a superior being.

618
00:58:52,090 --> 00:58:54,880
Stop rambling. Just go ahead and kill me.

619
00:58:54,880 --> 00:59:00,030
Why do you insist on making easy choices? Don't you have reasons to live?

620
00:59:01,950 --> 00:59:06,090
 If I stay alive, I'll come to you. 

621
00:59:06,090 --> 00:59:07,030
 What do you mean? 

622
00:59:07,030 --> 00:59:09,310
 I'll stay alive and come find you. 

623
00:59:09,310 --> 00:59:12,830
 Even if I don't remember you, I'll find you. 

624
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:20,800
Live. You must live on.

625
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:25,940
Live to find the answer to that question.

626
00:59:28,190 --> 00:59:35,110
The elevator is at the right end of the hallway. Run.

627
01:00:16,340 --> 01:00:18,460
What are you?

628
01:00:18,460 --> 01:00:20,940
What are you?

629
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:23,900
What are you?

630
01:00:28,260 --> 01:00:33,910
I'm your father. And you're my son.

631
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:38,640
Farewell, Ji Oh.

632
01:00:59,990 --> 01:01:03,900
♫  Voice to me  ♫

633
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:09,250
♫  Find tree  ♫

634
01:01:21,220 --> 01:01:23,910
This is your hell. Damn it.

635
01:01:26,710 --> 01:01:28,930
Hey!

636
01:02:00,370 --> 01:02:03,310
Good work.

637
01:02:03,310 --> 01:02:06,830
Finally, the first phase is over. Keep up the good work with the second  phase, too.

638
01:02:06,830 --> 01:02:09,190
Thank you.

639
01:02:09,190 --> 01:02:13,010
Is he dead?

640
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:17,140
He'd die instantly if he were a mere human.

641
01:02:17,140 --> 01:02:22,090
Still, it'll take a minute or so.

642
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:25,930
I guess my heart is breaking a little.

643
01:02:25,930 --> 01:02:28,380
Why not? I'm his mother, after all.

644
01:02:57,880 --> 01:03:00,600
What is this? What's happened?

645
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:02,580
Get a hold of them right away.

646
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:21,970
Look!

647
01:03:40,670 --> 01:03:44,290
 Human Tech 

648
01:03:48,030 --> 01:03:49,570
Escort them to the outside.

649
01:03:49,570 --> 01:03:51,570
Get up.

650
01:05:07,700 --> 01:05:12,800
Leave your arm before you leave.

651
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:15,570
That arm is mine!

652
01:05:21,570 --> 01:05:28,550


653
01:05:30,450 --> 01:05:38,580
♫  Look at me. Voice to me. Find tree.  ♫

654
01:05:39,450 --> 01:05:46,650
♫  Please let me sleep on it, so I can breathe in.  ♫

655
01:05:46,650 --> 01:05:47,560
Where is Ryu Jung Kwon?

656
01:05:47,560 --> 01:05:48,860
I don't know.

657
01:05:48,860 --> 01:05:52,750
♫  I'm searching for something that's beautiful.  ♫

658
01:05:52,750 --> 01:05:57,820
♫  The scent takes me there. I'll never fall. I'll never stop.  ♫

659
01:05:57,820 --> 01:06:02,540
♫  Because I’m gonna take everything I’ve got, just.  ♫

660
01:06:02,540 --> 01:06:07,080
♫  Follow the noise, follow the whispered breeze.  ♫

661
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:11,680
♫  Gotta keep the search but I’m so exhausted.  ♫

667

♫  The flying of the leaves, follow the smell of the tree.  ♫

668
01:06:56,020 --> 01:07:00,510
Ryu Jung Kwon!

669

♫  Keep looking for trees.  ♫

 L.U.C.A.: The Beginning  

676
01:07:32,910 --> 01:07:34,850
 Arrest him quickly. He's a murderer.  

677
01:07:34,850 --> 01:07:36,690
 Doesn't it feel as if the media is determining the direction of investigation? 

678
01:07:36,690 --> 01:07:39,360
 So, are you going to do what the press tells you to do? 

679
01:07:39,360 --> 01:07:41,410
 I'll clean up the aftermath. 

680
01:07:41,410 --> 01:07:45,330
 Going forward, work under me. I'll give you one thing you want. 

681
01:07:45,330 --> 01:07:48,240
 The target wasn't Human Tech, but Ryu Jung Kwon.  

682
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:53,620
 Her full name is Ha Neul Ae Gu Reum. The police released her photo. 

683
01:07:53,620 --> 01:07:55,080
 Are you looking for Ji Oh? 

684
01:07:55,080 --> 01:07:58,270
 I'll kill them myself. 

685
01:07:58,270 --> 01:08:00,360
 Please save me. 

686
01:08:01,430 --> 01:08:05,820
♫   Look at me. Voice to me.  ♫
