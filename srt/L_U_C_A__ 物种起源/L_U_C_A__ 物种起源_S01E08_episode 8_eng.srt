 L.U.C.A.: The Beginning  

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:05,550
♫   Voice to me.  ♫

3
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:10,020
♫   Find tree.  ♫

4
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:14,050
♫  Please let me sleep on it,  ♫

5
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:17,940
♫   so I can breathe in.  ♫

6
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:30,270
 L.U.C.A.: The Beginning  

7
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:36,470
 This is a work of fiction. Any resemblance to actual names, places, organizations, religious references, and incidents is entirely coincidental.  

8
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:43,990
 The episode was filmed with adequate accommodations to ensure the safety and the emotional well-being of the infant and minor actors used. 

9
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:48,270
 Episode 8 

10
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:53,100
Is this the place?

11
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:56,920
I think we've come to the right place.

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:06,050


13
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:13,770
Quite nice.

14
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:20,280
Looks good enough to stay here for a few days.

15
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:32,050
 Captain Choi, Ryu Jung Kwon 

16
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:15,270
 3 Months Later 

17
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:30,100
 Hello? 

18
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,320
I put the suicide note in his pocket.

19
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:59,310
Yes, Sir.

20
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:10,260
 The weather will continue to be clear today. 

21
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:12,090
 The level of fine dust will be average.  

22
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:14,320
-  Later tonight, in the mountain regions,  
  - Let's eat.  

23
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:18,020
  there'll  be a shower accompanied by lightning and thunder. 

24
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:19,410
Come on.

25
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,500
 Next, Dr. Kim, a researcher at Human Tech, 

26
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:29,660
 was found dead in a restricted area along a coastal forest this morning.  

27
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:32,870
 Dr. Kim's body showed no signs of foul play, 

28
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:36,680
 and given the suicide note, the police pronnounced his death to be a suicide. 

29
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:41,520
 Since the murder case at Human Tech, the so-called Lieutenant Ha's case,  

30
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:44,080
 Dr. Kim had been suffering from severe depression. 

31
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:49,720
 Unable to overcome his mental distress, he appears to have made that extreme choice. 

32
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:53,260
 Three months have gone by since the  Lieutenant Ha's case, 

33
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:57,120
 the police have yet to find any clue. 

34
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:04,970
I think I'll have to go.

35
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:08,260
Why, all of sudden?

36
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:10,380
I just heard someone died.

37
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:15,540
Who?

38
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:19,060
That I don't know.

39
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:22,780
All I know is that someone died again because of me.

40
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:35,760
We did end up staying much longer than a few days.

41
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:38,380
I was scared to go back.

42
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:41,380
But now, I think I have to, even if I'm scared.

43
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:44,670
Can't you just forget the whole thing?

44
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:46,780
Can you?

45
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:52,100
Your father suddenly showed up and tried to kill you. Can you just forget about that?

46
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:57,290
These sheep here are deseased and weak, so they aren't fit to live with the herd.

47
00:04:57,290 --> 00:05:00,510
I just need to get them back to health and return  them to their owner.

48
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:03,580
When I care for them, I don't think about anything else.

49
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:08,290
We can't live like this for the rest of our lives without a hope.

50
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:11,650
We can't live like this and just die.

51
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:14,420
To these ailing sheep, I'm their hope.

52
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:19,600
Isn't that enough? Hope shouldn't only be about the unknowable future.

53
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:25,480
Don't make excuses. We fled from the world.

54
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:30,340
They say penguins didn't flee to Antarctica.

55
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:32,770
Rather, they chose to be there.

56
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:39,720
Do you want to keep fighting? Is that the world you want to live in?

57
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:41,910
♫  Your eyes, keep your heart.  ♫

58
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:47,520
♫  The hidden shadow  ♫

59
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:58,320
♫  The light shining through the night  ♫

60
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:01,150
♫  In this life  ♫

61
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:07,310
 How have you survived all your memories? 

62
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:11,320
♫  Sunk into the sadness  ♫

63
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:14,530
♫  With both my eyes closed.  ♫

64
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:21,250
Live here. With me.

65
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:27,600
♫  Hold my hand so I am not afraid,  ♫

66
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,440
Let's live together.

67
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:33,540
♫  Let me hold you in my arms.  ♫

68
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:38,650
But I'm not a penguin. Nor is this Antarctica.
 ♫  I hope we can,   ♫

69
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:43,720
♫  stay together  ♫

70
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:48,650
♫  We don't have to run away  ♫

71
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:55,290
♫  as we do now.  ♫

72
00:07:55,290 --> 00:08:01,960
♫  Your heart raised me up when  ♫

73
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:07,490
♫   I was weary.  ♫

74
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:12,000
♫  The night.  ♫

75
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:22,800
♫  Your image is still so vivid.  ♫

76
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:27,380
♫  Along with my fears,   ♫

77
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:30,670
Should I just live here?
 ♫  that are collapsing.  ♫  

78
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:35,220
♫  Hold on to the memories.  ♫

79
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:38,230
If I just live, will it go away?
 ♫  At the end of hope,  ♫

80
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:44,060
♫  stay by my side.  ♫

81
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:47,970
♫  Hold my hand.  ♫

82
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:51,530
Should I just be that penguin?

83
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:55,350
♫  Let me hold you in my arms  ♫

84
00:08:55,350 --> 00:09:03,720
♫  I hope we can stay together.  ♫

85
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:08,660
♫  We don't have to run away  ♫

86
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:14,230
♫  as we do now.  ♫

87
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:27,000
♫  It's time.  ♫

88
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,420
♫  Time to save our soul  ♫

89
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,220
 Human Tech Research Institute 

90
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:03,580
 Human Tech Laboratory 

91
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:09,520
What are you doing?

92
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,820
Are you still here?

93
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,780
I'm asking. What are you doing?

94
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:16,440
 Completion 

95
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:22,700
It would've been nice if you came a bit later.

96
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:25,190
These bloomed in a rush at last.

97
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:28,200
-What are they?
-This place is too dreary.

98
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,820
I noticed there wasn't a single flower in this entire lab.

99
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:35,020
With us, getting romantic isn't legal.

100
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:40,900
They're pretty and nice. Thanks.

101
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,950
Thank you.

102
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:46,350
I'll take my leave now.

103
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:04,550
Take them out.  I can't have flowers in the lab.

104
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:06,100
Hold on a sec, Dr. Ryu.

105
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,450
Let's take a look at the log-in history.

106
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:20,060
Isn't this a hard copy?

107
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:21,920
Get her.

108
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:59,180
I thought about this yesterday.

109
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:02,830
That I lost everything and all was over.

110
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:05,010
I disagree.

111
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:09,340
I have nothing more that I want. And this is only the beginning.

112
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:12,660
What do you mean, "The beginning?"

113
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,850
We have nothing.

114
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:18,060
No future and no hope.

115
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:20,120
We have you.

116
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,200
That's a silly thing to say.

117
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,990
And we  have me.

118
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:28,550
You're different from others, so you can live like this. But not me.

119
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:31,320
I'm just an ordinary person.

120
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:40,440
Sorry.

121
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,670
It's okay.

122
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:46,950
I didn't want to be different from others.

123
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:50,000
So I've lived hiding myself my whole life.

124
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,490
I begged to be looked upon as ordinary, whenever I got found out about my strange power.

125
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,590
But that didn't work with people.

126
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,870
No one accepted me for who I was.

127
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:05,390
I guess that's because the world is filled with pain.

128
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,570
That's how most people live.

129
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:13,600
Giving pain and alternately, strength, too.

130
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:17,290
If you go now, do you have a person like that with you?

131
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:20,160
A person who gives you strength and comfort?

132
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:30,180
No, however hard I think.

133
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:32,170
No one.

134
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:34,470
Worse, I don't know what to do.

135
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:38,000
Last night, I thought it'd be better to settle and live here  in hiding.

136
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,820
It might've been the rain. I felt at ease.

137
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:43,100
Then the morning came.

138
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:48,060
The rain stopped, and do you know how I feel now?

139
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:51,790
I feel even less confident.

140
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:56,600
With the clarity of all things, I'm even more scared.

141
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:59,170
Nevertheless, being here isn't the best thing to do.

142
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:02,450
It isn't like we're going to have rain every night.

143
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:06,640
Right, it isn't going to rain every night.

144
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,380
I know.

145
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:12,860
That's a fantasy. So is this place.

146
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:15,160
This isn't a real world.

147
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,270
The real world is in reality.

148
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:23,520
Even if I may get broken and die, I ought to get back to the reality.

149
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,660
Hey, Gu Reum.

150
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:28,260
The world outside is like scenery.

151
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:31,970
If I want to take in the view, I will. If I don't, I won't.

152
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:35,020
Ji Oh.

153
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:39,160
I'm going.

154
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,670
Stay here one more day.

155
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:44,630
Take a walk and clear your head.

156
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:02,840
I hear there're people who generate more static  than others.

157
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:05,510
They say I was like that.

158
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:07,950
Who told you that?

159
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,330
The man who said he was my father.

160
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:15,210
Since birth, the problem I had with static was very bad. So I was taken to the place and treated.

161
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:17,300
That place isn't a hospital.

162
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:20,340
I guess I was treated there because the man was a researcher.

163
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:25,880
And he said your father was there, too.

164
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:28,940
My dad?

165
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:33,700
I heard him clearly when he said your dad.

166
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:36,700
 Is her name, Hanuel Ae Gu Reum? 

167
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:40,470
 He showed me the pictures of his daughter and bragged every day. 

168
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:42,690
That wasn't the place where my father worked.

169
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:44,450
He said your father was there, though.

170
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:46,300
How?

171
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:50,440
He said your father treated me. And that he adored me very much.

172
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:53,550
I guess that's why he brought me to your house.

173
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:55,270
And what happened to him?

174
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:58,990
 He set the lab on fire and took you and ran away.  

175
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:01,490
 You didn't resist him and followed him obediently.  

176
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:03,680
 He tried to sell you off.  

177
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:07,070
And there was an accident. That's just about all I know.

178
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:11,340
Was my father invovled in any type of research? For instance, the research the man does?

179
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:14,640
Your father treated me so that he could cure me.

180
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,000
He said your father was a good man.

181
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,880
It's time for you to let him go and your mom, too.

182
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:45,200
All the surrogates have successfully conceived, and they're in good condition. (  Gestation is counted in lunar months 

183
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,660
Does that mean we'll get three more children just like Ji Oh at the end of ten months?

184
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:51,170
They'll probably be more powerful than Ji Oh.

185
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:56,760
The key is preventing their cells from dividing too quickly throughout their growth period through continuous injections.

186
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,510
That'll make our Spiritual Leader ecstatic.

187
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:02,470
She'll rave about  the babies with sparkling eyes and tell the world the angels have arrived.

188
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:04,850
And her followers will flock to her with every dime they have.

189
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:08,630
Speaking of which, it looks like she makes her daily trip to the cabin.

190
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:11,050
No need to see. I believe you.

191
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:23,390
All three baby angels have answered your prayers.

192
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:27,490
That they'll protect you mothers until their coming to the earth.

193
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:29,290
Thank you, Spiritual Leader.

194
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:32,220
I should thank  you. 

195
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:37,160
At the end of ten months, all three of you will receive eternal life as the mothers of the angels.

196
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:42,540
Furthermore, your spirits will be set free, and you'll gain the Eye of God that sees the beginning and the end of the universe.

197
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:47,570
I'm sure she's peddling to those fanatics stuff  like eternal life, gods, the universe and whatnot.

198
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:51,930
Whether you sell a piece of gum or faith, selling isn't easy.

199
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:55,870
So I think sales people deserve our respect.

200
00:19:57,290 --> 00:20:00,330
What do you really want to say?

201
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:05,220
Remember? You promised to give me the rest of the fertilized eggs once they're conceived.

202
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:07,980
- I do. 
 - Give them to me.

203
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:12,070
I've got to collect my pension and quit this place.

204
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:16,070
The lab, that cult leader and whatnot, I'm sick of it all.

205
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:20,390
Where are you going to sell them?

206
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:21,880
Whoever makes the highest bid.

207
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:24,340
Are you going to be okay with this?

208
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:27,200
The Spiritual Leader won't sit back and just watch.

209
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:29,450
Yu Na ran with the research data already.

210
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:32,230
We might as well put the blame on her for this one, too.

211
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:40,850
The capsules  must be stored in a freezer under identical  conditions within 56 hours.

212
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:43,120
If not, they have to be biologically thawed.

213
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:47,010
I know that much. I went to school, you know.

214
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,170
What the hell. They're all gone.

215
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:04,550
I'm positive they were here.

216
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:07,500
What are you talking about? Where did you put them?

217
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:12,380
I definitely left them here. And I'm the only one who knows the passcode to this storage room.

218
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:16,070
When you're the only one who knows, where did they go?

219
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:18,470
Are you messing with me? Where did you put them?

220
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:20,530
I am asking you where are they!

221
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,400
Do you want to be found among the homeless when you're dead?

222
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,040
Killing you is a piece of cake. You won't be even in the news.

223
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,490
I'm telling you. I don't know!

224
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:37,970
I'm sure I implanted  three out of four and kept the rest.

225
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:40,870
And I'm the only one who knows we have fertilized eggs left.

226
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:45,310
The fact that you know it alone makes you the culprit. If not, wh-?

227
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:03,960
I'm not locked up here, am I?

228
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,740
Your guards are quite huge.

229
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:07,610
Can't you decide it yet?

230
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:09,840
On the contrary, I did some time ago.

231
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,110
Then give me the research data and the fertilized eggs.

232
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:17,610
You promised me one thing I want, if I bring them to you before the director snatched them away. Remember?

233
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,260
Whether it's a person or a thing.

234
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:23,480
I did say that.

235
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:28,580
I want Team Leader's freedom. Then I'll give all that I have.

236
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,700
Show me your goods first. Then I'll do as you ask.

237
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,030
No. Promise me first.

238
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:34,580
You're in no position to bargain with me.

239
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:38,380
Once the women downstairs give births, I don't need you or the fertilized eggs.

240
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:41,680
All I want is Team Leader's freedom. That's enough.

241
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:46,740
I had a feeling. Still, you're bringing tears to my eyes.

242
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:53,300
But hasn't it occurred to you that I could kill him to get you to talk?

243
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:55,490
Don't be so naive.

244
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:57,160
Or else, you'll live at the bottom all your life.

245
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,850
I won't sit still and just take it.

246
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:02,500
What, are you going to kill me then?

247
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:04,140
I am.

248
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:09,860
Thinking the way you do makes you naive. How frustrating.

249
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:06,830
Ji Oh.

250
00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:18,800
What's up? What happened?

251
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:22,280
I thought it might live, if only for a moment.

252
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:25,320
I thought I could save  it.

253
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:32,450
Was it sick to begin with, or did it get sick?

254
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:34,820
It was born fragile.

255
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,330
Are you okay?

256
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:03,070
It was weak at birth. So it couldn't suckle the breasts of its mother.

257
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:08,410
It was brought here and barely nursed back to health.

258
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:11,070
Looks like it wasn't adept at adjusting to the rest of the herd.

259
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:17,840
It was rejected by its own kind just as I am.

260
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:31,010
I'll stay here for a few more days, but not too long.

261
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:43,320
♫  Your eyes, keep your heart  ♫

262
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:48,860
♫  The hidden shadow  ♫

267
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:25,400

268

♫  So I am not afraid  ♫

269
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,020
I was looking at a dolphin.

270
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:36,700
"A dolphin is a mysterious animal."

271
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:40,070
"It is a large mammal, but  more specifically, it's a cetacean."
♫  Together  ♫

♫  The night  ♫

277
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:16,560
 Next. While under suspicion for murder, Lieutenant Ha  attacked her fellow police officer, 

278
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:22,580
 and fled with his gun. Several months have elapsed since the incident." 

279
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:28,840
 The police failed to locate Lieutenant Ha, and her case has gone cold. 

280
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:36,280
♫  Along with my fears that are collapsing, hold on to the memories.   ♫

288
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:23,100
Are you saying the ultrasound test results aren't coming along?

289
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:26,660
I hear some micro-electric currents run through the fetuses and interfere with their currents.

290
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:29,940
Though we  can hardly see the fetuses, I'm told they're healthy.

291
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:35,890
The day of glory we've all been awaiting for decades  is soon coming. Nothing must go wrong.

292
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:38,770
Are you still looking for Yu Na?

293
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:44,590
If she'd sold or transferred the eggs, she would've popped up in my search radar, but there's been no trace of her, yet.

294
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:49,240
I'm inclined to think she's keeping them like an insurance policy.

295
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:51,310
An insurance policy?

296
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:57,800
Do you have any insurance policies that I don't know about, Director?

297
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:01,570
Even if I do, would I tell you?

298
00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:03,780
When we plant seed, we become a united front.

299
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:07,660
But at the time of harvest, it's our nature to preoccupy ourselves with our own interests in mind.

300
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:12,780
I advise you not to do that, since my compensation for you will be so lavish you'll think it excessive.

301
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:16,610
Till the end, don't turn your back on me.

302
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:20,450
Now that you said it,

303
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:24,040
I have a feeling it's going to be you who will desert me.

304
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:31,900
If anyone forsakes anyone, it'll be me. So I'm telling you to not change, Director Kim.

305
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:33,750
Got it?

306
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:17,200
- Aren't they so tiny? 
 - Yeah, really tiny.

307
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:14,460
 Director Kim Cheol Su 

308
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:25,640
- Report the situation.
- Nothing's out of the ordinary.

309
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,480
What about Yu Na?

310
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:33,940
I haven't seen her yet.

311
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:36,020
Keep watching.

312
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:49,510
 You can't let his existence come out in the open. 

313
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:53,710
 If he marries and produces a child, it's anyone's guess what that'll be. 

314
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:55,510
 It's a monster. 

315
00:31:55,510 --> 00:32:00,390
 and a despicable hybrid. He'll destroy the ecosystem we humans have built. 

316
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:48,760
It's okay.

317
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:53,010
All is fine.

318
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:59,530
Gu Reum, are you okay? What is it?

319
00:32:59,530 --> 00:33:02,140
- Why? 
 - I'm fine.

320
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,200
Does that keep happening?

321
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:13,710
Sometimes. No, often.

322
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:18,000
Is it normal for a baby to be this active?

323
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,470
I wouldn't know. It's my first-time pregnancy.

324
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:23,120
Me too.

325
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,300
Why?

326
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,510
I've never thought about getting married.

327
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:35,900
Much less having a child before marriage.

328
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:42,110
I thought a family was the most selfish of all groups made by the weakest of us.

329
00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:44,960
I was confident that I'd never lean on anyone.

330
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:48,430
So I thought I'd never have a family.

331
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:52,550
- So you pretended to be strong? 
 - I did because I was afraid.

332
00:33:53,590 --> 00:34:00,400
What if our baby is born a monster like me?

333
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:04,110
What if it gets thrown out of the world just as I am?

334
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:08,960
- Ji Oh. 
 - I desperately hope it'll take after you.

335
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:14,180
I hope it won't look like me at all and be beautiful in every way just like you.

336
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:15,980
You're not a monster.

337
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:20,480
So  our child also is no monster.

338
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,320
Let me hear your answer.

339
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:26,170
I won't let our baby live the way I do.

340
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:32,390
I won't let it live like me, even if I have to destroy this world and make a new one.

341
00:34:32,390 --> 00:34:34,530
That's not going to happen.

342
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:37,100
A monster is a creation of thoughts.

343
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:41,420
Don't say things like that ever again. Got it?

344
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:43,420
Okay?

345
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:46,700
Say it louder.

346
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:51,020
Come here.

347
00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:54,850
What a good boy.

348
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,810
Won Yi!

349
00:35:08,050 --> 00:35:10,560
It's not my business to know how you've been getting on.

350
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:14,230
So let's skp the question like how or what we've been doing.

351
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:16,200
- Have you been well? 
 - Damn it.

352
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:23,360
Never mind. Give me the money. Fifteen hundred each. So you owe me, three thousand.

353
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:30,290
- This isn't a counterfeit, is it?
 - What about the IDs?

354
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:35,060
Where are they?

355
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:40,490
Here. You're Jin Fengguo, and this woman here is Li Xuenan.

356
00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:44,430
These are the cell phones in those names.

357
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:46,270
 Alien Registration Card
 Jin Fengguo 
 Li Xuenan 

358
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:49,280
-What are these?
-Your IDs.

359
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,840
But these are IDs for foreigners.

360
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:55,530
Yes, foreign IDs. Jin Fengguo. Li Xuenan.

361
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:57,600
I asked you to make us driver's licenses.

362
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:01,360
Be quiet. You're making me confused.

363
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:05,190
I'm sure you gave me the correct amount of money. You did, right?

364
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:09,780
Ji Oh, you're a fugitive who committed a crime. You shouldn't be nitpicking about your nationality.

365
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:13,500
But these are IDs for Chinese.

366
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:15,620
Be thankful that you get to be Chinese. You punk.

367
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:19,080
- It's a nation on a par with America. 
 - Still, these won't work.

368
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:22,590
They include your medical insurance, so use them for the time being.

369
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:26,420
A few years later, I'll change them into F5 visas for you.

370
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:30,980
But getting you the visas for permanent residency is quite expensive. So don't ask for  a discount.

371
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,940
I told you I'd need Korean resident IDs.

372
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:35,090
China is the best.

373
00:36:35,090 --> 00:36:38,900
You know what G2 is, right? They are G2.

374
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:41,740
Global Number 2. G2.

375
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:43,280
I'm going to have to register a birth. That's why.

376
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:46,670
Why would you register your birth? At your age?

377
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:49,670
- What? Do you want to live your life again as an infant?
 - Not me, our baby.

378
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:52,230
"Our baby?" Who's that?

379
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:55,630
We're having a baby. I'm going to be a father next month.

380
00:36:56,730 --> 00:37:03,240
Let me get this right. So the lady detective slash murderer and you are having a baby?

381
00:37:04,170 --> 00:37:08,050
You crazy bastard. You hopeless jerk.

382
00:37:08,050 --> 00:37:11,600
Okay, you two were on the run. And in that circumstance,

383
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:15,650
you let your passion take over you. Still, you jerk.

384
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:19,330
It's not true, is it? You're messing with me, right?

385
00:37:19,330 --> 00:37:21,960
It's true.

386
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:26,030
Hey, you can't. How can you be a dad?

387
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:32,930
- Okay. What about the wedding?
 - We haven't gotten one, yet.

388
00:37:32,930 --> 00:37:37,250
Fine,  it won't be too late to get one once  you get a paternity test.

389
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:40,750
- But Ji Oh, that woman is a murderer.
 - You got it wrong.

390
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:43,210
What do you mean, "No"?  She's on a wanted list.

391
00:37:43,210 --> 00:37:46,890
Besides, the world is full of criminals. Why out of everyone does it have to be her?

392
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:49,210
Anyhow, I'll use these for the hospital.

393
00:37:49,210 --> 00:37:52,700
But by next month, you better get me Korean IDs.

394
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:56,530
- I'll be going then. 
 - Where are you going, your jerk? Sit down.

395
00:37:57,390 --> 00:37:59,260
Do you have the money to raise that child?

396
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:01,830
Yeah, I work a little and earn a living.

397
00:38:01,830 --> 00:38:04,490
- Are you willing to raise that child?
 - You don't raise a child with willingness.

398
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:07,730
You've got to. With your willingness. Or else,

399
00:38:07,730 --> 00:38:10,290
your kid ends up like us. Do you get it?

400
00:38:14,850 --> 00:38:18,680
I'll call you when I get your driver's licenses.

401
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:22,040
Use this for baby formula. Buy the very best.

402
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:25,970
Hey, Won Yi!

403
00:38:31,330 --> 00:38:35,990
The days have been long and arduous full of trials.

404
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:39,720
Your due dates are just around the corner, so all of you will be moved to the main santuary.

405
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:43,290
The others will pack your things for you, so you can just bring yourselves.

406
00:38:43,290 --> 00:38:44,960
Shall we get up now?

407
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:51,050
I'm asking only because we aren't sure. There is no problem, is there?

408
00:38:51,050 --> 00:38:54,130
- What kind of problem?
 - The fetal movements are quite strong.

409
00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:57,780
The intensity of the baby's kicks is... how shall I put this?

410
00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:00,190
It's so strong that my entire body vibrates.

411
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:05,790
We've never borne children  before, but we didn't hear the intensity would be this strong.

412
00:39:05,790 --> 00:39:09,320
The child you're carrying isn't an ordinary child.

413
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:13,390
These aren't fetal movements, but the proof that the heaven and the earth will shake.

414
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:17,310
There's one more thing.

415
00:39:19,330 --> 00:39:23,390
Since last month, I felt like there was an electric current coursing through my whole body.

416
00:39:23,390 --> 00:39:26,530
It was more than the shock you get from static.

417
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:30,080
I thought I was alone, but the others said they felt it, too.

418
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:32,900
Did you feel an eletric current? A lot?

419
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:35,860
If it was something tolerable, we wouldn't have come to you.

420
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:37,930
All of us have lost our consciousness several times.

421
00:39:37,930 --> 00:39:42,150
From my belly, the electric current spread throughout my body.

422
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:45,240
It felt like all my blood was going to dry up.

423
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:28,170
They've gone crazy, and yet so beautifully crazy.

424
00:40:33,810 --> 00:40:38,290
- No, let's take it all. Put it in here?
 - Yeah.

425
00:40:38,290 --> 00:40:40,090
Take this, too.

426
00:40:41,090 --> 00:40:45,380
If my mom were here, she'd really look after us.

427
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:47,210
We can live a good life, can't we?

428
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:51,960
Yes, we can live a really good life. Don't worry.

429
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:54,950
Thanks for answering the way you just did.

430
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:06,660
What is it? A gift?

431
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:12,090
Clothes. Did you buy it?

432
00:41:12,090 --> 00:41:14,880
Did you know how to buy something like this?

433
00:41:16,370 --> 00:41:18,990
How do I look? Pretty?

434
00:41:18,990 --> 00:41:20,680
Pretty.

435
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:24,900
It's too white to be used for work clothes.

436
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:29,540
It's not work clothes. It's a wedding dress.

437
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:38,460
Here I come, come. Let me look at you. Ready?

438
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:40,550
The photo was taken.

439
00:41:42,610 --> 00:41:45,180
I think it was taken. But maybe, it was taken too soon.

440
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:47,170
Come take a look.

441
00:41:47,910 --> 00:41:53,020
It took the photo while I was coming over to you.

442
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:55,710
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

443
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:57,360
No, wait.

444
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:01,840
It  already took the picture.

445
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,510
This photo came out well. Let's use this.

446
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:10,240
No, we have to take it again.

447
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:14,590
Look at it. It's a bit... you know.

448
00:42:14,590 --> 00:42:16,980
- It looks fine to me. 
 - You look pretty, but I...

449
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:20,290
I don't look like I'm smiling. And yet, I'm not  not  smiling. And my hair doesn't look all that great.

450
00:42:20,290 --> 00:42:22,480
Come on, you look just fine. You look cute.

451
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:24,770
Besides, for wedding pictures, if the woman looks good, then all is okay.

452
00:42:24,770 --> 00:42:26,670
- It's fine.
 - Alright, let's take another.

453
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:30,000
Even if we do, it will look the same.

454
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,920
One, two.

455
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:45,210
You're so pretty.

456
00:43:33,350 --> 00:43:35,990
So, all there's left to do is for them to give birth to their babies?

457
00:43:35,990 --> 00:43:38,210
There may be some variables depending on the conditions of the fetuses.

458
00:43:38,210 --> 00:43:40,890
You said that the fetuses were healthy.

459
00:43:40,890 --> 00:43:44,570
Regardless of what  happens to the mothers, make sure you get the babies.

460
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:52,690
Ji Oh.

461
00:43:59,450 --> 00:44:02,290
Don't stop breathing. Please keep breathing.

462
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:06,820
 Try breathing from your abdomen. 

463
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:21,810
 Main Operation Room  

464
00:44:21,810 --> 00:44:26,360
 Please push a little more. Breathe. Inhale deeply. 

465
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:31,150
 Exhale, and push out your upper abdomen. 

466
00:44:31,150 --> 00:44:33,180
 Once more time. 

467
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:44,600
I'll inject  sedatives.

468
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:47,190
Tie them down and prepare for surgery. I'll try to get the babies out.

469
00:44:47,190 --> 00:44:49,230
We can see the baby's head.

470
00:44:49,230 --> 00:44:53,160
One more time. Inhale deeply.

471
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:56,750
Exhale deeply. Push. Good.

472
00:44:56,750 --> 00:45:01,030
A little more. Inhale.

473
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:04,690
Exhale.

474
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:31,240
Dr. Ryu.

475
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:33,790
What will happen to me?

476
00:46:33,790 --> 00:46:37,310
Come to your senses. You must hang on.

477
00:46:37,310 --> 00:46:40,400
It's your baby. You can overcome this.

478
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,330
Fight!

479
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:49,430
Don't go weak on me!

480
00:46:52,070 --> 00:46:54,170
No!!

481
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:16,580
Congratulations.

482
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:18,660
You did a good job today.

483
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:40,750
Come and hold your baby.

484
00:47:48,990 --> 00:47:52,720
Hold her. It's our baby.

485
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:08,860
Do you want to hold her later once you're calm?

486
00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:16,870
How can a thing like this happen?

487
00:48:16,870 --> 00:48:20,180
The fetuses were too strong.

488
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:22,640
Too strong for humans to withstand them.

489
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:24,560
But Ji Oh was born.

490
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:27,340
I strengthened their powers more than Ji Oh's.

491
00:48:27,340 --> 00:48:32,660
I stabilized the fetuses enough for the surrogates to withstand them. But as the cells were waking up at the end—

492
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:34,660
Well, enough.

493
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:38,200
So what will you do now?

494
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:41,970
What else? We have no choice but to get Ji Oh back in here.

495
00:48:41,970 --> 00:48:45,520
Let's not talk about things that aren't probable.

496
00:48:46,650 --> 00:48:47,740
Do you have a way?

497
00:48:47,740 --> 00:48:50,770
I extracted the cells from the fetuses, and I'm getting them cultured in the incubators.

498
00:48:50,770 --> 00:48:52,890
That'll only produce the same kinds of fetuses.

499
00:48:52,890 --> 00:48:57,420
Reducing their strengths weaken their powers. But empowering them causes the surrogates to fall apart.

500
00:48:57,420 --> 00:48:58,950
The whole thing shouldn't be like a Moebius strip.

501
00:48:58,950 --> 00:49:01,810
You can just be quiet.

502
00:49:01,810 --> 00:49:04,160
The only way is to catch Ji Oh again.

503
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:07,640
You're the one who got the lab blown up because you couldn't control Ji Oh.

504
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:11,220
Are you going to bring Ji Oh  here only to blow this place up, too?

505
00:49:14,170 --> 00:49:17,130
Is there a way to decrease the strength of the cells a little?

506
00:49:17,130 --> 00:49:22,150
Although I'll have to modify all the genes again, I'd better try that.

507
00:49:22,150 --> 00:49:26,780
Say, you do the remodification. When will we know if the result is a success or a failure?

508
00:49:26,780 --> 00:49:31,450
We'll know only after we get the fanatics to conceive and wait ten months. correct?

509
00:49:31,450 --> 00:49:35,310
- It would be better if we get the original cells from Ji Oh— 
 - Hey!

510
00:49:35,310 --> 00:49:41,780
Dr. Ryu does the research, and I fund it. You just pipe down and do what you're told to do.

511
00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:43,880
Don't you know that I'm the one who made you what you are today?

512
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:48,210
Don't you know it was I who kept you in that organization?

513
00:49:48,210 --> 00:49:54,240
You can't cut me off, but I can cut you.  Get a grip.

514
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:58,490
Okay. I give up.

515
00:49:58,490 --> 00:50:00,050
I'm out.

516
00:50:00,050 --> 00:50:02,200
Director Kim.

517
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:07,050
I've wasted more than 20 years here.

518
00:50:07,050 --> 00:50:10,420
I'm too old to clean up after a thing that makes no sense.

519
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:16,230
I hope the two of you make a beautiful day of glory.

520
00:51:09,460 --> 00:51:10,460
Yes, Director?

521
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:12,950
- Where are you now?
 - I'm taking a little break.

522
00:51:12,950 --> 00:51:15,440
Are you still going around looking for Yu Na?

523
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:18,540
Yes.

524
00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:22,020
Kill that bitch later. You have to catch Ji Oh first.

525
00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:24,180
Come to the front of my office.

526
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:04,600
Director called, so I came—

527
00:52:12,790 --> 00:52:17,560
That bastard. So rude.

528
00:52:19,620 --> 00:52:23,610
 Case summary of a missing person: Ha Yeong Jae and his wife. 

529
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:44,520
I think it's time for you to hand over those fertilized eggs to me.

530
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:46,110
Give Team Leader his freedom first.

531
00:52:46,110 --> 00:52:47,190
You're the same as ever.

532
00:52:47,190 --> 00:52:51,550
If I keep holding out, you could kill me and Team Leader, too. Right?

533
00:52:51,550 --> 00:52:53,230
While knowing that, do you still act  this way?

534
00:52:53,230 --> 00:52:57,420
I thought about it, and I concluded it'd be alright  to die rather than to live like this.

535
00:52:57,420 --> 00:52:58,860
You are quite stubborn.

536
00:52:58,860 --> 00:53:01,320
Rather, I am strong-willed.

537
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:05,720
- Are those fertilized eggs safe?
 - Yes.

538
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:11,460
Fine. I'll help set free Lee Son from the hands of Director Kim.

539
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:13,220
That's enough, right?

540
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:15,690
- Yes, that's enough.
 - I'll make that happen.

541
00:53:15,690 --> 00:53:17,710
Really?

542
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:21,330
How can you guarantee me that?

543
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:24,510
Director Jeong.

544
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:42,120
Lee Son threw a real grenade thinking it was a non-lethal flash grenade during a counter-terrorist exercise.

545
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:44,790
He killed nine.

546
00:53:44,790 --> 00:53:50,660
You killed five people by mistaking live rounds for blanks during a bilateral training exercise.

547
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:52,490
You were sentenced to life-in-prison and attempted a suicide. Correct?

548
00:53:52,490 --> 00:53:53,400
Who are you?

549
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:56,780
Director Kim orchestrated all that.

550
00:53:56,780 --> 00:53:58,960
You didn't have the slightest idea?

551
00:54:00,190 --> 00:54:01,320
I suspected that much.

552
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:04,470
It's one of the tactics older military men liked to use.

553
00:54:04,470 --> 00:54:08,190
Pushing folks down to hell and then, coming to their rescue.

554
00:54:08,190 --> 00:54:11,060
That way, the folks turn into their devoted slaves.

555
00:54:11,060 --> 00:54:14,110
Of course, I don't enjoy using that tactic.

556
00:54:15,350 --> 00:54:18,870
You've been through a lot. But getting back your reputation isn't easy.

557
00:54:18,870 --> 00:54:22,300
And it's impossible for you to get a retrial.

558
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:27,090
Instead, I'll give you freedom. Plus, a new identity. And money on the side.

559
00:54:27,090 --> 00:54:31,060
How can you prove to me that you aren't the same kind as he?

560
00:54:31,060 --> 00:54:35,010
Not sure. By faith?

561
00:54:38,820 --> 00:54:40,740
We've got a daughter.

562
00:54:40,740 --> 00:54:42,230
I know.

563
00:54:42,230 --> 00:54:45,850
She doesn't look like me at all. She looks after you in every way.  What a relief.

564
00:54:45,850 --> 00:54:49,220
I wasn't quite myself, and I didn't get a chance to count her fingers and toes.

565
00:54:49,220 --> 00:54:54,510
I saw them. She has beautiful ten of everything just like you.

566
00:54:54,510 --> 00:54:57,890
We have to name her. Do you have anything in mind?

567
00:54:57,890 --> 00:55:00,400
Can I- Can I name her?

568
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:03,700
What are you saying? You are her dad.

569
00:55:04,890 --> 00:55:06,730
But still...

570
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:10,650
Give her a name.

571
00:55:10,650 --> 00:55:16,210
Not a long one like Haneul Ae Gu Reum. Or, nothing as vague as Lee Seol Ran.

572
00:55:16,210 --> 00:55:19,290
Give her a pretty name.

573
00:55:19,290 --> 00:55:20,360
Okay.

574
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:23,700
Don't use a professional service for naming.  Pick one yourself.

575
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:30,180
Gu Reum, our IDs are here.

576
00:55:30,180 --> 00:55:33,720
Do you have to go now? Can't you go later after I leave the hospital?

577
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:34,900
I'll be right back.

578
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:38,680
We should get them quick so we can register our child's birth.

579
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:41,850
I'll be back soon.

580
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:26,090
I'm a dad now.

581
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:28,470
- Are you that happy?
 - Yeah.

582
00:56:28,470 --> 00:56:33,360
Yeah. Happy I am.  But it's different. I can't really explain it in words.

583
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:37,920
Of course. If we were good at explaining things, we would've become instructors.

584
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:39,640
So is it a son or daughter?

585
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:41,450
Daughter. She's so pretty.

586
00:56:41,450 --> 00:56:44,530
Look at you. You act like a proud parent.

587
00:56:44,530 --> 00:56:46,470
- Name?
 - We haven't named her yet.

588
00:56:46,470 --> 00:56:51,080
I thought of one, but I'm afraid if I name her, some of my bad energy might rub off on her.

589
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:54,090
Right, right, that could happen.

590
00:56:54,090 --> 00:56:56,000
Would it be better if I name her?

591
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,610
After all, I give off better energy than you. And I'm a good person.

592
00:56:59,610 --> 00:57:02,850
- No, you can't.
 - Ah, you bastard.

593
00:57:06,230 --> 00:57:08,570
Take them.

594
00:57:08,570 --> 00:57:09,520
 Lee Seol Ran 
 Kim Bong Guk 

595
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:11,700
Thanks. How much do I owe you?

596
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:15,100
Well, how about a million dollars?

597
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:18,360
I still have all the money you gave back to me last time.

598
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:22,090
Never mind. Consider it my wedding gift to you.

599
00:57:22,090 --> 00:57:24,220
I really don't have to pay?

600
00:57:24,220 --> 00:57:26,320
You can't do that, you jerk.

601
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:30,240
Any idea how much they're worth? You should, at least,  show a token of your appreciation.

602
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:31,530
Got it.

603
00:57:31,530 --> 00:57:37,290
Hey, I said you're fine. Why bring up money all the time?  I told you it's my wedding gift.

604
00:57:37,290 --> 00:57:41,360
Oh, right. These are nutritional supplements.

605
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:44,000
Give them to that murderer slash detective.

606
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,710
She didn't kill anyone.

607
00:57:45,710 --> 00:57:50,600
Sorry. The fugitive detective. I guess she's a mom now.

608
00:57:52,070 --> 00:57:54,890
Thanks. I'll make sure she gets them.

609
00:57:54,890 --> 00:57:56,390
I'll be going now.

610
00:57:56,390 --> 00:57:58,380
What? Not going to have a drink with me?

611
00:57:58,380 --> 00:58:01,020
I think I have to go. Let's drink together next time.

612
00:58:01,020 --> 00:58:05,210
Hey, I went out my way to do a thing that's illegal for you. The least you can do is to drink with me.

613
00:58:05,210 --> 00:58:07,610
I can't remember the face of my baby at the moment.

614
00:58:07,610 --> 00:58:09,130
Didn't you say she was pretty?

615
00:58:09,130 --> 00:58:12,180
She's pretty. She is. But I can't remember her face well. So I want to see her again fast.

616
00:58:12,180 --> 00:58:15,740
Alright. Then how about a quick one?

617
00:58:15,740 --> 00:58:18,190
Hey, I didn't get to hold my baby yet.

618
00:58:18,190 --> 00:58:21,320
Go. Get lost, you jerk.

619
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:22,510
Thanks, Won Yi.

620
00:58:22,510 --> 00:58:23,600
Just how grateful are you?

621
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:26,000
I will be grateful to you for 50 years.

622
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:31,360
You'll grow old and die just thanking me if you do that for 50 years at your age.

623
00:58:32,910 --> 00:58:35,780
Thanks for being friends with a guy like me.

624
00:58:37,460 --> 00:58:39,900
I hope I'm not getting an electric shock or anything like that.

625
00:58:42,650 --> 00:58:45,270
Look at that.

626
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:53,910
It hurts. Let go.

627
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:56,600
I'm going.

628
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:14,610
Yes?

629
00:59:14,610 --> 00:59:17,730
 Ms. Lee Seol Ran, it's time to sanitize the room for the newborn. 

630
00:59:17,730 --> 00:59:19,020
 Please take your baby. 

631
00:59:19,020 --> 00:59:20,920
Yes.

632
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:28,360
 At the site of the accident, remains of two bodies were found in a car. 

633
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:32,520
 After identifying the license plate, the police believe that the deceased are 

634
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:35,900
 Ha Yeong Jae and his wife, Lee Yeon Gyeong. 

635
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:39,150
 The couple went missing 20 years ago.  

636
00:59:39,150 --> 00:59:41,590
 Because they fell in a valley that's rarely visited by people, 

637
00:59:41,590 --> 00:59:45,440
 they couldn't be found until now. 

638
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:49,330
 Compared to the minor damage done to the exterior of the vehicle when it was found,   

639
00:59:49,330 --> 00:59:52,980
 it's been reported the vehicle's interior was completely burned. 

640
00:59:52,980 --> 00:59:58,900
 The National Forensic Service was unable to find any remains of inflammables or the point of the origin of the fire. 

641
00:59:58,900 --> 01:00:03,130
 And considering all the interior wirings of the vehicle were also burned, 

642
01:00:03,130 --> 01:00:09,000
 NFS presumes that electricity of tremendous voltage went through the vehicle. 

643
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:10,910
 What's wrong? 

644
01:00:10,910 --> 01:00:13,950
 Dad! Dad! 

645
01:00:24,940 --> 01:00:29,080
 Juan Metropolitan Police Agency 

646
01:00:33,820 --> 01:00:37,120
Yes, Crime Investigative Unit One.

647
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:39,320
Hello?

648
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:43,000
Hello?

649
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,160
 Seonbae-nim. 

650
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:45,970
Yes, who is this?

651
01:00:45,970 --> 01:00:48,210
Seonbae, it's me.

652
01:00:48,210 --> 01:00:51,060
I don't know any younger females who would call—

653
01:00:51,060 --> 01:00:52,870
Wait, you—

654
01:00:54,460 --> 01:00:59,040
Hey, it's you. Right?

655
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:00,290
Yes, it's me.

656
01:01:00,290 --> 01:01:04,760
You- where are you right now?

657
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:07,350
Are you alone now?

658
01:01:07,350 --> 01:01:09,190
Of course not.

659
01:01:09,190 --> 01:01:13,600
You remember my number, right? Write it down.

660
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:15,560
010...

661
01:01:27,390 --> 01:01:28,760
Hey, where are you?

662
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:32,560
Hey, you. Do you think living on the run will solve your case?

663
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:34,100
It's not me. I didn't do that.

664
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:37,610
I know that. Even if the evidence is perfect, I know it isn't you.

665
01:01:37,610 --> 01:01:39,430
There're many strange things about the case.

666
01:01:39,430 --> 01:01:40,790
Let me ask you one thing.

667
01:01:40,790 --> 01:01:42,230
 What is it? 

668
01:01:42,230 --> 01:01:44,550
What happened in the case of Ha Yeong Jae?

669
01:01:44,550 --> 01:01:46,870
Ha Yeong Jae? Who is that?

670
01:01:46,870 --> 01:01:49,220
The man went missing 20 years ago.

671
01:01:49,220 --> 01:01:52,040
Oh, that case. What about it?

672
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:55,170
Was it really the high-voltage electricity that caused what happened to him?

673
01:01:55,170 --> 01:01:59,870
We wouldn't know. That's what the NFS says, so we assume that's what happened.

674
01:01:59,870 --> 01:02:02,030
The car was fine on the outside,

675
01:02:02,030 --> 01:02:05,800
but the inside was completely burned with the wirings and all. So that's a possibility.

676
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:07,500
But why do you ask that?

677
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:10,960
Please get me a DNA sample from the remains.

678
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:14,760
Hey, Gu Reum. You're not in a position to be doing this.

679
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:16,920
Contact me once you get the sample.

680
01:02:16,920 --> 01:02:20,100
And you must never tell Team Captain.

681
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:22,650
I will contact you later.

682
01:02:23,350 --> 01:02:25,790
Hey? Hello? Hello?

683
01:02:27,710 --> 01:02:29,910
What the heck.

684
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:34,510
Why are you so surprised?

685
01:02:34,510 --> 01:02:38,890
Surprised? Who's surprised?

686
01:02:38,890 --> 01:02:42,330
I heard you whispering. Who were you talking to?

687
01:02:42,330 --> 01:02:44,030
Are you cheating on your wife?

688
01:02:44,030 --> 01:02:46,490
Cheating on my wife? Come on.

689
01:02:46,490 --> 01:02:49,160
Just some younger person, I know.

690
01:02:49,160 --> 01:02:52,850
- A woman?
 - No, a man.

691
01:02:53,720 --> 01:02:57,160
Oh, I have to pee. I need to use the bathroom.

692
01:03:16,950 --> 01:03:19,530
It's me.

693
01:03:19,530 --> 01:03:25,150
Look into the call records for the call just made to the office, and to Detective Kim Yu Cheol.

694
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:29,610
 He said your father treated me. And that he adored me very much. 

695
01:03:29,610 --> 01:03:31,750
 I guess that's why he brought me to your house. 

696
01:03:31,750 --> 01:03:35,990
  It's time for you to let your father go and your mom, too. 

697
01:03:44,850 --> 01:03:47,490
What's wrong?

698
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:49,660
Do you want me to hold you, Sweetie?

699
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:52,700
There.

700
01:03:56,560 --> 01:04:02,030
 Hospital Entrance 

701
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:31,590
Where is the new mom in Room 303 and the baby?

702
01:04:31,590 --> 01:04:33,250
What's the name of your wife?

703
01:04:33,250 --> 01:04:35,290
Haneul-  It's Lee Seol Ran.

704
01:04:35,290 --> 01:04:37,010
Did you say, "Lee Seol  Ran?"

705
01:04:39,510 --> 01:04:41,690
- She checked out.
 - What?

706
01:04:41,690 --> 01:04:44,790
She checked out a little while ago with her guardian.

707
01:04:44,790 --> 01:04:46,290
But I  am  her guardian.

708
01:04:46,290 --> 01:04:50,020
She paid the hospital and left the hospital with her guardian.

709
01:04:50,020 --> 01:04:52,650
- But I'm the guardian, her husband.
 - Oh, I see.

710
01:04:52,650 --> 01:04:54,690
Your wife left with the guardian, though.

711
01:04:54,690 --> 01:04:56,150
With whom?

712
01:04:56,150 --> 01:04:57,620
What's going on?

713
01:04:57,620 --> 01:05:01,700
He's a Korean-Chinese. I've been telling him his wife left the hospital, but he insists he's her husband.

714
01:05:01,700 --> 01:05:05,350
Hello, Nurse. You remember me, right? I've been here all this time.

715
01:05:05,350 --> 01:05:07,830
You can't cause a scene here.

716
01:05:07,830 --> 01:05:11,670
But I'm her husband. Who did she leave with-

717
01:05:11,670 --> 01:05:13,360
Can I look at the CCTV here?

718
01:05:13,360 --> 01:05:17,140
We do have CCTVs, but we must obey the personal information protection law.

719
01:05:17,140 --> 01:05:19,750
Unless you're authorized, it's difficult for you to see the cameras.

720
01:05:19,750 --> 01:05:25,180
Check against this ID the signature I used on the guardian consent form when my wife was admitted.

721
01:05:30,390 --> 01:05:33,190
Hold on a sec.

722
01:05:33,190 --> 01:05:35,650
Do you know that man?

723
01:05:42,340 --> 01:05:44,390
Detective Ha?

724
01:05:46,820 --> 01:05:48,840
I'm not that person. Who are you?

725
01:05:48,840 --> 01:05:53,040
Hey, I remember you.

726
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:55,050
Who are you?

727
01:05:56,490 --> 01:05:58,520
You'll wake up your baby.

728
01:06:03,300 --> 01:06:06,430
Listen to me if  you want your baby to live.

729
01:06:06,430 --> 01:06:08,000
We will leave here quietly.

730
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:12,480
Pack your bag and pay the hospital. All very naturally.

731
01:06:27,370 --> 01:06:29,540
Give me my baby.

732
01:06:29,540 --> 01:06:31,390
Once we get there.

733
01:06:31,390 --> 01:06:33,790
Where are you taking me?

734
01:06:35,490 --> 01:06:38,690
Just give me my baby and I'll follow you quietly.

735
01:06:48,830 --> 01:06:50,690
Please.

736
01:06:54,630 --> 01:06:58,850
What is your identity? How are you involved with Detective Kim?

737
01:06:58,850 --> 01:07:00,420
Whose baby is that?

738
01:07:00,420 --> 01:07:02,460
My baby.

739
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:06,870
I hope Ji Oh isn't the father of your baby.

740
01:07:51,320 --> 01:07:58,310


741
01:08:13,060 --> 01:08:16,260
 L.U.C.A.: The Beginning  

742
01:08:16,260 --> 01:08:18,020
 Do they know you're that kind of jerk? 

743
01:08:18,020 --> 01:08:20,960
♫   Find tree.  ♫

744
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:22,060
 Where is Gu Reum? 

745
01:08:22,060 --> 01:08:24,890
 Kill them all. Don't leave any traces behind. 

746
01:08:24,890 --> 01:08:27,470
 Live for yourself. Not for me. 

747
01:08:27,470 --> 01:08:29,070
 That can't be true. 

748
01:08:29,070 --> 01:08:30,160
 Is Ji Oh the father of your baby? 

749
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:32,020
 You could die, you punk. 

750
01:08:32,020 --> 01:08:35,130
 I don't care anymore. For the first time in my life, I have the desire to live. 

751
01:08:35,130 --> 01:08:36,320
 And I've got courage, too. 

752
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:38,140
 Did Ji Oh really do that? 

753
01:08:38,140 --> 01:08:41,300
 If you touch Gu Reum and our baby, you are all dead. 

754
01:08:41,300 --> 01:08:42,860
 It really is Ji Oh, right? 

755
01:08:42,860 --> 01:08:45,180
♫   Everything I’ve got just  ♫

756
01:08:45,180 --> 01:08:48,260
♫   follow the noise, follow the whispered breeze  ♫
