00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:08,880
♫  Voice to me, find tree.  ♫

♫  Please let me sleep on it, so I can breathe in.  ♫

 L.U.C.A.: The Beginning  

5
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:36,520
 This is a work of fiction. Any resemblance to actual names, places, organizations, religious references, and incidents is entirely coincidental.  

6
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:43,080
 The episode was filmed with adequate accommodations to ensure the safety and the emotional well-being of the infant and minor actors used. 

7
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:46,950
 Previously  
 Ji Oh would've used all his power even if that meant his death. 

8
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:50,220
 So he probably won't even be able to remember who he is now. 

9
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:51,520
 Ji Oh, this bastard. 

10
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,940
 So that kid showed up again? 

11
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:54,890
 Yes, we're doing our best to collect him. 

12
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:56,480
 Run away.  

13
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,890
 I said don't do it! 

14
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:01,900
 This may be a great opportunity, but you do realize this is the last chance, don't you? 

15
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:05,200
 Of the two, whoever is alive is a murder suspect. 

16
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,030
 - We've met before, haven't we? 
 - I clearly remember who you are now. 

17
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:15,490
 So you, too, have to get your memories back. 

18
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:17,560
 You have to remember what happened to my mom and dad. 

19
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,990
 He wouldn't die, would he? 

20
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:21,010
  In critical condition, he's still at risk of dying. 

21
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:24,840
 Even if he's dead, bring me his body. As soon as possible, in the freshest condition. 

22
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:28,120
 He ran away. 

23
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:31,120
 He was near death. But he got up! 

24
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:34,640
 He inadvertently kills the weak cells in him, preserving only the strong ones. 

25
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,990
 I waited for you. What have I done to you? 

26
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:39,260
 It is I who have questions for you. 

27
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:53,990


28
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:15,540
 We'll be back, Gu Reum. 

29
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:17,150
 You'll have to stay alone for a bit. 

30
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:19,630
 Where are you going? 

31
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:22,790
 We'll be back soon. It wouldn't even take an hour. 

32
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:25,670
 Let's have pork cutlets for lunch. 

33
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,150
 Mom. 

34
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:35,210
 My baby, instead of pork cutlets, let's go eat something more delicious later. 

35
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:37,030
 What would be more delicious? 

36
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:39,940
 Your dad will buy you whatever you like. 

37
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:50,120
 We'll be back soon.

 Episode 3 

43
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,820
Gu Reum's in an accident.

44
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:31,940
Investigate her case as kidnapped or missing.

45
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:35,300
Block this train station front and back, so not even an ant can escape.

46
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,610
Yes, sir!

47
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:55,950

♫  Voice to me  ♫

49

♫  Find tree.  ♫

50
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:40,790
Is this possible?

51
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:42,940
There's no way this is possible.

52
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:46,130
No, how can this be a ridiculous ass of things?

53
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:51,900
It's an assortment of human DNA and DNAs of jellyfish, electric eels, and even flies.

54
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,440
Aren't these DNAs all genetically modified?

55
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,930
Modifying in so many different ways is impossible,

56
00:06:56,930 --> 00:07:00,960
unless you put all these animals in a mixer to combine their DNAs.

57
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,820
That means their embryonic stem cells were manipulated.

58
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:07,670
Regardless of what technology is used, isn't that illegal?

59
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:11,900
What kind of a person would do something like this unless he's gone crazy?

60
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:15,840
I don't know of anyone who could do something like this except one.

61
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,260
Who is that?

62
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:19,610
Doctor Ryu Jung Kwon.

63
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:22,050
Ryu Jung Kwon?

64
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:25,100
The guy who can't use one of his arms?

65
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:27,710
- You know him? 
- Of course, I do.

66
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:32,920
When he got found out for manipulating human cells for genetic engineering, he was expelled from academia and got arrested.

67
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,230
He's known to be a total psycho in this field.

68
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:36,950
He's a complete lunatic.

69
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:39,130
We went to college together.

70
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:41,730
He was one of my closest friends.

71
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:46,550
I'm sorry.

72
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:49,000
There's nothing to be sorry about.

73
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,370
The one who started the rumor of him being crazy,

74
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:54,230
and the one who got him kicked out of academia was me.

75
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:50,950
 When will the heaven take away the broken and no-goods of the earth? 

76
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,650
Aren't you hungry?

77
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:23,960
Why? After all, we do this to eat and live.

78
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,590
Stop it. This is serious.

79
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:29,410
- What's more serious than wanting to eat when you're hungry? 
 - Hey!

80
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:31,230
Let's go.

81
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:44,860
Everyone makes at least one big mistake in his life.

82
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:49,000
Mistakes like killing, stealing,  doing drugs and getting married.

83
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,870
But you've already made one big mistake.

84
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:56,020
I saved you when you would've easily been left in prison to rot. The least you can do is not to repeat the same mistake.

85
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:57,070
I'm sorry.

86
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:59,530
This isn't a situation where saying sorry is going to cut it.

87
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:00,570
I still can  find him.

88
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:02,460
Where? And how?

89
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:05,660
Don't tell me you're going to wait for him to resurface again.

90
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:09,560
He disappeared with the female detective who followed us at the hospital.

91
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,460
The entire police force are probably looking for her.

92
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:14,030
If we can tap into what, who, and where the police investigate,

93
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,640
we'll be able to catch him before they do.

94
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:19,850
What if he abandoned the female detective and ran away alone?

95
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:23,880
If he'd just left her, then she'd have died on the train track.

96
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,860
But he troubled himself to save her.

97
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:29,110
Quite unlike him who ran away all the time,

98
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:32,020
this is the first time I've seen him save someone.

99
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:35,530
I'll let you know what the police are doing, so catch him.

100
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:41,820
If you just do this job well, then I'll let you retire.

101
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,820
You can't live here forever.

102
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:47,450
Don't you want to live in a house with windows and a backyard?

103
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:50,430
And get yourself a dog, too.

104
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:53,220
But don't get married, though.

105
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:55,250
It only creates problems.

106
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:58,090
Anyway, I have to get a shot once every two weeks

107
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:00,930
for the rest of my life.

108
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:03,890
I couldn't leave this place even if I wanted to.

109
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:06,160
There must be a way.

110
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:10,900
Once we bring Ji Oh in, I'll give you one of his arms, and you put it on.

111
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:14,630
You know his body parts are highly compatible with anyone.

112
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:17,160
Can you really do that for me?

113
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,870
What's so difficult about giving you one of his arms?

114
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:25,660
Some things take care of themselves when you learn to prioritize.

115
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:28,760
When you tackle bigger problems first, solving smaller ones becomes way easier for you.

116
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,930
You better catch him this time.

117
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:36,590
Repeating the same result isn't a mistake, but a talent.

118
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:47,380
I stopped your bleeding, but I'm not sure if it worked.

119
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,740
You got your head injured.  You shouldn't overexert yourself.

120
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:54,670
Well, I should overexert myself with you now.

121
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:09,290
Stop, please.

122
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:15,980
Just tell me who I am. You said you remembered who I was.

123
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:21,060
If you want to hear me talk, you come clean first and tell me what you remember.

124
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:31,540
I remember someone lying unconscious and saving that person's life.

125
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:41,340
I think that someone was you, but I'm not entirely sure.

126
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:45,040
Hey, thanks for saving me.

127
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,230
Is that enough? What else?

128
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:52,390
Nothing. Ever since I woke up at the hospital, I was being chased and ended up here. That's all I remember.

129
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:54,770
Anything about the guys chasing you?

130
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:57,890
- Nothing. 
 - Anything about you falling off from the rooftop?

131
00:13:57,890 --> 00:13:59,470
- No. 
 - How about the death of Mr. Kim?

132
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:01,730
Who is Mr. Kim?

133
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:06,450
Did you get your head damaged somehow?

134
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:10,520
Tell me what you know.

135
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,200
Get off me.

 Juan Metropolitan Police Agency 

142
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:15,960
Just what about that kid made them hunt him down, even to the hospital, and kill?

143
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:19,730
I guess they wanted to clean him up. After all, he's the witness to their murder.

144
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:25,230
I just don't get it. How did a kid with broken vertebrae get up and run away?

145
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:28,520
His X-rays probably got mixed up. All the while, he was fine.

146
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:31,260
Team Captain, don't you find the things I think strange not at all strange?

147
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:34,750
What's stranger for me is how kids can kill their own parents for inheritance.

148
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:39,150
And how some sickos abduct cute, innocent children and  bury them.

149
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:42,220
Funny, aren't you bursting with humanity all of a sudden?

150
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:47,070
Hey, the second you think you can kill your parent or your child

151
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:49,720
is when you're stripped of your worth as a human being.

152
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:54,860
I know that, too. It's just funny to see you act all so humane.

153
00:15:54,860 --> 00:16:00,130
Are you running for an office? Will I see you work the marketplace munching  rice cakes and sausages?

154
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:03,680
Just as many politicians do, will you reminisce about your poor childhood with the vendors?

155
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:13,270
- Why doesn't he come out already? 
 - God, you startled me.

156
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:14,910
Did you find it? There was one, right?

157
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:17,270
- Yes, there was. 
 - See, what did I tell you? There was.

158
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:21,500
Immediately following the report of the fire at the subway station, there came in a report of a stolen vehicle.

159
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,570
The license plate number is 22 GA 7801, and it's a silver vehicle.

160
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:26,690
For now, we issued a recovery warrant on the vehicle.

161
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:28,810
Got it.

162
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:32,020
See, could he have carried Gu Reum in his arms or on his back?

163
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:36,620
He had to have stolen a car and got away.

164
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:39,880
Lucky for you, I'm a veteran capable of thinking that much.

165
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:42,640
Good job. In fact, you did great.

166
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:46,230
Now scan all the CCTVs and track down the location of the stolen vehicle.

167
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:49,460
You mean, me?

168
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:52,220
Wait, Team Captain.

169
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,870
Crap, does he have to ruin it for me like this?

170
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:59,570
The police know about the stolen vehicle and are looking for it. Stand by in the car.

171
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:04,730
How

172
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:08,650
can you not remember anything?

173
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:12,440
I recall some things but can't figure out what they are. I'm not even sure they are about me.

174
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:17,710
But then, how can you remember me?

175
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:22,040
I'm curious, too. So I rescued you.

176
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:29,330
Have we met before?

177
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:36,140
Unless there's another guy just like you, it must've been you.

178
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:49,500
Could you put on the siren any louder?  Must you advertise we're heading to the crime scene?

179
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:14,520
I was ten years old when you came to my house.

180
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,580
Are you sure that was me?

181
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:22,660
Your eyes emanated rays of blue.

182
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:27,290
 Hey, what's wrong? Don't do that. 

183
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:30,000
 Don't do that. You're scaring me. 

184
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:34,400
 Dad! Dad! 

185
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:39,590
That thing attacked me.

186
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:48,430
Why was I in your house?

187
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,360
That's something I want to ask you.

188
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:57,210
Why were you brought to my house, and where were you taken to?

189
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:59,780
I have to wonder how a kid who stayed a night in my house

190
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:03,480
can haunt me with such pain all my life.

191
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,870
That was the last I saw them.

192
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:26,750
Right after that, my mom and dad vanished.

193
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,240
I don't remember a thing.

194
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,090
Just because you don't remember, that doesn't mean you don't have a past.

195
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:39,760
Do you think I killed them?

196
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:42,850
You're quite capable of that.

197
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:48,650
What I saw that day was a devil.

198
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:54,790
I'm scared of people.

199
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:58,900
So much so that when I sense someone approaching me, all the hair on my body stands up.

200
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:02,520
If I'm a devil as you say, will I be terrified of people as I am?

201
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:08,110
You shouldn't be the judge of whether you're a devil or not.

202
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:13,470
Hey, hurry up. Hurry.

203
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:26,730
Even if I have to dig through your brain, I'll find out what happened for sure.

204
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:38,950
Someone is here.

205
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:41,250
Run. It's him!

206
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:02,600
What are you?

207
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:05,670
Are you a fixer? If not, a private eye?

208
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:32,060
Where is he? Even if you guys get him, he'll end up in my hands.

209
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:35,020
This isn't where a police woman should meddle.

210
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:39,610
What the hell do you think you are, you bastard?

211
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,810
Be prudent about using your guns. Don't just pull the triggers.

212
00:21:56,810 --> 00:21:59,930
- You three, go this way. And we'll go this way. 
 - Yes, Sir!

213
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:01,840
To the second floor!

214
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:22,860
Don't touch him. He's mine.

215
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,710
Gu Reum.

216
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:44,000
Gu Reum!

217
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:49,310
Gu Reum!

218
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:53,580
You bastard!

219
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:01,920
Hey!

220
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:05,330
Go ahead! Go!

221
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:09,180
Hey, are you okay?

222
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:12,650
You're okay, right? Stay here.

223
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:36,580
At 7 p.m. Be here.

224
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:58,200
- That guy is really fast. 
- He's gone?

225
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,910
Yeah.

226
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:05,180
Go and keep looking for him.

227
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:08,270
 You go that way. 

228
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:12,700
Hey, are you really okay?

229
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:17,280
Yes, but how did you find me here?

230
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:22,150
Were you really kidnapped?

231
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:25,640
I passed out during the fight on the subway, and I woke up to find myself here.

232
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,940
Show me your arm.

233
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:30,880
- Pardon? 
 - Show me your arm.

234
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:39,550
- There aren't any marks of restraints.
 - No.

235
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:43,110
Being a detective, how many kidnapping and abduction cases do you think I've worked on all these years?

236
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:44,220
Is this a quiz?

237
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:48,630
Be it a case of kidnapping or abduction, at the end, the victim always says, "Thank you."

238
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:51,680
But do you know what the perpetrator says?

239
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:55,820
- What does he say? 
 - "How did you find me?"

240
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:57,730
You said that just now.

241
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:03,910
Why won't you answer me? You're usually great with smart comebacks.

242
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:07,060
-Are you suspecting me? 
 -Yes.

243
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:11,960
Are you saying I kidnapped myself?

244
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:20,750
I'm not hiding anything.

245
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:22,820
- Are you sure? 
 - Yes.

246
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:26,760
- Really? 
 - Well, what about you? Aren't  you hiding anything?

247
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:31,630
-What about me? 
 -You're not telling me how you found me here.

248
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:35,360
Oh, is it a trade secret?

249
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:46,790
- Something happened, right? 
 - I don't know. I was unconscious.

250
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:52,110
Something happened to you. That's why you're trying to hide it.

251
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:59,000
I'll assign you to a female officer in charge, so make an honest statement. I'll keep it a secret.

252
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:04,460
Wow, you're really letting your imagination run wild.

253
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:06,850
- Am I wrong? 
 - Yes, you are.

254
00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:10,350
- I don't think I am, though. 
 - Nothing like that happened, I'm telling you!

255
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:15,480
Then that's a relief.

256
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:23,120
Are you guys having fun here?

257
00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:28,290
- Have you searched every corner? 
 - We did. He's not here.

258
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:31,540
Yes, he isn't here.

259
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:38,290
Let's evacuate and put him on a wanted list.

260
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:40,380
Let's leave.

261
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:54,690
Are you sure he didn't escape?

262
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:57,950
  I didn't see him go out.  

263
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:06,590
So,  Ji Oh treated that girl?

264
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:11,920
There's more than that. I felt he was trying to protect her.

265
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:16,260
If they're close enough to protect each other, they'll meet up again, no doubt.

266
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:21,540
Haneul Ae Gu Reum graduated from the Police Academy.

267
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:26,720
She was first assigned to Felony and Homicide. Then she was transferred to  Criminal Investigation for insubordination.

268
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,940
Her records show nothing noteworthy except that her parents went missing.

269
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:33,520
-  That  is what's different about her. Her father is Ha Young Jae.
 - Did you say, Ha Young Jae?

270
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:39,590
He was the co-founder and co-researcher of this lab. The very man who created Ji Oh.

271
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:50,490
If he hadn't run away with Ji Oh and his research materials, we wouldn't be in all this mess.

272
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:54,550
Did you not catch him then? So did he go missing?

273
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:10,450
  We have your wife, too.  

274
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:16,220
 If you don't start talking, your wife dies. Do you want to make your daughter an orphan? 

275
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:21,830
I don't know either. He disappeared with his wife.

276
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:24,030
Was it Ji Oh's doing?

277
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:29,030
Very likely.

278
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:37,070
- I'll deal with the police. You keep an eye on the female detective.
 - Yes, sir.

279
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:18,420
  Can I see you right now?  

280
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:27,210
Why? Am I pretty?

281
00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:28,890
Why is your face in that state?

282
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:31,390
I'm a detective, you know.

283
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:36,520
You should've been obedient. Why ask for trouble in a tough place when you can have the cozy job of digging up dirt on people?

284
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:40,310
- I wasn't kicked out for not obeying my orders.
 - Then what for?

285
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:45,150
I was investigating my immediate supervisor. Such a shady guy he was.

286
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:47,930
- Even when you were told not to, did you continue? 
 -Yes.

287
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:50,000
That's what insubordination is.

288
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,940
Did you ask to see me just to scold me?

289
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:54,900
Both. To scold you and ask for a favor.

290
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:58,000
A favor I'll do, but I won't do any of your requests.

291
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:03,160
- Find me this one person.
 - That sounds more like a request.

292
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:08,600
Remember the man who was near death at the hospital but then got up and ran away?

293
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:12,330
Did you say his name was Ji Oh?

294
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:17,460
I analyzed his DNA and found it rather strange.

295
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:20,480
- In what way was it strange? 
 - I don't know if you will believe this.

296
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,960
- I'll believe it. 
 - What?

297
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,970
Anything.

298
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:32,160
You might not believe it. He's human, but he doesn't seem human.

299
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,730
What?

300
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:39,170
How should I put this? Well, it's hard to say he's human.

301
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:41,320
Is he a mutant, then?

302
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:44,180
- No, he isn't. 
- Then someone with a supernatural power?

303
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:50,540
When the potency of a power is exceptional, you can call it a superpower. But that isn't anything we can tell from DNA.

304
00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:54,210
Then what is strange?

305
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:57,510
I can only find out what's strange after examining him.

306
00:31:57,510 --> 00:31:59,390
You want me to find Ji Oh?

307
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:06,580
He's part of  your  investigation. I'm talking about Ryu Jung Kwon. I went to college with him.

308
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:08,920
If he's a friend from college, you should be able to find him easily.

309
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:12,400
I don't even know if he's dead or alive. That's why I'm asking you.

310
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:16,450
- He's been reported as missing? 
 - Nobody's reported him missing. He simply vanished.

311
00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:18,770
Did his family not report him missing?

312
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:23,670
His family apparently cut their ties with him, so that might explain why, but...

313
00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:25,310
Did something happen?

314
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:32,750
At an academic symposium a long time ago, he was a keynote speaker, and he raised the eyebrows of many.

315
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:36,080
 We, humans have realized how incomplete we are. 

316
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:40,650
 But then, we made wrong choices to compensate our incompleteness. 
    

317
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:44,080
 Instead of developing our strength, we invented machines. 

318
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:47,250
 Instead of developing our brains, we invented computers. 

319
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:50,910
 In the future, robots will be given the job of production 

320
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:54,940
 and all the thinking will be done by AI (Artificial Intelligence). 

321
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,950
 Humans chose technology over evolution. 

322
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:03,900
 As a result, technology keeps advancing, 

323
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:08,120
 while humans are only degenerating. 

324
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:13,180
What we saw in him wasn't a young scientist's ambition but madness.

325
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:14,650
Isn't what he said true, though?

326
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:18,720
Perhaps it was. There were people who frantically supported his views, after all.

327
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:23,730
 We humans are becoming the only species on earth to have stopped our evolution. 

328
00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:26,450
 Evolution is change, and change is survival. 

329
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:29,250
 All species that stop evolving will become extinct. 

330
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:31,540
 In order to stop the human race from being obliterated, 

331
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:36,330
 we must trigger artificial evolution and awaken our species. 

332
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:46,230
 We must realize this code of research ethics is 

333
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:51,400
 the very thing that lets the human race degenerate. 

334
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,530
 The true value of science  

335
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:55,770
 lies not in cutting away at its advancement, 

336
00:33:56,790 --> 00:33:58,640
 but further challenging it. 

337
00:34:06,770 --> 00:34:10,590
When the symposium was over, I was asked to furnish the academy with my written opinions.

338
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:12,660
I mobilized every word I knew

339
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:16,240
to condemn Dr. Ryu. The academy went with my statement of opinions.

340
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:19,210
Dr. Ryu was expelled from the academy for having violated the research ethics code.

341
00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:21,890
Furthermore, all his research grants were terminated.

342
00:34:21,890 --> 00:34:23,910
He got arrested a few months later.

343
00:34:23,910 --> 00:34:25,380
When he did, his family left him.

344
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:26,860
Why did he get arrested?

345
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:29,400
For misusing the research subsidies and illegally purchasing egg cells.

346
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,330
Plus, he smuggled in animals of endangered species.

347
00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:33,480
He claimed his innocence.

348
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:36,380
But the social milieu of the time didn't think even the death penalty was enough for him.

349
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:40,220
Was what he did that serious?

350
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:44,520
For instance, what if

351
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:47,800
you genetically engineer a human by combining it with a dog to give it an exceptional ability to smell?

352
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:51,230
Or, what if you combine a bird with a human to give it the ability to fly?

353
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:54,860
Along the same vein, what if the DNAs of fish are used to create a child with gills?

354
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:57,370
Say, a human capable of shooting electricity like an eel,

355
00:34:57,370 --> 00:35:00,340
or a human that stings you with venom just like a jellyfish,

356
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:04,320
Would that be a human? How far do we set the parameters for being a human?

357
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,090
He sure did more than claiming.

358
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:10,920
In reality, Dr. Ryu was actually making such genetic abnormalities.

359
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:14,070
It was so shocking that I stopped myself short of going to the press.

360
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:18,310
When his research lab was searched for confiscation, a chimera was found.

361
00:35:18,310 --> 00:35:20,640
What's a chimera?

362
00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:23,990
It's a hybrid of different species of animals.

363
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:26,780
Or, it can be produced by combining a human and an animal.

364
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:40,540
That's just crazy wild.

365
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:42,730
Crazy wild, indeed.

366
00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:44,990
After he was released from prison, he disappeared.

367
00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:50,650
Rumor had it then he went abroad, or he killed himself and whatnot. But no one saw him.

368
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:55,100
Then do you think Dr. Ryu Jung Kwon created Ji Oh?

369
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:57,620
- I'm only guessing. 
 - What's the probability of Dr. Ryu having done just that?

370
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:59,020
Well,

371
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:01,250
Not long ago, in China and America,

372
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:04,320
genetic engineering produced a child that's immune to the AIDS virus.

373
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,210
Once they put their mind to it, they can manufacture any type of a human they so desire.

374
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:09,770
They can even modify the cells of a pig with those of a human

375
00:36:09,770 --> 00:36:12,910
to grow human organs in that pig.

376
00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:16,350
So the pig is a pig on the outside, but with human organs inside?

377
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:18,000
Gross, isn't it?

378
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,510
Unfortunately, it isn't the limitation of scientific advancement.

379
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:22,890
- What if it isn't?
 - It's the limitations the ethics code imposes.

380
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:26,130
The ethics code mandates how far an experiment can go.

381
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:29,580
In other words, once the code is breached, there's no limit to how far an experiment can go, right?

382
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:33,580
Many scientists have keen interests in creating new forms of life.

383
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:36,720
After all, any one of us has the innate desire to be a god.

384
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:41,420
What if scientists succeed in creating hybridized life forms?

385
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:46,000
Will the modified life forms be given the capacity to feel as humans do?

386
00:36:46,010 --> 00:36:47,550
Not sure.

387
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:51,580
Perhaps their instincts are more honed than their feelings.

388
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:54,820
Anyhow, parts of their forms are animals.

389
00:36:56,530 --> 00:37:01,490
When we have enough of those hybridized forms, they'll harm ordinary humans, right?

390
00:37:01,490 --> 00:37:04,080
The world isn't ruled by the strongest of all species,

391
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:07,040
but by the species most adept at changing.

392
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,270
Hence the human race rules the earth.

393
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:12,170
Look at us. Aren't we gross as a species?

394
00:37:12,170 --> 00:37:15,680
We inhabit every known corner of the world.

395
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:18,620
You can find Dr. Ryu, right?

396
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:22,480
I'll try.

397
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:35,110
 Kim, who was killed by a train returning to its terminus 

398
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:37,920
 is known to have previously served in the military. 

399
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:43,370
 Kim ran away as he was being investigated in 2019 for his misconduct while serving in the military. 

400
00:37:43,370 --> 00:37:46,620
 From the text message that's considered as his suicide note, 

401
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:51,130
 the police investigated his death as suicide with a  strong motive. 
   

402
00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:53,630
In the text message that's been reported...

403
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:58,000
When we're the actual police on his case, who's saying that he killed himself?

404
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,560
It isn't me.

405
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:03,560
Me, neither.

406
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:06,670
No reporter came to our office.

407
00:38:08,390 --> 00:38:11,750
Pathetic. They call themselves reporters  when all they do is rush to air their flimsy stories without actual investigation.

408
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:15,610
Strange, we couldn't do a background check on Kim Wang Sik now deceased.

409
00:38:15,610 --> 00:38:18,430
Who did the background check to retrieve the text message?

410
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:24,330
Team Leader, about the death at the subway platform.

411
00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:27,030
Clearly, the reporters know the things we don't know.

412
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:30,540
We couldn't run a background check, so we sent in a formal, written request. So far, we've got no answer.

413
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:33,170
Forget it. His case is no longer in our jurisdiction.

414
00:38:33,170 --> 00:38:37,110
- What are you talking about?
 - Along with the Ji Oh case, this case is also removed from our jurisdiction.

415
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:39,630
- All of you, take your hands off. 
 - Pardon?

416
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:43,290
With murder and abduction, this case is worth many points. Why do we want to let it be taken away from us?

417
00:38:43,290 --> 00:38:45,280
Where was it sent to? To the Property and Crime Unit?

418
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,020
Don't know.

419
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:49,640
I just saw the unit chief and was told to hand over the case.

420
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:51,630
Collect all the data for transfer.

421
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:53,640
We have nothing.

422
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,580
How can we have data?

423
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:59,630
All we've done is run around and haven't started an investigation yet.

424
00:39:06,690 --> 00:39:08,510
What about Gu Reum?

425
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:12,120
- Has she gone to the hospital? 
 - How would I know?

426
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:16,700
She said after getting the medical treatment she'd need, she'd come in tomorrow.

427
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:26,660
♫  Everyone is gone. Your fear of being alone.  ♫

428
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:36,170
♫  It will make you stronger. Alone.  ♫

429
00:39:38,850 --> 00:39:42,910
♫  I can't feel anything.  ♫

430
00:39:43,830 --> 00:39:47,870
♫  I can't hear anything.  ♫

431
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:52,670
♫  Do you know what happened?  ♫

432
00:39:53,730 --> 00:39:58,360
♫  Is not this a dream?  ♫

433
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:00,590
♫  Whatever.  ♫

434
00:40:08,870 --> 00:40:14,120
♫  I remember a piece of memory. In fact that I was afraid of fear.  ♫

435
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:20,080
♫  Heart was like a desert. Life was full of pain and confusion.  ♫

436
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:24,390
Eat. That's yours.

437
00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:33,930
♫  Only your love was a hope for me.  ♫

438
00:40:33,930 --> 00:40:38,900
♫  Only your heart was a hope for me.  ♫

439
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:42,220
You said you had memories you couldn't erase in your head.

440
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:52,490
A white room. A red hallway.

441
00:40:52,490 --> 00:40:54,360
A terrified child.

442
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,770
 The curtains on fire. Academiron. 

443
00:40:56,770 --> 00:40:58,770
Green land.

444
00:40:58,770 --> 00:41:02,380
Wind. Your face. And my name.

445
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:05,960
Any memory of killing anyone?

446
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:17,950
Not sure.

447
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:24,200
Hey, don't say you don't know. Try to remember things.

448
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:29,210
I do remember waking up after having lost consciousness.

449
00:41:29,210 --> 00:41:31,800
But once or ten times? I can't know.

450
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:35,510
I wake up in a strange place every time.

451
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:40,270
So you wake up from your unconsciousness without any memory?

452
00:41:40,270 --> 00:41:42,750
Most of the time, except for a few things.

453
00:41:43,610 --> 00:41:46,710
How convenient. I wish I could do what you can do.

454
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:49,220
Turning on and off your memory.

455
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:52,120
Do you know how it feels to be cut off from your own life?

456
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:54,440
Without knowing what I have done

457
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:58,840
and who I am, I'm left alone. Do you know how that feels?

458
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:05,040
Since I don't know how I've lived, I can't know how I'm to live. Do you know how frustrating that is?

459
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:09,140
Do you know what it feels like living with pain all the time?

460
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:13,860
My mom and dad, who promised me pork cutlets for lunch, didn't come back after they left with you.

461
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:16,600
Are they dead or alive?

462
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,470
If neither was the case,

463
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:21,640
did they just abandon me?

464
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:26,420
One moment, I hope they're alive somewhere, and next, I worry what if they are.

465
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:30,680
If, in fact, they abandoned me and are alive and well all this time,

466
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:32,410
where does that leave me?

467
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:38,150
I've lived haunted by that ugly thought all my life. Do you know how that feels?

468
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:42,270
You at least have the memory of being abandoned. But I have nothing.

469
00:42:42,270 --> 00:42:46,090
I can't know how you feel because I have no parents.

470
00:42:46,090 --> 00:42:49,140
I have nothing more to say since I don't remember things.

471
00:42:50,390 --> 00:42:52,320
I'll be going.

472
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,640
You're from an orphanage.

473
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:57,940
We'll go down there tomorrow.

474
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:03,690
Once we get there, we'll find out

475
00:43:03,690 --> 00:43:06,390
who left you there.

476
00:43:06,390 --> 00:43:09,790
And whether you were left there before or after you came to my house.

477
00:43:09,790 --> 00:43:12,440
Did you just say I was at an orphanage?

478
00:43:16,250 --> 00:43:18,850
When I call you, answer the phone.

479
00:43:18,850 --> 00:43:20,460
Hey.

480
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:25,520
Where is the orphanage?

481
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,090
Are you curious?

482
00:43:27,090 --> 00:43:29,460
I told you.

483
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:32,430
I'd dig deep into your head if that's what it takes to get my answers.

484
00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:38,970
What if I won't go?

485
00:43:38,970 --> 00:43:41,670
Live as you do now for the rest of your life

486
00:43:41,670 --> 00:43:44,170
without knowing who you are.

487
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:12,500
You haven't eaten yet?

488
00:44:15,810 --> 00:44:18,430
Did you see the news?

489
00:44:18,430 --> 00:44:21,120
They say a former, corrupt civil servant killed himself.

490
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:23,820
What a joke.

491
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:27,220
Even a deceased would want to keep their honor.

492
00:44:27,970 --> 00:44:30,660
Honor for the dead? That's a luxury.

493
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:33,280
What would they say if I died today?

494
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:37,590
They'd probably say a former female military officer killed herself

495
00:44:37,590 --> 00:44:39,160
when her plan to get promoted by sleeping with her superior went awry?

496
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:41,840
So don't die.

497
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:44,350
I was told what I do is for my country.

498
00:44:44,350 --> 00:44:47,430
And that I was called, once again, to pledge my allegiance to my country.

499
00:44:47,430 --> 00:44:49,600
But I'm not all that sure I'm doing things the right way.

500
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:52,750
Our country is too big while we're too small.

501
00:44:52,750 --> 00:44:55,270
It's only natural we can't understand everything.

502
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:59,100
Just as ants can't know the workings of the universe?

503
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:01,100
If you don't like it, you always can leave.

504
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:03,380
What about my leg then?

505
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:07,190
It'll rot and fall away if I don't get my injections.

506
00:45:07,190 --> 00:45:10,170
Don't you, too, keep quiet and follow their orders for the same reason as me, Team Leader?

507
00:45:10,170 --> 00:45:12,780
Stop pouting.

508
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:14,710
I guess you can say that I'm pouting.

509
00:45:14,710 --> 00:45:17,430
You can just as easily give up on your arm as I can my leg.

510
00:45:17,430 --> 00:45:21,640
But to keep our limbs, we're doing what we do without knowing why.

511
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:27,620
The female detective will be given a new cell phone tomorrow.

512
00:45:27,620 --> 00:45:31,270
I'm told a tracking device is embedded in the phone. So don't lose her.

513
00:45:44,410 --> 00:45:47,570
You want to get off early, why?

514
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:50,910
I've got fifteen stitches.

515
00:45:50,910 --> 00:45:55,460
Back in my day, with an injury like that, we just stitched it up with a stapler and kept working.

516
00:45:55,460 --> 00:45:59,140
- You're being pampered. 
 - That's why you're called  a konde , old generation.

517
00:45:59,140 --> 00:46:02,930
It's an honor.  Konde  is now listed in the dictionaries used in England.

518
00:46:02,930 --> 00:46:05,410
You mean  English dictionaries,  not the dictionaries in England.

519
00:46:05,410 --> 00:46:07,460
Watch it. I'm a patient.

520
00:46:08,190 --> 00:46:10,060
Why do you want to get off early?

521
00:46:10,090 --> 00:46:12,400
- I'm going to rest. 
 - What will you do while resting?

522
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:15,400
You kept complaining I didn't rest, but now you're complaining that I am!

523
00:46:15,470 --> 00:46:19,290
It's weird, you wanting to rest. You refused when I asked you to.

524
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:22,590
I remind you, I'm a patient.

525
00:46:27,750 --> 00:46:29,820
Who is this?

526
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:32,380
Kim Wang Sik. Do you recognize him?

527
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:35,280
He's the guy from the subway platform!

528
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:37,490
He killed himself by letting himself get run over by a train.

529
00:46:37,490 --> 00:46:40,680
What nonsense. That was an accident!

530
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:42,850
You can't explain it if you make it an accident.

531
00:46:42,850 --> 00:46:47,510
Why was he there at that time? Who sent him there for what reason?

532
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:51,350
But when it's a suicide, there's no need to explain any of that. It's simply a personal matter.

533
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:53,920
- But why is it a suicide? 
 - The police announced it as such.

534
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:56,340
- But this is our case. What police say it was a suicide? 
 - The police in another jurisdiction.

535
00:46:56,340 --> 00:46:58,550
- What  jurisdiction? 
 - I don't know.

536
00:46:58,550 --> 00:47:01,770
I was simply told to turn the case over and keep my hands off. Nobody told me who'd investigate the case and where.

537
00:47:01,770 --> 00:47:06,360
With a demand like that, shouldn't they tell you where to turn  the case over and who will receive it?

538
00:47:12,290 --> 00:47:15,860
So they're saying an ordinary police unit has no business in a case like this. Is that it?

539
00:47:15,860 --> 00:47:20,050
Kid, what do you mean by "ordinary police"? We now have the investigation rights.

540
00:47:20,050 --> 00:47:21,640
Then where did they take the case to?

541
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:24,970
I don't know. What else can I do besides take my hands off? You do the same, alright?

542
00:47:24,970 --> 00:47:27,170
- Team Leader! 
 - I'm warning you so that you don't go around causing problems.

543
00:47:27,170 --> 00:47:30,480
So you just go to your corner without a word of protest?

544
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:34,150
I protested, loud and clear.

545
00:47:34,150 --> 00:47:37,200
Weren't you kicked out of Felony and Homicide for insubordination?

546
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:42,140
You were investigating your immediate supervisor. Lucky that you only got transferred because you were with Felony and Homicide.

547
00:47:42,140 --> 00:47:46,260
People like us at the bottom rung of criminal investigation will be terminated immediately.

548
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:51,400
So don't go around digging dirt. Just rest.

549
00:47:55,050 --> 00:48:00,320
This is a new phone for you from the police force. Report your old one as lost &amp; broken. Then go home.

550
00:48:07,630 --> 00:48:10,900
What happened? Where are you?

551
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:13,470
I'll join you soon. Keep me informed till then.

552
00:48:33,770 --> 00:48:39,170
How rude. Sit in the front. Are you a CEO or something?

553
00:48:54,460 --> 00:48:57,030
On second thought, just go back to the backseat.

554
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:59,930
I feel uncomfortable with you sitting next to me.

555
00:49:05,930 --> 00:49:08,600
I said go back!

556
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:11,020
Where's the orphanage?

557
00:49:11,020 --> 00:49:14,120
You don't remember anything about the orphanage?

558
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:17,870
I was never there.

559
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:24,490
People can lie but not what's said on paper.

560
00:49:24,490 --> 00:49:27,150
Move to the back!

561
00:49:27,150 --> 00:49:30,180
Does it matter where I sit?

562
00:49:30,890 --> 00:49:34,540
It's me you don't like, not the seats.

563
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:36,560
Do you want to ride in the trunk?

564
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:40,190
Go.

565
00:50:18,850 --> 00:50:22,650
How can I help you?

566
00:50:26,020 --> 00:50:29,820
I'm Haneul Ae Gu Reum. I'm here to meet Sister Stella.

567
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:31,990
You're the detective who called earlier, right?

568
00:50:31,990 --> 00:50:34,610
She's waiting for you. Come in.

569
00:50:36,850 --> 00:50:40,840
I'll ask questions. You be quiet.

570
00:51:01,420 --> 00:51:03,390
Sister Stella.

571
00:51:10,030 --> 00:51:14,630
How do you do? I'm Gu Reum who called you earlier.

572
00:51:16,570 --> 00:51:20,580
For someone who's a detective,

573
00:51:20,580 --> 00:51:24,140
you sure give off a good aura.

574
00:51:24,140 --> 00:51:28,690
I don't know why you're here,

575
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:34,110
but since you came this far, I'll pray for your blessings.

576
00:51:37,710 --> 00:51:41,710
It seems like you're with company.

577
00:51:42,540 --> 00:51:44,580
Yes, we came together.

578
00:51:44,650 --> 00:51:47,940
I'll pray for your blessings, too.

579
00:51:50,330 --> 00:51:52,490
Aren't you going to thank her?

580
00:51:52,490 --> 00:51:54,530
Thank you.

581
00:52:00,580 --> 00:52:04,930
She's still in the convent. Is she praying?

582
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:10,500
Give me some kind of reaction.

583
00:52:11,390 --> 00:52:15,540
Didn't you see her profile? She's an atheist.

584
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:21,590
I'm looking for a person.

585
00:52:21,590 --> 00:52:28,370
For various reasons, we had to shut down the orphanage a long time ago.

586
00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:30,910
I don't know how much I'll remember.

587
00:52:30,910 --> 00:52:34,000
Who are you looking for?

588
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:41,470
This dates back to twenty years ago. Would you happen to know Jang Jae Woo and Hwang Eun Gyeong?

589
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:45,700
I don't.

590
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:49,470
 Hwang Eun Gyeong at Uicheon Convent 

591
00:52:49,470 --> 00:52:52,980
According to their families, they attended this church.

592
00:52:52,990 --> 00:52:56,170
They said they were going to mass that day only to never be seen again.

593
00:52:56,170 --> 00:52:59,270
I've lived here my whole life.

594
00:52:59,270 --> 00:53:05,420
If that had happened, the police would've come to see me.

595
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:09,330
I haven't heard of any of our church members going missing.

596
00:53:09,330 --> 00:53:12,340
Even though they went missing, no police ever showed up?

597
00:53:12,340 --> 00:53:15,620
They never did on account of that incident.

598
00:53:15,620 --> 00:53:18,070
Then why else did they show up here?

599
00:53:19,990 --> 00:53:25,560
There was a fire in our church once.

600
00:53:25,620 --> 00:53:29,400
- The police came for the first time. 
 - I see.

601
00:53:32,410 --> 00:53:37,450
By chance, do you remember the name, Ji Oh?

602
00:53:41,020 --> 00:53:43,360
Do you remember?

603
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:48,420
Ji Oh... why yes.

604
00:53:49,290 --> 00:53:53,010
How could I forget that name?

605
00:53:53,010 --> 00:53:58,270
By chance, can I find out who brought him here?

606
00:53:58,270 --> 00:54:02,430
No, that child came here by himself.

607
00:54:02,450 --> 00:54:07,760
When I went out in the morning, he was standing before the Virgin Mary.

608
00:54:07,780 --> 00:54:13,770
"Did you come alone? Did someone bring you here?"

609
00:54:13,770 --> 00:54:16,870
I asked, but he always gave the same answer.

610
00:54:16,870 --> 00:54:22,440
He ended each of his sentences with "Jioh, jioh" for polite speech. So we named him Ji Oh.

611
00:54:22,450 --> 00:54:26,040
Do you not remember the exact day, month, and year he came here?

612
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:28,770
I don't remember that much.

613
00:54:28,770 --> 00:54:31,340
It happened so long ago.

614
00:54:31,340 --> 00:54:37,030
Twenty years have gone by already.

615
00:54:38,090 --> 00:54:41,970
Was there anyone who came to visit or sponsored him?

616
00:54:41,970 --> 00:54:47,460
Why do you ask? What do you want to know?

617
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:52,180
I just wanted to know if anyone was connected to him.

618
00:54:52,180 --> 00:54:57,340
Has that child caused any problems?

619
00:54:57,340 --> 00:55:03,630
No. Has anyone adopted your orphans?

620
00:55:03,670 --> 00:55:06,180
Four did.

621
00:55:06,180 --> 00:55:11,300
Of those who adopted, was there anyone named Ha Yeong Jae?

622
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:16,490
Ha Yeong Jae. Ha Yeong Jae.

623
00:55:17,450 --> 00:55:19,760
No.

624
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:22,630
It's the first time I've heard of the name.

625
00:55:22,630 --> 00:55:29,100
It's possible your memory is foggy. If you have any documentation, could I have a look?

626
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:31,390
No.

627
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:36,940
It isn't anything I could forget.

628
00:55:36,940 --> 00:55:43,780
I can't possibly forget things that have to do with that child.

629
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:50,730
Whenever people took him to adopt him,

630
00:55:50,730 --> 00:55:55,340
they would return him the day after,

631
00:55:55,340 --> 00:55:58,380
saying they couldn't handle him.

632
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:04,230
Everyone said they couldn't keep him for even  a night.

633
00:56:04,230 --> 00:56:10,890
They always had a terrified look on their faces and left here as if they were running away.

634
00:56:11,870 --> 00:56:13,530
Um, Sister.

635
00:56:13,530 --> 00:56:16,880
That's the kind of child he was.

636
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:19,910
Everyone had such a difficult time with him.

637
00:56:21,290 --> 00:56:22,680
Yes, I understand.

638
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:23,890
And that child?

639
00:56:23,890 --> 00:56:27,050
- You don't have to tell us more.
 - No.

640
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:29,740
If you are involved with that child,

641
00:56:29,740 --> 00:56:35,830
you must know this. That child set fire to this place.

642
00:56:35,830 --> 00:56:39,180
That was when I got my eyes hurt.

643
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:44,290
Don't keep that child close to you.

644
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:52,250
He doesn't even remember having been here.

645
00:56:55,910 --> 00:56:59,190
He always said that.

646
00:56:59,190 --> 00:57:02,960
Whenever he caused big problems, he'd say he didn't remember.

647
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:05,150
That he wasn't the one who caused the problems.

648
00:57:05,150 --> 00:57:08,280
Do you know why he did that?

649
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:09,510
Why?

650
00:57:09,510 --> 00:57:12,120
Because in that child,

651
00:57:12,970 --> 00:57:15,460
there was a devil.

652
00:57:15,460 --> 00:57:20,740
Was it that the devil set this place on fire, and the child didn't remember?

653
00:57:20,740 --> 00:57:22,690
No.

654
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:30,910
That child was the devil himself.

655
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:36,220
He changed his persona whenever he needed to.

656
00:57:37,660 --> 00:57:40,720
It wasn't me who set the fire.

657
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:44,910
I never set this place on fire. How could I when I was never here?

658
00:57:50,030 --> 00:57:52,450
Are you Ji Oh?

659
00:57:53,510 --> 00:57:55,930
Are you Ji Oh?

660
00:57:56,700 --> 00:58:00,950
No, that can't be.

661
00:58:00,950 --> 00:58:03,680
He can't be in here.

662
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:13,700
No way. If you're indeed that child, you can't come in here.

663
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:16,670
If that child is me, I'm right here.

664
00:58:34,290 --> 00:58:36,940
So you are Ji Oh.

665
00:58:40,450 --> 00:58:43,990
You really are Ji Oh.

666
00:58:43,990 --> 00:58:46,180
Yes, it's him.

667
00:58:56,210 --> 00:58:58,410
Sister!

668
00:59:06,370 --> 00:59:09,020
Sister Stella!

  Yeochon Catholic Church 

670
00:59:48,110 --> 00:59:50,060
Great Angel, St. Michael.

671
00:59:50,060 --> 00:59:52,610
Please protect us for we are in the midst of a battle.

672
00:59:52,610 --> 00:59:57,090
Please protect us from the trickeries and schemes of Satan.

673
00:59:57,090 --> 01:00:00,960
I humbly beseech the triune God of heaven, please hear my plea.

674
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:03,570
O LORD of Hosts,

675
01:00:03,570 --> 01:00:06,440
Satan and his minions wander upon the earth for the destruction of souls.

676
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:09,220
I pray to Thee to condemn them to hell.

677
01:00:09,220 --> 01:00:12,140
Please send them to hell!

678
01:00:13,310 --> 01:00:15,450
Is that me?

679
01:00:16,810 --> 01:00:19,760
Was I such an unbearable existence?

680
01:00:21,390 --> 01:00:23,700
You are a devil.

681
01:00:23,700 --> 01:00:28,970
You are a devil, and you should've burnt to death before you returned here.

682
01:00:28,970 --> 01:00:33,520
How were you able to return here? You're Devil's child.

683
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:39,090
Great Angel, St. Michael, please protect us for we are in the midst of a battle.

684
01:00:39,090 --> 01:00:44,300
Please protect us from the trickeries and schemes of Satan and his minions.

685
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:48,370
I've never been here before. I told you, it wasn't me.

686
01:00:52,330 --> 01:00:56,590
Do you know how many you killed?

687
01:00:56,590 --> 01:01:05,960
You burned alive those young children and those lovely sisters.

688
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:09,390
No, that wasn't me.

689
01:01:10,230 --> 01:01:14,410
You are a devil. No, you are Devil himself.

690
01:01:14,410 --> 01:01:17,140
Today you will burn to death right here.

691
01:01:17,140 --> 01:01:21,140
I will never let you victimize me again. Never.

692
01:01:22,470 --> 01:01:24,540
Great Angel, St. Michael.

693
01:01:24,540 --> 01:01:29,260
Please protect us for we are in the midst of a battle.

694
01:01:32,930 --> 01:01:36,010
Lord, please protect us.

695
01:01:36,010 --> 01:01:41,880
Please protect us from the trickeries and schemes of Satan and his minions.

696
01:01:44,030 --> 01:01:47,880
O LORD of Hosts!

697
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:48,640
Let's go.

698
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:51,520
Please protect us.

699
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:52,730
Enough. Let's go.

700
01:01:52,730 --> 01:01:54,860
Great Angel, St. Michael.

701
01:01:54,860 --> 01:01:57,950
Please protect us for we are in the midst of a battle.

702
01:01:57,950 --> 01:02:02,000
Please protect us from the trickeries and schemes of Satan and his minions.

703
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,960
O LORD of Hosts.

704
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:36,100
 Who are you? 

705
01:02:36,100 --> 01:02:40,120
 Where is this place? I don't know. 

706
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:44,930
 I didn't do it. I don't know anything. 

707
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:49,700
 Please chase away that devil with this holy water. 

708
01:02:49,700 --> 01:02:52,320
 With this holy water, please chase away the devil. 

709
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:55,580
 Please condemn this wicked serpent  to hell. 

710
01:02:55,580 --> 01:02:57,180
 Please send him to hell. 

711
01:02:57,180 --> 01:03:00,430
 Please chase this old dragon to the depths of the inferno. 

712
01:03:00,430 --> 01:03:02,320
 Please, I beseech you. 

713
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:08,390
 Please bind this foolish monster in chains and send him to hell. 

714
01:03:08,390 --> 01:03:10,100
 Please don't do that! 

715
01:03:10,100 --> 01:03:14,210
 Please send away this devil! 

716
01:03:14,210 --> 01:03:19,790
 Please condemn this wicked serpent to hell! 

717
01:03:19,790 --> 01:03:23,380
 - This old dragon to the depths—
 - Stop it! 

718
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:30,750
 This serpent, the old dragon who is  Devil, Satan himself... 

719
01:03:33,210 --> 01:03:39,260
He tempts your saints and leads them to the way of hell—

720
01:03:39,260 --> 01:03:40,110
Please don't do this.

721
01:03:40,110 --> 01:03:44,540
Please protect us from the trickeries and schemes of Satan and his minions.

722
01:03:44,540 --> 01:03:49,760
I plead with the Heavenly Father. Please bind him!

723
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:50,530
I told you to stop.

724
01:03:50,530 --> 01:03:56,590
Condemn to Hades all the evil spirits and Satan wandering in the earth!

725
01:03:56,590 --> 01:03:58,800
Stop!

726
01:04:12,390 --> 01:04:15,040
While you knew nothing about me, you made me into a monster.

727
01:04:15,040 --> 01:04:20,860
I was a human until you called me a monster. It's you who made me a monster.

728
01:04:21,770 --> 01:04:26,310
Disappear into hell, you devil.

729
01:04:26,310 --> 01:04:28,220
Why should I?

730
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:38,730
You are a monster full of evil spirits!

731
01:04:47,070 --> 01:04:49,180
Why am I?
