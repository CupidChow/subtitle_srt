  - Please don't! 
 - Please bind this foolish monster in chains,

 While you knew nothing about me, you made me into a monster. 

34
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:25,190
 I was a human until you called me a monster. 

35
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:27,830
 It's you who made me a monster. 

36
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:32,740
 Disappear into hell, you devil. 

37
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,380
 Why should I? 

38

 You... 

39
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:45,710
 are a monster full of evil spirits!

Sister, are you alright?

Let's go.

48
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:37,550
It wasn't me. I didn't do that.

Are we going inside?

50
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:51,970
Crap, we'd all die from asphyxiation even before we found him.

It was me who set that fire.

63

What about the reason why you were brought to my house?

64
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:18,660
And where you went with my parents?

65
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:22,000
Don't you remember?

66
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:29,160

♫  And at the end of the world, stay by my side  ♫

72
00:07:56,260 --> 00:08:00,610
♫  Hold my hand.  ♫

73
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:02,820
Get in quickly.

74
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:05,130
Sister!

75
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:08,390
Sister, wait just a moment.

76
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:30,580
Where's the guy who was just here?

77
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:44,490
Is he gone already?

78
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:47,690
His car isn't here.

79
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,110
I told you, we shouldn't have gone in.

80
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:54,220
If we'd just waited out here, we would've caught him.

81
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:56,080
Her cell phone?

82
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,410
I'm not getting her location.

83
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:00,210
I think she turned it off.

84
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:02,370
Or, it got turned off.

85
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:29,620
Since when could you do that?

86
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:32,580
Sizzling.

87
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:40,690
There are times I want to die.

88
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:44,860
When the going gets tough, and I hurt too much, I think I'd be better off dead.

89
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:48,220
When it's all over, I wonder how easy and happy I'd feel.

90
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:52,640
Whenever I think that my body suddenly heats up.

91
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,870
I don't know how it happens.

92
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:58,670
My whole body just becomes that way.

93
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:02,820
And I see blue light before my eyes.

94
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:07,690
It's as if my body fights to stay alive when I want to die.

95
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:14,190
The times you want to die are,

96
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:16,920
in fact, the times you want to live the most.

97
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:21,760
I didn't think that way.

98
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,160
That's not how I saw you.

99
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,660
When you fell from the rooftop,

100
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:30,220
and when you ran from the hospital,

101
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:34,850
and even moments ago, what I saw was a man determined to live.

102
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:41,050
Anyway, you've survived even when that meant burning up your body.

103
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:44,890
Anyhow, the things I need you to recall

104
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:48,960
aren't whether you were there, or that the curtains were on fire.

105
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:53,130
I need to know what happened before you came to the orphanage.

106
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:59,260
You said you'd dig through my brain. I don't want to do that for you anymore.

107
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:02,690
I don't want to know what else is in my head.

108
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,260
I told you not to make the same mistake, didn't I?

109
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:17,350
How many times have you lost him from right under your nose?

110
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:20,760
We traced the license plate on the car to the church. It belonged to the female detective.

111
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,020
It's clear that she's on the move with Ji Oh.

112
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:27,170
Her cell phone is turned off so we can't track her location. I think it is due to the electrical impact.

113
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:30,000
Once her phone is on again, I'll get on her tail.

114
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,630
I placed my people at the police station and the female detective's home, just in case.

115
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:36,680
She'll pop up soon.

116
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,560
- Have you eaten? 
- Not yet.

117
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,460
Make sure you eat well.

118
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:45,190
- So you don't go feeling sluggish.
 - Okay, sir.

119
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:47,440
You know I don't trust people, right?

120
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,920
- I know.
 - Yet I trust you.

121
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,420
So repay my trust.

122
00:11:58,130 --> 00:12:00,860
And I trust you, too, Dr. Ryu.

123
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:05,190
So let's all just do well,

124
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:07,420
please?

125
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:28,720
Are you okay?

126
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:31,950
I am.

127
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:35,820
I am sorry

128
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:39,630
about having fixed your arm for nothing, so you can't even leave this place.

129
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:41,960
It's better than not having one.

130
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,890
It's just an arm.

131
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:47,930
That goes the same for you and me.

132
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:51,630
Doctor,

133
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:54,120
once we bring Ji Oh in here,

134
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:57,160
can you really put his arm on me?

135
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:01,330
Someone gave you that idea, huh?

136
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,350
- That he would cut off Ji Oh's arm and attach it to you?
 - Is that possible?

137
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:09,820
Science is a mere shadow of God. Only faith can bring forth results.

138
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,460
Do I just need to have faith?

139
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:17,630
If I do my job well, I, too, can have a normal arm.

140
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:20,500
If I believe that, will it really happen?

141
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:24,030
What else can you do besides believe?

142
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:28,310
- If you can, keep your faith, too. 
 - You mean it isn't possible?

143
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:33,480
It's possible in theory. But the world doesn't operate on theories.

144
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:37,870
it operates on variables. After all, humans

145
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:42,560
are slaves of variables. Both you and I.

146
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:49,990
Everyone here is all the same.

147
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:54,040
No one gives me straight answers.

148
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,080
Yeah.

149
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:58,870
It's a tough place for a former soldier to  endure.

150
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,350
I understand how you feel, but

151
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,560
bring Ji Oh back safely.

152
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:12,870
I'd like it if you bring him in without hurting him.

153
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:16,510
My recent dreams at night

154
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:20,510
are all about seeing Ji Oh again.

155
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,580
Did you open it?

156
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:39,240
Yeah, tell me.

157
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,510
It's 01 MA 5273.

158
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:48,500
01, MA, 5273.

00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:56,990
- Is this the correct number?
  - Get in quickly. 

161
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:02,270
01 MA 5273.

162
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:05,780
- It says it was scrapped.
 - Huh?

163
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:10,140
A car rental service owned it, and it was taken to the scrap yard last year.

164
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:13,610
Clearly, it's an unregistered vehicle. What about it?

165
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:17,620
- Nothing.
 - What do you mean, "Nothing"?

166
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:19,610
It caught my attention because the driver was reckless.

167
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:22,190
You left work early saying you weren't well. What were you doing driving around?

168
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:24,260
Alright, hanging up now.

169
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:27,480
Hey, you're not going around doing stuff you shouldn't, are you?

170
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:31,100
- I'm hurting. Hanging up now.
   - Hey, Gu Reum. 

171
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:39,660
 Say, a human capable of shooting electricity like an eel, or a human that stings you with venom just like a jellyfish,  

172
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:44,680
 would that be a human? In reality, Dr. Ryu was actually making such genetic abnormalities. 

173
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:08,610
Professor, it's me. I have something to tell you.

174
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:33,030
Someone followed us.

175
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:34,860
Now?

176
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:40,780
Not now. Earlier.

177
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:46,060
I noticed a car in front of the church. It wasn't there when we went in.

178
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:48,830
I just found out it's an unregistered vehicle.

179
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:52,280
- So who was it?
 - I told you, it isn't registered.

180
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:59,700
No, whoever it was, they didn't follow us.

181
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:05,830
- Rather, they tracked us down. 
 - Did you tell someone where you were going?

182
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:07,940
No, I told no one.

183
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:12,080
- Then how did they know? 
 - There are many ways.

184
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:15,430
They could've installed a tracking device in my car or my phone.

185
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:18,270
They could've tracked me in real-time via satellite.

186
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:21,800
But what matters isn't how they found us.

187
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:25,900
- It's who they are after. 
 - Me.

188
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:29,660
Yeah, it's you.

189
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:34,480
Someone knows that we are together.

190
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:37,700
They're using me to get to you since they can't find you.

191
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:44,860
What's so special about you that they even go after a police officer?

192
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:51,190
- What are you, really? 
 - Didn't you say you weren't interested?

193
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:55,680
You could be more than just a murder witness.

194
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:59,550
Did I witness a murder?

195
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:02,920
Never mind. Let's go.

196
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:05,710
Where?

197
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:08,260
To find out who you are.

198
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:19,940
 Awooa Cosmetic Surgery Center 

199
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:39,800
It's okay. I called him.

200
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:46,720
Hello, Professor.

201
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:52,270
I was working on something inside. Is he that friend?

202
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:55,960
Well, he's not a friend.

203
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:59,830
He's the guy who ran away from the hospital.

204
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:05,120
Nice to meet you. I'm Oh Jong Hwan. This is my colleague's clinic, and I'm using it for a time.

205
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,270
There's no one but us here, so no worries.

206
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:10,400
What would I worry about?

207
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:15,930
I'm going to run a few tests on you today. It won't take long.

208
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:19,490
What are you talking about? What tests?

209
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:23,280
- Just a few simple tests.
 - You said nothing about tests.

210
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:29,510
- I'm telling you now.
 - But the tests aren't for you. They're for me.

211
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:33,030
What made you think you could make a decision like that on your own?  I won't get tested.

212
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:37,560
Hey, Hey!

213
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,310
I'm explaining why now.

214
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:45,970
You decided this by yourself, and  you're explaining only now. Why should I listen?

215
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:50,790
With tests, we can find out who made...

216
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:53,580
"Made" isn't the right word.

217
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:59,080
We can find out who gave you the power, or if the power is generated within you somehow.

218
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:02,670
That's the key to finding out who you are.

219
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:07,580
Let's do the tests. We both want to know, don't we?

220
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:13,690
What if digging up my past tells you that I killed your parents? What will you do then?

221
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:15,530
If that's the case,

222
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:22,930
you die too.

223
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:29,890
- So for you to decide to kill me or not, I have to go through with the tests, right?
 - Right.

224
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:31,760
Then, let's do them.

225
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:39,110
What do I have to do?

226
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:44,460
It's just some blood tests and biopsies. But before that,

227
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:50,460
by chance, have you seen this person before?

228
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:56,400
Not even once?

229
00:20:56,410 --> 00:21:00,880
I'm not sure if I've never seen him or I can't remember seeing him.

230
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:06,390
I see.  Shall we go in?

231
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,140
I'm about to swab some of your epithelial cells.

232
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:19,140
Open your mouth.

233
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:39,580
I'll collect some skin cells for a biopsy.

234
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:49,970
 Don't do it. Please don't! 

235
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,800
 Don't do it! 

236
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:23,680
To test your immunity and antibodies, I'm going to extract some spinal fluid.

237
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,710
It's going to hurt a lot more than you think.

238
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:29,490
- Do it quickly.
 - I'm beginning now.

239
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:27,540
 Please... 

240
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:37,960
Stop it. Stop it!

241
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:40,440
It's dangerous for you to get up now!

242
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,640
Put this on.

243
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:21,850
Did it hurt a lot?

244
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:32,820
I'm not going to say I'm sorry. Let's go back in.

245
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:34,290
The tests are nearly done.

246
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:38,160
I don't want to know anymore. Just leave me alone.

247
00:25:56,210 --> 00:26:01,190
Stop it. Don't do that.

248
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:18,430
When someone approaches me, I get chills all over.

249
00:26:18,430 --> 00:26:23,580
I get like that especially when a stranger approaches me in the dark.

250
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:27,670
But I didn't get that way with you.

251
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:48,100
You were never a danger to me, not in the hospital or at the subway station.

252
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:50,530
You were the only one.

253
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:55,320
You were the only one I thought I could be with.

254
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,210
Let's go back in.

255
00:26:58,390 --> 00:27:01,120
He said the next test wouldn't hurt as much.

256
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:04,750
If I had killed your parents,

257
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:08,050
the hair on my body would've stood on end when I saw you the first time.

258
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,090
It's not me.

259
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:14,510
The culprit is someone else.

260
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,300
Don't think of seeing me again.

261
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:19,250
The tests are almost done.

262
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:21,470
I don't want to know anymore.

263
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:23,580
I'm scared.

264
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:39,110
If you won't go back in, I'll take you by force.

265
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:27,710
Now might be a good time for you to fix up your whole face.

266
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:32,650
I desperately want to, but I don't have money.

267
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:36,290
Anyhow, are you okay?

268
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:41,750
Abetting a suspect will get you into trouble later.

269
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:48,460
He came to my house when I was little.

270
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:51,460
He did? How?

271
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:54,950
I don't know.

272
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:57,770
If your father worked by chance

273
00:28:57,770 --> 00:29:00,760
- Why?
 - in biotechnology,

274
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:03,740
I think he might be connected to Ji Oh.

275
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:08,290
I saw my father wear gowns when I was young.

276
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:14,420
So I thought he was a doctor. Later, I found out he worked at the Korea Aerospace Research Institute (KARI).

277
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:20,130
That's quite possible. Doctors are an essential human resource for exploring space.

278
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:25,220
But why did Ji Oh come to your house?

279
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:27,990
I don't know that myself.

280
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:33,090
But what's more puzzling is that

281
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:39,120
he disappeared the next day, along with my parents.

282
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,550
What do you mean?

283
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:44,550
It's just as I said. They disappeared.

284
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:48,700
After that day, my parents never came back.

285
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:51,060
Did they go missing?

286
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:55,330
That's why you're holding on to him.

287
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:57,860
In case he knew something about what happened to your parents.

288
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:59,690
Exactly.

289
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,770
But he ran away. That jerk.

290
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:07,690
I guess I've got to catch him again. Shall we get up?

291
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:09,570
Gu Reum.

292
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:17,640
You ... is this the case you said you were investigating continuously by yourself?

293
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:19,700
No, it's not.

294
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:22,550
You became a police officer because of it, right?

295
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:26,340
It's not that. It's all in the past.

296
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:31,600
And you got kicked out of Felony and Homicide because you were investigating your parents' case, correct?

297
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,520
As you did today.

298
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:41,100
Do you think your mom and dad are alive?

299
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:44,890
Or, do you think they are dead?

300
00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:49,980
Isn't that obvious?

301
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:55,330
When you've gone missing for five years,  you're presumed dead.

302
00:30:55,330 --> 00:31:00,760
No traces of my parents are found in clerical or financial records.

303
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,080
Apart from that.

304
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,860
Apart from that,

305
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:10,700
is there anything else?

306
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:18,160
I can't have my mom and dad alive.

307
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:21,630
Or else, it only means they  deserted me and ran away.

308
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:27,660
If they're alive and well, where does that leave me?

309
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:30,000
That shouldn't be.

310
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,700
It isn't right if they're alive.

311
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,460
Yet,

312
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:49,490
I keep hoping they're alive.

313
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:56,070
I want to see them just once.

314
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:04,930
Gu Reum, you are you.

315
00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:05,990
Okay.

316
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:08,620
You are you.

317
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:10,050
I know.

318
00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:13,170
No, you don't.

319
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:18,070
You're someone's daughter and friend.

320
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:21,180
You may be someone's mother later on.

321
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:24,760
You'll play many different roles in the course of your life.

322
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:30,540
More important than any role you play is being who you are.

323
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:37,450
Live your life as you, not as somebody's daughter.

324
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:42,870
Wise words.

325
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:46,260
However, they don't comfort me.

326
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:49,160
That's because all your emotions have dried up.

327
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:54,520
That's a bit comforting.

328
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:58,680
Your parents could ruin your life.

329
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:03,420
Later on, your husband or children could.

330
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:06,130
But you shouldn't.

331
00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:10,930
The last person to ruin your life is always you.

332
00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:14,420
Professor, let's talk about work.

333
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:17,310
When the results come out, you're going to tell me first, right?

334
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:19,460
Of course.

335
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:26,830
Will the tests show whether Ryu Jung Kwon

336
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:29,770
is connected to Ji Oh or not?

337
00:33:29,770 --> 00:33:34,750
Painters talk about the styles of paintings and brushstrokes.

338
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:40,030
The same can be said about scientists. Each scientist has their own distinct style of research. So we know who's who.

339
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:42,160
It if turns out Ji Oh is linked to Ryu Jong Kwon,

340
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:47,700
and if we find Dr. Ryu, can we know about Ji Oh's past too?

341
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:49,700
Probably.

342
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:52,860
That's enough then.

343
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:57,550
I'll get going. Thank you for your work, Professor.

344
00:33:57,550 --> 00:33:59,420
Alright.

345
00:34:33,470 --> 00:34:35,700
So bored.

346
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:37,210
Focus.

347
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:40,310
Until when do we have to be doing this?

348
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:44,130
Until Ji Oh shows up. Sit up straight.

349
00:34:44,130 --> 00:34:46,090
I don't want to.

350
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:51,410
Team Leader, you ought to feel this wind.

351
00:34:51,410 --> 00:34:54,150
I told you to sit up straight.

352
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:04,520
Nothing's more foolish than being faithful. I doubt he'll show up today.

353
00:35:07,290 --> 00:35:10,220
I saw your records.

354
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:14,660
My ex-boyfriend is in the military police. I coaxed him.

355
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:17,260
Do you want to die?

356
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:21,920
Team Leader, you killed nine people.

357
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:40,860
Didn't you go over that training exercise  hundreds of times?

358
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:43,020
Stop it.

359
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:46,510
Unless you're stupid, there's no way you can't tell the difference between a flash grenade and a real grenade.

360
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:48,150
I told you to stop.

361
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:53,850
Would it be that someone added explosives to your flash grenades?

362
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:00,630
That sort of thing happened to me, too.

363
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:05,730
During my bilateral training, I only took blank cartridges with me.

364
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:43,090
Lieutenant!

365
00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:45,400
- Lieutenant!
 - What happened?

366
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:13,860
After five people got killed, I knew what I had was live rounds of bullets.

367
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:18,070
I made sure they were blank rounds. I  had to wonder how that could happen.

368
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:24,490
Since it was an exercise, they gave us no live bullets. So I wondered  why I had them in my gun.

369
00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:30,520
I was sentenced to life. And twice, I think?

370
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:33,000
I tried to kill myself.

371
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,930
Why didn't you?

372
00:37:35,930 --> 00:37:38,220
Someone came looking for me.

373
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:40,900
Who?

374
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:46,650
I can't say who.  I promised him to carry that secret to my deathbed.

375
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:50,400
He told me then.

376
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:55,770
That if I obeyed him, he'd give me work and even a leg.

377
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:03,690
I hope you didn't go through anything like that, Team Leader?

378
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:17,330
 The decision is yours. 

379
00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:21,300
 You can rot in here, or come work for me. 

380
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:24,990
  What kind of work are you talking about?  

381
00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:27,270
 Let's just say you'll do something for your country. 

382
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:29,850
It isn't a conspiracy of any kind, I hope.

383
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:35,920
You and I just happened to make a similar  mistake, right?

384
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,960
A mistake that's never supposed to happen.

385
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:42,430
Enough. We just have to not make mistakes anymore.

386
00:38:57,620 --> 00:39:02,460
Aren't you sick of killing people you don't know without knowing why?

387
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:04,430
Go inside.

388
00:39:04,430 --> 00:39:07,010
Do you want to run away together?

389
00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:09,290
To where no one can find us.

390
00:39:09,290 --> 00:39:12,600
We are the best in the world when it comes to cover and concealment.

391
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:15,090
Go inside. I'll pretend I didn't hear that.

392
00:39:15,090 --> 00:39:17,630
You will pretend you didn't hear it?

393
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:21,650
That's just about the cruelest answer there is.

394
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:23,780
It makes the person hopeful till the end.

395
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:25,630
Don't expect anything from me.

396
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:29,000
If I run away by myself,

397
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,870
will you come to kill me, Team Leader?

398
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:32,880
Of course, I will.

399
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,820
I see.

400
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:38,720
Pretend you didn't hear that.

401
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:41,730
Don't get lax with your surveillance. And report to me if anything happens.

402
00:39:41,730 --> 00:39:44,080
I'll meet up with you tomorrow morning.

403
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:49,220
Are you running away?

404
00:39:49,910 --> 00:39:52,870
He is running away. How petty.

405
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:05,380

 Juan Metropolitan Police Agency 

408
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:39,510
What are you doing?

409
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:41,180
I am bringing you coffee.

410
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:44,700
Why? Are you sick?

411
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:46,870
- Out of your mind?
 - No.

412
00:40:46,870 --> 00:40:50,370
I just like you, Team Leader.

413
00:40:52,370 --> 00:40:56,190
You caused some trouble, didn't you?

414
00:40:57,820 --> 00:40:59,530
What trouble would I cause?

415
00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:03,110
Oh, Team Leader, you won't even recognize my sincerity.

416
00:41:03,110 --> 00:41:05,320
I'm quite hurt.

417
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:08,600
Just return this for me.

418
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,240
What is it?

419
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:13,320
Hey!

420
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:17,490
I just got you this phone. How did you ruin it like this already?

421
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:23,340
What did she do to it?

422

423
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:18,980
  Hello?  

424
00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:24,670
  Hello? Go on, speak. Hello?  

425
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:30,150
What? If you call, you should speak. Hello?

426
00:42:35,310 --> 00:42:39,190
You are Ji Oh, aren't you? This is Ji Oh, isn't it?

427
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:57,910
Why are you hanging up, you jerk?

428
00:42:57,910 --> 00:42:59,500
You are Ji Oh, aren't you?

429
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:02,890
Where are you? Do you have no money? Should I come get you?

430
00:43:02,890 --> 00:43:05,190
- Who—
 - You were going to ask who I was, weren't you?

431
00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:08,130
  It's me, man. Your friend Won Yi.  

432
00:43:08,130 --> 00:43:12,210
Don't wander around in the streets. Hurry, come home.

433
00:43:12,210 --> 00:43:13,820
  You've forgotten your address, right?  

434
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:16,360
  I'll tell you, so listen well.

 Embezzled Research Funds 

438
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:41,110
Why are you hovering?

439
00:43:41,110 --> 00:43:43,360
Thank you.

440
00:43:46,310 --> 00:43:53,270
The number is the same as before. So something is going on with you lately, right?

441
00:43:53,270 --> 00:43:55,640
- No. 
 - It's okay.

442
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:58,500
Think of me as your older brother and tell me everything.

443
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:01,710
I don't have a brother.

444
00:44:01,710 --> 00:44:04,380
Then think of me as your uncle.

445
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:08,000
I don't have an uncle, and nothing's up, either.

446
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,180
Really?

447
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:13,700
How about any grievance you have toward your team?

448
00:44:14,370 --> 00:44:18,350
None. I like being part of the team very much.

449
00:44:18,350 --> 00:44:20,720
And you are great, Team Leader.

450
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:24,480
So you don't have any problems? And you are in your right mind?

451
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,580
I said so.

452
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:30,670
No worries and no resentments? But you microwave your cell phone?

453
00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:33,530
A new cell phone you only received the day before?

454
00:44:33,530 --> 00:44:36,450
I went to visit General Affairs and they told me that the inside of the phone was completely burned up.

455
00:44:36,450 --> 00:44:40,790
Nothing could've burned the phone the way it was unless you put it in a microwave open. And I said you wouldn't have done it.

456
00:44:40,790 --> 00:44:45,210
What's the use of defending you? Do you know how ridiculous you continuously make me look?

457
00:44:45,210 --> 00:44:49,550
There's a rumor that a psychopath is in our team. Have you gone crazy?

458
00:44:49,550 --> 00:44:52,300
Why do you act this way?

459
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:55,260
- It's not like that?
 - If not, are you a psycho?

460
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:58,220
You got dumped by Felony and Homicide for doing what you do now. Correct?

461
00:44:58,220 --> 00:44:59,340
Just a minute.

462
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:02,310
Don't answer that. You transfer the call and answer it.

463
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:05,210
Yes, Criminal Investigation Team 1, Ha Gu Reum speaking.

464
00:45:05,210 --> 00:45:07,440
I told you not to answer it.

465
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:11,940
Yes, is that so?

466
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:14,450
Yes, got it.

467
00:45:14,450 --> 00:45:17,320
Hey, where are you going? Stop there!

468
00:45:18,110 --> 00:45:19,780
Come here.

469
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:22,730
Come here.

470
00:45:23,710 --> 00:45:25,300
Here.

471
00:45:26,830 --> 00:45:28,890
You sit down right here.

472
00:45:28,890 --> 00:45:33,270
Hey, you! Hey!

473
00:45:35,150 --> 00:45:38,010
That crazy psychopath!

474
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:16,710
Who is it?

475
00:47:19,550 --> 00:47:21,600
I'm asking who it is.

476
00:47:34,940 --> 00:47:37,320
Ji Oh, you punk.

477
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:42,590
I thought you were dead, you punk.

478
00:47:42,590 --> 00:47:46,890
You, come here, come here. You, punk.

479
00:47:46,890 --> 00:47:49,480
When did you last bathe? You stink so much.

480
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:51,340
Hey, come on in.

481
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:55,090
Shower first. Hey, where are you going?

482
00:47:55,090 --> 00:47:58,750
Take off your shoes. First, take your shoes off.

483
00:48:00,810 --> 00:48:03,030
Come in.

484
00:48:16,730 --> 00:48:19,610
I saw you on the news.

485
00:48:19,610 --> 00:48:23,430
But you are not that type of guy. You're not some righteous disciple.

486
00:48:23,430 --> 00:48:26,910
You're not even an eighth cousin of a righteous disciple (You're far from it).

487
00:48:28,550 --> 00:48:31,430
But you used electricity again, right?

488
00:48:31,430 --> 00:48:33,120
You do that all the time, you punk.

489
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:37,510
You're off to somewhere  alone. Each time you use your electricity, you lose your memory.

490
00:48:37,510 --> 00:48:41,620
And then you only contact me after a long time.

491
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:45,940
You call me, say nothing, just breathe heavily. And then, when I ask, "Are you Ji Oh?"

492
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:48,500
you say, "Who are you?" Ugh, you.

493
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:51,280
It's me, you punk.

494
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:53,590
Eat.

495
00:48:53,590 --> 00:48:56,050
But I'm impressed.

496
00:48:56,050 --> 00:48:59,980
You don't remember anything, but you memorized my number.

497
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:03,940
I can't change my number because of you, you punk.

498
00:49:05,450 --> 00:49:07,730
- Are we— 
 - Yes, correct. We are friends.

499
00:49:07,730 --> 00:49:11,610
- Then— 
 - Yes, we left the orphanage together and lived together. And you ran away every day,

500
00:49:11,610 --> 00:49:13,450
saying you would live alone.

501
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:16,730
In the past—

502
00:49:16,730 --> 00:49:19,980
In the past, we were an amazing pair.

503
00:49:20,770 --> 00:49:23,620
You knocked them out, and I emptied their pockets.

504
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:25,820
You broke doors open, and I stole everything.

505
00:49:25,820 --> 00:49:27,420
 Oh, this is nice. 

506
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:33,330
♫  Everyone is gone. Your fear of being alone.  ♫

507
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:39,100
♫  It will make you stronger.  ♫

508
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:42,990
 Come on, punk. You go.  
 ♫  Alone.  ♫

509
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:05,870
 This is a big one. 

510
00:50:05,870 --> 00:50:08,670
 Here, here. 

511
00:50:08,670 --> 00:50:13,550
Ji Oh, Ji Oh, look at that.

512
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:23,310
 Ji Oh, open it. 

513
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:26,710
 What are you waiting for? Open it. 

514
00:50:27,380 --> 00:50:30,930
 Open it, you punk. 

515
00:50:33,140 --> 00:50:35,730
 What are you doing? Open the door. 

516
00:51:07,780 --> 00:51:11,320
Your superpower electricity and my speed.

517
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:15,200
We were a small business on the go.

518
00:51:16,290 --> 00:51:19,320
But where have you been, this time?

519
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:21,890
- So we were such— 
 - Yes, bad guys.

520
00:51:21,890 --> 00:51:27,770
You didn't think we were good guys, by any chance? Look at you, acting shocked again.

521
00:51:27,770 --> 00:51:30,590
Don't think about going anywhere this time.  Do a business with me.

522
00:51:30,590 --> 00:51:34,020
I can make you ID's and passports if you need them.

523
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:35,270
You can make those things?

524
00:51:35,270 --> 00:51:39,440
Ji Oh, who made your driver's license for you?

525
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:44,180
- By any chance— 
 - By any chance, do I know who is chasing you?

526
00:51:44,180 --> 00:51:45,950
- Yeah. 
- Hey.

527
00:51:45,950 --> 00:51:51,180
are you really being chased? You always say that and leave, saying you can't stay for long.

528
00:51:51,180 --> 00:51:56,040
But who is chasing you? You said it wasn't the police. I'm more curious than you are.

529
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:00,800
- Who am I?
 - Oh no. Damn it.

530
00:52:03,860 --> 00:52:08,380
Our so-called parents threw us away as soon as we were born.

531
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:11,960
That's why the orphanage registered  our births.

532
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:16,460
Oh, do you remember those older kids who used to hit us every day?

533
00:52:16,460 --> 00:52:19,620
- I don't.
 - Right, of course, you don't.

534
00:52:20,650 --> 00:52:24,140
Anyway, we were getting pummeled  that day.

535
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:26,600
 - Stop it!
 - Let us go! 

536
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:27,980
 Stop it! 

537
00:52:27,980 --> 00:52:29,940
 Hurry and come down here. 

538
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:32,090
 No! 

539
00:52:41,170 --> 00:52:45,770
 When I regained consciousness, I saw the whole church burning. 

540
00:52:45,770 --> 00:52:48,530
I knew all along you'd burn down that church one day.

541
00:52:48,530 --> 00:52:53,260
Anyway, all the nuns were throwing fits, and that's when we ran away.

542
00:52:53,950 --> 00:52:58,220
So think about it. How would kids like us, just a little over 10 years old, survive in the streets?

543
00:52:58,220 --> 00:53:02,780
We lived on charity, begged for food, pickpocketed and stole.

544
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:09,670
What's the conclusion? Stop asking who you are and write it down.

545
00:53:09,670 --> 00:53:11,360
The conclusion is ...

546
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:16,130
you and I are nothing.

547
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:20,170
Why aren't you writing this down?

548
00:53:20,170 --> 00:53:24,110
Oh really. How about you get a tattoo instead?

549
00:53:24,110 --> 00:53:27,650
"I am abslolutely nothing." How about it?

550
00:53:32,330 --> 00:53:36,190
Before I went to that orphanage,

551
00:53:36,190 --> 00:53:40,920
did I ever talk about where I was, and what I did? For example, whose house I stayed in?

552
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:44,480
- You did say one thing.
 - What?

553
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:47,300
That you didn't remember a single thing.

554
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:54,450
I guess you used electricity once before you came to the orphanage.

555
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:58,420
Hey, listen to me.

556
00:53:59,610 --> 00:54:02,650
Don't suffer needlessly, as you do when you leave here.

557
00:54:02,650 --> 00:54:06,000
Stay here and work with me.

558
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,870
I loan people money, and you collect their debts.

559
00:54:08,870 --> 00:54:13,910
Just flash those blue eyes at those who won't pay us back, and it's over.

560
00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:20,610
As the proverbial saying goes, you can literally flash light beams out of your eyes  where money is due.

561
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:35,900
 NATIONAL FORENSIC SERVICE 

562
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:40,380
We have to wait again? How do detectives do those stakeouts?

563
00:54:40,380 --> 00:54:42,890
They should get a raise.

564
00:54:52,270 --> 00:54:55,420
- Why do you look at me with such disdain?
 - Sit up straight.

565
00:54:55,420 --> 00:54:57,910
If you don't want to look at me, then don't.

566
00:55:36,850 --> 00:55:39,990
 A-01 

567
00:55:43,650 --> 00:55:45,870
 Please let me live! 

568
00:55:45,870 --> 00:55:49,220
 - Where's Ji Oh?
   - I don't know. I really don't! 

569
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:51,160
 - You lived with him.
 - No. 

570
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:55,670
He just squatted in my place on his own.

571
00:55:55,670 --> 00:55:59,030
 It's true! It's true! 

572
00:55:59,030 --> 00:56:02,390
It's true! He just stayed for a bit and then left.

573
00:56:02,390 --> 00:56:06,840
 After that, I can't contact him, and he won't answer his phone. 

574
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:21,290
 I really don't know anything, you son of bitch! 

575
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:25,780
 Sorry for saying that. 

576
00:56:27,070 --> 00:56:31,750
 Please let me live. Please! Please let me live! 

577
00:56:41,110 --> 00:56:43,130
 If Ji Oh calls or comes to see you, 

578
00:56:43,130 --> 00:56:48,590
  I'll call you right away. Really, right away. 

579
00:56:48,590 --> 00:56:51,930
 Please let me live, please. 

580
00:56:54,420 --> 00:56:58,170
 Yes. Get a hold of me immediately. 

581
00:56:58,170 --> 00:57:02,300
And if you have any other thoughts, remember this sound.

582
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:15,610
 A-01 

583
00:57:15,610 --> 00:57:18,520
 A-01 

584
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:23,750
 A-01 

585
00:57:25,460 --> 00:57:27,890
- Speak.
 - It's me.

586
00:57:27,890 --> 00:57:29,240
What happened?

587
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:32,950
Ji Oh just came. He's at my place.

588
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:35,670
Keep him there no matter what.

589
00:57:35,670 --> 00:57:37,340
Yes.

590
00:57:38,270 --> 00:57:40,210
Ji Oh has been found.

591
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:02,940
 NFS 

592
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:08,140
I went through it roughly.

593
00:58:08,140 --> 00:58:13,320
So, this is why people don't find science interesting. I don't understand a thing.

594
00:58:14,980 --> 00:58:16,380
Look.

595
00:58:16,380 --> 00:58:21,260
- This is a DNA homology test.
 - What's homology?

596
00:58:21,260 --> 00:58:26,610
It's an analysis of how much homogeneity (similarity) there is between two cells.

597
00:58:26,610 --> 00:58:29,680
I see more than six distinct character traits of each cell are combined.

598
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:31,370
What does that mean?

599
00:58:31,370 --> 00:58:36,170
So that means, there are at least six DNA types in one body.

600
00:58:36,170 --> 00:58:38,340
What?

601
00:58:38,340 --> 00:58:41,500
The most distinct characteristic is that of the knifefish.

602
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:43,920
What is a knifefish?

603
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:48,370
Simply put, they're electric eels. But actually, electric eels

604
00:58:48,370 --> 00:58:50,650
aren't really eels. They're fish.

605
00:58:50,650 --> 00:58:54,850
In any case, there is electric eel DNA mixed in there?

606
00:58:54,850 --> 00:58:57,570
It's not just that.

607
00:58:57,570 --> 00:59:00,040
The DNA characteristics of red jellyfish, sturgeons,

608
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:02,320
bats and fruit flies.

609
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:04,300
All these characteristics are present.

610
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:09,560
If all these characteristics are combined, the entity can generate and sense electricity.

611
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:14,190
It can also have a superior capacity for recovery and reflexes that far exceed those of humans.

612
00:59:14,190 --> 00:59:17,260
Is it possible to combine DNA characteristics to that extent?

613
00:59:17,260 --> 00:59:22,500
Though in theory only now, if someone unlocked the secret of L.U.C.A. (Last Universal Common Ancestor), such is possible.

614
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:24,800
What's L.U.C.A.?

615
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:28,120
Gu Reum, when do you think your life began?

616
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:31,350
Me? My existence, you mean?

617
00:59:31,350 --> 00:59:33,430
No, biologically.

618
00:59:34,470 --> 00:59:35,760
It would be in my mother's womb.

619
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:42,090
Right. Your life form began when a sperm and an egg, two cells of different characteristics got mixed.

620
00:59:42,090 --> 00:59:47,960
The two cells must have something in common to help blend their respective DNA, yes?

621
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:49,620
I suppose so.

622
00:59:49,620 --> 00:59:55,260
If you look at the origins of all species, there is an ancestor cell which has something in common with every life form.

623
00:59:55,260 --> 01:00:00,060
That is called L.U.C.A., Last Universal Common Ancestor.

624
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:04,120
Is it a mutation, then?

625
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:06,140
No.

626
01:00:06,140 --> 01:00:10,970
No mutation can be this elaborate. This was engineered from the beginning.

627
01:00:10,970 --> 01:00:13,870
You mean somebody engineered a life form?

628
01:00:15,870 --> 01:00:19,680
Professor, isn't that in the realm of God?

629
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:24,710
No. It's in the realm of technology, although it is forbidden.

630
01:00:28,450 --> 01:00:30,320
Could this be the work of Dr. Ryu Jung Kwon?

631
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:32,280
Ninety-nine percent.

632
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:37,360
He's the only one with the skills to combine the genes to this extent.

633
01:00:37,360 --> 01:00:40,080
And he's the only one crazy enough to do something like this.

634
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:45,150
Then are the people chasing Ji Oh sent by him, too?

635
01:00:45,150 --> 01:00:49,270
I don't know, but I think I better consult academia.

636
01:00:49,270 --> 01:00:51,890
Also, I need to see whether my analysis is correct.

637
01:00:51,890 --> 01:00:53,990
And you,

638
01:00:56,060 --> 01:01:01,400
if you meet him again, make sure to keep him with you. You must.

639
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:02,550
Why?

640
01:01:02,550 --> 01:01:07,320
Now I can tell you this with all certainty.  He isn't human.

641
01:01:22,620 --> 01:01:24,580
What's going on?

642
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:37,790
You are something.

643
01:01:37,790 --> 01:01:41,270
Coming here again after getting screwed over twice.

644
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:57,410
There was a stray dog.

645
01:01:57,410 --> 01:02:02,060
An animal control center took him in and examined him to see if he had a disease.

646
01:02:02,060 --> 01:02:06,300
And it tried to feed him, too. But the dog didn't appreciate any of that.

647
01:02:06,300 --> 01:02:10,300
The dog just runs away like crazy. Like you.

648
01:02:11,090 --> 01:02:13,980
I don't have diseases. And I eat well.

649
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:18,920
That's what the dog thought of himself, contrary to how people saw him.

650
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:21,530
- Let's go.
 - Stop the bullshit.

651
01:04:43,450 --> 01:04:47,450
Although we caught him, we lost.

652
01:05:10,140 --> 01:05:15,010
Go up there and erase the pictures from their cell phones. Clean up well before you leave.

653
01:05:23,690 --> 01:05:26,120
 Human Tech 

654
01:05:58,650 --> 01:06:05,050
It's the research data that took me over thirty years to collect.

655
01:06:05,090 --> 01:06:09,470
For that research result, I dedicated my whole life.

656
01:06:09,470 --> 01:06:12,130
Without bearing my name, it was uploaded for all to see.

657
01:06:12,130 --> 01:06:14,880
You should've stopped it.

658
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:19,200
My life's work was thrown open to those damn fools in the Academy.

659
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:22,840
Those holding positions in the Academy are nothing but a load of crap.

660
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:25,430
Bullshit!

661
01:06:25,430 --> 01:06:29,250
They can never catch up to me. But who knows what they'll do with my research results?

662
01:06:29,250 --> 01:06:30,450
My research.

663
01:06:30,450 --> 01:06:34,330
There's just no telling they won't take away my life's work.

664
01:06:34,330 --> 01:06:37,830
You might as well go public with your patent.

665
01:06:37,830 --> 01:06:42,110
It's an act  of murdering a scientist.

666
01:06:44,100 --> 01:06:46,310
What makes you so high and mighty, huh?

667
01:06:46,310 --> 01:06:49,130
Without me, you could not have come this far.

668
01:06:49,130 --> 01:06:53,600
Ji Oh is the result of my science worth over billions and trillions.

669
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:59,010
The existence of Ji Oh is what testifies to my worth.

670
01:06:59,010 --> 01:07:01,740
Do you even have the slightest clue?

671
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:05,810
Are you finished?

672
01:07:06,910 --> 01:07:09,490
Go out there right this minute and solve the problem.

673
01:07:09,490 --> 01:07:16,800
Burn the server or do whatever you have to. Just take down my research data.

674
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:19,290
You're not acting right now, are you?

675
01:07:19,290 --> 01:07:20,140
What?

676
01:07:20,140 --> 01:07:23,310
Such a passionate performance. It's weird.

677
01:07:23,310 --> 01:07:25,540
Look here!

678
01:07:25,540 --> 01:07:29,410
That was uploaded by your buddy, Professor Oh Jong Hwan at NFS (National Forensic Service).

679
01:07:29,410 --> 01:07:33,350
I'm leaning toward thinking he uploaded that at your own bidding.

680
01:07:33,350 --> 01:07:35,480
What kind of crazy talk is that?

681
01:07:35,480 --> 01:07:38,760
Why would I do such a thing when

682
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:41,950
the Academy sold its soul for a few dollars of research subsidies?

683
01:07:41,950 --> 01:07:47,300
Why else? You aren't as good as you were once when Ha Young Jae worked with you after his disappearance.

684
01:07:47,300 --> 01:07:51,090
By tacitly allowing your work to go public, you can anonymously solicit advice and suggestions.

685
01:07:51,090 --> 01:07:55,220
It's a form of cheating you did. Am I wrong?

686
01:07:55,220 --> 01:07:58,330
What you say is simply beyond me. How can you doubt me?

687
01:07:59,300 --> 01:08:03,700
The only thing leaked to NFS was Ji Oh's blood sample while he was in the hospital.

688
01:08:03,700 --> 01:08:08,670
But the data uploaded now includes his blood and epithelial and skin cells.

689
01:08:08,670 --> 01:08:13,310
It even shows the biopsies of his liver and lung plus spinal fluid.

690
01:08:13,310 --> 01:08:16,840
Did Ji Oh get a physical?

691
01:08:16,840 --> 01:08:18,700
That can't be.

692
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:24,770
By logic, we've come to conclude you leaked the data.

693
01:08:25,700 --> 01:08:28,350
Help me understand.

694
01:08:28,350 --> 01:08:30,710
How could you do something like that?

695
01:08:30,710 --> 01:08:33,800
I've never done such a thing.

696
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:36,730
There's no way I'd do such a thing in my right mind.

697
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:43,040
Ambition for fame, perhaps? You, scientists have that, don't you?

698
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:46,710
You want to tell the world, 'I've done the impossible!'

699
01:08:46,710 --> 01:08:48,640
'I deserve a Nobel Prize.'

700
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:51,820
Isn't it your lifelong dream to see your name in the Hall of Fame?

701
01:08:51,820 --> 01:08:53,770
No!

702
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:57,010
That isn't true.

703
01:08:57,780 --> 01:09:01,170
I don't need such things.

704
01:09:01,170 --> 01:09:05,080
Without the need for such things, you aren't a  scientist.

705
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:14,350
I'll erase the data soon.

706
01:09:14,350 --> 01:09:20,440
But until we find out how the data got uploaded, I don't trust you.

707
01:09:21,530 --> 01:09:25,070
And you've reached a certain age now.

708
01:09:25,070 --> 01:09:29,530
Don't talk down to me just because you're a little angry.

709
01:09:29,530 --> 01:09:31,800
Act with some class.

710
01:10:03,810 --> 01:10:05,550
Yes.

711
01:10:08,620 --> 01:10:10,100
What?

712
01:10:11,110 --> 01:10:13,560
Did you just say you got him?

713
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:15,950
Let's do a FaceTime.

714
01:10:23,080 --> 01:10:25,130
Bring him in here right away.

715
01:10:38,890 --> 01:10:42,130
 Where are we going? 

716
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:45,980
 Where are you taking me?  

717
01:11:19,410 --> 01:11:21,040
 What are you doing? Please don't! 

718
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:23,060
 Why are you doing this? Why? 

719
01:11:23,060 --> 01:11:25,630
 What are you doing to me? Please, stop! 

720
01:11:25,630 --> 01:11:27,970
 Why are you doing this? 

721
01:11:27,970 --> 01:11:29,980
 Why are you— 

722
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:33,110
 He's the child I told you about. 

723
01:11:33,110 --> 01:11:35,440
 You won't regret this? 

724
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:40,710
 As you promised, I need your assurance for my family's safety and funds for us to settle abroad. 

725
01:11:40,710 --> 01:11:44,310
 Let's run some tests first to see if what you told us is true. 

726
01:11:51,410 --> 01:11:54,520
 You said you'd buy me something delicious. 

727
01:11:54,520 --> 01:11:57,220
 You said we were going on a picnic. 

728
01:11:57,220 --> 01:12:01,100
 You promised you'd never give me another shot.  

729
01:12:03,240 --> 01:12:06,660
 My people are seeing your wife now. 

730
01:12:06,660 --> 01:12:11,470
 We're ready with the money and the account for you. As long as the data you turned over to us is true and correct, 

731
01:12:11,470 --> 01:12:14,600
 I'll make sure the money gets to your wife immediately. 

732
01:12:17,050 --> 01:12:19,070
 Don't. Please don't.  

733
01:12:19,070 --> 01:12:21,470
 Please don't. 

734
01:12:22,630 --> 01:12:24,520
 Stop! 

735
01:12:26,550 --> 01:12:30,340
