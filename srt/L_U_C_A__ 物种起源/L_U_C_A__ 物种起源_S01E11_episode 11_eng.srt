7
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:36,510
  This is a work of fiction. Any resemblance to actual names, places, organizations, religious references, and incidents is entirely coincidental.  

8
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:43,060
  This episode was filmed with adequate accommodations to ensure the safety and the emotional well-being of the infant and minor actors used.

11
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:02,360
It's okay, my baby.

12
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,800
You trust Mommy, right?

13
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:09,840
Everything will be alright.

14
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:14,150
Let's go.

15
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:45,740
He shines brightly even in the darkness.

16
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:49,120
He sees you wherever you hide.

17
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:52,430
The sins of your deeds and even the sins of your thoughts,

18
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:56,480
he'll punish you for them all. Thus he has spoken.

19
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:10,160
Stop the nonsesical lies!

20
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:15,140
The baby angel or whatnot, I gave you all that I had.

21
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:17,540
You've been going on about the same thing for the last ten years!

22
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:22,090
A fraud like you must die now!

23
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:24,470

They're going nuts.

00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,610
We'll be okay.

39
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:36,750
Go back in without causing problems for us.

40
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,940
Are you here to catch me or save me?

41
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,980
You've got blood on you.

42
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,950
Let's go.

43
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:12,720
We can get out of here right now.

44
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:27,320
This is the first time I'm holding the baby.

45
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,290
That's not how you hold her.

46
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:31,640
Give her to me. I'll hold her.

47
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:37,210
Ji Oh, give me the baby.

48
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:41,580
Let's go back in.

49
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:43,980
I risked my life to get out of there.

50
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:46,380
This is the safest place.

51
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:50,130
No one dares to harm us here.

52
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:51,340
This place is a prison.

53
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:53,760
The outside is an even bigger prison.

54
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:56,200
Get in.

55
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,390
Ji Oh.

56
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:01,190
Ji Oh!

57
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:06,340
 In the darkness, you shall cry alone in sorrow. 

58
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:09,200
 In the light, I shall lament and cry with you. 

59
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,760
  I have heard your prayers and seen your tears.  

60
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:16,820
Thus says he, "If you lower yourselves before me, I will raise you."

61
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:21,040
To only those who fall prostrate and cry, he will show his grace and glory.

62
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:26,680
Those who do not know what honor is are like perishing beasts.

63
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,040
Even when you come to realize the Divine Presence,

64
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:34,190
if you don't well up with tears,  you are no different from beasts!

65
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,880
 Our tears are like the dewdrops at nightfall, 

66
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,610
 his tears are weightier than the waterfall pouring into the ocean. 

67
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:49,800
 Who can know it fully?   

68
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:19,990
Do you remember the place we lived in?

69
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:23,510
I thought we had it all, but you didn't.

70
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:25,680
 We have nothing. 

71
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,470
 No future, no hope. 

72
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:30,460
 And what's worse, we have no money. 

73
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:33,350
 Look around, we have nothing. 

74
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:35,880
You're still the same.

75
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:41,730
I see a future and hope for us here, but you don't.

76
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:43,830
What hope?

77
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:46,300
I won't. Nor do I want to.

78
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:50,180
Then don't. You don't need to.

79
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:57,660
I'll walk the path of evil. You walk the one of good.

80
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,460
I'll do anything for us.

81
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:04,450
What on earth are you going to do?

82
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:19,220
 A baby sheep grows in an artificial womb. 

83
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:21,730
Are you crazy? That's ridiculous.

84
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:26,150
If there are hundreds of thousands of kids  like our daughter, no one will dare to harm her.

85
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:28,890
Will more of what's abnormal make it normal?

86
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:31,210
Ji Oh, please come to your senses.

87
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:33,320
There are things we can and can't do as people.

88
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,640
What is abnormal?

89
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:40,810
Is anyone different from you abnormal? I've never thought you're abnormal.

90
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:44,490
I'm going to destroy the arrogance of people.

91
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:49,260
I'll show them it's okay to live just as you are with what you have.

92
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:52,020
What you want to change isn't  the world, but the people in it.

93
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:55,420
That's human remodeling.  How are you different from the others?

94
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:58,940
That's the only way for our family to survive.

95
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:02,320
When it comes down to survival, there's no good or bad.

96
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:07,820
Ji Oh.

97
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:13,620
Will you really let yourself become a monster?

98
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,490
Just...as much as I need to.

99
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:34,420
I heard you had quite a night last night.

100
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:37,690
You've succeeded, Spiritual Leader.

101
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:40,590
It was some mountain climber's dream

102
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:44,760
to scale all fourteen peaks of the Himalayas in his 20's.

103
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,650
After numerous failed attempts,

104
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:52,100
he finally realized his dream as he neared his fifties.

105
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:54,650
Perhaps because it took him so long

106
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:56,440
joy wasn't the only emotion he felt.

107
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,990
I'm sure he wasn't sad about it either.

108
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,780
Now that Ji Oh became something like a god,

109
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:06,010
you've made your dream come true.

110
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:09,980
Once the clones are made, we'll handle them, going forward.

111
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:14,390
What do you mean? Why should you handle something that we make?

112
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:15,850
Ji Oh alone, maybe.

113
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:20,200
But for this magnitude, we feel uneasy about letting a private business handle it.

114
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:24,220
It will be difficult to deal with the consequences if the clones fall into the wrong hands and are used as human weapons

115
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:28,430
Still, we'll continue to support your business with what you need.

116
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:33,320
You clearly misunderstand something on a colossal level.

117
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:36,160
It's  we  who have been assisting your business.

118
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:41,710
We shouldered all responsibility for illegal experiments on living humans, which the intelligence agencies couldn't do.

119
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:44,000
Hence my superior is grateful for your hard work.

120
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,940
Your superior, who? Director Kim or Oh or Song? Who?

121
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:52,940
I have many superiors above me. My organization has many levels.

122
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:56,990
Director Jeong, stop acting up.

123
00:11:56,990 --> 00:12:01,350
Do you know how many  of your superiors' heads will roll from just one word from me?

124
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:04,950
In politics, economy, society in general, and culture,

125
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:08,070
plus in religion and even sports, we foster many organizations.

126
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:11,020
When any of these organizations becomes big enough, we're helped by them.

127
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:16,960
When the organizations grow interconnected, they become one gigantic lump in which they sustain one another.

128
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:20,500
In good times, they're collectively called the Establishment.

129
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:25,970
In tough times, they're called unorthodox and dangerous. The thing that's important is this.

130
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:29,790
The star is that lump, and we're its supporting cast.

131
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:33,190
Whenever the supporting cast overacts, the film is ruined. You know that, right?

132
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:39,140
I know quite well what you're saying. So go and tell your superiors this.

133
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:42,140
That I'll handle everything, so  they  shouldn't overact.

134
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:48,910
At my one command, I have hundreds of people willing to throw themselves with grenades in their hands.

135
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:54,920
I'll pass it along. After all, I'm just someone doing the hands-on work.

136
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,150
What's going on with Director Kim?

137
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:02,380
Lee Son has gone under the radar, and I thought I put some sense into Director Kim.

138
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:06,410
But he hasn't turned in his letter of resignation and has gone into hiding.

139
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:12,290
I suppose when you get older, you grow less inclined to listen. Right?

140
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:23,020
Do you want to transfer? Okay.

141
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:27,210
Well,  why is it so complicated? Damn it.

142
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:31,330
What was the passcode for transfer? Okay.

143
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:34,650
Done.

144
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,270
- Did you see the money deposited to you?
 - Yes, Sir.

145
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:43,050
From here on out, we're stuck together with the unbreakable tie of money.

146
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:46,520
Do this with your lives on the line. Listen to me well, and I'll give you the life you want.

147
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:50,300
- Who's the target? 
 - Damn it, I forgot about that.

148
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:58,110
You just need to kill all four of them.

149
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:00,930
If anyone gets in the way, do what you must to get rid of them.

150
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:07,170
When you finish, put his corpse alone into a body bag and bring it frozen to Juan Airport.

151
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:10,190
The moment you hand me the body bag, the rest of the money will be deposited to you.

152
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:12,360
- Questions? 
 - Are guns allowed?

153
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:16,600
This is the Republic of Korea. Don't you know it's illegal to use guns?

154
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:20,960
When you get there, you'll see a baby. Taking it as a hostage is the easiest.

155
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,740
You're dismissed for now, and assemble again when I tell you the time and the place.

156
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,560
Yes, Sir.

157
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:30,760
Who are they?

158
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:34,630
They're just like you. The guys I used once and got rid of.

159
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:37,860
Still, do they come to you when you call?

160
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:42,270
Even ghosts can be ordered around with money. Why not men?

161
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:44,880
Are the shots okay for you?

162
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,210
Yes.

163
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:49,120
- Any side effects?
 - None.

164
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:54,240
This is the last. Take it.

165
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,750
Dr. Ryu said this injection will make your cells go to war against each other.

166
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:01,300
The weak ones will be killed and only the strong will survive.

167
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:06,320
And the surviving cells will work feverishly to differentiate in order to fortify their power.

168
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,240
- Do you know what that means?
 - I do.

169
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,260
Do you, really?

170
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:14,920
In a few days, that arm of yours will explode.

171
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:18,560
Doesn't matter. I only need to kill Ji Oh.

172
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,870
Fine.

173
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:25,190
There was a time when I put my life on the line, trusting my guts alone.

174
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:30,830
It was all useless. Wait for my call.

175
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:44,530
The people who hold this place together are those fanatics.

176
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:48,290
The fact that they knelt before you

177
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:52,200
means you just became the king over this church.

178
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:55,440
Is becoming a king of a cult religion something to celebrate?

179
00:15:58,110 --> 00:16:03,240
Do you think this place exists just as a church? Not at all.

180
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:06,980
This is just one of the cartels that comprise the giant Establishment.

181
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:11,290
It's too big and deep to crumble when any of them is cut off.

182
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:14,380
It's an organization that won't vanish when any part of it revolutionizes itself.

183
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:19,540
That organization is finally starting to use you.

184
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:21,270
I won't let myself used by anyone.

185
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:23,550
You're being used already.

186
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:25,980
How would they feel since they witnessed the Divine Messenger with their own eyes?

187
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:28,820
Selling and giving away all they have would be nothing for them.

188
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:32,270
What's really frightening is, with your words alone,

189
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:36,960
you can get people to jump into fire carrying grenades.

190
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:41,270
- I won't say such words—
 - Of course, you won't.

191
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:44,200
What about the Spiritual Leader?

192
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:48,370
It seems to me the woman can do anything by  invoking your name.

193
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:49,940
I guess anyone can be her target.

194
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:55,390
This is how they control the world. By confusion.

195
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:58,390
They pit people against each other by their regions, sexes, and even generations.

196
00:16:58,390 --> 00:17:02,070
As they fight tooth and nail, they don't even know who their real enemy is.

197
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:06,980
You coming on the scene on top of eveything  will usher in utter chaos.

198
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:09,700
That'll be the fall of our views on religion, values, and the world.

199
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:13,370
And that's no different from war.

200
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:16,770
Is there anything more profitable than war?

201
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:19,510
Hence, they're dragging you into this.

202
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:23,470
Is that why you made me? For their sake?

203
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:31,550
They're nothing more than ordinary people.

204
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:37,000
You'll destroy all of them

205
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,590
and bring in a new order.

206
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:44,840
I don't need anything as grand as order or chaos.

207
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:50,310
For me, the world where my daughter goes to school and has friends to be with is enough.

208
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:56,380
Anyone with the thought of using me will be the first to die.

209
00:17:56,380 --> 00:18:01,270
Don't forget the reason why I've kept you alive in spite of all that you've done to me.

210
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:03,500
Just tell me what your plan is for the coming days.

211
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,910
I am your father.

212
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:15,660
Leave us alone.

213
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:31,670
The experiment was done at a pediatric hospital in Philadelphia a few years ago. This is an artificial womb.

214
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:34,710
They raised a premature baby in it.
 A 23-week old human baby survives in a similar fashion. 

215
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:39,380
The baby was born healthy just as it would've from a real womb.

216
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:44,480
Not only in America but in Japan, Europe,

217
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,980
and in Korea, too, the experiment has been done.

218
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:51,970
I eagerly awaited the perfection of this technology.

219
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:56,520
No need for surrogates. If there are a hundred of these, a hundred  will be born, and if a thousand, a thousand.

220
00:18:56,520 --> 00:19:00,060
This thing can reproduce, in one year, thousands the same as you.

221
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:06,360
This is, indeed, the greatest blessing from science.

222
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:09,340
Is what is made in this way ...

223
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:11,850
really human? 
 Connect the umbilical cord to the tube. Supply oxygen and nutrients.  

224
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:16,060
What's wrong with this? What's a human anyway?

225
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:20,820
There isn't much to being human.

226
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:23,340
Nor is it  some great being.

227
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:29,640
You said there's a bare minimum number that can survive the ecosystem.

228
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:35,670
Take my cells. Whether that number is a thousand or tens of thousands,

229
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:38,130
make as many as you need.

230
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:44,060
Did you say one hundred ova?

231
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:48,240
There may be defective ones, so it'll be good to have ten extra ones.

232
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,460
My followers line themselves up  to conceive Divine Children.

233
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:56,930
Getting a hundred surrogates can be done in no time. Aren't they better than an artificial womb?

234
00:19:56,930 --> 00:20:00,930
The artificial womb is stronger and more reliable  even when it's overworked.

235
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:04,680
Babies' conditions can be observed with the naked eye as well.

236
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:07,780
My followers will be disappointed.

237
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:13,950
I find it hard to rely on people. I'll only take the egg cells.

238
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:21,790
All I need is to run a few simple tests and draw your blood.

239
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:24,640
What about my bone marrow?

240
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:29,220
When I collected stems in the past, I did it by drawing from bone marrow or cultured it using an organism.

241
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:33,640
Nowadays, blood from any superficial body part will do.

242
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:48,780
Have you ever heard of immortal jellyfish?

243
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,630
No.

244
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:54,780
They're the Red Sea Jellyfish.

245
00:20:54,780 --> 00:21:00,670
They're given the name because of their eternal longevity. Speaking in human terms,

246
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:05,250
it's like an old man, nearing his death, shedding his old cells,

247
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:08,460
and returning to being a fetus all over again.

248
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:10,800
That's precisely what we are about to do.

249
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:14,950
When electricity is amped to its maximum, cells that are about to die will die.

250
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:18,680
Only new and strong cells will live.

251
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:23,010
This way, we get the best of fertilized eggs.

252
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:25,110
Begin.

253
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,900
It won't be as painful as before.

254
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:39,200
I have no more pain to feel.

255
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,650
The voltage will be increased incrementally till it reaches Level 6.

256
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:46,220
Let's get started.

257
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,960
Sweetheart.

258
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:16,530
They say the world was a dot in the beginning.

259
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:21,710
From that same dot, the universe and mankind came into being.

260
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:26,370
In other words, we were that tiny dot in the beginning.

261
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:33,510
♫  The light shining through the night  ♫

262
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:39,530
That dot became a whale and an eagle.

263
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:41,780
It became a human, too.

264
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:46,100
Isn't it all so mysterious?

265
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:48,980
Then a man came along

266
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:53,600
and solved the mystery of that dot.

267
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:58,280
Then the man came to have the power to make anything he wanted.

268
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:02,620
He made people and animals.

269
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:08,540
He made what wasn't human and animals, too.

270
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:20,960
That's how your father was born.

271
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:30,490
But if your heart is human, you are truly human.

272
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:35,660
Right? You've got to remember what Mom says.

273
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:41,400
That you are never a monster.

274
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:04,410
 Injae Sunsa,  the giant of Chinese Buddhism wrote in  Injae Rok,   a book about gaining understanding,

275
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:09,260
there is a passage that says,  'Bongbul salbul bongjo sajo.' 

276
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:13,740
When you meet Buddha, kill Buddha, and when you meet a teacher, kill the teacher.

277
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:17,180
Kill anything that stands in the path of your understanding.

278
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:21,040
He concluded at the end that you are to kill yourself, too.

279
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:27,600
Not only our religion but others, too, teach the denial of all faiths apart from the true one.

280
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:33,200
Relay to all our regional faith leaders that this should be the essence of their prayers.

281
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:38,550
Tell them, starting today, to select only the true believers and put them in the book of names.

282
00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:46,050
Supreme Spiritual Leader, did the Divine Messenger really come to the earth?

283
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:51,570
Correct. He greeted all my followers in person.

284
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:57,130
Why do you all look so surprised?

285
00:24:57,130 --> 00:24:59,390
What, did you not truly believe in the coming of the Messenger?

286
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:02,160
Oh, no, no.

287
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:08,260
Now that he bore witness to the divine words, no one can call us a cult anymore.

288
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:11,660
How should we select those to go in the book of names?

289
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:16,550
As proof of their true faith, tell them to dedicate what they treasure the most.

290
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:19,270
Be it money or time or youth.

291
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:23,700
Only those who give their all will go into the book of names.

292
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:27,660
I'm going to draw some blood and see your cell immunity.

293
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:31,790
I'll repeat today's tests for a week or so.

294
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:35,150
I'm going to take the best of your cells.

295
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:40,480
Ji Oh.

296
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:57,550
♫  What should I do  ♫

297
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:12,900
♫  Please wait, I wish you’re here  ♫

It's Dad. It's your dad, my baby.

00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:19,990
Daddy is here.

300

00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:45,100
Sweetheart, it's Mom. Mommy is here. It's okay.

303
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:47,770
I was just surprised, that's all. I'm sorry.

304
00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:51,180
I'm sorry. Sorry.

305
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:55,190
It's alright. Mommy is okay, so don't cry. Can you please leave?

306
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:56,790
What if it happens again when you're alone?

307
00:27:56,790 --> 00:28:02,440
I was just startled. That won't happen again. So please leave.

308
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:05,780

Don't scream, or you'll startle the baby.

317

Ji Oh.

318
00:28:55,330 --> 00:29:00,820
There's something wrong with the baby. She doesn't seem to recognize her mom.

319
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:02,550
What do you mean?

320
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:05,430
Looks like she has memory loss.

321
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:09,940
That's bullshit.

322
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:15,650
Just like you. She has memory loss.

323
00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:17,840
Shut up!

324
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:30,190
♫  What should I do?  ♫

325
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:31,580

Sweetheart, sorry. Mommy's sorry.

327
00:29:35,410 --> 00:29:38,160
Mommy isn't hurt. It's alright.

328

♫  What should I do?  ♫

329
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:54,390
♫  Please swear.  ♫

330
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:23,700
Speaking.

331
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:25,820
  Come down. Let's go.  

332
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:27,100
Is it time for the operation?

333
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:31,180
Today is the day of prayer. The easiest day to break in.

334
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:47,460
These are the cells that produce electricity.

335
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:51,800
This is yours, and this is your daughter's.

336
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:55,550
You two were different at first.

337
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:59,890
This is the first day she came in. And this is from her first test.

338
00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:04,160
And this is from the day she first released electricity.

339
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:07,410
And this...

340
00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:09,400
 Specific analysis of Control-B’s Chromosome 6 by gene mapping 

341
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,580
is from last night.

342
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:18,230
I initially thought that because of the degeneration of her cells, they wouldn't function.

343
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:21,450
But hers gradually began to resemble yours.

344
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:26,480
Now they match you perfectly.

345
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,560
 Specific Analysis of Control-B's Chromosome &amp; by Gene Mapping 

346
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:34,830
 Control-B's gene map day by day 

347
00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:44,140
Once electricity circulates, it kills off weak cells.

348
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:50,250
That goes the same for brain cells, causing memory loss.

349
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:55,600
I woke up each day in an unfamiliar place.

350
00:32:00,730 --> 00:32:05,480
 I couldn't  remember why and how I ended up there. 

351
00:32:08,410 --> 00:32:12,970
 The person in the mirror was a stranger to me, and I wasn't sure that was me. 

352
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:17,260
I thought it'd be better to die.

353
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:21,470
I really wanted to die, but I've kept myself alive till now  because I wanted to know who I was.

354
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:25,530
Then one day, you began not losing your memories even when you used your electricity, correct?

355
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,570
The day when I fell off from the rooftop.

356
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,490
Since then, my memories don't go away.

357
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:47,630
Probably, you gave out the amount of electricity your body couldn't handle that day.

358
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:52,350
It's likely that all your weak cells burnt, leaving only the strongest to survive.

359
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:58,100
No matter what electricity you use, only the cells that withstand remain. You can now keep your memories.

360
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:02,340
There is only one way to treat her.

361
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:05,560
Electric shock.

362
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,700
Are you going to run electricity in a baby?

363
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:09,920
We've got to try until she overcomes her limitations.

364
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:12,010
No. You can't do that to my child.

365
00:33:12,010 --> 00:33:14,420
She's your daughter.

366
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:16,130
She won't die.

367
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:21,300
You were never allowe outside of the lab until you became six years old.

368
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:25,480
Since you wanted so much to go out, I promised that I'd take you out on a picnic.

369
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:30,780
How happy you were when I told you that we'd see mountains and oceans.

370
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:34,460
It was the first time I saw you hopping with joy.

371
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:38,530
I opened the door to your room on the day of our picnic.

372
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:42,830
Do you know what you said?

373
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:49,030
"Who are you, Mister? Where am I?"

374
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:55,180
Your daughter will grow up like that too.

375
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:58,110
She'll keep forgetting the faces of her mom and dad.

376
00:33:58,110 --> 00:34:01,160
If that happens when she goes out alone,

377
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:06,650
she'll never find her way back home.  Just like you.

378
00:34:08,450 --> 00:34:11,040
It's your choice.

379
00:34:48,850 --> 00:34:52,000
I've never prayed, so I don't know how.

380
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:56,900
I also know nothing will change. But still...

381
00:34:57,830 --> 00:34:59,880
I am praying.

382
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,580
Did you pray?

383
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:24,720
No, I cursed.

384
00:36:12,330 --> 00:36:15,520
Since I was little, they say I lost my memories whenever I used my electricity.

385
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:18,210
That's because my brain cells burnt.

386
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:20,890
But now my weak cells are all burnt,

387
00:36:20,890 --> 00:36:25,490
leaving only the strong. So even with electricity coursing through me, I don't lose my memories.

388
00:36:25,490 --> 00:36:27,080
So?

389
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,800
Our child, too, will grow up like that.

390
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,150
Don't say that.

391
00:36:32,850 --> 00:36:35,090
Does she know who you are?

392
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:39,460
Does she meet your eyes when she hears you?

393
00:36:43,010 --> 00:36:45,610
Her memories are gone.

394
00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:52,930
It's hard enough for me already. Without you adding anything, I'm terrified.

395
00:36:52,930 --> 00:36:56,080
We can fix her.

396
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:59,010
Using electricity, we can burn all the weak cells in her.

397
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:02,230
What, are you serious?

398
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:04,570
If that's the only way, I'd rather not fix her.

399
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:10,270
They're the very people who made you this way. They have no regard for people. How can I trust them with our baby?

400
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:12,210
They've done things to you.

401
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:14,460
So I have to stop them from doing the same things to my daughter.

402
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:18,070
No more talk of that nonsense. Never.

403
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:25,170
Each time she uses her electricity, she won't remember a thing.

404
00:37:25,170 --> 00:37:29,620
No one knows whether it'll be a few times a year, or once in a few years.

405
00:37:31,770 --> 00:37:34,870
She won't recognize us eventually.

406
00:37:36,290 --> 00:37:39,950
Do you know what it's like to live losing your memories?

407
00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:43,180
You're left nothing to reminisce in life.

408
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:45,770
Honestly, I hated you.

409
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:51,240
You've denied all along, but killing my parents,

410
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:54,180
and losing all other memories, you still remembered me out of all people.

411
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:59,850
Because of all that, I hated you a lot. But not anymore.

412
00:37:59,850 --> 00:38:02,850
It's my life, however scary it is.

413
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,660
Ji Oh,

414
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:11,200
You stop right here.

415
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,460
Even if I die, I won't  give them my baby.

416
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:17,700
If you're still taking her, you'll have to kill me first.

417
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:20,910
If not, set us free.

418
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:23,850
I'm going to have to take the baby to a hospital first.

419
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,000
I was always sorry.

420
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:42,600
And I am still.

421
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:09,020
He said hell isn't the shadow of death, but the footsteps he took.

422
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:14,430
Hell isn't anything far away but right on the path you  walk.

423
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:22,180
But the ones with true faith will escape from hell and live forever in this life.

424
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:27,880
All becomes useless when you die. It's the end. You must live and get on the book of names.

425
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:31,340
To go on the book of names, you must prove your faith is true.

426
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:33,000
I believe, Spiritual Leader!

427
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,280
You just need to bring that which is the most precious to you.

428
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:38,270
If you bring me what's more important than your own life,

429
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:42,620
- I'll be happy to open the door to heaven for you. 
 - Amen!

430
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:41,910
You did the right thing.

431
00:40:41,910 --> 00:40:45,800
The blood test is first. Then the recovery rate of her cells

432
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:49,040
and her immunity will be tested. Then next—

433
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,820
I know.

434
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:54,010
Start.

435
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:18,390
You, there. What are you, people?

436
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:23,480
Stop them!

437
00:43:04,530 --> 00:43:06,570
My baby.

438
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:38,610
Aren't you hot dressed like that in this weather?

439
00:43:38,610 --> 00:43:40,800
Hey, what are you, Mister?

440
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:43,730
What the hell—

441
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:10,440
I'm beginning the electricity test. She'll endure it well.

442
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:16,040
Look at her arm. All the injection marks already disappeared.

443
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:19,990
Her ability to recover is better than yours.

444
00:44:20,830 --> 00:44:22,810
Begin.

445
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:40,070
Who knew I'd have a day when I'd look up to you like this?

446
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:47,320
Just accept it. You probably thought it something grand,

447
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:50,250
but all death is empty.

448
00:44:51,070 --> 00:44:53,670
Aren't you curious about Yu Na?

449
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:58,860
Don't you know why Yu Na came to me? It was all because of you.

450
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:04,860
Yu Na only wanted one thing. Your freedom.

451
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:12,930
On the condition that I'd set you free, she promised she'd give me the fertilized eggs.

452
00:45:12,930 --> 00:45:16,170
But that day, Ji Oh came. It was him who killed Yu Na.

453
00:45:16,170 --> 00:45:20,160
- No need for us to be like this. 
- I know.

454
00:45:21,310 --> 00:45:24,150
Don't let Yu Na's death go in vain.

455
00:45:24,150 --> 00:45:29,160
I'll do everything for you. I can give you much more than freedom.

456
00:45:36,950 --> 00:45:42,210
Does someone like you dare to kill me? You lowlife.

457
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:02,610
How come you folks are all the same?

458
00:46:10,010 --> 00:46:13,870
Don't do this. Don't be like this.

459
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:17,100
Save me. Don't do this. Don't!

460
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:21,040
Kill him! Kill them all! All of them!

461
00:46:40,870 --> 00:46:42,820
What was that?

462
00:47:14,620 --> 00:47:17,520
Is the private plane ready? ( In Japanese )

463
00:47:18,150 --> 00:47:21,460
I already turned over the visual data.

464
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:24,170
Even if his cells die,

465
00:47:24,170 --> 00:47:27,270
they'll stay fresh for 24 hours.

466
00:47:27,270 --> 00:47:30,280
Let's just stick with the industry rules.

467
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:32,100
The moment we turn over the corpse,

468
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:34,400
you'll deposite the rest of the money.

469
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:51,180
Director Jeong. Director Jeong, please here.

470
00:47:51,180 --> 00:47:54,060
Send people. Right away!

471
00:47:54,060 --> 00:47:55,940
At once!

472
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:03,560
We're ready.

473
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:05,950
Release 1K.

474
00:48:11,580 --> 00:48:14,820
Wait. Wait a moment.

475
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:18,670
This has to be done at least once anyway.

476
00:48:18,670 --> 00:48:22,950
Later. When she grows a little bigger.

477
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:29,570
You endure your own pain. The child will endure hers.

478
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:36,590
Flip the switch.

479
00:48:45,370 --> 00:48:47,230
Get her out.

480
00:48:47,230 --> 00:48:49,970
If you go back to your room, we'll later—

481
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:57,730
You're not qualified to be a dad.

482
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:01,200
Nor are you a human.

483
00:49:28,730 --> 00:49:30,980
Don't open it!

484
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:50,280
Kill them all.

485
00:50:10,870 --> 00:50:12,670
Let's get out of here.

486
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:20,350
Gu Reum.

487
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:40,910
Get out.

488
00:51:56,980 --> 00:51:58,800
Gu Reum.

489
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:09,830
I'm telling you  I came to rescue you.

490
00:52:09,830 --> 00:52:13,810
I won't get fooled anymore. Get up and turn around.

491
00:52:14,610 --> 00:52:16,590
Come on, Rookie.

492
00:52:32,810 --> 00:52:33,890
Hey!

493
00:52:33,890 --> 00:52:37,880
Get up! Put your hands above your head and turn around.

494
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:41,990
Hey, there's no time for this. We need to leave here quickly.

495
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:48,990
Hey, don't shoot!

496
00:52:48,990 --> 00:52:53,380
So many bad guys are here. You better save your bullets.

497
00:52:53,380 --> 00:52:56,660
-Are you happy?
-Turn around.

498
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:19,740
Hey, shoot everyone that comes our way. No, wait.

499
00:53:19,740 --> 00:53:23,630
-Everyone except me, got it? 
-Shut up and walk.

500
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:50,300
Gu Reum, shoot.  Hurry up and shoot!

501
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:11,200
Team Captain.

502
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:16,200
How's the child?  Looks like she's sleeping away the whole morning.

503
00:55:17,780 --> 00:55:22,800
You brat. I told you I came to save you.

504
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:24,710
Oh boy, what do I do now?

505
00:55:24,710 --> 00:55:27,370
Team Captain, why would you-

506
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:29,750
This isn't it.

507
00:55:31,590 --> 00:55:36,430
Give me the gun and go. I'll do whatever I can to stop them.

508
00:55:36,430 --> 00:55:38,690
No. Come with me.

509
00:55:38,690 --> 00:55:41,230
You must come with me. Get up.

510
00:55:41,230 --> 00:55:43,460
Hurry and get up.

511
00:55:43,460 --> 00:55:46,000
You really don't listen, do you?

512
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:49,300
Quick, get up already.

513
00:56:12,670 --> 00:56:14,910
Gu Reum!

514
00:56:21,550 --> 00:56:24,490
Hold on a bit longer.

515
00:56:24,490 --> 00:56:27,120
Over there, my car.

516
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:30,610
Hold on.

517
00:56:32,020 --> 00:56:34,780
The child.  Give her to me.

518
00:57:21,830 --> 00:57:26,470
Go slowly. You shouldn't speed with a child in the car.

519
00:57:26,470 --> 00:57:30,030
Hang in there a bit longer. We're almost at the hospital, Team Captain.

520
00:57:30,030 --> 00:57:32,280
Stop making too much fuss.

521
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:34,690
If this were back in the day,

522
00:57:34,690 --> 00:57:38,610
we'd just put on an bandage and go to work the next day.

523
00:57:40,190 --> 00:57:43,620
Why did you do all that, when you can't stay bad all the way?

524
00:57:43,620 --> 00:57:46,640
That's what I'm saying.

525
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:52,440
I should've just killed her back then.

526
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:54,950
What are you talking about? Kill whom?

527
00:57:54,950 --> 00:58:03,020
I told you once I chased after this criminal for over ten years.

528
00:58:03,020 --> 00:58:05,290
Anyone can tell

529
00:58:05,290 --> 00:58:11,110
that woman is the criminal, but no one can touch her.

530
00:58:12,730 --> 00:58:18,260
The police wouldn't investigate her, nor would the prosecution indict her.

531
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:21,770
I got so mad.

532
00:58:23,790 --> 00:58:26,490
But I became more and more scared.

533
00:58:28,050 --> 00:58:31,430
Once I knelt before her, though,

534
00:58:31,430 --> 00:58:38,080
the world became an easier place to live. And I was promoted to become a Team Captain.

535
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:41,290
And I got generous  personal funds on the side, too.

536
00:58:48,570 --> 00:58:54,110
I should've killed her then. If I had, I wouldn't be living like this.

537
00:59:04,790 --> 00:59:08,970
Hey, Rookie. Rookie!

538
00:59:08,970 --> 00:59:11,700
Open the arm rest.

539
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:14,030
Later.

540
00:59:14,030 --> 00:59:16,850
Open it now. Now, you brat.

541
00:59:19,140 --> 00:59:24,160
You see a business card, right? It should say Kim Cheol Su.

542
00:59:25,180 --> 00:59:27,260
He's that bastard.

543
00:59:27,260 --> 00:59:29,590
 Kim Cheol Su 

544
00:59:29,590 --> 00:59:31,570
He's what?

545
00:59:34,330 --> 00:59:38,900
He  is  the bastard who killed your mom and dad.

546
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:44,540
Not Ji Oh, but that bastard.

547
00:59:56,770 --> 00:59:58,760
What are you talking about?

548
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:04,680
Framing you for murder was also his doing.

549
01:00:06,740 --> 01:00:09,340
Team Captain, is that all true?

550
01:00:10,530 --> 01:00:12,600
Team Captain.

551
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:16,340
Team Captain!

552
01:00:16,340 --> 01:00:18,450
Team Captain!

553
01:00:19,770 --> 01:00:21,750
Team Captain!!

554
01:00:21,750 --> 01:00:24,260
Team Captain, please open your eyes.

555
01:00:25,180 --> 01:00:28,430
Team Captain, open your eyes!

556
01:00:28,430 --> 01:00:32,840
Team Captain, we're almost at the hospital. Quick, open your eyes.

557
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:36,540
Team Captain, we're at the hospital. Open your eyes!

558
01:01:16,730 --> 01:01:19,350
Team Captain. Team Captain.

559
01:01:19,350 --> 01:01:23,080
Team Captain, wake up!

560
01:01:23,080 --> 01:01:24,820
Come on, wake up.

561
01:01:24,820 --> 01:01:27,530
Come on, open your eyes, Team Captain!

562
01:01:27,530 --> 01:01:29,890
Team Captain!

563
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:37,180
♫  The light shining through the night   ♫

564
01:01:37,180 --> 01:01:40,250
How could you leave like this?

565
01:01:40,250 --> 01:01:43,330
♫  In this life.  ♫

566
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:49,450
♫  Sunk into the sadness that descends endlessly  ♫

567
01:01:49,450 --> 01:01:56,530
  ♫ that descends endlessly, both my eyes closed  ♫

568
01:01:57,800 --> 01:02:02,500
♫  So that I don't disappear.   ♫

569
01:02:02,500 --> 01:02:09,850
♫  Hold my hand so I am not afraid.  ♫

570
01:02:12,050 --> 01:02:17,080
♫  Let me hold you in my arms.  ♫

571
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:25,520
  ♫I hope we can stay together.  ♫

572
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:30,420
♫  We don't have to run away  ♫

573
01:02:30,420 --> 01:02:36,480
♫  as we do now.  ♫

574
01:02:43,790 --> 01:02:47,420
♫  It's time.  ♫

575
01:02:48,750 --> 01:02:53,570
♫  Time to save our souls.  ♫

576
01:03:12,630 --> 01:03:15,060
Was it me you were running away from?

577
01:03:17,420 --> 01:03:19,200
Why?

578
01:03:20,830 --> 01:03:22,880
Why!

579
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:29,620
I just found out you didn't kill my parents.

580
01:03:29,620 --> 01:03:36,600
I'm sorry for suspecting, no, for believing you did.

581
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:42,520
I'm relieved that you didn't. Thanks to that, I have now the strength to go on.

582
01:03:42,520 --> 01:03:47,720
No problem then. Why did you run away?

583
01:03:47,720 --> 01:03:53,360
I'm scared of you. You put our baby on that experiment table.

584
01:03:56,410 --> 01:03:59,720
Do you think I felt at ease doing that?

585
01:03:59,720 --> 01:04:06,000
Gu Reum. Is your pain today more important than the pain our baby will endure later?

586
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:10,980
Do you know the last element that makes a human a true human?

587
01:04:10,980 --> 01:04:13,420
It's love.

588
01:04:13,420 --> 01:04:17,360
You had that in the past, but you don't now.

589
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:21,080
What's the point of loving if you can't protect it?

590
01:04:21,080 --> 01:04:24,550
When the whole world rejects and points its fingers at us, should I just let them?

591
01:04:24,550 --> 01:04:27,420
Is that love?

592
01:04:27,420 --> 01:04:30,460
Should the three of us run away and live in hiding? Is that what you want?

593
01:04:30,460 --> 01:04:33,330
Isn't that what you wanted?

594
01:04:33,330 --> 01:04:37,590
You said the world was like scenery, and that you could take it in from afar.

595
01:04:37,590 --> 01:04:40,140
We weren't a mom and a dad back then.

596
01:04:40,140 --> 01:04:43,270
We're no longer just the two of us now.

597
01:04:54,520 --> 01:04:58,150
I want to go back to the time when I didn't know anything.

598
01:04:58,150 --> 01:05:00,020
Now is that time.

599
01:05:01,840 --> 01:05:04,160
We can live like that.

600
01:05:04,990 --> 01:05:06,820
Okay.

601
01:05:13,950 --> 01:05:17,250
You're not a monster, Ji Oh.

602
01:05:17,250 --> 01:05:20,920
But we made you to be one.

603
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:23,450
- As long as we're gone—
 - No, no.

604
01:05:23,450 --> 01:05:26,860
As long as we're gone, you won't live like a monster.

605
01:05:26,860 --> 01:05:28,660
Don't go.

606
01:05:28,660 --> 01:05:32,550
I'm sorry. And thank you.

607
01:05:32,550 --> 01:05:34,390
I loved you very much.

608
01:05:34,390 --> 01:05:36,790
Don't leave. Don't do this to me.

609
01:05:36,790 --> 01:05:38,430
Please don't do this to me.

610
01:05:38,430 --> 01:05:40,620
Don't go! Don't be like this!

611
01:05:40,620 --> 01:05:41,800
Don't be like this. No!

612
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:43,890
No, I love you, Gu Reum!

613
01:05:43,890 --> 01:05:45,630
No, I love you. Don't go!

614
01:05:45,630 --> 01:05:48,980
No!

615
01:06:02,690 --> 01:06:09,730


616
01:06:23,940 --> 01:06:26,890
 L.U.C.A.: The Beginning  

617
01:06:26,890 --> 01:06:29,260
 I'm asking you. If that is your plan. 

618
01:06:29,260 --> 01:06:31,330
 Consider I am entrusting you with my own life. 

619
01:06:31,330 --> 01:06:34,150
 Please trust me just this once. 

620
01:06:34,150 --> 01:06:36,260
 I can find someone for you. 

621
01:06:36,260 --> 01:06:42,460
 Run away good. If you get caught, your daughter will die a miserable death as an experiment subject. 

622
01:06:42,460 --> 01:06:46,360
 I have no reason to be like the rest. I'm not a perfect human being, to begin with. 

623
01:06:46,360 --> 01:06:47,660
 That's why I liked you. 

624
01:06:47,660 --> 01:06:50,810
 Because you weren't perfect. 

625
01:06:50,810 --> 01:06:55,880
 Now I know for sure. Being human is not a righteous existence..
