 This is a work of fiction. Any resemblance to actual names, places, organizations, religious references, and incidents is entirely coincidental.

13
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,990
 1.  Embezzlement  2. Forging of private documents with respect to the embezzlement: The defendant, using a computer program  

14
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:33,430
 on February 28, 1986, fabricated the accounting records  for the research subsidies for submission  and for personal gain.  

15
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:37,100
 3. Fraud: The  Defendant's research was subsidized  by the Coalition of industry and acadmic foundations. 

16
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,630
Hello?

17
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,370
Hello?

18
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:31,200
You're Ji Oh, right?

19
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,060
 I'm right, aren't I? 

20
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:37,800
Where are you? I'll be right there, so wait.

21
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,800
I don't know. I don't know where I am.

22
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,590
I got it. You're using a payphone, right?

23
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:47,670
I'm going to find your location using this number, so don't go anywhere. Okay?

24
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,720
Answer me!

25
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,400
Don't scream.

26
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,290
Just wait there.

27
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:06,990
 Catch him, no matter what. 

28
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:11,390
 If he gets out of control, many may end up losing their lives. 

29
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:14,730
 If he marries and produces a child, it's anyone's guess what that'll be. 

30
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:18,360
 The boundaries defining what a human is, will break. 

31
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:23,320
 He may seem to be human now, but that can change anytime. 

32
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:26,870
 Depending on which animal inside him wakes, 

33
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:29,380
 he may turn into an entirely different spieces. 

34
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:31,800
 He'll do whatever he can to survive. 

35
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,140
 Don't we as humans do the same for our survival? 

36
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:38,470
 I don't mean in the existential sense, but biologically.  

37
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:41,770
 You do understand me, right? You must catch him. 

38
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:45,500
 Got it? 

39
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,140
 Yes. 

40
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,270
 Okay, 

41
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:53,180
 I'll go back in and send this over to the academia for review.  

42
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:04,830
 Gu Reum, use your gun if you have to. 

43
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:07,700
 You can't let his existence come out in the open. 

44
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:14,310
 Don't you think Ji Oh, too, might have feelings? 

45
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:18,780
 As long as he has the slightest presence of feelings, I don't think he's a monster.  

46
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:22,070
 He is a monster.  And he's a horrible hybrid.  

47
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:25,640
 He'll destroy the ecosystem we  humans have built. 

48
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:29,610
 If you can't catch him, it'd be better to kill him.

00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,180
I'm going to work now.

76
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:20,190
So don't do anything, or go anywhere. Just stay  in here.

77
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:23,050
Fix yourself something if you're hungry.

78
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:25,300
And clean after yourself.

79
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:36,770
Don't look at me that way.

80
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:39,570
I'm not going to sympathize with you, nor am I going to try to understand you.

81
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:42,650
As far as I'm concerned, you're just a murder suspect

82
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:45,600
or a person of interest in a case of missing person.

83
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:50,280
Here's the bathroom and that's my room-

84
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,320
if you go in there, I'll kill you.

85
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:55,240
I'll return by the evening.

86
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:11,290
You should sit down.

87
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:28,850
Did you get into a fight?

88
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:34,440
Did you get beat up?

89
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:41,390
- Those guys again from before?
 - Yeah.

90
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,440
You have a special power.

91
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,740
You can  just use that, can't you?

92
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:52,120
Ordinary humans are no match for you.

93
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:56,530
With a power like yours, couldn't you just destroy the ecosystem built by humans?

94
00:11:56,530 --> 00:11:59,190
I'm human, too. Why would I want to destroy that?

95
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:01,630
Just admit it comfortably.

96
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:04,800
You aren't just a human, after all.

97
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,080
I want to be a human.

98
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:11,660
And what I have isn't a power. It's a curse

99
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:14,020
Hey, fair enough.

100
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:18,690
Because of your power, you may have not known what love is.

101
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,850
You've never experienced love, have you?

102
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:27,710
So you haven't.

103
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:32,950
You really haven't.

104
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:38,480
Clean up after you finish eating.

105
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,740
 Breaking news 

106
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:06,240
 The massive cyber attack yesterday 

107
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,570
 immobilized the banking computer network, and it's yet to be restored. 

108
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:13,580
 Much inconvenience is expected before the openings. 
   

109
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:17,200
 Many businesses were affected yesterday including banks, online shopping malls, 

110
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,860
 and email service providers, totaling thirteen business establishments. 

111
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:24,910
 National Forensic Service is also among those reportedly hacked. 

112
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:27,870
 The Cyber Investigation Unit is now actively investigating the incident. 

113
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:31,710
 The police suspect an involvement of an organized hacking group. 

114
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:35,370
 They didn't rule out the possibility of a cyber attack from North Korea. 

115
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:38,760
- What happened to the data?
 - Sorry,  Professor. You've seen the news, right?

116
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,740
This is no joke. Nothing's working.

117
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:42,840
Excuse me for a moment.

118
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:53,010
 Recovery
Your PC needs to be repaired. The application or operating system couldn't be downloaded. 

119
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:56,980
- Did you lose your data, too? 
- It's worse than that.

120
00:13:56,980 --> 00:14:02,210
The server won't respond at all. I don't think we can save the research data or the paper.

121
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:04,750
- What about the data I sent you?
- Just the same.

122
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,780
Professor, you've backed up the data, right?

123
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:08,750
All of our computers are down, too.

124
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,850
So there is no data at all now?

125
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,390
What if someone intentionally did this targetting  the data?

126
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:17,260
I doubt that when even banks and shopping malls are left in the  disarray as we are.

127
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:19,370
 They said it was a cyber attack from North Korea. 

128
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:23,220
 Anyway, Professor, do you really not have the original data? 

129
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:27,110
I'll call you later.

130
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:53,600
You've finally succeeded in collecting Ji Oh. How are you?

131
00:14:53,600 --> 00:15:00,100
We've destroyed the data in the Academy and agreed with the police to blame North Korea and  its cyber attack for the incident.

132
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:04,570
You've done a good job. Now a new era will be unveiled.

133
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,240
You know, when you launch a rocket,

134
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:20,300
this is the actual part that carries out the mission.

135
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:26,690
To send it off to space, this much energy is used and discarded.

136
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:33,840
The way we humans use energy is inefficient. We use too much of it.

137
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:43,090
I heard the kid emits quite a lot of electricity.

138
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:48,230
We gather he's still evolving.

139
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:51,520
Imagine making children like him continuously.

140
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:55,640
It means you can charge your cell phone by simply holding it.

141
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:59,910
And just by holding the steering wheel, you can make the electric car move.

142
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:02,500
We collect Ji Oh and imagine

143
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:07,480
reproducing one hundred and one just like him. That'll put us on the map.

144
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:10,580
But why one hundred one?

145
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:15,840
One hundred one human clones. Mysterious, don't you think? That'll pique the interest of many.

146
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:19,950
We clone them again. The moment we give birth to 1,010,000 angels

147
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:24,190
the leaders of this world will change, and all wealth and honor will be ours, right?

148
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:26,390
It's the coming of a new era, isn't it?

149
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:28,640
It's an era of glory.

150
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:32,300
It's an era ruled by the children who trust and follow us.

151
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:41,880
Ji Oh was originally destined for that.

152
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:47,460
Ji Oh is our first successful prototype. As such, he was to give away his cells and go extinct for the greater good.

153
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:53,550
L.U.C.A. But he's lived far too long.

154
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:57,870
Now that we have him back, we intend to incinerate him after we're done cloning his cells.

155
00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:01,780
You should. We're almost there.

156
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:06,060
Director, you still have a lot to do until  it is all finished.

157
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:10,030
You're soon going to be the chief of the National Intelligence Service.

158
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:13,050
You need to work harder.

159
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:15,010
Thank you.

160
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:18,510
I'll always stand behind you, Spiritual Leader.

161
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:27,610
Sorry, it's a call from the lab.

162
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:31,650
What is it?

163
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:37,090
What?

164
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:49,690
Get up. Get up! Damn you!

165
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:54,970
- Our vehicle exploded as we were coming back with the collection. 
- Let go.

166
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:59,330
We couldn't help it. He woke up even though we injected him with the sedative.

167
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:05,250
What's with that look?

168
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:12,620
Wake him up. Wake him up!

169
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:14,600
He is in a state now in which he needs absolute rest.

170
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,750
Give him a stimulant or whatever.  Just wake him up!

171
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:21,180
Alright. Give me twenty five millimeters.

172
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:56,820
Why are you moving about already? I told you to stay in bed.

173
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,340
I have a request.

174
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:00,850
Okay, but for now, let's go back to the treatment room. You shouldn't move.

175
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:03,660
Make me strong, too.

176
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:05,530
What do you mean?

177
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:11,550
The injection you put in here. You can also put it in elsewhere, can't you?

178
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:14,750
You can put it in everywhere on me, right?

179
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:18,130
- What's wrong? DId something happen? 
 - Please do it.

180
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:23,190
Nonsense. If there're any side effects, I'd have no choice but to amputate your limbs.

181
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:28,060
You should've amputated my arm back then, instead of making me like this.

182
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:31,130
You should've cut it off altogether then.

183
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:38,590
What's this? I'm neither a human nor a monster.

184
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:42,410
I should be one or the other. Don't you think?

185
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:45,950
So, what do you want to be?

186
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:48,080
What is it that you really want to be?

187
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:52,620
Do you know how many injections of the sedative I gave Ji Oh?

188
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:56,630
With that many, he should've been dead already. Yet he woke up and did this to me.

189
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:02,790
What should I... what should I become in order to beat him?

190
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:05,190
Shouldn't I become at least as powerful as him?

191
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:10,840
Don't be silly. No matter what you do, you can't beat some one born that way.

192
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:18,740
- Please do it. 
 -  No!

193
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:24,170
- What are you doing? Take him away. 
 - Please do it. Do it to me as well.

194
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:28,060
I would like to see this to the end, too.

195
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:34,150
Whether I stay a human or turn into half a monster.

196
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:38,310
 Juan Metropolitan Police Agency 

197
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:41,880
 Be gentle. Please. 

198
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:44,580
Quick. Get in here.

199
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:47,350
Hey, Jun Wuk, come here. I told you not to cause problems.

200
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:51,590
Hey, baldy,  move over a bit more. All of you, form a line.

201
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:56,510
 - Look here. One, two, three. 
 - Stand straight. 

202
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:59,070
 Turn left. 

203
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:01,560
 Quick, quick. Look straight ahead. 

204
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:04,380
 - All of you, face the back. 
 - The back. 

205
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:06,550
 Obviously, you can't stay out of trouble even for a day, can you? 

206
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:11,230
- When are you going to stop doing this?
 - It's really not me.

207
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:13,920
- You guys are going to prison, got it?

208
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:16,910
 - Hey, you. Just tell me the truth.  
 - Damn it! 

209
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:19,070
Come on, tell us.

210
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:21,420
I got it already. Just give me your  name.

211
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:25,580
- I swear. I didn't do it.
 - You said that already. Your name! 

212
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,100
- It's going to hurt. 
 - Let's do it.

213
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:40,030
- Are you sure you won't regret this? 
 - Go ahead and do it.

214
00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:21,300
You're aware of the side effects, right?

215
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:27,820
The dramatic vitalization of cells will cause the  muscles to become stronger and the rate of recovery will increase.

216
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:32,670
That will also speed up the aging of cells and cause premature death.

217
00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:36,540
- Things like that? 
 - You may even not be able to have a child.

218
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:39,430
If you're going to change your mind, tell me now.

219
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:47,520
Whatever I do, it's better when I have someone to hurt with me.

220
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:50,520
Please start.

221
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,230
Team Leader!

222
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:09,400
Don't do it. It hurts.

223
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:16,870
   

224
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:55,460
Change your clothes. Change your underwear as well.

225
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:58,940
Don't even think about washing the clothes you have on now. Throw them away.

226
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,750
- Did you have dinner? 
 - Not yet.

227
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:13,490
How about lunch?

228
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:16,010
Not yet.

229
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:25,470
Unless you can stay alive without eating, just eat.

230
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:58,690
Professor, Ji Oh is here.

231
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:01,890
- Is everything okay? 
 - I'm keeping him with me for now.

232
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:04,190
Keeping him with you? Where?

233
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:06,000
I'm just keeping him with me.

234
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,320
Put him in handcuffs. Don't get any ideas.

235
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:13,070
Just take him to the police station no matter what and lock him up. Got it? 
-Yes.

236
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:16,850
What's with that answer? He's more dangerous than you think.

237
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:20,460
Don't pity him and don't provoke him by talking about finding your parents.

238
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:22,340
No one knows how he'll change.

239
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:23,820
He's not that bad.

240
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:26,130
What do you mean he's not that bad. Just listen to what I say without question.

241
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:31,480
I'll come by the police station tomorrow, so lock him up in the detention cell. You've got a gun on you, right?

242
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,620
Yes.

243
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:36,590
If anything happens, just shoot him. I've got your back.

244
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:45,310
Hold on. I'll call you back.

245
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:51,390
Are you alright?

246
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:56,490
I'm fine. I was just startled. That's all.

247
00:25:56,490 --> 00:26:00,190
Are you really okay? I didn't hit you, did I?

248
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:02,410
I told you. I just fell because I was startled.

249
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:04,640
Drive properly.

250
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:15,830
What a fright.

251
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:54,090
Get the data when I call you.

252
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:55,650
 Employee Identification Records
  Ji Oh  

253
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:06,020
 Who are you? 

254
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:09,320
 Why are you in my house? 

255
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:12,200
 What's your name? 

256
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:19,890
 What's wrong? Don't do that. 

257
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:22,180
 Don't do that. You're scaring me! 

258
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:25,290
 Dad! Dad! 

259
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,810
Didn't I tell you I'd kill you if you came in here?

260
00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:55,420
Beat it.

261
00:28:55,450 --> 00:28:58,600
-It was you. 
-What?

262
00:28:58,610 --> 00:29:03,260
That kid. The one who was scared. It was you.

263
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:11,650
I just remembered. I went to your house.

264
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:31,290
Who are you? What are you doing to me right now?

265
00:29:31,290 --> 00:29:35,670
Where you got Ji Oh's biometrics and whether you still have the original data.

266
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:37,580
You just need to answer these two questions.

267
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:40,080
Who are you to ask that?

268
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:48,050
It's refined ethanol. This equals  drinking one or two bottles of soju.

269
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:51,960
What the hell are you doing? I'm with the NFS (National Forensic Service).

270
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:55,080
Do you really think we won't be able to figure out this much?

271
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:59,500
During the Cold War between the East and the West Germany,

272
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:02,490
this is how they got rid of their venerable academics.

273
00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:06,330
They injected ethanol into them, and placed a few bottles of alcohol in their cars.

274
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:10,800
Then they placed young girls in their passenger's seats.

275
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:14,850
The next morning, the press would report they were dead in their drunken stupor, fooling around with some young girls.

276
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:19,450
That's how you kill a person and their reputation all at once.

277
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:23,930
I'll spare your reputation, so tell me.

278
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:43,400
Gu Reum.

279
00:30:45,530 --> 00:30:48,270
Gu Reum brought him in.

280
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,120
I performed a biopsy on him.

281
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:52,490
That female detective?

282
00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:55,600
- Yes.
- Are they still together?

283
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,860
No, he's gone.

284
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:03,150
He left. More tests need to be done.

285
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:06,660
- What about the original data?
- It's gone.

286
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:11,010
- It's been wiped out.
- Did you print it at all?
- Yes.

287
00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:14,130
- How many copies?
- One.

288
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:17,900
A single copy. I cannot lose that.

289
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:20,350
That's the only one left.

290
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:26,670
Professor Oh's office. One printed file.

291
00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:28,820
I'll go and check it.

292
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:32,970
 NATIONAL FORENSIC SERVICE 

293
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:26,970
I didn't quite know what to do after my parents disappeared.

294
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:29,300
After all, I was just ten at the time.

295
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:33,390
I didn't even know what it meant for someone to go missing.

296
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:40,490
After I became a cop, I started to investigate.

297
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:45,320
But oddly, everyone my dad ever knew

298
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:48,460
disappeared off the face of the earth.

299
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:51,630
Dad's friend, his colleague,

300
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:54,650
his school friend, the one who loaned him money,

301
00:32:54,650 --> 00:32:57,650
and the one who deposited moneny into the account of the one who had loaned him the money.

302
00:32:57,650 --> 00:33:00,500
Where that person worked,

303
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:04,690
and the church my dad's friend attended.

304
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:08,500
All of them died or vanished.

305
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:11,580
I've never searched someone so desperately as you do.

306
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:14,610
During my ten years in the police force,

307
00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:20,990
I've never failed finding someone after putting in this much work.

308
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:25,340
I came to a dead end.

309
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:30,650
That was when you showed up.

310
00:33:30,650 --> 00:33:33,390
The only thing I remember is you.

311
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:37,570
I don't know why I was at your house.

312
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:47,870
This man is the key to finding your memories.

313
00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:49,890
Ryu Jung Kwon?

314
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,050
What does he have to do with me?

315
00:33:53,050 --> 00:33:58,460
I'm not exactly sure, but I'm told he knows everything about you.

316
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:03,860
You're hoping I'm the one who killed your parents, aren't you?

317
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:06,840
Because if I'm the culprit, then it's all over.

318
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:10,320
If I'm not, that means you've got to keep looking.

319
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:15,220
You're right.

320
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:21,340
If you're the bad guy, this will all come to an end.

321
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:24,120
Having been a detective for so long,

322
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:27,480
whether someone is good or bad,

323
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:30,160
I can tell with just one look at their eyes.

324
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,790
With you, I'm not so sure.

325
00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:42,190
I hope I was the one who killed your parents.

326
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:45,620
Catching me, you'll end up feeling relieved.

327
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:49,430
You will be able to live without struggling anymore.

328
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:54,300
I don't intend to arrest you if you're the murderer.

329
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:57,620
I'll kill you instead.

330
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:02,050
You haven't loved anyone either, have you?

331
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:05,810
Are you putting me down?

332
00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:09,500
Plan well ahead if you want to make it a perfect crime.

333
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:12,740
That way, you won't be branded as a killer for killing a thing like me.

334
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:21,530
 Juan Metropolitan Police Agency 

335
00:35:21,530 --> 00:35:26,640
 Your call cannot be connected, and it will be directed to  voice mail.  

336
00:35:35,350 --> 00:35:38,210
 You aren't answering your phone all day long. 

337
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:41,580
 Don't come to the station. I'll let you know where we should meet. 

338
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:45,620
Gu Reum.

339
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:59,490
What is it this time? Are you going to pick on me again?

340
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:02,480
I'm working so hard and being good.

341
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:14,290
I swear I didn't put my cell phone in my microwave oven.

342
00:36:14,290 --> 00:36:16,440
-Did you get the news yet?
-What news?

343
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,350
You haven't heard it yet?

344
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:23,390
What? What's happened?

345
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:26,610
Let's go. We can talk on the way there.

346
00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:46,570
Hey, Gu Reum, Gu Reum!

347
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:51,230
Gu Reum!

348
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:00,590
Hey, Gu Reum!

349
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:03,480
Wait! Wait a moment!

350
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:10,260
Calm youself. This is time  to be prudent.

351
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:11,050
Give me a moment.

352
00:37:11,050 --> 00:37:14,360
 - We have to do an autopsy— 
 - I said give me a moment.

353
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:55,200
 NFS (National Forensic Service) 

354
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:25,850
I hear Gu Reum was very close to Professor Oh.

355
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:29,090
Yeah.

356
00:38:29,090 --> 00:38:31,680
And Professor Oh adored her.

357
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,660
He did.

358
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:40,630
♫  Do I  ♫

359
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:48,220

363
00:41:16,290 --> 00:41:19,590

366
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:40,560
I said let go. 
 ♫  To our own shelter  ♫

367
00:41:49,230 --> 00:41:54,430
I had a man who I wished were my father.

368
00:41:57,300 --> 00:42:00,290
I'm just back from his funeral service.

369
00:42:00,290 --> 00:42:03,670
I've lived alone for a very long time.

370
00:42:04,850 --> 00:42:08,340
And now I'm really alone.

371
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:11,180
I have no one.

372
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:13,350
I'm perfectly alone.

373
00:42:13,350 --> 00:42:15,700
♫  lonely heart  ♫

374
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:17,740
Being alone is convenient.

375
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:21,270
You're the one who had a devastated expression because you were alone.

376
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:22,940
♫  To our own shelter  ♫

377
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:25,450
There isn't much to life.

378
00:42:25,450 --> 00:42:28,770
It's about watching others die while I still live on.

379
00:42:28,770 --> 00:42:30,470
And when you're alone, you don't even have to do that.

380
00:42:30,470 --> 00:42:33,900
♫  I'm sorry.  ♫

381
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:38,120
Good for you since you're fine being alone.

382

♫  I swear.  ♫

383
00:42:41,730 --> 00:42:45,040
♫  I will be with you  ♫

384
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:04,310
 Don't run away. 

385
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:09,070
 Don't leave until I tell you to. 

386
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:13,550
Don't leave me until the end.

387
00:44:57,340 --> 00:45:01,220
I won't leave you till the end.

388
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:10,490
You can't.

389
00:45:10,490 --> 00:45:11,730
Why not?

390
00:45:11,730 --> 00:45:14,000
What's the point of a search warrant when the case is closed?

391
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,330
You know well the professor didn't drink.

392
00:45:16,330 --> 00:45:18,740
He probably got himself killed because he drank so much when he wasn't used to it.

393
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:21,980
Why would he drink that much inside his vehicle of all places?

394
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:25,180
This wasn't a simple case of driving under the influence.

395
00:45:26,230 --> 00:45:27,680
There's no evidence of him being murdered.

396
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:28,910
Look at the circumstance.

397
00:45:28,910 --> 00:45:29,930
Not the circumstance, but evidence.

398
00:45:29,930 --> 00:45:33,040
But there's such a thing as circumstantial evidence.

399
00:45:35,110 --> 00:45:36,810
Haven't you seen the results of his autopsy?

400
00:45:36,810 --> 00:45:40,780
Nothing came out of his lung, meaning he wasn't forced to drink.

401
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:42,930
He drank on his own.

402
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:46,440
He was talking with me on the phone.

403
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:49,210
He said he'd call me right back, and he ended up like that.

404
00:45:49,210 --> 00:45:52,410
If it were a mere accident, why was his dashboard cam turned off?

405
00:45:52,410 --> 00:45:54,320
I didn't turn it off, did I?

406
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:59,450
Let me just look into his phone and email records.

407
00:45:59,450 --> 00:46:01,960
Prosecution has jurisdiction and they closed the case.

408
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:07,210
Prosecution closed the case. Do you think it'll open again just because we ask for it?

409
00:46:07,210 --> 00:46:11,440
The work of the police is to be suspicious and confirm that suspicion. That's what I learned.

410
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:14,790
Are you really a police officer if you just take your hands off because the case is closed?

411
00:46:14,790 --> 00:46:16,710
Of course you are.

412
00:46:22,650 --> 00:46:24,910
Aren't you embarrassed?

413
00:46:24,910 --> 00:46:27,670
I may be embarrassed. But rules are rules.

414
00:46:27,670 --> 00:46:31,410
What will you do if I get evidence?

415
00:46:31,410 --> 00:46:34,550
Will you bury it  because the case is closed?

416
00:46:34,550 --> 00:46:35,750
Do you have evidence?

417
00:46:35,750 --> 00:46:37,010
Not yet.

418
00:46:37,010 --> 00:46:39,550
Then get the evidence before talking to me about this.

419
00:46:39,550 --> 00:46:44,310
Hence, I need you to get me a search warrant.

420
00:46:44,310 --> 00:46:46,950
Okay, I got it.

421
00:46:46,950 --> 00:46:49,560
I'll get you one. Hold on a sec.

422
00:46:50,510 --> 00:46:52,510
Where did I put it?

423
00:46:54,870 --> 00:46:57,300
Here, shoot me with this.

424
00:46:57,300 --> 00:46:59,310
- Come on, Team Captain. 
 - Shoot me.

425
00:46:59,310 --> 00:47:01,840
After that, do whatever you want to.

426
00:47:06,290 --> 00:47:07,170
It has no bullets.

427
00:47:07,170 --> 00:47:08,980
- Do you want bullets? 
 - Yes.

428
00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:11,950
- What, are you going to shoot me? 
 - You told me to.

429
00:47:13,450 --> 00:47:16,120
Will you really keep this up?

430
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:17,550
I'm going to investigate.

431
00:47:17,550 --> 00:47:21,180
Okay. Go ahead. Do what you like.

432
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:25,060
Investigate all you want. But if you do, you're no longer on my team.

433
00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:28,800
You make all of us look awful, running around as if you're the only one with brains. I can't have you on my team.

434
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:31,380
What about your colleagues who've been on the team way longer than you have?

435
00:47:32,470 --> 00:47:36,480
They're just a bunch of imbeciles to you. Am I wrong?

436
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:41,380
If you want to work the way you do, then go to Felony and Homicide.

437
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:43,650
I'm ready to ship you off there anytime you're ready.

438
00:47:59,610 --> 00:48:02,270
What a temper he has, really.

439
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:07,350
Are you alright?

440
00:48:08,290 --> 00:48:09,970
Sorry.

441
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:13,500
You can't just barge in and demand a search warrant.

442
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:18,430
You have to come up with a believable scenario and corner him.

443
00:48:18,430 --> 00:48:20,510
Then I'll do that.

444
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:28,280
Getting an instant search warrant isn't easy. Start questioning the people around Professor Oh. You're good at digging dirt.

445
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:32,510
I'm sorry that I can't help you.

446
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:51,850
The female detective is heading to NFS (National Foresic Service).

447
00:48:51,850 --> 00:48:56,020
We'll get her on her way back, so you decide precisely where on the highway.

448
00:48:56,020 --> 00:48:58,900
No, there wasn't anything unusual.

449
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:03,470
Nothing at all? For instance, someone might've called him.

450
00:49:03,470 --> 00:49:05,400
No, no one.

451
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:09,170
All of us were very much preoccupied that day.

452
00:49:09,170 --> 00:49:14,280
None of our computers worked because of the hacking incident. And we were getting bombarded with calls from everywhere.

453
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:17,930
The technicians in the network room were running in and out like crazy.

454
00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:21,920
Oh, right.

455
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:26,740
It appeared Professor Oh turned over some data to the Academy.

456
00:49:26,740 --> 00:49:29,490
He talked on the phone many times over that.

457
00:49:29,490 --> 00:49:32,360
Can I know whom in the Academy he talked to?

458
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:36,850
Not sure. But knowing whom won't be of much use.

459
00:49:36,850 --> 00:49:42,410
Much of the conversation was about the computers in the Academy getting hacked and the loss of the data.

460
00:49:43,850 --> 00:49:47,210
Maybe he might have gotten drunk because of that?

461
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:55,690
Did you ever drink with Professor Oh?

462
00:49:55,690 --> 00:50:00,160
No, not even once.

463
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:04,820
Even a single glass would make his face all red. He wasn't into drinking at all.

464
00:50:04,820 --> 00:50:06,550
Right.

465
00:50:06,550 --> 00:50:10,590
- Did you bring that for the late Professor?
 - Yes.

466
00:50:10,590 --> 00:50:12,240
Shall we go in then?

467
00:50:53,230 --> 00:50:55,610
Just leave it as is.

468
00:50:55,610 --> 00:50:58,450
General Administration will clean up his desk in a few days.

469
00:50:58,450 --> 00:51:01,440
Please allow me to clean a little before I leave.

470
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:23,690
There's the contact point, right in front of us.

471
00:52:23,690 --> 00:52:26,160
Kill her engine.

472
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:28,390
I'm turning it off.

473
00:52:31,570 --> 00:52:33,670
 STOP 

474
00:52:51,170 --> 00:52:54,910
 Put your foot on the brake. Then try the ignition. 

475
00:53:10,180 --> 00:53:12,220
 OPEN 

476
00:53:23,090 --> 00:53:27,280
 Breaking news. Around 1 o'clock this afternoon, on Freeway 13 in Juan City, 

477
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:33,590
 an on-duty detective working for Criminal Investigation was abducted by unknown assailants. 

478
00:53:33,590 --> 00:53:38,480
 This is the first incident in which an on-duty detective is abducted in a broad day light. 

479
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:41,360
 The detective kidnapped is Lieutenant Ha. 

480
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:45,610
 She's a female detective who's known to have solved dozens of criminal cases.  

481
00:53:45,610 --> 00:53:48,330
 According to a police insider, Detective Ha  

482
00:53:48,330 --> 00:53:50,540
 was on her way back to the police station from NFS. 
   

483
00:53:50,540 --> 00:53:54,900
 Her vehicle disappeared, and a single knife was found on the scene. 

484
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,730
 Given that her disappearance occurred on a stretch of the highway with minimal traffic, 

485
00:53:58,730 --> 00:54:04,280
 the culprits are thought to have known in advance her return route and lay in wait. 

486
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:10,430
 Judging from the meticulousness of the crime and its  circumstance, the police— 

487
00:54:10,430 --> 00:54:12,170
 Hey, Ji Oh. 

488
00:54:13,660 --> 00:54:16,060
Did you come here alone?

489
00:54:16,060 --> 00:54:18,130
Why? Are you going to sell me off again?

490
00:54:18,130 --> 00:54:21,090
Hey, you really have that wrong.

491
00:54:21,090 --> 00:54:23,670
I didn't sell you off. I was forced to give you away.

492
00:54:23,670 --> 00:54:29,950
I didn't get even a dime. Do you see the state of my place? They didn't even give me the money to fix the broken windows.

493
00:54:30,710 --> 00:54:32,020
Where's your phone?

494
00:54:32,020 --> 00:54:33,990
Come on, Ji Oh.

495
00:54:39,950 --> 00:54:42,250
Make the call.

496
00:54:42,250 --> 00:54:43,290
What are you doing?

497
00:54:43,290 --> 00:54:46,290
- Make the call. 
- What are you talking about?

498
00:54:46,290 --> 00:54:47,610
Sell me off.

499
00:54:47,610 --> 00:54:49,210
- I told you that wasn't my intention. 
 - Go ahead. Sell me off.

500
00:54:49,210 --> 00:54:51,340
What do you mean, selling you off?

501
00:54:51,340 --> 00:54:56,340
I'm telling you I didn't get a dime from them. Why are you doing this to me?

502
00:54:56,340 --> 00:54:59,310
I'm not going to run away anymore.

503
00:54:59,310 --> 00:55:01,230
Make the call.

504
00:55:16,180 --> 00:55:17,170
Speak.

505
00:55:17,170 --> 00:55:18,860
It's me.

506
00:55:18,860 --> 00:55:22,780
Well, he's with me now.

507
00:55:22,780 --> 00:55:25,410
He's telling me to sell him off to you.

508
00:55:25,410 --> 00:55:27,170
Is that you?

509
00:55:28,130 --> 00:55:28,990
It's you, indeed.

510
00:55:28,990 --> 00:55:30,920
 Why did you do it? 

511
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:35,250
This is only the beginning. If you don't show up,  I'm going to kill everyone you know.

512
00:55:35,250 --> 00:55:38,800
 I intend to search and kill even those who have merely talked with you.  

513
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:41,780
- Where is the woman? 
 - Here, right in front of me.

514
00:55:41,780 --> 00:55:43,680
 I'll give you the address. Come where I am. 

515
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:46,520
- No, I won't.
 - Even if that means her death?

516
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:49,740
Come if you want to catch me. Two hours later at LC Plaza.

517
00:55:49,740 --> 00:55:53,290
She dies if you don't cooperate.

518
00:55:53,290 --> 00:55:56,640
Kill her after you kill me. Bring her with you.

519
00:56:02,730 --> 00:56:06,310
Apparently he likes you. He is quite antsy.

520
00:56:06,310 --> 00:56:08,410
It was you-

521
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:11,930
You killed him, didn't you?

522
00:56:11,930 --> 00:56:14,520
Killed whom? I've killed quite a few.

523
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:18,600
Professor Oh. It was your doing, right?

524
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:21,880
You gave him Ji Oh's biometrics. He died because of you.

525
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:24,820
He wouldn't have  been killed if you had stayed quiet.

526
00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:27,950
Untie me right at this minute. Or else, I'll kill you.

527
00:56:27,950 --> 00:56:31,740
You'll be dead soon. Don't struggle so much.

528
00:56:33,530 --> 00:56:35,170
I'm going to have to borrow your phone.

529
00:56:35,170 --> 00:56:38,360
No, you can't. I'm contractually bound for another year.

530
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:41,990
Plus I have no insurance if I lose it. You can't take—

531
00:56:41,990 --> 00:56:45,330
Okay. Go.

532
00:56:45,330 --> 00:56:47,430
Just go.

533
00:56:47,430 --> 00:56:51,340
I don't care where and how you live.

534
00:56:51,340 --> 00:56:54,970
But make sure you cut ties with me, alright?

535
00:56:54,970 --> 00:57:00,330
Don't ever come back looking for me. Even if we run into each other, pretend you don't know me.

536
00:57:00,330 --> 00:57:04,130
Don't look at me with that expression.

537
00:57:04,130 --> 00:57:06,440
In spite of everything, I—

538
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:09,820
I was on your side.

539
00:57:09,820 --> 00:57:14,260
I lied for you even when you set the church on fire.

540
00:57:14,260 --> 00:57:19,340
No matter how scared I was, I opened my door to you when you came.

541
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:23,190
I did that much as your friend.

542
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:27,710
- Are you sure we're friends? 
 - Damn it, yes, we are.

543
00:57:27,710 --> 00:57:30,440
Are we  really  friends?

544
00:57:32,670 --> 00:57:38,850
In any case, apart from each other, you and I have no friends. So, why not be friendly?

545
00:57:39,670 --> 00:57:42,470
I'll come back if I need to.

546
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:47,380
I'm telling you not to.

547
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:52,440
As you know, I remember very little.

548
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:55,070
Starting today, I'll keep only the good memories of you.

549
00:57:55,070 --> 00:57:58,750
What are you saying out of the blue? It's not like you're asking me to date you.

550
00:57:58,750 --> 00:58:00,760
Thanks.

551
00:58:03,380 --> 00:58:05,260
I'm borrowing your car, too.

552
00:58:05,260 --> 00:58:07,450
Hey, no. No. No.

553
00:58:07,450 --> 00:58:10,150
Hey, I haven't finished my payment on it yet.

554
00:58:10,150 --> 00:58:12,900
Hey, hey!

555
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:22,410
♫  I'm searching for something that's beautiful.  ♫

556
00:58:22,410 --> 00:58:27,470
♫  The scent takes me there. I'll never fall. I'll never stop.  ♫

557
00:58:27,470 --> 00:58:32,030
♫  Because I'm gonna take everything I've got, just.  ♫

558
00:58:32,030 --> 00:58:36,680
♫  Follow the noise, follow the whispered breeze.  ♫

559
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:41,210
♫  Gotta keep the search, but I'm so exhausted.  ♫

560
00:58:41,210 --> 00:58:45,710
♫  Never give in, never give up. No.  ♫

561
00:58:45,710 --> 00:58:50,260
♫  Nothing can be fixed , nothing can be sured,  ♫

562
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:54,900
♫  till I'm there, till I'm there.  ♫

563
00:58:54,900 --> 00:59:02,650
♫  Look at me, voice to me, find tree.  ♫

564
00:59:02,650 --> 00:59:04,010
 LC Plaza 

565
00:59:04,010 --> 00:59:11,890
♫  Please let me sleep on it, so I can breathe in.  ♫

566
00:59:28,830 --> 00:59:31,740
 A-01 

567
00:59:32,850 --> 00:59:34,500
- Are you here?
 - The woman?

568
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:37,890
- Come see her yourself if you're curious. 
 - I need to confirm first that it's her.

569
00:59:37,890 --> 00:59:39,790
Call me.

570
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:02,140
I can't see your face.

571
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:03,550
Confirm.

572
01:00:03,550 --> 01:00:05,870
Say hi for the last time.

573
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:18,140
We should meet now.

574
01:00:18,140 --> 01:00:20,710
Come to the first floor. I'm in front of Elevator 3.

575
01:00:20,710 --> 01:00:23,840
She dies if you do something stupid.

576
01:00:25,750 --> 01:00:28,520
Elevator 3 on the first floor. 
 Entrance to the shopping mall 

577
01:00:28,520 --> 01:00:31,480
If anything happens, just kill her.

578
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:16,500
You son of bitch. Damn it.

579
01:02:50,410 --> 01:02:52,090
Are you okay?

580
01:02:52,090 --> 01:02:53,880
I have to get that bastard.

581
01:02:53,880 --> 01:02:56,260
They killed Professor Oh.

582
01:02:56,260 --> 01:02:58,090
Gu Reum.

583
01:02:59,060 --> 01:03:01,630
Who said it's okay for you to call me by my name?

584
01:03:01,630 --> 01:03:03,680
Listen carefully.

585
01:03:05,110 --> 01:03:10,000
I'll come to you if I'm still alive.

586
01:03:11,110 --> 01:03:12,350
What are you saying?

587
01:03:12,350 --> 01:03:14,620
I'll stay alive and come look for you.

588
01:03:14,620 --> 01:03:18,700
Even if I don't remember you, I'll come to you. But today, you've got to run.

589
01:03:18,700 --> 01:03:20,580
- What about you? 
 - I'm going to fight.

590
01:03:20,580 --> 01:03:23,750
No, you can't. I'm the one who fights. You—

591
01:03:23,750 --> 01:03:28,380
Later.  You have to stay alive if you want to know whether I killed your parents or not.

592
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:33,870
If I'm the murderer, you can kill me only if you're alive. So live!

593
01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:38,700
You can't do this alone.  It's dangerous.

594
01:03:46,600 --> 01:03:48,520
I'll get going.

595
01:03:58,980 --> 01:04:01,340
Don't you smell flesh burning?

596
01:04:01,340 --> 01:04:03,520
We're missing Tae Ho.

597
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:22,840
Track his cell phone.

598
01:04:24,540 --> 01:04:26,650
I'm getting the signal.

599
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:48,650
His phone is turned off.

600
01:04:48,650 --> 01:04:51,690
- The location? 
 - I have it.

601
01:05:06,230 --> 01:05:08,290
Who the hell are you guys?

602
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:17,280
Can you guess what was the hardest training I did?

603
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:19,440
It was the training to survive captivity.

604
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:24,070
What I was to do when I was captured by my enemies.

605
01:05:24,070 --> 01:05:28,250
Some of my peers died during the training.

606
01:05:28,250 --> 01:05:31,720
I'm going to ask you  for the last time. Who the hell are you guys?

607
01:05:36,820 --> 01:05:39,470
You aren't going to get one word out of me.

608
01:05:39,470 --> 01:05:45,920
The only thing you can do is probably to beat me.

609
01:05:46,620 --> 01:05:49,500
The more you hit me the more anxious you'll get.

610
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:57,650
Why? Because I'm not telling you anything.

611
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:17,450
In the end, you'll kill me.

612
01:06:17,450 --> 01:06:20,320
Then you will get scared and run away.

613
01:06:27,500 --> 01:06:29,990
Try me. Begin!

614
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:03,620
Team Leader!

615
01:08:13,170 --> 01:08:15,380
Team Leader.

616
01:08:15,380 --> 01:08:19,560
He still has breath but his arm...

617
01:09:04,420 --> 01:09:07,880
Yes, Haneul Ae Gu Reum. She's on my team.

618
01:09:07,880 --> 01:09:09,980
Understood.

619
01:09:11,060 --> 01:09:12,980
I said I understood.

620
01:09:13,010 --> 01:09:18,390
By 'understood,' I mean I'll look into the matter and get back to you.

621
01:09:20,390 --> 01:09:23,560
My plate is already full with her case alone. How can you expect me to be so quick looking into the matter?

622
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:25,760
Don't you watch the news?

623
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:28,680
The detective who was abducted is her.

624
01:09:35,350 --> 01:09:37,370
Hey, Gu Reum!

625
01:09:39,760 --> 01:09:42,690
Gu Reum, what happened?

626
01:09:42,690 --> 01:09:45,190
Are you alright? Did you get hurt anywhere?

627
01:09:45,190 --> 01:09:47,110
Did you escape? How did you get away?

628
01:09:47,110 --> 01:09:50,180
Team Captain, we need to send her to a hospital first.

629
01:09:50,180 --> 01:09:51,570
Be quiet.

630
01:09:51,570 --> 01:09:55,350
- Send her to a hospital and get her treated. Then investigate—
- I said be quiet!

631
01:10:04,160 --> 01:10:05,590
Is it correct you were kidnapped?

632
01:10:05,590 --> 01:10:08,590
I escaped out of a trunk.

633
01:10:08,590 --> 01:10:14,720
Most likely, they were the guys in that unregistered vehicle. I asked you to track their license plate a few days ago.

634
01:10:14,720 --> 01:10:16,430
Is that so?

635
01:10:19,820 --> 01:10:23,220
You follow me. You, Yu Cheol, follow me, too.

636
01:10:23,220 --> 01:10:24,960
Pardon?

637
01:10:28,290 --> 01:10:30,180
Team Captain!

638
01:12:10,130 --> 01:12:14,280
You used your head, but not quite skillfully.

639
01:12:14,280 --> 01:12:18,970
After all, our speciality is leading and tailing people.

640
01:12:27,770 --> 01:12:32,440
Since we've come this far, we should see the end of each other.

641
01:12:32,440 --> 01:12:34,890
If you can beat me,

642
01:12:34,890 --> 01:12:38,240
 Exit  

643
01:12:38,240 --> 01:12:40,740
then you can come in here.

644
01:12:42,290 --> 01:12:49,310


645
01:12:51,950 --> 01:12:55,840
In here is everything that tells you who you are.

646
01:13:00,010 --> 01:13:09,070
♫  Look at me, voice to me, find tree.  ♫

647
01:13:09,070 --> 01:13:17,740
♫  Please let me sleep on it, so I can breathe in.  ♫

648
01:13:17,740 --> 01:13:22,410
♫  I'm searching for something that's beautiful.  ♫

649
01:13:22,410 --> 01:13:24,390
 L.U.C.A.: The Beginning   
 ♫  The scent takes me there.  ♫

650
01:13:24,390 --> 01:13:27,100
♫  I'll never fall. I'll never stop.  ♫

651
01:13:27,100 --> 01:13:28,880
 Where is Ji Oh? Where are you hiding him? 

652
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:32,280
 Without letting anyone know, make several copies of his somatic cells. 

653
01:13:32,280 --> 01:13:36,520
 Exterminate all the other researchers. We don't want people to know they're made by scientists. 

654
01:13:36,520 --> 01:13:37,780
 What's all this? 

655
01:13:37,780 --> 01:13:41,630
 She shouldn't have joined my team in the first place. 

656
01:13:41,630 --> 01:13:42,910
 Who are you? 

657
01:13:42,910 --> 01:13:47,210
 I feel that not only they're professionals but have an organization behind them. 

658
01:13:47,210 --> 01:13:50,690
 If you must be killed, I'll be the one who kills you. 

659
01:13:50,690 --> 01:13:54,950
 Ji Oh, where are you? 

660
01:13:54,950 --> 01:13:59,310
♫  Look at me, voice to me.  ♫
