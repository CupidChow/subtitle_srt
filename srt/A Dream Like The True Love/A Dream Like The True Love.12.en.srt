1
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,080
What are you doing?

2
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,560
I want to write a letter
to my parents in prison to let them

3
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:32,600
know I'm safe.

4
00:00:33,139 --> 00:00:36,448
(Father, Mother, hope you're okay.)

5
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,720
I suppose they won't
be able to see your letter.

6
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:45,840
What do you mean?

7
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,080
The prison reported

8
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,640
Registrar Wen has typhoid fever.

9
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,840
Mrs. Wen is also in critical condition.

10
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,800
I beg you to save them.

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,400
I can save them.

12
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,480
However,

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,480
I want you to accompany me
to the capital.

14
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,880
I know you possess great talent.

15
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,960
Keeping you by my side is not

16
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,200
to bury your talents.

17
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:23,240
Your Highness,

18
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:24,760
when should we depart?

19
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,520
We depart today.

20
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,400
Wen Su.

21
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,960
Your opportunity is coming.

22
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,440
Remember to make a clean break.

23
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,280
I did remind you.

24
00:01:54,752 --> 00:01:58,432
=A Dream Like The True Love=

25
00:01:58,432 --> 00:02:01,024
=Episode 12=

26
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:12,600
Baoyin.

27
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,120
Why are you giggling?

28
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:15,960
Luo.

29
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:16,720
You...

30
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,600
Why are you here?

31
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:19,640
Check out

32
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:20,880
my latest tea treat.

33
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,720
Qixi Festival is approaching.

34
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,560
The restaurant needs
to have something new.

35
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:25,920
Any suggestions?

36
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:26,960
Alright.

37
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,600
Not bad, not too sweet.

38
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,360
Well...

39
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,040
On the day of the festival,

40
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,760
why don't you close the shop?

41
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,360
I'll take you and Baozhu

42
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,640
to the night market by the Bian River.

43
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,800
Unfortunately,

44
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,200
I'm meeting someone.

45
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,240
Meeting someone?

46
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,760
Who is he?

47
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:57,960
Do I know him?

48
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,280
Baoyin.

49
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,320
Baoyin.

50
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,120
It's bad.

51
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,040
Father...

52
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,840
Father has typhoid fever.

53
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,560
Sir, please be kind.

54
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,000
My family is gravely ill.

55
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,240
Let me take a look.

56
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:17,840
Just one look.

57
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,320
No way.

58
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,240
Take it back.

59
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,600
I'm begging you.

60
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,680
I said no way.

61
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,120
Not for any price.

62
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,640
It's Eldest Princess's order.

63
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,960
Who'll take the fall?

64
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,680
Baoyin, what should we do?

65
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,720
Madam He said

66
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,440
severe typhoid fever can be deadly.

67
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,200
Don't worry.

68
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,680
This matter is fishy.

69
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:40,960
I'll ask Su.

70
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,080
He will have a way.

71
00:03:47,168 --> 00:03:49,984
(Princess's Mansion)

72
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,880
Will Eldest Princess
return from the capital?

73
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,440
That is hard to say.

74
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,520
There will be a change in Daqing.

75
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,120
Stop it.

76
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:25,760
Mr. Wen Junior,

77
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,040
Master is seriously ill in prison.

78
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,880
I naturally know.

79
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,720
Why did you chase after me?

80
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:32,880
I...

81
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,360
I'm here to discuss with you.

82
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,680
Don't interfere in matters

83
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,960
of my family anymore in the future.

84
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,200
What do you mean?

85
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,360
You know I'm willing to take care

86
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,680
of your family.

87
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,600
Why are you deliberately
saying this now?

88
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,800
There will be someone
to look after my parents.

89
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,360
You needn't worry much.

90
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,080
About the previous things,

91
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,680
it was me who overstepped first.

92
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,480
If it caused a misunderstanding,

93
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,920
I sincerely apologize.

94
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,840
Did the Eldest Princess
threaten you again?

95
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,960
What exactly happened?

96
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,280
This is my own decision.

97
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,720
It's not about her.

98
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,000
I have decided to go to the capital.

99
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,720
In the future, we may never
see each other again.

100
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,760
We might as well part ways here.

101
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,360
I must make proper plans

102
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,640
for myself and my parents, right?

103
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,920
If you pursue your future,
I will not stop you.

104
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,280
But is this the future

105
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,320
you envision for yourself?

106
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,160
I don't know
what Eldest Princess promised you.

107
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,200
But sages said when virtue falls

108
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,760
short of position, disaster follows.

109
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,520
Have you forgotten it?

110
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,800
Everyone has their fate,
no need for you to worry.

111
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,440
I will succeed.

112
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,840
I advise you to think it through.

113
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,280
Certain things are beyond our control.

114
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,800
Baoyin.

115
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,720
Matters about the court
are beyond your understanding.

116
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,040
The most important thing
in this world is power.

117
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,640
What if I don't match my role?

118
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,920
Only the powerless perish.

119
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,000
Live your own life well.

120
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,280
Just pretend I never appeared.

121
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,000
You are not a gentleman

122
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,880
with integrity and virtue

123
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:24,840
at all.

124
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:25,680
It's ridiculous.

125
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,640
Go find your Eldest Princess.

126
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,080
From today onwards,

127
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,000
just assume the one
I used to be is dead.

128
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,760
If you leave, never return.

129
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,400
Never!

130
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,720
(The most important thing
in this world is power.)

131
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,960
(Only the powerless perish.)

132
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,360
Someone has fallen into the water!

133
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,240
You are awake.

134
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,120
Are you uncomfortable?

135
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,760
I'll get a doctor.

136
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,520
I thought you would leave

137
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,720
and never come back.

138
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:18,760
I'm not leaving.

139
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,800
I'm not going anywhere.

140
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,960
I'll stay here with you.

141
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,600
Don't cry.

142
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,880
Mr. Wen Junior.

143
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,440
Why did you want to leave suddenly?

144
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,080
Why did you break your promise?

145
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,360
Why did you
say such heartless words to me?

146
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,120
I understand you have your difficulties.

147
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,280
But we agreed before

148
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,080
that no matter what happens,
we will face it together.

149
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,600
Have you forgotten?

150
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,800
I'm sorry.

151
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,960
It's my fault for making you sad.

152
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,112
Baoyin.

153
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,320
If you regret it,

154
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,280
I can let you go back now.

155
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,480
I dare not.

156
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,080
You haven't forgotten

157
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,200
I am still controlling
your parents' lives.

158
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,600
If not for this,

159
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,680
I'm afraid you wouldn't follow me.

160
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,600
You are overthinking.

161
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,040
Your Highness, since I followed you,

162
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,040
there has been no way back.

163
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,240
I will let you know

164
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,040
you will not regret

165
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,320
following me.

166
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,240
Your Highness, you want to...

167
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,640
I'll take back everything
that should belong to me.
