1
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:30,480
Do you think your sweetheart

2
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,440
will still like you after what happened?

3
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,200
You're ruined.

4
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:42,960
Except me,

5
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,000
no other woman will accept you.

6
00:00:56,864 --> 00:01:00,544
=A Dream Like The True Love=

7
00:01:00,544 --> 00:01:03,136
=Episode 8=

8
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,040
(The lord let the thing go.)

9
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,720
(Without any clout or status,)

10
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,720
(you should back off.)

11
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,400
If my parents were still alive,

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,360
I wouldn't have to go through this.

13
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:23,000
My father was also a registrar.

14
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,000
(Stick around me,)

15
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:37,760
(and your sister)

16
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,520
(will be safe from bullying.)

17
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,360
(Sounds good?)

18
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,280
Baoyin,

19
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,040
why aren't you asleep yet?

20
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:54,440
Nothing.

21
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,280
Sleep now.

22
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,040
Baoyin,

23
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,640
did you see Su

24
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,000
at the Princess's Mansion today?

25
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:06,880
None of his business.

26
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,720
I just think

27
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,600
we can no longer be bullied by others.

28
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,880
How can we avoid being bullied?

29
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,720
Sleep now.

30
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,520
(I was born a peasant girl.)

31
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,240
(When I left my mother
by selling myself,)

32
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,640
(I was already defying fate.)

33
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,880
(I have to strive upwards.)

34
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,120
(I can't stay a peasant girl forever.)

35
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,360
(Wildflowers get trampled)

36
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,240
(when growing by the roadside,)

37
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,560
(but they)

38
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,040
(bloom on the mountaintop.)

39
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,800
(To avoid being bullied,)

40
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,400
(I have to fight my way up.)

41
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:19,920
Baoyin!

42
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,840
I sold all

43
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,280
your boat-woman stuff.

44
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,080
I got

45
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,960
a good price.

46
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,160
It's a pity

47
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,880
that such a good business

48
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,040
is being given up.

49
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,640
Break it to make it.

50
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,640
Luo,

51
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,080
give the two guan of cash

52
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,880
to Madam He next to me.

53
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,320
Baozhu will stay with her for a while.

54
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:48,880
This money

55
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,640
is for food.

56
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I'm off to the bank.

57
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,880
You're selling your stuff,

58
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,040
changing money,

59
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,200
and entrusting Baozhu to others.

60
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,840
Did you run into some trouble?

61
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,400
Don't worry.

62
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,280
I found a profitable business.

63
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,440
If everything goes smoothly,

64
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,160
it can bring great profits.

65
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,840
What kind of business is so profitable?

66
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,000
You talk in riddles

67
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,520
and are so eager for money.

68
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,160
How can I not worry?

69
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,160
Tell me

70
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,120
how much you need.

71
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,560
I need money to create opportunities.

72
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,440
I have to keep moving forward.

73
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,080
Will it work?

74
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,640
You,

75
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,160
a woman.

76
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,280
The right wind

77
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,040
will lift me up.

78
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,520
What men can do,

79
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,160
we women can just do the same.

80
00:04:50,009 --> 00:04:51,904
(Ten days later)

81
00:04:58,272 --> 00:05:00,128
(Owner of Curio Shop)
Three taels is my limit.

82
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:01,800
Three taels?

83
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,120
So little?

84
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,960
Then please go elsewhere.

85
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,240
Wait.

86
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,000
Three taels.

87
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,560
Just three taels.

88
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,600
Your writing

89
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,280
is decent.

90
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,080
If you need money,

91
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,280
copy books for me.

92
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,760
Ten taels per book.

93
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,640
What book is so valuable?

94
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,400
The Zang Tuo Sutra

95
00:05:34,432 --> 00:05:36,360
(Zang Tuo Sutra)
is an official government print

96
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,640
and is in short supply.

97
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,040
A hand-copied version

98
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,960
can fetch ten taels of silver.

99
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,120
Isn't this like stealing a book?

100
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,680
How can you say that?

101
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,680
Only private printing is.

102
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,680
You can say no.

103
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,280
Don't ruin my reputation.

104
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,200
Brother-in-law?

105
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,560
Come in.

106
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,680
Is Baoyin at home?

107
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,240
You don't know?

108
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,280
She went out to sea to harvest pearls.

109
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,960
It's been almost half a month.

110
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,440
Went out to sea?

111
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:23,880
You have to admit

112
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,400
she is pretty stubborn.

113
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,800
She's dead set

114
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,760
on making more money.

115
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,040
Did she say when she'd be back?

116
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,200
She didn't say that.

117
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,960
Maybe two or three months.

118
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,640
At sea, it's all about the weather.

119
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,760
She's just a frail young lady,

120
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,240
and she hasn't written back.

121
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,520
No idea how she's doing now.

122
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:52,920
Give the money

123
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,240
to her for me when she gets back.

124
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,240
It's improper.

125
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:01,880
Wait till she's back.

126
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,880
Give it to her yourself.

127
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:05,840
Stop here!

128
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:39,880
Miss.

129
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,160
Are you okay?

130
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:42,800
Okay?

131
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,360
I'm fine.

132
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:44,800
Come on.

133
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,560
Sit here.

134
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,200
You're having a fever.

135
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,200
It's no big deal.

136
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,440
I'm okay.

137
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,280
(Baozhu,)

138
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,360
(hope you're doing okay.)

139
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,600
(Unknowingly,)

140
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,280
(I've been here over a month.)

141
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,400
(I often think of you,
Uncle, and Auntie.)

142
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,400
(I hope you're all doing well.)

143
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,040
(I miss you very much.)

144
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,440
(I'm fine.)

145
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:19,520
(Don't worry.)

146
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,400
(This is my first time seeing the sea)

147
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,760
(and boarding a ship,)

148
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,520
(but everything has gone smoothly.)

149
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,280
(I thought life at sea)

150
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,760
(would be incredibly tough,)

151
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:36,040
(but it's more comfortable
than traveling on land.)

152
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,200
(Everyone on the ship
treats me like family,)

153
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,200
(and takes great care of me.)

154
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,840
(I have no worries or hardships.)

155
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,600
(And I've never imagined)

156
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,160
(that pearls come from clams.)

157
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,840
(I just dive and gather them,
and I can reap a rich harvest.)

158
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,920
(Didn't you despise copying books?)

159
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,800
(Why are you interested now?)

160
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,480
(I've got to say,)

161
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,600
(the price isn't what it used to be.)

162
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,560
(It's only six taels)

163
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,280
(per book now.)

164
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,240
(Maybe you should reconsider.)

165
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,040
(Baoyin,)

166
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,720
(had I tamed my pride earlier,)

167
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,640
(I wouldn't have to see you
go through all this,)

168
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,320
(feeling powerless.)

169
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,440
(Today's fog is so thick.)

170
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,920
(If the captain hadn't said
to stay inside,)

171
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,280
(I'd love to see)

172
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,080
(this endless sea of mist.)

173
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,800
(Baozhu,)

174
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,440
(the sea is so vast,)

175
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,120
(way beyond what we can imagine.)

176
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:04,120
(Its changes are so hard to predict.)

177
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,600
(I can see why Su struggles.)

178
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,720
(He's carrying the weight of waves.)

179
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,000
(Every step under those waves)

180
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,120
(must be really difficult.)

181
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,600
(He's breaking through the mist alone,)

182
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,760
(just to reach his great goals.)

183
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,840
(Don't fault him.)

184
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,440
(If you see him,)

185
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,080
(greet him for me.)

186
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,640
(Without you,)

187
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,320
(this lamp is never lit for me.)

188
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,440
(Where is my home now?)

189
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,560
(This courtyard)

190
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,320
(has become my only safe place)

191
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,760
(in the endless nights.)

192
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,720
(Baoyin,)

193
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,200
(when will you care for yourself,)

194
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,880
(so I don't have to worry)

195
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,640
(and feel so restless?)

196
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,200
51.

197
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,480
52.

198
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,400
53.

199
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,280
54.

200
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,360
55.

201
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,600
56.

202
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,200
57.

203
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,240
Which silly girl is daydreaming here?

204
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,240
Baoyin!

205
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,880
Baoyin, you're back!

206
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,280
I received all your letters.

207
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,160
I miss you too.

208
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:24,640
Baoyin,

209
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,520
why are you so thin?

210
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,840
You've gotten dark too.

211
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,200
It must have been tough.

212
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,640
Silly girl,

213
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:32,800
this is nothing.

214
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:36,120
I've earned money
to buy you delicious food

215
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,160
and pretty clothes.

216
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,080
Look!

217
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,800
I got them for you!

218
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:47,880
Baoyin!

219
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,160
Luo.

220
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,640
You finally returned.

221
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:52,960
I didn't just return.

222
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,320
I've got a ton of gifts for you.

223
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,720
All this seafood is yours.

224
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,760
What do you want to eat?

225
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,040
- I'll cook.
- Baoyin,

226
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,240
Su said

227
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,360
if you're back,

228
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,800
I should tie a red silk to the tree
by Bian River's bridge.

229
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,720
to let him know.

230
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,440
Mr. Wen Junior

231
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,520
was here?

232
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,040
Baoyin,

233
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,000
where to?

234
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,040
I'll cook tonight to welcome you.

235
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,080
Come back early.

236
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,200
I bought this.

237
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,320
What happened?

238
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:25,600
Your Highness,

239
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:28,600
fallen goods ahead have collided
with the ship.

240
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,880
The Shu brocade you ordered
from the Curio Shop last month

241
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,600
should be ready by now.

242
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,160
I'll go get it for you.

243
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,120
Good that you remembered for me.

244
00:14:59,360 --> 00:14:59,960
Go.

245
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,440
Yes.

246
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,200
