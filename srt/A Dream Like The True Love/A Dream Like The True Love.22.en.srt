3
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:27,920
Take a look.

4
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,360
These and these.

5
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:34,520
I'll take them all.

6
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:35,720
Alright, Ms. Chen.

7
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,520
Please wait a moment.

8
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,240
All of these?

9
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:45,680
They must cost a lot!

10
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,640
You've caused quite a stir

11
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,760
in the capital this time.

12
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,200
Even the daughter of Minister Song

13
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,720
has invited you to a banquet.

14
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,600
This is nothing.

15
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,680
We have the money anyway.

16
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,800
It'd be inappropriate to visit

17
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,400
Song Shulan empty-handed.

18
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,680
I've asked about.

19
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,120
Their banquets are one of a kind

20
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,880
in the capital.

21
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,720
That's talents from various circles.

22
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:11,880
Is Mr. Wen okay

23
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,880
with you going alone?

24
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:17,680
Why...

25
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,120
Why did you bring him up?

26
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:21,760
Nothing.

27
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,400
Didn't someone say

28
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,880
the ship has sailed?

29
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,160
Why stick around?

30
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,720
I'm here for Baozhu.

31
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,520
I must attend

32
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,280
my sister's wedding.

33
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,920
You can go back to Qingzhou tomorrow.

34
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,120
Don't worry about me.

35
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,920
Is it because I'm in the way?

36
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,320
Lest Mr. Wen gets the wrong idea?

37
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,320
I don't care what he thinks.

38
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,680
Gentlemen, please enjoy.

39
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,160
If there's anything...

40
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,200
Ms. Song.

41
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,760
Ms. Chen.

42
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:10,960
Thank you for having me.

43
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:11,880
I've prepared

44
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:12,720
a small gift.

45
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,680
This is my younger sister, Baozhu.

46
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,920
Greetings, Ms. Song.

47
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,760
If it isn't Lady Ying.

48
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:19,960
Greetings.

49
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,480
So glad to have you here.

50
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,080
I've already heard

51
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,360
about you and Mr. Wen.

52
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,760
No wonder he refused my proposal
three times.

53
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,360
Turns out he's been waiting
for such a fine lady.

54
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,480
He was getting betrothed?

55
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,080
Of course.

56
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,120
A bunch of matchmakers came and went,

57
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,600
only to get rejected.

58
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,200
Come.

59
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,440
I'll introduce you to some friends.

60
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,440
Mr. Wen has arrived.

61
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,560
- Mr. Wen.
- Mr. Wen.

62
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,120
Mr. Wen.

63
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:07,920
Look at mine.

64
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,120
Isn't it beautiful?

65
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,600
This is mine.

66
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,640
Take another look at mine.

67
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,280
Ms. Chen.

68
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,640
Glad to finally meet you.

69
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,320
You are indeed

70
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,440
true to your name.

71
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,640
This time it's indeed better.

72
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,480
Right?

73
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,840
- Ms. Chen.
- Ms. Chen,

74
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,160
join us for a drink.

75
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,160
Why are you here?

76
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,800
You aren't invited.

77
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,880
You've been strutting all over the city.

78
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,920
I'm worried about your safety.

79
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,880
I'm perfectly fine.

80
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,880
And I just met many young gentlemen.

81
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,040
Gentlemen?

82
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,320
These are all wastrels,

83
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,520
seeking pleasure all day long.

84
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,400
Don't fall for their tricks.

85
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,440
I heard you've met
a bunch of matchmakers.

86
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,640
Am I not even allowed
to make new friends?

87
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,520
What do you say, Mr. Wen?

88
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,600
Are you

89
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,800
jealous?

90
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,280
What else can I do

91
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,880
other than reject them?

92
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,480
I've said it before,

93
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,680
you've always been

94
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,280
the only one I wish to marry.

95
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,720
Baoyin,

96
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,600
don't listen to Song Shulan.

97
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:52,880
Su has never fallen

98
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,960
for any woman all these years.

99
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,400
No one knows him

100
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,520
better than I do.

101
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,840
He has suffered a lot

102
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,360
waiting for you.

103
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,560
Suffered?

104
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,040
He...

105
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,360
Mr. Wen.

106
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,240
Why are you doing this to yourself?

107
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,920
Just apologize to His Majesty

108
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,720
and marry his younger sister.

109
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,280
Wouldn't that be great to join

110
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,200
the royal family?

111
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,800
If Ms. Chen returns,

112
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,960
you can take her

113
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,120
as a concubine.

114
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,640
Why do you have to do this?

115
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,720
Men in my family

116
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,760
never take concubines.

117
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,400
I will only

118
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,720
marry one woman,

119
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,680
and that's

120
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,520
Baoyin.

121
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:08,960
Hey!

122
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,360
Mr. Wen?

123
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,080
Mr. Wen!

124
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,360
Mr. Wen!

125
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,640
Someone!

126
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,840
Go find the imperial physician!

127
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,920
Su nearly froze to death.

128
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,520
Father even had someone make a coffin.

129
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,280
After five days and nights,

130
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,400
the old ginseng His Majesty bestowed us

131
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,800
saved his life in the end.

132
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,200
How could he disobey His Majesty?

133
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,760
He insisted on marrying

134
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,120
no one but you,
in case you should return.

135
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,720
If he were to marry,

136
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,720
you would be heartbroken.

137
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,520
Anyone can see he's still

138
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,680

when I went to look for her.

192
00:11:24,915 --> 00:11:26,080
(Su)

193
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,640
Mr. Wen!

194
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,120
I found this on the gate.

195
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,520
It's for you.

196
00:11:31,251 --> 00:11:34,016
(Meet me outside the city, Mr. Wen)

197
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:36,680
Baozhu,

198
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,240
we go to Lord Ying.

199
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:38,560
Okay.

200
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,280
You want troops?

201
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,120
Are you nuts?

202
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,520
That would be a felony.

203
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,400
This is Baoyin.

204
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,400
I don't care.

205
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,240
Halt.

206
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,560
Whoa.

207
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,640
It's past curfew.

208
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,120
No one leaves the city.

209
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,640
I am Wen Su, Minister of Revenue.

210
00:11:59,040 --> 00:11:59,720
I'm on a case.

211
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,600
Make way.

212
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,440
Why would you lead troops
out of the city?

213
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,880
Without an imperial edict,

214
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,600
we can't let you pass.

215
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:06,720
Make way!

216
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,280
Let them pass.

217
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:14,520
Giddy up!

218
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:16,960
Giddy up!

219
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:17,680
Giddy up!

220
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:18,840
He broke the curfew.

221
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,200
Report to His Majesty.

222
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:20,840
Yes.

223
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,720
Help!

224
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,680
