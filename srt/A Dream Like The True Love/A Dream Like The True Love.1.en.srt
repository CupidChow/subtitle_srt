1
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,280
(I'm Chen Pan'er,)

2
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,160
(a daughter of poor farmers.)

3
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,880
(The magistrate took girls
as sacrifices to the River God.)

4
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:38,800
(My father couldn't afford
to ransom me.)

5
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,560
(So I could only be sacrificed.)

6
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,040
(But)

7
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,640
(can I survive?)

8
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:41,960
Look, she's over there.

9
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,480
Catch her. Don't let her escape again.

10
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:44,640
Hurry up.

11
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:45,640
She ran this way.

12
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,400
(Just when I thought
I had successfully escaped,)

13
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,040
(I never expected)

14
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:57,606
(that the sacrifice was all a scam.)

15
00:01:58,648 --> 00:02:04,003
=A Dream Like The True Love=

16
00:02:05,012 --> 00:02:07,516
=Episode 1=

17
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,920
Keep a watch on them.

18
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,480
Get them on the carriage.

19
00:02:17,722 --> 00:02:19,722
Don't cry anymore.

20
00:02:20,448 --> 00:02:21,402
(Yamen)

21
00:02:21,402 --> 00:02:23,842
Anyway, we'll be sold
to Chungui House tonight.

22
00:02:24,122 --> 00:02:26,842
This is our fate. Just accept it.

23
00:02:30,778 --> 00:02:31,858
The magistrate promised us.

24
00:02:32,138 --> 00:02:33,378
As long as we do a good job,

25
00:02:33,618 --> 00:02:35,418
he will reward us.

26
00:02:40,378 --> 00:02:41,538
(There must be a way.)

27
00:02:41,738 --> 00:02:42,738
Don't think about it.

28
00:02:43,618 --> 00:02:44,818
These corrupt officials

29
00:02:45,058 --> 00:02:46,258
use sacrifices as a pretext

30
00:02:46,258 --> 00:02:47,938
for human trafficking.

31
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:51,810
we're doomed in the end.

32
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:00,570
Are you ready?

33
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:01,970
The vehicle transporting them

34
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:03,570
will arrive soon.

35
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:39,850
Don't waste your energy.

36
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:43,570
Anyway, it's a dead end.

37
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:46,490
No matter what,

38
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:48,010
nobody but me

39
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:49,410
can decide how I'll die.

40
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:52,610
Load the women onto the vehicle.

41
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:53,370
- Yes.
- Yes.

42
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:06,130
(This magistrate is not only corrupt,)

43
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:09,090
(he also sells women
under the guise of sacrifice.)

44
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:12,410
(I must save those women first,)

45
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:15,210
(Wen Su)
(and will report to His Highness later.)

46
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:17,330
The vehicle is arriving soon.

47
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:19,330
Tie all the women up.

48
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:21,090
If anybody resists, kill them.

49
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:22,210
- Yes.
- Yes.

50
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:29,250
What will you choose?

51
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:30,330
Do you want to escape?

52
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:31,450
Do you want to suffer

53
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:33,330
or give yourself a chance to choose?

54
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:40,330
Can we choose?

55
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:43,090
Can we choose?

56
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:48,730
I don't want this.

57
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:50,210
I want to try again.

58
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:52,250
I also want to try.

59
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:53,570
Let me try.

60
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:54,690
Me too.

61
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:57,290
Come on. Hurry up. Let's do it together.

62
00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:00,250
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

63
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:01,730
Pull it harder.

64
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:05,810
Great.

65
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:06,970
We did it.

66
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:15,250
Who is he?

67
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:16,730
Is he here to kill us?

68
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:17,650
Let's run!

69
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:30,850
Let's go!

70
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:34,210
Let's go!

71
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:17,450
Well done.

72
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:20,090
Thank you, sir.

73
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:21,930
Move them out and bury them.

74
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:23,050
Clean it up.

75
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:24,090
Yes.

76
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:07,410
I arrived too late

77
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:09,250
and couldn't save others.

78
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:11,770
I could only save you.

79
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:23,690
Well,

80
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:25,370
pardon me.

81
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:47,890
- Who are you? What are you doing?
- Don't move.

82
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:52,042
Don't kill me.

83
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:56,010
I'm here for a case.

84
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:56,930
Don't be afraid.

85
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:04,370
I had no choice just now due to urgency.

86
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:06,650
Miss, please forgive me.

87
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:07,850
I intentionally

88
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:10,250
didn't stab your vital parts.

89
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:13,330
So,

90
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:15,850
you saved me?

91
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:22,770
Thank you for saving my life.

92
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:25,130
I will never forget your help.

93
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:28,370
If you mind me having seen your body,

94
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:32,210
and it affects your reputation,
come to Bianyang Prefecture to find me.

95
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:37,890
Don't misunderstand me.

96
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:39,850
I won't badger you.

97
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:42,010
You saved my life.

98
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:44,930
I will repay you in my own way.

I...

113
00:10:44,082 --> 00:10:44,442
Yes.

This is my home.

115
00:10:53,722 --> 00:10:54,642
Come over.

116
00:11:04,402 --> 00:11:05,402
Young lady.

117
00:11:06,362 --> 00:11:07,522
Do you know

118
00:11:08,442 --> 00:11:09,802
what place this is?

119
00:11:10,322 --> 00:11:11,162
Yes, I do.

120
00:11:14,122 --> 00:11:16,362
I came here to sell myself.

121
00:11:17,962 --> 00:11:19,362
Sell yourself?

122
00:11:23,842 --> 00:11:24,762
Do your parents agree?

123
00:11:26,322 --> 00:11:27,242
I don't need them.

124
00:11:28,042 --> 00:11:29,362
I can make my own decisions.

125
00:11:30,242 --> 00:11:31,362
They all want me dead.

126
00:11:31,922 --> 00:11:33,802
Yet, I must find a way to survive.

127
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:36,802
This year's girl
as sacrifice to the River God

128
00:11:37,082 --> 00:11:38,682
is you.

129
00:11:39,442 --> 00:11:41,042
I won't go. If I go, I will die.

130
00:11:41,042 --> 00:11:41,442
Stop it.

131
00:11:41,442 --> 00:11:42,434
(Chen Pan'er's Father)

132
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:43,242
(Chen Pan'er's Mother)
Pan'er.

133
00:11:43,242 --> 00:11:45,002
What's the point of raising you?

134
00:11:45,242 --> 00:11:46,962
You think
you're worth ten taels of silver?

135
00:11:47,138 --> 00:11:49,322
(Chen Youtian)
Do I have to go just because I'm a girl?

136
00:11:49,322 --> 00:11:50,762
Does a girl not deserve to live?

137
00:11:50,762 --> 00:11:51,282
You...

138
00:11:51,282 --> 00:11:52,562
Stop it.

139
00:11:52,922 --> 00:11:54,322
You can't let Pan'er do it.

140
00:11:55,002 --> 00:11:56,322
Pan'er is your own daughter.

141
00:11:56,322 --> 00:11:57,322
You get out of here.

142
00:11:58,002 --> 00:11:59,442
We're already out of food.

143
00:11:59,442 --> 00:12:00,922
My son is about to starve to death.

144
00:12:01,122 --> 00:12:03,242
Mother. Don't plead with him.

145
00:12:04,162 --> 00:12:04,802
It's useless.

146
00:12:06,522 --> 00:12:08,402
He only thinks of himself.

147
00:12:08,722 --> 00:12:10,362
He never cares about us.

148
00:12:19,962 --> 00:12:20,722
Go there.

149
00:12:58,002 --> 00:12:58,762
Make her leave.

150
00:12:59,482 --> 00:13:00,442
She's actually back.

151
00:13:00,442 --> 00:13:01,802
If the officials find out,

152
00:13:01,802 --> 00:13:03,522
our whole family will be done for.

153
00:13:03,802 --> 00:13:05,562
Without the money,

154
00:13:05,562 --> 00:13:06,762
I would let you die with her.

155
00:13:06,762 --> 00:13:07,882
Just rest assured,

156
00:13:08,682 --> 00:13:11,082
I've given the money to your mother.

157
00:13:13,442 --> 00:13:14,482
This is sad.

158
00:13:14,482 --> 00:13:17,682
A human is not as valuable as money.

159
00:13:17,682 --> 00:13:18,522
Sit tight.

160
00:13:18,842 --> 00:13:20,562
We'll go to Bianyang Prefecture

161
00:13:20,882 --> 00:13:22,162
and find you a good place there.

162
00:13:22,522 --> 00:13:23,042
Go.

163
00:13:23,042 --> 00:13:24,482
Pan'er.

164
00:13:25,178 --> 00:13:26,650
Pan'er.

165
00:13:27,546 --> 00:13:30,386
(Mother, I have no way out.)

166
00:13:30,946 --> 00:13:32,466
(I must leave here.)

167
00:13:32,466 --> 00:13:34,306
Pan'er.

168
00:13:36,122 --> 00:13:38,442
(My father will abuse you and me
if I go back home.)

169
00:13:39,002 --> 00:13:41,602
(After selling me,
you have money to treat your illness.)

170
00:13:44,122 --> 00:13:45,482
By the way, what's your name?

171
00:13:47,082 --> 00:13:47,922
My name is Chen...

172
00:13:49,602 --> 00:13:52,762
(A human is not as valuable as money.)

173
00:13:55,082 --> 00:13:56,122
My name is Baoyin.

174
