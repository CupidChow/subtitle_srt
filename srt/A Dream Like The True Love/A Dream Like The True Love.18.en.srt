=A Dream Like The True Love=

2
00:00:15,105 --> 00:00:17,344
=Episode 18=

3
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,960
(Mr. Wen stated his admiration
for a loyal servant at home.)

4
00:00:32,128 --> 00:00:34,592
(Being loved by a person
who values trust and keeps promises)

5
00:00:34,592 --> 00:00:36,720
(is indeed your fortune.)

6
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:57,760
Baoyin,

7
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,640
why are you still here?

8
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,400
I am the shopkeeper.

9
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:03,800
Where else can I be?

10
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,040
I've heard it.

11
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,560
You got a large amount of rewards.

12
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,160
The Wen family's name was cleared.

13
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,480
Don't mind the shop.

14
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,000
Pack up and go to the capital

15
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,120
to enjoy prosperity

16
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,160
and achieve success.

17
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,720
But this shop is something
I built up bit by bit.

18
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,760
I can't ignore it.

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,800
Baoyin,

20
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,080
did the Wen family treat you badly?

21
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,720
They have always treated me well.

22
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:29,880
It's just that...

23
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,880
Baoyin, Baoyin.

24
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:33,960
Baoyin.

25
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,320
Go home and take a look.

26
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,320
Why are you so flustered?

27
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,560
Yuniang...

28
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,000
Yuniang brought the entire Su family

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,160
to our house.

30
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,680
Mother asked me to call you back.

31
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,600
I don't know what Yuniang
said to my parents.

32
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,480
It made Father so angry that he fainted.

33
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,080
Madam He, help me watch the shop.

34
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:49,920
I will go back.

35
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,440
Alright, don't worry.

36
00:01:59,444 --> 00:02:02,720
(Yuniang)

37
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,440
Who let you into my and Baoyin's room?

38
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,160
Come out!

39
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,320
Qiongniang,

40
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,920
I am your sister.

41
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,280
Why can't I be here?

42
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,280
My name is Baozhu.

43
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,600
You're not my sister.

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,200
You ignored the whole family

45
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,680
for a whole year.

46
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,880
And why are you here now?

47
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,360
Qiongniang,

48
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,600
I had my reasons back then.

49
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,960
You're not a little kid anymore.

50
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,280
Shouldn't you be more sensible?

51
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,280
I don't care. This is Baoyin's room.

52
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,320
You come out!

53
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,600
Qiongniang,

54
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,280
why are you so disobedient?

55
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,480
Let go.

56
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,800
Let go.

57
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,480
You...

58
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,160
I am the one
in charge of this family now.

59
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,840
If anything, talk to me.

60
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,080
Who are you?

61
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,600
How dare you act wildly in Wen Mansion!

62
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:10,560
You wild girl, even became the head of
my assistant minister nephew's household?

63
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,000
Talk big? Aren't you afraid of
straining your tongue?

64
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,720
First, I don't know
any assistant minister.

65
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,320
Secondly,

66
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,360
this yard is rented by me.

67
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,200
The contract is in the cabinet.

68
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:28,320
For now, it belongs to me.

69
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,520
Additionally,

70
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,520
did you present your name cards

71
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,200
when coming here?

72
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,560
This is Wen family,

73
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,800
proven by Master Wen and Madam Wen.

74
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,120
Alright.

75
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,720
Take a step back.

76
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,560
Even if the Wen family
now lives with me,

77
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,120
be it a promotion or getting rich,

78
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,000
if the assistant minister you mentioned

79
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,600
is Mr. Wen Junior of the Wen family.

80
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,920
Shouldn't you go to the capital
to find him?

81
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,120
Why come here to force his parents?

82
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,480
People need dignity.

83
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,200
And trees need bark.

84
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,400
Think about if you have no shame.

85
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,000
Who are you referring?

86
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,160
You!

87
00:04:09,346 --> 00:04:10,280
- You...
- She is young.

88
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,280
But you, so old and

89
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,520
with one foot in the grave,

90
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,560
still not reasonable?

91
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,720
Shouldn't you behave with humility?

92
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,080
I've heard of repaying kindness with
enmity, but not the other way around.

93
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,520
If I were you,

94
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,160
I would go home right now,

95
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,000
praying every day for Mr. Wen Junior

96
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,480
to forget about you soon enough.

97
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,840
Who are you exactly, wild girl?

98
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,880
Why speak so viciously?

99
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,520
I am the legitimate uncle of Wen Su.

100
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,840
In this case, it's even more detestable.

101
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,400
Back then,

102
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,200
you disregarded family ties

103
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,600
and chose to protect yourself.

104
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,640
Now,

105
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,880
you don't deserve to be his uncle.

106
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,200
You...

107
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,920
Father, Mother.

108
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,600
Mother,

109
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,160
you need to stand up for me.

110
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,080
I told you to go back.

111
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,200
Why are you still here
embarrassing yourself?

112
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,200
Mother,

113
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,240
I am your biological daughter.

114
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,200
Now that he is in power,

115
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,720
he surely can't turn his back
on me, right?

116
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,320
Moreover,

117
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,040
he is now favored by His Majesty.

118
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,560
Getting my husband a position
in the royal court

119
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,440
is just a piece of cake.

120
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,920
You're so hesitant here.

121
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,280
Do you look down upon us?

122
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,320
You still dare to mention
Mr. Wen Junior.

123
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,520
He is no longer who he once was.

124
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,200
He has suffered so much

125
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,680
and endured so much.

126
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,280
Do you think he's still easy to provoke?

127
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,680
Take some medicine and clear your mind.

128
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,280
You...

129
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,320
Look.

130
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,240
Everyone, look,

131
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,800
this is

132
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:10,160
what I found in her bundle.

133
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,000
(Su)

134
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,120
Su's personal sweat cloth.

135
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:21,120
I thought you were
some loyal and righteous young lady.

136
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:25,120
But you just covet
Su's talent and looks,

137
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:29,560
seeking the wealth
and status of our Wen family.

138
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,520
You want to be the head lady
of the Wen family?

139
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,440
Who gave you the audacity?

140
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,520
I did.

141
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,240
So what?

142
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,160
Su.

143
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,360
Baoyin and I have been in love
with each other

144
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,560
for a long time.

145
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,120
If I say she's the head lady
of the Wen family,

146
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,000
who dares to oppose?

147
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,720
Su,

148
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:31,160
she is just an ill-intentioned maid.

149
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,960
I'm afraid she had ulterior motives
as soon as she entered Wen Mansion,

150
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,560
wishing to climb high.

151
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,000
Don't be enchanted.

152
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,160
Father, Mother,

153
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,560
don't be deceived.

154
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,720
Alright.

155
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,720
You don't know who she is?

156
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,800
I'll tell you.

157
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:55,000
She is the one
who saved our entire Wen family.

158
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,560
If Chen Baoyin

159
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,240
can't be the matriarch of our family,

160
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,840
then she will be the only head lady
of our Wen family.

161
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:07,280
Your connection
with our Wen family has ended.

162
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:08,760
I...

163
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,880
Our Wen family

164
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,480
don't owe you anything.

165
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,520
In the future,

166
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,880
whether you live well or poorly,

167
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,920
it's all up to you.

168
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,440
Mother.

169
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,120
Go back.

170
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,920
Mother, listen to what Father is saying.

171
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,560
He doesn't want his own daughter.

172
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,600
Mother, say something.

173
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,760
I agree

174
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,480
with your father.

175
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,160
Just go.

176
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,200
Chen Baoyin,

177
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,240
what...

178
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:44,000
What kind of spell
have you cast on them?

179
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,920
They've all been bewitched by you.

180
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,000
Be careful. Your pride today

181
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,840
may lead to a bad end tomorrow.

182
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,360
You'd better speak kindly
for the sake of the kids.

183
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,280
Your brother has come this far

184
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,360
and the Wen family lived on.

185
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,880
You don't know what he has sacrificed.

186
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,520
But you only think
it was my manipulation.

187
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,240
Fine.

188
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,800
You are family,

189
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,760
but I

190
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,200
have become an outsider.

191
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,120
You are bullying me, aren't you?

192
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,320
Father, Mother,

193
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,920
let's go.

194
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,200
Let's go.

195
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,200
Father, Mother.

196
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,880
Go after her.

197
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,080
Go after her.

198
00:10:04,563 --> 00:10:05,472
Baoyin.

199
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,680
Baoyin.

200
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,536
I went to the shop looking for you.

201
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,840
But you are here.

202
00:10:17,043 --> 00:10:18,600
(Su)

203
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,720
This sweat cloth...

204
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,800
I wanted to return it to you.

205
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,200
Just never found the opportunity.

206
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,280
Baoyin,

207
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,280
although the words I just said

208
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,280
is abrupt,

209
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,840
I'm sincere.

210
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,200
I have admired you for long,

211
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,480
and wish to grow old with you.

212
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,160
Would you be willing?

213
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,920
I was just a servant.

214
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,440
I am here today
because of your kindness.

215
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,600
Such a big matter,

216
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,240
how can I decide on this?

217
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,480
Moreover,

218
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,680
Master and Madam are still unaware.

219
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,280
My parents always
intended to betroth us.

220
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,200
About this matter,

221
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,000
I only want to ask for your opinion.

222
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,520
Since you told me

223
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,520
being upright and honest is integrity,

224
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,640
and under great pressure,

225
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,440
making choices
is also a kind of character,

226
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,000
I stopped seeing you as a servant.

227
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,520
I know you suffered

228
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,400
many grievances at home.

229
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,760
But you are resilient,

230
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,440
never willing to resign,

231
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,600
even stronger than a man.

232
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,200
I respect you

233
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,160
and love you.

234
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,960
I hate myself for failing
to protect you before.

235
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,360
Now everything has settled.

236
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,720
I can finally say this to you.

237
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,240
All of this

238
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,840
feels like a dream.

239
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,800
I never thought

240
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,200
you would understand me so well.

241
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,680
So are you

242
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,280
agreeing?

243
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,840
From now on,
I'll be always by your side.

244
00:13:15,412 --> 00:13:19,404
♪Through every storm,
through every breeze♪

245
00:13:19,404 --> 00:13:21,972

♪Every storm and every breeze♪

♪A witness to our love♪

♪With you, my heart is complete♪

254
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,880
Today we reunite again.

255
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,920
After hardship comes happiness.

256
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,640
By the way, Su,

257
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,720
where have you been during this time?

258
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,040
How did you get through it?

259
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:24,520
I...

260
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,560
Uncle,

261
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,320
Mr. Wen Junior concealed his identities
and followed the Crown Prince,

262
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,560
His Majesty now.

263
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,920
Their royal affairs are all secrets.

264
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,256
Loyalty and filial piety often conflict.

265
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,520
Don't make difficult for him.

266
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,640
Baoyin is right.

267
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,440
Since that is the case,

268
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,400
about how you two developed feelings

269
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,960
secretly,

270
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,920
it is also inappropriate for us
to inquire, right?

271
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,600
Not to mention Father and Mother,

272
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,440
I don't know, either.

273
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,320
Seeing your mutual love

274
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,520
and affection,

275
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,440
we are relieved.

276
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,400
This time, I'm back home

277
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,720
to bring you
to live in the capital city.

278
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,360
So we can reunite soon

279
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,080
and not separate.

280
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,280
Great.

281
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,040
Then let's hold the wedding
in the capital city.

282
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,680
At that time,
we'll hold a grand celebration

283
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,920
to formally marry
Baoyin into our family.

284
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,120
Let's have another drink.

285
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:35,600
Baoyin.

286
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,120
Baoyin, thank you.

287
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:38,920
Come on.

288
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,360
Be careful.

289
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,320
Be gentle.

290
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,040
Yes.

291
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,360
Who sent you here?

292
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,480
You got the wrong place?

293
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,600
How could it be?

294
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,640
Mr. Wen Junior.

295
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,600
I bought all these for my wife.

296
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,000
Do you like them?

297
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,120
Your kindness,

298
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,120
I get it.

299
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,280
But that's too much.

300
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,320
I can't use them all.

301
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:22,360
You are now the head lady
of the Wen family.

302
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,080
There will be more
of these things in the future.

303
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,320
And they are

304
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,920
here to take care of you
and Baozhu's daily life.

305
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,600
You'll get used to it.

306
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,600
Then you tidy up first.

307
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,880
I'll take you out for a stroll later.

308
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,880
I've heard the head lady was once
a servant of the Wen family.

309
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,080
We are all servants.

310
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,720
Why do they take a fancy to her?

311
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,680
When the Wen family fell,
she didn't leave.

312
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,880
She also endured
a lot of hardships with Qiongniang.

313
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,240
Marrying her is just to repay the favor.

314
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,600
So that's how it is.

315
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,160
Truly a scheming one.

316
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:11,920
What?

317
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,320
You rejected the marriage again?

318
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,880
Does this count as defying His Majesty?

319
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,080
Why go back to confess your guilt?

320
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:19,600
Father, rest assured.

321
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,200
I know the limits.

322
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:24,840
His Majesty is worried about
my unstable position in the court.

323
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,640
That's why he insists on doing that.

324
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,080
If I, a top scholar,

325
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,000
need to rely on my wife's family
to establish myself,

326
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,480
it would be disgraceful.

327
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,480
Su,

328
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,280
don't take advantage of
being close with His Majesty

329
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,320
and become

330
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,280
arrogant.

331
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,920
Remember, those close to power
live on the edge of danger.

332
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,160
I dare not be arrogant.

333
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,760
Even without the marriage rejection,
it would still be the same.

334
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:54,800
My path,

335
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,440
I shall walk it myself.

336
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,880
Now, everything has been settled.

337
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,720
I want nothing.

338
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,320
I just wish to marry her.

339
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,200
I can only blame myself

340
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,720
for not able to protect you.

341
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,040
If you can manage it, so be it.

342
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,160
But don't get Baoyin involved.

343
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,560
Yes.

344
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,080
(Marriage rejection?)

345
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,240
(Mr. Wen Junior rejected the marriage)

346
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,640
(bestowed by His Majesty again for me.)
