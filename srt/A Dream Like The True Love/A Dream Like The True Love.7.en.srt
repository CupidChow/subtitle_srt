00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:14,430
=A Dream Like The True Love=

2
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:17,022
=Episode 7=

3
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,520
Hurry up and show respect.

4
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,000
Greetings, Eldest Princess.

5
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:25,480
Know it?

6
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:27,560
It's Crane Sipping.

7
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,520
Funny?

8
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,760
I heard you stood up
for your sister at the girls' school

9
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,560
and offended the Magistrate.

10
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,040
Is this true?

11
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:44,800
Yes.

12
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,704
- Your Highness...
- I called you here not to punish you.

13
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,480
It's to grant you a favor.

14
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,360
Three chances.

15
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,440
If you hit the white mark,

16
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,600
I'll let you go.

17
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,400
Hold on.

18
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,160
Scared?

19
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,640
(Beating)
(Two chances left.)

20
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:05,600
Take him away.

21
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,600
Beat to death.

22
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:08,920
Your Highness.

23
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,200
Spare me, Your Highness!

24
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,000
Your Highness!

25
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,440
Your Highness, spare me!

26
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,880
Go on.

27
00:03:38,464 --> 00:03:40,672
(Whipping)

28
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,840
Your Highness. How could it be me?

29
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:46,920
Your Highness,

30
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:47,760
spare me.

31
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,600
Spare me!

32
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,840
Your Highness!

33
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,840
Your Highness!

34
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,200
If you miss again,

35
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,960
the next one will be Wen Su.

36
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,440
Your Highness,

37
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,320
I've never shot a bow before.

38
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,160
Isn't this a bit unfair?

39
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,640
You want fairness?

40
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:16,120
Then Wen Su has to cut his hair
as a condition.

41
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,040
Alright.

42
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,240
Let's change the game.

43
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,640
Guards.

44
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,800
If both are hit,

45
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,840
I'll let you go.

46
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:51,920
If you miss,

47
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,040
you both will die.

48
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,480
(You were looking for a show?)

49
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,160
(Well, here it is.)

50
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,880
(You miscalculated.)

51
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,128
(I've excelled at slingshots
since childhood.)

52
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,280
Thank you for your mercy.

53
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:19,880
Get lost.

54
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:53,960
How about it?

55
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,440
Take off your clothes.

56
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,400
You've spoiled

57
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,800
my mood today.

58
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,160
Baoyin.

59
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,040
Baoyin.

60
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,640
- Baoyin!
- Baoyin!

61
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,920
What's wrong, Baoyin?

62
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,080
Baoyin!

63
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,240
Baoyin, what's wrong with you?

64
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,480
What is this for?

65
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,000
Where are your clothes?

66
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,960
I'm fine.

67
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,600
Baozhu, don't cry.

68
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,400
I'm just hungry.

69
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,480
I want to eat roast goose.

70
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:20,920
Okay.

71
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:21,880
Eat roast goose.

72
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,880
Let's go eat roast goose.

73
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,400
(You've spoiled my mood today.)

74
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,920
(Stay on your knees here)

75
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,920
