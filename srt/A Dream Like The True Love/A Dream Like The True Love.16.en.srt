00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,160
Make way!

4
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:19,880
Make way!

5
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:20,760
Everyone, make way!

6
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:27,840
Shameless!

7
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:28,760
Good he's caught!

8
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:30,240
Hit him!

9
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,240
Make way!

10
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,800
Mr. Wen!

11
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,000
It's me!

12
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,120
Buddha Temple...

13
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:35,680
Go away!

14
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:36,520
He deserved to die!

15
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:37,080
Get lost!

16
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,160
Make way!

17
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:40,880
Make way!

18
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,120
Make way!

19
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,600
Lady.

20
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,280
Master!

21
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,040
Don't speak.

22
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,400
Follow me.

23
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,000
Did Ruchu say where the decree is?

24
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:14,920
Sir,

25
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,880
the guards are too vigilant.

26
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:17,840
Given the situation,

27
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,280
the Eldest Princess doesn't have it yet.

28
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,600
Well, you may leave.

29
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,200
Yes.

30
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,360
Master,

31
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,640
why was Mr. Wen Junior sentenced?

32
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,640
Earlier he left with the Eldest Princess

33
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,600
without telling me.

34
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,000
Suddenly his life is in danger now.

35
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,480
I need to know the reason.

36
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,040
So I can explain to his parents later.

37
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,600
Please let me know.

38
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,040
Well,

39
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,520
since you're here for him,

40
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,440
you must be loyal and righteous.

41
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,240
Then I shall tell the truth.

42
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,200
As His Majesty is seriously ill,
my sister

43
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,600
intended to rebel.

44
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,440
As the Crown Prince's confidant,
Ruchu had to stay by her side,

45
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,712
and find the right time to act.

46
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,200
It happened abruptly.

47
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,320
The future is uncertain.

48
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,960
That's why he couldn't
tell you the truth.

49
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,240
(No wonder
he said those heartless words.)

50
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,360
Master,

51
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,840
when will he be executed?

52
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,240
Is there

53
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,400
a way to save him?

54
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,760
Ruchu has an imperial decree.

55
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,400
But when meeting with us,

56
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,160
the Eldest Princess's men took him

57
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,720
and the decree was missing.

58
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,160
As long as Ruchu
keeps the decree's location secret,

59
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,680
the Eldest Princess will not
do anything to him.

60
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,000
I have a risky solution.

61
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,680
I wonder if I can try it.

62
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,560
Who are you to break in?

63
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,200
How dare you.

64
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,400
I am the Eldest Princess's
personal maid.

65
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,480
By her order,

66
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,000
I need to interrogate Wen Su now.

67
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,400
I have this royal jade.

68
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,520
How dare you stop me?

69
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,840
We are sorry

70
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,840
for offending you.

71
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:17,800
Please.

72
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,280
Kill me if you want.

73
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,200
About the imperial decree,

74
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,160
I will not reveal anything.

75
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,680
Mr. Wen Junior.

76
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,360
Who let you in?

77
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,760
Do you know what this place is?

78
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,200
How can I leave you alone?

79
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,480
I have met with Head Monk Fahui.

80
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,840
They shouldn't have involved you.

81
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,000
All was my choice.

82
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,400
If Head Monk Fahui didn't tell me,

83
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,200
how could I know what you really think?

84
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,200
That day,

85
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,640
I said harsh things.

86
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,880
I didn't mean it.

87
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,080
I understand.

88
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,080
What a touching romance.

89
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,040
Su, I never knew

90
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,720
you are so considerate.

91
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:40,480
What happens between you and me
has nothing to do with Baoyin.

92
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,760
Let her go.

93
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,600
If you're unhappy,

94
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,720
come at me.

95
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,880
Which part of you
has not been flogged by me?

96
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,320
I am tired of you.

97
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,960
I want to try something new.

98
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,080
Where is the imperial decree?

99
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:28,920
If you don't say,

100
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,520
I'll make your lover drink this.

101
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,040
Since I'm here,

102
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,480
I'm ready to die for him.

103
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,480
I was

104
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,480
saved by you.

105
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,160
Today, I'll repay you.

106
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,520
We owe each other nothing.

107
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,360
Wen Ruchu!

108
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,840
Don't you want to know
where the decree is?

109
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,240
Kill me,

110
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:16,040
and no one will know where it is.

111
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,280
Don't push me.

112
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,520
I cherished your talent,

113
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,600
and intended to spare your life.

114
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,240
But you took advantage of my kindness.

115
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,480
Since you're so devoted to each other,

116
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,720
you can choose.

117
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,840
I can only let one of you leave.

118
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,960
I had

119
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,240
studied arduously for over a decade.

120
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,800
I was well-known for making the list.

121
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,040
I devoted myself entirely
to my homeland.

122
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,560
Humiliation

123
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,120
and torture.

124
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,480
I can endure them
along with blood and tears.

125
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,240
But there is one person

126
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,920
I must protect.

127
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,560
Don't be afraid.

128
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,720
Mr. Wen Junior.

129
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,080
Mr. Wen Junior.

130
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,720
Mr. Wen Junior!

131
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,720
Mr. Wen Junior!

132
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,160
You gave your life for a villager.

133
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,040
Wen Su,

134
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,240
you truly are a love-struck fool.

135
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,600
The decree is hidden outside
the palace wall at south gate.

136
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,280
It is hidden
outside the palace wall at south gate.

137
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,520
Outside the palace wall at south gate.

138
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,320
Alright.

139
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,600
How is Wen Su?

140
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,160
You must save him.

141
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,200
