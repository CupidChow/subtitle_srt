=A Dream Like The True Love=

2
00:00:15,188 --> 00:00:16,949
=Episode 17=

3
00:00:22,368 --> 00:00:23,168
Mr. Wen Junior.

4
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:25,960
Mr. Wen Junior.

5
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,240
Mr. Wen Junior.

6
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:30,880
Mr. Wen Junior.

7
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:38,400
Master,

8
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,560
is Mr. Wen Junior saved?

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:43,760
Rest assured.

10
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,280
It missed vital parts.

11
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:46,480
Life's not in danger.

12
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,240
He said that this way,
you would surely understand.

13
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,880
Missed vital parts.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,560
It's the same as before.

15
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,760
Where is he?

16
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,680
Thanks to your assistance.

17
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,960
The edict was found.

18
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,520
Wen Su is entering the palace
with the Crown Prince.

19
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:17,520
Be it success or failure,

20
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,160
tonight, there will be an answer.

21
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,760
He is injured.

22
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,560
How can he do something
so dangerous again?

23
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,400
Everything happens

24
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,440
for a reason.

25
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,800
Someone has to bring it to an end.

26
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,200
Ruchu specifically instructed

27
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,880
to send you back to Bianyang.

28
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,200
If there are changes,

29
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,080
please join the Wen family

30
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,840
and flee to a safe place.

31
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,920
I will prepare a carriage
for you right away.

32
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,280
Always thinking for others.

33
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,920
Have you ever thought about yourself?

34
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,600
(Six hours ago)
The physician said she was tired.

35
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,240
You're injured. Don't move around.

36
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:31,840
Ruchu.

37
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,080
Ruchu.

Kill!

60
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,640
Your Highness, it's Wen Su.

61
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,240
Why is he still alive?

62
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,600
You are the Crown Prince's aunt.

63
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,200
He is merciful.

64
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,160
Knowing you love beauty,

65
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,440
he ordered to leave your corpse intact.

66
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,480
You should end yourself.

67
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,280
Winner takes all.

68
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,360
Just within a few days,

69
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,120
we have exchanged our positions.

70
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,040
I believe more in the manifestation of

71
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,200
heavenly justice.

72
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,480
Heavenly justice?

73
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,000
Since childhood, I have been well-read

74
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,400
with a profound knowledge.

75
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,880
Just because I am a woman,

76
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,280
I can only watch
incompetents gain power.

77
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,720
But a woman is only to marry,

78
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:31,840
give birth,

79
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,680
and become a tool.

80
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,800
Why?!

81
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,360
So you harmed your elder brother

82
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,600
and intended a coup,

83
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,680
bringing Daqing to a crisis

84
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,440
and ignoring blood and kinship?

85
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,400
What's wrong with that?

86
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,400
The heaven is unjust,

87
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,640
so I will take it myself.

88
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,440
A decree can't be defied?

89
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,520
I insist on fighting for it!

90
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:03,880
Even as an emperor,

91
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,040
you'll never be a wise ruler.

92
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,880
And no one will follow you.

93
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,360
You only have hatred.

94
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,360
Right.

95
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,560
How about you?

96
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,560
You hate that I humiliated you

97
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,640
and crushed your dignity.

98
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,120
Hate me then.

99
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,600
Hatred lasts longer than love.

100
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,560
You are wrong.

101
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,920
Even trapped in prison,

102
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,440
I have never been defeated
by your humiliation.

103
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,560
I know what my heart desires.

104
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,840
And I know someone
in this world understands me

105
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,920
and always stands by my side.

106
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,640
I have loved passionately all my life.

107
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,040
For the late emperor,

108
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,520
Daqing,

109
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,240
and the people,

110
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,840
I never felt a bit of guilt.

111
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,400
I blame only time and fate

112
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,600
for not fulfilling my heart's desires.

113
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,200
In this lifetime,

114
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,440
I don't need others to convict me.

115
00:09:26,676 --> 00:09:29,760
(By the Command of Heaven,
the Emperor decrees:)

116
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,640
(In the 22nd year
of the rule of the Daqing Emperor,)

117
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,440
(Crown Prince accepted
the mandate of heaven,)

118
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,800
(and followed the imperial edict
to ascend the throne.)

119
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,440
(Eldest Princess Zhao Qingcheng)

120
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,880
(attempted to overthrow the monarchy
and was sentenced according to the law.)

121
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,080
(Reported and settled
after a long deliberation.)

122
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:49,200
(Thus, I declare to the world
to let everyone know.)

123
00:09:53,939 --> 00:09:55,240
(Bianyang)

124
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,080
Congrats, Mr. Wen.

125
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:56,480
Here.

126
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,920
Mr. Wen Junior was appointed by His Majesty
as Assistant Minister of Revenue.

127
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,800
And your name cleared.

128
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,240
You regained Emperor's favor.

129
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,400
As a close friend,

130
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,960
I share in the honor.

131
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,760
Thank you.

132
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,960
Please come inside.

133
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,000
Come inside.

134
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,040
Father, Mother.

135
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:12,760
Let's go.

136
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,240
Father,

137
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,200
an old gentleman
has arrived at the door.

138
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,880
Old gentleman?

139
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,600
Sir,

140
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,240
I failed to welcome you
from afar. Sorry.

141
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:23,880
Mr. Wen,

142
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,200
you helped the Emperor

143
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,400
ascend the throne.

144
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,960
His Majesty ordered me
to confer you rewards.

145
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,320
Who is Chen Baoyin?

146
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,880
- Baoyin...
- Baoyin...

147
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,400
She is...

148
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,360
Baoyin is...

149
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,480
(Bianyang has been fully restored.)

150
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:50,360
(I come here every day
to tie a red ribbon,)

151
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,040
(only hoping Mr. Wen Junior)

152
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,880
(to return home soon.)

153
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:55,840
Baoyin.

154
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,200
Baoyin.

155
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,400
Baoyin.

156
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,520
Someone from the palace
wants to see you.

157
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,640
Mr. Wen Junior...

158
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,880
Must be news about him.

159
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:07,800
Let's go.

160
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,880
You're back.

161
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,560
You must be Lady Baoyin.

162
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,280
Greetings, sir.

163
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,640
I'm indeed Baoyin.

164
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,280
You have made contributions

165
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,600
in finding the edict.

166
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,280
These are rewards from His Majesty.

167
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,680
Thanks for the rewards.

168
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,160
I'm deeply grateful.

169
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,720
I have one more thing

170
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,640
to congratulate you.

171
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,280
I'm already overwhelmed.

172
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,800
No wishful thinking.

173
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,560
Do you not want to know
about Mr. Wen's good news?

174
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,440
Please, do not keep me
in suspense anymore.

175
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,440
Mr. Wen guarded His Majesty well.

176
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:09,760
His Majesty intended

177
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,800
to arrange a marriage
of equal social standing,

178
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,320
but Mr. Wen resolutely refused,

179
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,640
stating his admiration
for a loyal servant at home.

180
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,640
They already had an engagement.

181
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,360
Being loved by a person
who values trust and keeps promises

182
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,520
is indeed your fortune.

183
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,800
I offer my congratulations to you here.

184
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,640
Thank you for your kindness.

185
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,560
His Majesty's words have been conveyed.

186
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,480
I will set off back to the capital.

187
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,160
Take care, everyone.

188
