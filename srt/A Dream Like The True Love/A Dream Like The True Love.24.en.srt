=Episode 24=

3
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:20,080
Even if

4
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,120
I want you dead,

5
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:23,840
you'll die for him?

6
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:28,880
Yes.

7
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:43,520
Please rise.

8
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,240
This dear friend of mine

9
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,440
surely is right about you.

10
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,600
How could I possibly tear you apart?

11
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,000
Though him mobilizing troops
is indeed a capital offense.

12
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,880
That's a fact.

13
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,360
But I know

14
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,520
what he has done for me over the years.

15
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,680
I also know he has thus

16
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,800
made many enemies.

17
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:21,960
So

18
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,760
Your Majesty will no longer blame him?

19
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,160
He has committed such a heavy offense.

20
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,440
If I openly protect him,

21
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,200
that would bring him harm.

22
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,760
You do understand that,

23
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,520
right?

24
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,120
Yes.

25
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,880
Your Majesty has reasons.

26
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,040
What can I do?

27
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,080
I've heard about your sharp tongue.

28
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,920
You do have

29
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,840
a way with words.

30
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,840
I'll give you a chance

31
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,800
to speak for Ruchu.

32
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,960
You may speak

33
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,480
as you see fit.

34
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,440
Thank you.

35
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,400
His Majesty arrives.

36
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:28,480
- Long live Your Majesty.
- Long live Your Majesty.

37
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:29,800
Rise.

38
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,936
- Thank you, Your Majesty.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.

39
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:34,880
Your Majesty,

40
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,200
I heard

41
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:40,200
Mr. Wen mobilized Lord Ying's troops

42
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,360
and broke the curfew to leave the city.

43
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:46,040
Such audacity.

44
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,360
I hope Your Majesty will punish him.

45
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,720
Your Majesty.

46
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,800
Mr. Wen mobilized troops

47
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,960
because I was abducted by villains

48
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,720
and he was desperate to save me.

49
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,360
So I should be

50
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,480
the one to blame.

51
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,440
Who is this?

52
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:14,320
Your Majesty,
that's only her side of the story.

53
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,800
We don't know what she is to Wen Su.

54
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
If it was to save her,

55
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,640
why mobilized the troops?

56
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:20,840
In my opinion,

57
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,640
she is definitely covering for Wen Su

58
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,560
to conceal his real intention.

59
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,040
Wen Su has long been taking advantage

60
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,480
of Your Majesty's grace.

61
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,080
His true intention

62
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,800
behind his crime

63
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,440
is not that simple.

64
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,120
Mr. Zhang, are you

65
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,320
implying His Majesty is incompetent?

66
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,440
I traveled all the way from Qingzhou,

67
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,720
crossing the whole nation,

68
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,120
and met all sorts of people.

69
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,040
Do you know what they say
about His Majesty?

70
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,600
They say His Majesty is wise

71
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,480
and Daqing is going to prosper.

72
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,960
I didn't mean that.

73
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,320
Wen Su has his issues.

74
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,960
He used to be a toy boy.

75
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,480
And now, just because of some merits,

76
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,520
he becomes arrogant

77
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,680
and eliminates dissidents.

78
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,080
There's nothing

79
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,160
he couldn't do.

80
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,800
Which law stipulates

81
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,640
that a toy boy can't be an official?

82
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,360
He achieved first place

83
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:21,840
in three imperial exams.

84
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,080
But as a filial son,

85
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:23,800
he chose

86
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,080
to work undercover to save

87
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,080
his family.

88
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,760
As a loyal subject,

89
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,360
he had devoted himself
to the great cause for years

90
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,680
just to crush the villains' conspiracy

91
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,000
and restore peace.

92
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,960
As a censor,

93
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,800
you are granted the right to speak,

94
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,120
but it's not for you
to say whatever you like,

95
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,360
or criticize whoever you want.

96
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,320
We common folks have a saying,

97
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,080
"Words hurt more than knives."

98
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,920
I wonder if you've heard of it.

99
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:48,720
You!

100
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,640
The ministers suspect
Wen Su of conspiracy,

101
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,440
yet they can't produce any evidence.

102
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,920
Now they finally
have something against him,

103
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,400
so they are making full use of it.

104
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,480
I know how hurtful
people's words can be.

105
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,600
I have also backed down

106
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,880
years ago.

107
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,600
But now I see

108
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,840
we shouldn't blame those
who are slandered,

109
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,520
but those who throw judgment

110
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,800
and allegations blindly.

111
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,440
I vouch for

112
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:19,280
Mr. Wen's innocence with my life.

113
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:23,840
Your Majesty,

114
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,920
this woman is clearly

115
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,760
twisting the facts.

116
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,520
She's just defending Wen Su.

117
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,520
You mustn't...

118
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,000
Then I shall speak the truth.

119
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,720
The prefect of Qingzhou, Feng Gui,

120
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,920
embezzled tax funds

121
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,640
and took bribery.

122
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,360
He retaliated against me.

123
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,680
I asked Lord Ying for this favor
out of desperation

124
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,000
to arrest Feng Gui.

125
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,640
I overstepped

126
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:54,880
my authority.

127
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,360
Feng Gui retaliated against you

128
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,680
and broke our law.

129
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,240
The evidence is solid.

130
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,680
Send him to the Court
of Judicial Review.

131
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,160
As for you.

132
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,400
I overstepped my authority

133
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,520
and made a grave mistake.

134
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,800
I shall resign

135
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,320
and never join public service.

136
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,320
Su.

137
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,680
Are you sure?

138
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:21,920
Your Majesty.

139
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,600
Wen Su mobilized troops

140
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,600
to arrest a serious offender.

141
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,840
He has been

142
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,560
serving the court
with utmost dedication.

143
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,160
Please forgive him for once.

144
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,320
Since I took office,

145
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,200
I have been strict with both myself

146
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,880
and other officials to a fault.

147
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,080
If I make a mistake

148
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,120
and demand exoneration,

149
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,120
how can I

150
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,080
be a role model to others?

151
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,280
To resign

152
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,560
is my best choice.

153
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,840
In that case,

154
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,520
you may go.

155
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,640
- Your Majesty is wise.
- Your Majesty is wise.

156
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,120
Wen Su.

157
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,200
Wen Su?

158
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,000
Why call me by my full name?

159
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,320
Are you really going to resign?

160
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,320
It's all my fault.

161
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,120
I insisted on leaving you,

162
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,280
thinking it was for the best.

163
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,240
Now I understand

164
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,880
the defamed are not in the wrong.

165
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,760
If they behave properly,

166
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,120
they shouldn't mind those words.

167
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,960
If I may ask you again,

168
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,600
do you trust me?

169
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,840
Of course.

170
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,400
I just don't trust myself.

171
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,400
I made you wait for five years

172
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,720
and lose your job.

173
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,840
I never blamed you.

174
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,560
Not before.

175
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,840
Not ever.

176
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,160
I'm just afraid to let you down.

177
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,960
Since I am still here,

178
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,480
be it a day

179
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:17,680
or a lifetime,

180
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,920
I will wait for you.

181
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,560
Then

182
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,960
do you still remember

183
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,160
what I said in that cave?

184
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,400
What did you say?

185
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,200
Ms. Chen.

186
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,200
Ms. Chen.

187
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,520
What's wrong?

188
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,400
Mr. Wen returned drunk

189
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,440
and wanted a bath.

190
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,480
He usually bathes alone,

191
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,080
but it's been an hour.

192
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,240
I called several times,

193
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,120
but he didn't answer.

194
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,800
I'm afraid he was drugged

195
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,120
rather than drunk.

196
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,960
He kept saying he's dizzy
and wouldn't come out.

197
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,400
But he did ask for you.

198
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,760
Me?

199
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,680
Did his injury flare up?

200
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,520
Not sure.

201
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,440
Please go check on him.

202
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:45,880
Alright.

203
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,240
Su?

204
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,000
Su.

205
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,400
What's wrong?

206
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,320
Baoyin.

207
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I feel awful.

208
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,240
Su.

209
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,160
Someone drugged me.

210
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,920
Stay away.

211
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,760
I can't hold it much longer.

212
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,440
Just go.

213
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:25,960
Go.

214
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:27,720
But who

215
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,640
would it be?

216
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,640
Is it because what you said...

217
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,400
(The aphrodisiac.)

218
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,120
(Whoever drugged him is really vicious.)

219
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,640
(They know well
what he cares about most,)

220
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,160
(yet still mean to destroy him.)

221
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,040
(If he loses his composure in public,)

222
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,760
(from what I know of him,)

223
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,920
(he might kill himself.)

224
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,360
(Forget it.)

225
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58,160
(It's not like
we haven't kissed before.)

Morning, Baoyin.

236
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,800
Auntie.

237
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,400
It's all my fault.

238
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,560
I got drunk

239
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:02,600
and we...

240
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,160
I lost my mind.

241
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,600
Five years ago,

242
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,800
I was a man

243
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,600
who lived in constant fear

244
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,720
and suffered humiliation.

245
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,440
Even when I hated myself,

246
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,280
you were the only one to trust me

247
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:19,480
love me, wait for me, and protect me.

248
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:23,360
You always kept a clearer

249
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,840
and more rational mind.

250
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,760
These five years,

251
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,640
the strength you once gave me
has steered me

252
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,400
through all those hardships.

253
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,400
Right now, I want nothing

254
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,120
more than you by my side.

255
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,200
But it should've been different.

256
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,360
If you change your identity

257
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,280
and retake the imperial exam,

258
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,320
that should be acceptable, right?

259
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,800
I feel so bad

260
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,480
that you can't

261
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,600
exert your talents.

262
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,080
Well, that's not the case.

263
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:13,960
You once said

264
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:15,960
as time passes,

265
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,160
the full moon

266
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:18,680
wanes.

267
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,080
Nothing in this world

268
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,440
is perfect.

269
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,440
But imperfection is good enough.

270
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,960
That's why we must

271
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,600
cherish the present while we live.

272
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,800
Little happiness

273
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,160
might just be enough for us.

274
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,840
I'd rather live a plain and simple life

275
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,080
with you.

276
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,040

278
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,360
(but trust,)

279
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,080
