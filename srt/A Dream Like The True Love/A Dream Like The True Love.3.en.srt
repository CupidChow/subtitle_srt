=A Dream Like The True Love=

2
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:16,896
=Episode 3=

3
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,080
(Su Mansion)
Yuniang is my elder sister.

4
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:21,400
Go away!

5
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,320
This is Miss Wen Qiongniang.

6
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:24,840
Ms. Yuniang is her sister.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,280
I dare you to make a move!

8
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,240
Wen family was raided.

9
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,480
No more Miss Wen.

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,320
Ms. Yuniang is pregnant now.

11
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:31,600
If the fetus is harmed,

12
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:32,992
you'll be in serious trouble!

13
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:33,920
Go away!

14
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:35,240
- Yuniang!
- Go!

15
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,240
I am Qiongniang.

16
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:36,880
Go!

17
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,880
I'll fight you if you dare touch her!

18
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,800
I dare anyone to harm her.

19
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,240
Heaven is watching what people do.

20
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,560
There'll be divine retribution.

21
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,600
Yuniang!

22
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:49,920
I am Qiongniang, Yuniang!

23
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:50,520
Go!

24
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,560
I am Qiongniang.

25
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,840
Don't go.

26
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:55,600
Qiongniang.

27
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,000
Qiongniang.

28
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,720
Tell your master

29
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:00,960
driving dogs into a corner

30
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,440
will surely backfire.

31
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:12,560
Open the door!

32
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,120
Is anyone there?

33
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,160
Open the door!

34
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,880
Is anyone there to help my lady?

35
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,720
(I understand Yuniang just wants
to look after herself.)

36
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,520
(But I can't be ungrateful.)

37
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,080
(The Wen family never treated me
as a servant.)

38
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,480
(Mr. Wen Junior even saved my life.)

39
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,840
(I must protect Qiongniang.)

40
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,120
Thank you for the rescue.

41
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:37,720
Miss,

42
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,168
(Luo Teng)
no need for that.

43
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,160
It was a small effort.

44
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,280
I see you got wet in the rain.

45
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,120
I brewed medicine.

46
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,560
Drink it while it's hot.

47
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,120
Did you encounter any difficulties?

48
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,840
To be honest,

49
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,920
our family encountered a mishap.

50
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,040
We couldn't find our relatives.

51
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,520
Right now,

52
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,160
only we two are left
to rely on each other.

53
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,280
If you really can't find a place to go,

54
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,480
you can stay here for the time being.

55
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,440
This room of mine happens to be empty.

56
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,240
In that case,

57
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,760
just consider me

58
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,560
renting this room from you.

59
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,360
Talk about it later.

60
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,600
We should look out for each other

61
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,480
every day.

62
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,480
It's getting late.

63
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,520
Drink the medicine

64
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,560
and rest early.

65
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,320
Mother.

66
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,600
Qiongniang.

67
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:40,800
Don't be afraid.

68
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,000
I am here.

69
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,800
Baoyin, my sister
doesn't want me anymore.

70
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,160
I want my father.

71
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,120
I want my mother.

72
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,480
Qiongniang, don't cry.
We have a place to stay now.

73
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,080
Everything will get better.

74
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,000
It will all be fine.

75
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,120
It will all be fine.

76
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,360
I don't want to.

77
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,040
I miss my parents.

78
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,840
I miss my elder brother.

79
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,800
I want to go home.

80
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,680
Qiongniang.

81
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,280
Qiongniang, don't cry.

82
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,600
Qiongniang.

83
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,320
Qiongniang.

84
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,640
Qiongniang, look.

85
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,160
Look, what is this?

86
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:27,960
Look.

87
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,680
A person's life

88
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,680
is like this glass ball.

89
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,120
When placed in the dark,

90
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,880
it becomes dull and dark.

91
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,000
No one pays attention.

92
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,680
When placed in a bright place,

93
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,600
it can reflect multicolored radiance.

94
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,200
If there is no light,

95
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,080
we

96
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,480
have to light ourselves up.

97
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,360
We can still shine out light.

98
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,960
Once lit up,

99
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,800
the road will be smoother.

100
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,600
People

101
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,960
must keep moving forward.

102
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,200
Right now, it's a bit tough.

103
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,160
But I promised Mrs. Wen to protect you.

104
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,760
So I won't leave you behind.

105
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,800
I'll stay with you

106
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,040
and treasure you
like the apple of my eye.

107
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,800
My name is Baoyin.

108
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,960
You can be called Baozhu.

109
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,840
I listen to you.

110
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,280
I'm not used to sleeping here.

111
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,440
I didn't bring your personal clothes.

112
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,840
I made a pillow for you
with old clothes.

113
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,120
The buckwheat you're accustomed to.

114
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,480
You go to sleep first.

115
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,480
I'll watch over you here.

116
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,600
Baozhu, hurry and sleep.

117
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,440
There's

118
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,240
no suffering man can't endure.

119
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,760
As long as we are alive,

120
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,800
there will always be hope.

121
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,240
(The Wen family has fallen.)

122
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,320
(I must take good care
of Baozhu to survive.)

123
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,480
(I'm strong.)

124
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,480
(I'm not afraid of hardship.)

125
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,760
(I learned a few characters
during half a year in the Wen family.)

126
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,000
(I also learned accounting.)

127
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,920
(I rented a bamboo raft.)

128
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,880
(On the Bian River,)

129
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,920
(I started a business
selling small dishes.)

130
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,560
(Profit is enough
to keep us fed and clothed.)

131
00:07:26,735 --> 00:07:28,493
(Drunken Shrimp
Orchids and Chrysanthemums)

132
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,960
Today's promotion: holiday benefit.

133
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,200
Buy two, get one dish free.

134
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,120
Spend ten coins, get two coins off.

135
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,720
Don't miss out as you pass by.

136
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,600
Don't miss such a great opportunity.

137
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,120
Spend ten coins, get two off.

138
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:42,880
Come on.

139
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:43,360
Come on.

140
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,400
Hold on tight.

141
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,600
Buy and take it with you.

142
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,840
Don't go home empty-handed.

143
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,200
The Su family moved out
of Bianyang overnight.

144
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,728
The tree falls, the monkeys scatter.

145
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,040
Afraid of being implicated.

146
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,400
But how did I hear

147
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,120
that the Wen family was not executed
for the charges?

148
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,280
They were just imprisoned.

149
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,240
Imprisoned?

150
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,840
Who did you hear this from?

151
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:13,920
Wait a moment.

152
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,200
Excuse me.

153
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,640
Where is the Wen family imprisoned?

154
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,960
Baoyin, I am scared.

155
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:25,760
Sir,

156
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,680
let me out.

157
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,440
Go back.

158
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,360
Behave!

159
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,640
Do you want to eat?

160
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:31,960
Baozhu.

161
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,280
Don't be afraid.

162
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,480
I am here.

163
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,520
Baoyin, I am scared.

164
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,800
Baozhu, don't be afraid.

165
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,400
I am here.

166
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,440
Be quick, just an hour.

167
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:52,920
Qiongniang?

168
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:54,760
Qiongniang.

169
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,000
- Qiongniang.
- Father, Mother.

170
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,240
Mother, Father.

171
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,040
Qiongniang.

172
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,600
Qiongniang.

173
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,000
My Qiongniang.

174
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,560
Qiongniang.

175
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,640
Baoyin.

176
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,320
Baoyin.

177
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,080
Mother.

178
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,560
She is my sister.

179
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,920
I am no longer called Qiongniang.

180
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,480
I am called Baozhu.

181
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,000
Baozhu.

182
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,920
Please forgive me.

183
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,920
I dare not let her use her real name,

184
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,680
in case they come to get her.

185
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,000
I had to let her take on my surname

186
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,760
and give her the first name Baozhu.

187
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:37,880
Get up quickly.

188
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,320
You did nothing wrong.

189
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,440
My Wen family was entirely convicted.

190
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,280
Only Qiongniang was left.

191
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,920
If it weren't for you,

192
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,360
she might not be able
to stand here alive today.

193
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,520
I am too indebted to thank you properly.

194
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,320
What harm is there in being her sister?

195
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,760
If our Wen family

196
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,760
ever rises from disgrace one day,

197
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,800
you will stand as our daughter.

198
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,080
I don't want a noble status.

199
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,040
Back then,

200
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,000
you treated us servants as family.

201
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,920
For me, the Wen family

202
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,520
has given me a new life.

203
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,600
I just want to protect my family.

204
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,520
Just consider it me repaying a favor.

205
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,320
Where is my brother?

206
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,280
Why is he not here?

207
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,120
I heard the soldiers went
to the academy to arrest him.

208
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,440
But I don't know where he is being held.

209
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,480
Poor Su.

210
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,080
I don't even know if he's alive or dead.

211
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,680
Mother, don't be afraid.

212
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,640
Baoyin says

213
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,560
there's no hardship
that can't be endured.

214
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,640
As long as you live well, there is hope.

215
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,880
Our family will eventually reunite.

216
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:01,680
Right.

217
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,560
Hurry up.

218
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,360
Time's up.

219
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,760
Sir, Madam, rest assured.

220
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,840
I will protect Qiongniang.

221
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,480
Hurry up.

222
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:14,680
Baoyin.

223
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,584
- Mother.
- Qiongniang.

224
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,560
Qiongniang.

225
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,920
Qiongniang.

226
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,480
- Qiongniang.
- Father, Mother.

227
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,760
Father, Mother.

228
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,560
Qiongniang.

229
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:26,040
- Qiongniang.
- Father, Mother.

230
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,200
- Qiongniang.
- I won't go!

231
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,000
- Qiongniang.
- Mother.

232
00:11:43,424 --> 00:11:45,952
(Three days later)

233
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,280
Little gadgets.

234
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,200
Get one.

235
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,160
Baoyin, it turns out today
is the Shangsi Festival.

236
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,200
Yes.

237
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,600
The days have become confusing.

238
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,880
Didn't realize today
was the Shangsi Festival.

239
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,840
Baoyin, there are
so many river lanterns here.

240
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,120
Many people are making wishes.

241
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,520
(Hope for my benefactor,)

242
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,200
(Mr. Wen Junior, safety and peace.)

243
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,920
(Wishing for the Wen family to reunite.)

244
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,440
Baoyin, it's so lively over there.

245
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,680
Let's go have a look.

246
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,800
Bravo!

247
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,200
Bravo!

248
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,128
The Eldest Princess's here.

249
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,120
She is the late emperor's
most beloved youngest daughter.

250
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,120
I heard she holds
half of the Tiger Tally

251
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,680
and is in charge of Bianyang.

252
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,720
Even the officials are wary of her.

253
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,320
This pleasure ship is so beautiful.

254
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,280
The Eldest Princess
is accustomed to luxury.

255
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,400
This is the largest pleasure ship
in Bianyang.

256
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,080
I've heard the Eldest Princess's husband

257
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,160
kept a mistress.

258
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,600
She then sent someone

259
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,320
to have him castrated.

260
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,080
No wonder

261
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,400
she kept so many
young and handsome toy boys.

262
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,520
As long as they're men she fancies,

263
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,320
none can escape her grasp.

264
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,160
Baoyin,

265
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,200
who is that man by the princess's side?

266
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,560
It's my brother!
