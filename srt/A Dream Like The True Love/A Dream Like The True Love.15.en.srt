=Episode 15=

3
00:00:26,464 --> 00:00:30,016
(Memorial tablet of Ms. Xu)

4
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:33,360
Mother,

5
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,840
I have failed you.

6
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:38,360
I didn't take good care of you.

7
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,600
I can only hold a late funeral for you.

8
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,000
Mother,

9
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,640
I'm doing well now.

10
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,320
Life is rarely perfect.

11
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,400
Most of the time,

12
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,800
what we get is not what we wish for.

13
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,320
I cannot blame my fate.

14
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,120
In this life,

15
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,400
we are like dandelions,

16
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,160
unable to choose where to take root.

17
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,600
We can only strive to grow.

18
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,720
Let me go.

19
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,680
Let me go!

20
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,920
Let me go!

21
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:38,800
Let me go!

22
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,000
You ungrateful one!

23
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,560
Who allowed you to mourn here?

24
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,080
Now, you are doing this?

25
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,600
Are you cursing me to death?

26
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,200
I...

27
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,400
I'll beat you to death!

28
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,320
Ungrateful one!

29
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,480
Father, don't you remember

30
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,120
the day you sacrificed me?

31
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,480
As long as I live,

32
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,920
you and my brother will exploit me!

33
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,400
Even if I'm married,

34
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,800
as long as I'm not dead,

35
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,240
you'll still get things from me.

36
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,560
That's what you think, right?

37
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:32,360
You...

38
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,240
A father can marry off his daughter!

39
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,040
Who do you think you are?

40
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,320
You are just a girl!

41
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,960
Just a girl!

42
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,680
What's wrong with that?

43
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,200
We girls are people too!

44
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,280
Just because we're girls,

45
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,760
must we endure so much unfair treatment?

46
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,240
It's truly ridiculous.

47
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,840
I will tell others,

48
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,400
from now on,

49
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,080
that won't happen again!

50
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,400
I, Chen Baoyin,

51
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,960
have freed myself from this village.

52
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:14,680
In the future,

53
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,560
I will let everyone know

54
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,160
that we girls can live on our own,

55
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,360
relying on nobody!

56
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,320
Pan'er!

57
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,720
Throw them into the coffin!

58
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:36,600
Pan'er!

59
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,600
Let's talk about this!

60
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,680
Let's talk!

61
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,480
Baoyin,

62
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,360
I'm sorry!

63
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,680
Baoyin!

64
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,960
You are so ungrateful!

65
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,240
If this gets out,

66
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,240
how will others see you?

67
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,080
Baoyin,

68
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,160
I beg you!

69
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,920
Pan'er!

70
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,480
Baoyin!

71
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,080
As the old saying goes,

72
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,080
of all virtues,
filial piety comes first.

73
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,440
However,

74
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,280
my father and brother,

75
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,520
in the name of filial piety,

76
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,040
committed acts of greed and murder!

77
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:13,560
Chen Pan'er,

78
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,240
let me out!

79
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,560
Stay inside for four hours.

80
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,200
Having you accompany my mother

81
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,960
would even disturb her peace.

82
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,760
(True filial piety)

83
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,960
(is breaking the fate of family,)

84
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,800
(and striving to ensure parents' faults)

85
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,920
(and ancestral shortcomings
do not reenact in oneself.)

86
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,200
(The evil of the whole family)

87
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,880
(must stop with my generation)

88
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,760
(and not continue any longer.)

89
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,360
(This)

90
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,400
(is true filial piety.)

91
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,440
Please tell Captain Wei,

92
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,200
I am very grateful.

93
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,440
Captain Wei was once
a student of Master Wen.

94
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,720
Please send greetings to him
on behalf of my master.

95
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,920
You're too kind.

96
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,800
I put some datura in your porridge.

97
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,640
A small amount can calm the mind,

98
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:47,240
and excess causes drowsiness.

99
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,160
The current plan is,

100
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,160
before the Crown Prince returns,

101
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,360
I absolutely cannot leave this place.

102
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,680
When my brother wakes up

103
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,840
and hands over the power to me,

104
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,960
everything can finally settle down.

105
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,320
(Perfect match.)

106
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,360
(How ironic.)

107
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,160
(If I sacrifice myself,)

108
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,280
(and my body is sent home,)

109
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,800
(and if you are still willing)

110
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,680
(to bid me farewell,)

111
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,320
(you will learn my true feelings.)

112
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,240
Your Highness,

113
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,320
this may work,

114
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,760
but he can only stay awake for a moment.

115
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,480
As for what happens next, I...

116
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,840
I told you to do it. Just do it.

117
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,600
I will take the responsibility.

118
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:09,640
Yes.

119
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,160
Your Highness,

120
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,080
this is ginseng soup

121
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,760
specially brewed
by Changle Palace for you.

122
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,080
You've been very busy.

123
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,160
Pay more attention to your health.

124
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,800
Your Highness,

125
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,400
if no accidents,

126
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,440
in less than a quarter,

127
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,960
His Majesty will wake up.

128
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,800
You just wait outside.

129
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,680
Yes.

130
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,400
When he wakes up,

131
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,440
I need to know

132
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,680
about the imperial edict...

133
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,360
(I need to know
where the imperial edict is.)

134
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,200
Did you hear it?

135
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,960
His Majesty is gone.

136
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,360
Is the news reliable?

137
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,680
How come I heard

138
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,520
the Crown Prince
has returned to the capital?

139
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,280
You're all wrong.

140
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,040
What I heard is

141
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,360
the Eldest Princess

142
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:25,080
has secretly murdered His Majesty.

143
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,000
Currently, the capital

144
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,920
is already under her control.

145
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,320
The Eldest Princess?

146
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,560
The one who fancies pretty men?

147
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,960
If she takes power,

148
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,920
it will truly be a misfortune of Daqing!

149
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,800
No.

150
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,600
I heard

151
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:45,000
she has killed all her toy boys.

152
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:47,920
Indeed,

153
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,880
once the people have power,

154
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,840
they're different.

155
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,560
Gentlemen,

156
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,760
can we still freely

157
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,000
enter or leave the capital?

158
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,160
I heard the Eldest Princess
has taken control,

159
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,400
but not the city being closed.

160
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:05,680
But,

161
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,200
do you really have to go?

162
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,000
Maybe,

163
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,680
once the Crown Prince returns,

164
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,240
the two sides will start fighting.

165
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,120
You'll be put yourself in danger.

166
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,560
It may be quite dangerous.

167
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,920
I have decided

168
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,280
to go to the capital.

169
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,904
Don't interfere in matters

170
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,680
of my family anymore in the future.

171
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,960
And my parents

172
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:28,960
will be taken care of.

173
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,520
I must make proper plans

174
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,680
for myself and my parents, right?

175
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,160
Is your family in the capital?

176
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,680
It's very dangerous there.

177
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,320
You'd better

178
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,160
not go there.

179
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:42,920
Right.

180
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,384
There is someone who saved me.

181
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,960
Though dangerous,

182
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,800
I have to go.

183
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
(Mr. Wen Junior,)

184
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,800
(you once saved my life.)

185
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,800
(This time,)

186
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,800
(I will repay you.)

187
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,720
(You and I)

188
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,480
(will then be even.)

189
00:11:16,243 --> 00:11:18,784
(Capital Street)

190
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:26,525
Sir. Take a look!

191
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,440
Make way!

192
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,480
The prison cart!

193
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,200
