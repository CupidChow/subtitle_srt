Your Highness.

00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,720
What a beautiful melody.

5
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,160
Mournful

6
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,000
and lamenting.

00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,680
I'm afraid your mind is elsewhere,

00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,560
dare I say, in Bianyang.

9
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:14,760
Forgive me.

10
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,120
This bracelet...

11
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,280
It's

12
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,360
my gift for my sister's birthday.

13
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,760
It's not about Baoyin.

14
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:25,640
Liar!

00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,920
I may be a fool.

00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,360
But I'm here

17
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,640
to assist you for the greater cause.

18
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,840
I've put those feelings behind me.

19
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,480
You are just like him.

20
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,600
You men are all liars.

21
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,880
Treacherous words

22
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:58,880
come out so readily

23
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,240
that even you believe them yourself.

24
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,000
I'm loyal to you only.

25
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,440
If I lie,

26
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,720
may I end up like the bracelet.

27
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,000
You are the top scholar.

this is the new house I rented.

68
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,200
It's certainly not Wen Mansion,

69
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,120
but please make do for now.

70
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,560
I'll find a better one.

71
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,040

00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,560
Baoyin,

76
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,560
we owe you so much.

77
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,680
How can we repay you?

78
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:13,480
Madam,

79
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,520
please don't do this.

80
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,080
Baoyin,

81
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:20,280
since this is a new beginning,

82
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,280
if you don't mind,

83
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,360
just call us

84
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,200
Father and Mother.

85
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,120
We are one family.

86
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,640
That's right.

87
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,160
Master,

88
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:36,200
I've long seen you as my elders.

89
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,280
How about Uncle and Auntie?

90
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,440
Also a family.

91
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,520
Don't, Baoyin.

92
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,080
Since we are all family now,

93
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,560
there is no need

94
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,880
for such formalities.

95
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,760
Baoyin,

96
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,040
Luo booked us a table
at Qingchun Restaurant.

97
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,080

98
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,200
Father and Mother's return.

99
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,520
You brat.

100
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,080
Always thinking about food.

101
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,400
I wonder how Su is doing now.

102
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,040
Whether he's still alive somewhere.

103
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,280
Fate always blesses him.

104
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,280
No news may be the best news.

105
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,040
He must be somewhere safe.

106
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,160
Everything will be fine.

107
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,360
Right.

108
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,120
We have a new home.

109
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,800
Sooner or later,

110
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,360
he'll come find us.

111
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,120
Mother, I'm starving.

112
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,280
Let's go quickly.

113
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,440
- Okay.
- Come.

114
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,800
Father, Mother,

115
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,600
I missed you so much.

116
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,920
(They finally reunited.)

117
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,400
I'll make you something delicious.

118
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,280
Okay.

119
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,040
(The bride of the River God this year)

120
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,600
(is you.)

121
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,760
No!

122
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,640
Pan'er can't go.

123
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,520
She'll die!

124
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,440
Pan'er!

125
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,840
Pan'er!

126
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,200
Pan'er!

127
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,440
(Mother, what did you wish for?)

128
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,240
I prayed that you will

129
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,600
live a blessed life.

130
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:42,320
(I wonder if my mother
is doing well now.)

131
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,400
Baoyin,

132
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,360
why didn't you go to the restaurant?

133
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,200
I've already eaten.

134
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,720
Master and Madam went home to rest.

135
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,440
Figured I should come take a look.

136
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,760
Thank you for covering for me.

137
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,240
Don't mention it.

138
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,800
It's good that Master Wen

139
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
and his wife are out.

140
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,240
Why are you brooding?

141
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,480
Did they say anything?

142
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:12,840
No.

143
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,680
They have been very good to me.

144
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,600
It's just

145
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,320
I miss my mother.

146
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,640
Oh silly me!

147
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,920
I forgot this.

148
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,320
Madam He asked me before she left

149
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,000
to give you this.

150
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,680
Mother wrote me a letter?

151
00:09:33,354 --> 00:09:36,448
(My dearest daughter)

152
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,040
It's Mr. Lv's handwriting.

153
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,160
It's really her.

154
00:09:46,266 --> 00:09:51,744
(The letter from Mother)

155
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,640
Mother said she is much better now.

156
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,520
It's just

157
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,080
she misses me.

158
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,120
Now that the Wens are out of prison.

159
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,320
That's a big relief.

160
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,160
The shop's business

161
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,600
is booming.

162
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,800
Why not take this opportunity
to go home?

163
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,280
Madam He and I can manage the shop.

164
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,960
I've learned from the best, after all.

165
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,080
(I've saved some money.)

166
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,680
(I can bring Mother over)

167
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,760
(to live a better life.)

168
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,120
Eldest Princess arrives.

169
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,480
You can't barge

170
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,600
into His Majesty's chamber.

171
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,240
Mr. Song,

172
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,040
I respect you as a loyal subject
of my father,

173
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,480
so I'll ask nicely.

174
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,640
But you should know better

175
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,560
than to stop me.

176
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,560
His Majesty has instructions.

177
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,120
No one but the Crown Prince

178
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,720
is allowed to visit.

179
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,160
Does Your Highness

180
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,560
intend to defy His Majesty?

181
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,960
You are holding my brother hostage.

182
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,360
I don't even know how he's doing.

183
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,800
Mr. Song,

184
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,720
you keep saying it is
for the greater good.

185
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,320
Who knows what you're up to.

186
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,960
I insist on cleaning house right now.

187
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,240
Who dares to stop me?

188
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,920
If Your Highness insists,

189
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,280
you will have to kill me!

190
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:19,720
- We would never surrender.
- We would never surrender.

191
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,600
- Never surrender!
- Never surrender!

192
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:34,520
Minister Song!

193
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,480
Minister Song!

194
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,840
- Mr. Song!
- Mr. Song!

195
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,320
Mr. Song!

196
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,520
- Mr. Song!
- Mr. Song!

197
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,200
Mr. Song!

198
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,520
Mr. Song!

199
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,280
Are you okay, Mr. Song?

200
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,360
Mr. Song!

201
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,040
- Mr. Song!
- Mr. Song.

202
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,640
Mr. Song.

203
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:05,800
Mother.

204
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,320
Mother.

205
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,120
You are back.

206
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:20,800
What's this?

207
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,040
Where is Mother?

208
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,160
Mother?

209
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,400
She's long dead.

210
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,160
What?

211
00:13:38,656 --> 00:13:43,200
(Memorial tablet of Ms. Xu)

212
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,800
Mother.

213
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:55,880
Mother.

214
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,800
Mother is dead.

215
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,920
When was this?

216
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,440
Do you think selling yourself

217
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:19,640
can cover her treatment?

218
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,760
It's not even enough for Father and me.

219
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:26,120
That money was to save Mother!

220
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,760
- You were supposed to save her!
- Let go!

221
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:29,440
You...!

222
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:29,840
Get lost!

223
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,160
She was beyond saving!

224
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,840
But the living need food.

225
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,520
Don't you agree?

226
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,920
One more thing,

227
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,000
about what happened last time,

228
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,960
we can't just let it slide.

229
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,960
What do you want?

230
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,680
Brother,

231
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:57,720
I'm here.

232
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,640
It seems you are barely hanging on.

233
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,680
You must not die

234
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,640
before you agree to my rule.

235
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,720
Aren't you

236
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,880
a surprise today?

237
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,920
I never thought you, a mere scholar,

238
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,360
would have such courage

239
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,840
to kill an official.

240
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,960
Our cause depends on this.

241
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,200
I was only doing my job

242
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,440
and clearing obstacles.

243
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:47,760
Well done.

244
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,160
Now

245
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,080
before the Crown Prince returns,

246
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,760
I must not leave this chamber.

247
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,560
When Brother comes to

248
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,000
and abdicates in favor of me,

249
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,400
only then will all come to an end.

250
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,520
Understood.

251
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,840
What do you want?

252
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,000
One should marry

253
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,280
when they come of age.

254
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,720
Your brother has not yet married.

255
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,400
I have already wedded you

256
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,560
to the fool from the village.

257
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:27,680
Tomorrow,

258
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,400
they will come pick you up
for the wedding.

259
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,360
Wedding?

260
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,320
Great.

261
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,640
I was waiting for this.

262
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,520
Tie them both up!

263
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:58,560
You!

264
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,400
What are you doing?

265
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:00,920
You!

266
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:01,320
Let go!

267
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,360
You ingrate!

268
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,160
What am I doing?

269
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,960
You two should join my mother!
