00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:16,600
Help!

2
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:17,720
Help me!

3
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:19,200
Help!

4
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,960
Help, anyone!

5
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:23,280
Help!

6
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:25,640
Quit screaming.

7
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,960
Your man will come save you soon.

8
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,320
Who are you?

9
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,440
Why did you kidnap me?

10
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,200
If it's about money, I have plenty!

11
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,160
I'm already a dead man.

12
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,200
What do I need money for?

13
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,200
But I didn't expect you
to be Wen Su's old flame.

14
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,800
How perfect.

15
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm using you to lure him out.

16
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,880
Then you can die together.

17
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,480
How romantic!

18
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,160
It's you, old miser.

19
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:03,680
Baoyin!

20
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:12,880
Baoyin!

21
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,120
Su!

22
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,640
I'm here! Help me!

23
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:25,320
Feng Gui.

24
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,280
Release her

25
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,520
and turn yourself in.

26
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,240
Maybe you'll die a clean death.

27
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,560
Wen Su,

28
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,600
I'm already a dead man.

29
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,560
But before I die,

30
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,600
I must take you down.

31
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:40,880
Attack!

32
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,760
Help!

33
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,920
Help!

34
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:09,960
Wen Su.

35
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:14,800
Just die with your lover!

36
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:34,960
Baoyin!

37
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,320
Su.

38
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,840
Let go.

39
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,440
If you are gone,

40
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,760
I won't live either.

41
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,200
(I will definitely find a way)

42
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,160
(to repay you for saving me.)

43
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,400
(I am Wen Su,)

44
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:55,840
(Wen Ruchu.)

45
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,960
(Being upright)

46
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,880
(and generous is a kind of character.)

47
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,600
(Under pressure,)

48
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,760
(making choices
is also a kind of character.)

49
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,960
(Since you have already
made your choice,)

50
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,560
(why hurt yourself so?)

51
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,640
(Those who know and love you)

52
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,640
(will never abandon you.)

53
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,960
(Su.)

54
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,040
Su.

55
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,680
See you in the next life.

56
00:05:36,276 --> 00:05:40,640
=A Dream Like The True Love=

57
00:05:41,555 --> 00:05:43,776
=Episode 23=

58
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,320
Baoyin!

59
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,640
Su.

60
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,360
Su...

61
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,440
Wen Su.

62
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,760
Wen Su.

63
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,720
You survived worse.

64
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,160
You can make it again.

65
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,440
You are so full of life

66
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,880
that even Death can't take you.

67
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,240
Wake up.

68
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,800
Please, wake up.

69
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,840
You know me.

70
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,960
I never believe in fate.

71
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,440
Always want to break free

72
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,640
and move forward.

73
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,800
I want to see what lies ahead.

74
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,520
But

75
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,800
I don't want to be alone anymore.

76
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,360
Wake up.

77
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:21,920
Please.

78
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,200
Please wake up, okay?

79
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,600
We can move forward.

80
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,480
Let's see the world together.

81
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:33,800
Okay?

82
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,880
Answer me.

83
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,160
Okay?

84
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,960
Su.

85
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,520
Go home.

86
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,480
Go...

87
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,080
Okay.

88
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,760
Let's go home.

89
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,760
Let's go home.

90
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,480
His Majesty arrives.

91
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,840
Are you not going to look at me?

92
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,680
Greetings,

93
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,360
His Majesty.

94
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,160
You are the one Wen Su can't forget.

95
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,240
I remember you retrieved the edict

96
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,120
and received my reward.

97
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,880
Yes, I did.

98
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,080
I'm glad Your Majesty remembers me.

99
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,120
So, Mr. Wen...

100
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:03,880
Don't worry.

101
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:05,840
He's fine.

102
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,080
The imperial physician
has been with him.

103
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,960
He has got better

104
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,160
while you were unconscious.

105
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,280
Luckily there were branches
to catch you.

106
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:17,480
I don't know how you were able

107
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,480
to drag a severely injured man

108
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,360
to a cave at the bottom of the cliff.

109
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,560
You were lucky

110
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,840
the imperial guards found you.

111
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,840
Or you'd surely be dead.

112
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,360
But even if he lives,

113
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,200
you know what kind of crime
he has committed.

114
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,760
He led the troops without my permission

115
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,040
and broke the curfew,

116
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,480
disregarding me and the law.

117
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,440
Please forgive us.

118
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,400
He did it because of me.

119
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,880
Because he wanted

120
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,080
to save me.

121
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,680
So I shall take the punishment.

122
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,080
Even if

123
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,520
I want you dead,

124
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,920
you'll die for him?

125
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,080
