1
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,960
(The money you send back home)

2
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,040
(is dwindling.)

3
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:31,760
I'm your own brother!

4
00:00:32,064 --> 00:00:33,360
Just some wontons. What's wrong?

5
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:33,840
Get out!

6
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:36,160
Whether you changed your name
or sold yourself,

7
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,840
you're still a Chen!

8
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:38,920
(Just wait!)

9
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,264
Close up if you're tired.

10
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,120
No need to wait for me.

11
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,000
Fine, I'm okay.

12
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,000
I have to do the counting.

13
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,200
Go sit down.

14
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,600
I'll make you a bowl of wontons.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,400
What happened?

16
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,000
Nothing.

17
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,160
Everything is fine.

18
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,360
I know you're tough,

19
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,920
but isn't that just for outsiders?

20
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,960
My brother

21
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,520
came ask for money today.

22
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,160
I drove him away.

23
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,560
They messed with me before.

24
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,080
Now they see I'm doing well
and come for money.

25
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,840
I just can't get over it.

26
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,280
Did he bully you?

27
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,320
I had already driven him away.

28
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,080
If he dares to come again,

29
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,080
just come to me.

30
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:53,880
I know.

31
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,680
I can handle him for now.

32
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,680
It's already late now.

33
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,640
I'll just

34
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,520
leave.

35
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,360
Have a bowl before you go.

36
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,360
I'll go make it now.

37
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:10,920
Very quick.

38
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,440
Mr. Wen Junior,

39
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,520
wontons are ready.

40
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,520
Wake up and have some.

41
00:03:56,768 --> 00:04:00,448
=A Dream Like The True Love=

42
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:03,040
=Episode 10=

43
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,256
Isn't he Mr. Wen Junior?

44
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,240
How did he become
the Eldest Princess's toy boy?

45
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,160
You missed the boat tour
on Shangsi Festival?

46
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,760
(Now I see.)

47
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,960
(My sister's got some serious guts.)

48
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,120
(Going after the Eldest Princess's guy.)

49
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,720
(She's on her own this time.)

50
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,560
Wait outside.

51
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,880
If you can get the court
to agree to peace

52
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,880
and give my people a break,

53
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,000
we'll contribute

54
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,320
100,000 taels of silver

55
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,200
and endless livestock.

56
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,680
Is my Daqing

57
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,960
interested in such meager profits?

58
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,600
(Envoy of the Xirong)
Certainly,

59
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,880
we also know what you desire.

60
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,600
If you decide to seize power,

61
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,760
we will certainly lend full support

62
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,120
to assist you

63
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,320
in ascending the throne.

64
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,400
Why should I trust you?

65
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,760
I've heard you've got spies in Daqing.

66
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,880
If you truly mean business,

67
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,840
deal with this major threat to me first.

68
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,520
Only then can we negotiate.

69
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,400
You mean...

70
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,920
The Crown Prince.

71
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,360
(Terrible.)

72
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:28,920
Thief!

73
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,360
Well.

74
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,440
I knew it was you
who stole the money last time.

75
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,800
So what?

76
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,920
This shop belongs to the Chen family.

77
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,880
As the sole heir in nine generations
of the Chen family,

78
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,320
it's only natural that I get some money.

79
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,280
Ask for money?

80
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,760
I'll break your hand!

81
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:52,200
You...

82
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,560
I'm done being a cash cow

83
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,840
for your Chen family.

84
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:55,880
No money,

85
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,920
but I can give you a good beating.

86
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,720
Don't think I'll stay away

87
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,160
because you ganged up on me.

88
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:06,880
Chen Pan'er,

89
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,800
you know

90
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,320
what you've done.

91
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,760
Cut the crap!

92
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,080
See the authorities now!

93
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:16,640
Yes!

94
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,360
Go!

95
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,320
I am her own brother.

96
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,464
It's family matters.

97
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,320
Chen Pan'er,

98
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,760
I saw you

99
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,400
with the Eldest Princess's toy boy,

100
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,560
right here...

101
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,760
Don't talk nonsense!

102
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:35,720
What?

103
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,360
Ashamed now?

104
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,080
I'll say it again,

105
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,680
and I'll shout it.

106
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,720
I'll let everyone in Bianyang know

107
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,920
about your affair
with the Eldest Princess's

108
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,360
toy boy!

109
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,400
Baoyin,

110
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,600
do you need help?

111
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,240
No need.

112
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,760
I did nothing.

113
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,720
If you dare to spread rumors,

114
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,120
I'll tear your mouth apart.

115
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,560
At that time, don't blame me for

116
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:07,960
turning you in, my brother.

117
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,680
I don't care!

118
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,400
Do it.

119
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,280
Do it.

120
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,560
If you report it,

121
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,400
I'll go tell the Eldest Princess.

122
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,880
I dare you to kill me.

123
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,360
Think about it.

124
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,760
If the Eldest Princess learns

125
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,240
you've been with her toy boy,

126
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,680
how long do you think you'll live?

127
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,240
And your sweetheart?

128
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:31,800
Better

129
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,480
get my money ready.

130
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,200
I'll come for it.

131
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:41,560
Baoyin,

132
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,560
do the authorities handle such matters?

133
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,320
He is your own brother.

134
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,080
(No way.)

135
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,160
(It involves Mr. Wen Junior.)

136
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,160
(I can't hide it from him.)

137
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:06,280
- Fair skin, fine bones, lost in scent.
- Fair skin, fine bones, lost in scent.

138
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:12,960
- Traitorous, rootless and ambitious.
- Traitorous, rootless and ambitious.

139
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:16,000
(The Eldest Princess secretly
met with the foreign envoy.)

140
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,760
Nonsense!

141
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,040
This tabloid has now spread in Bianyang.

142
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,880
Even a little child can recite a few.

143
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,560
No hard evidence,

144
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,160
but the court
will surely talk behind your back.

145
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,360
Meeting with Xirong is confidential.

146
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,240
Who leaked the news?

147
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,200
Report!

148
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:01,760
Your Highness,

149
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,120
urgent news from the capital.

150
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,760
Xirong offers to give up a city
to make peace with us.

151
00:10:06,464 --> 00:10:09,280
His Majesty has let the Crown Prince
to the northern border for negotiations.

152
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,200
What a bunch of shameless hypocrites!

153
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,480
The Crown Prince is getting an easy win.

154
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,240
It seems

155
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,560
Xirong is spreading rumors

156
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,280
to disrupt our Daqing court

157
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,840
and achieve their real goals.

158
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,680
By my order,

159
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,720
anyone in the city spreading rumors

160
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,440
about this in the tabloid

161
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,560
will be arrested!

162
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,160
- Yes.
- Yes.

163
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:51,960
Mr. Wen Junior.

164
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,400
You left the signal with a red silk.

165
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,240
Is it urgent?

166
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,960
My lousy brother

167
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,320
must have learned
about you and the Eldest Princess.

168
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,440
I'm worried he'll go to her
and rat you out.

169
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,360
So I brought you here
to talk this through.

170
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,560
Rat me out?

171
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,320
Does he have any proof?

172
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,680
No.

173
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,120
He just saw you eating wontons with me

174
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,240
and started

175
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,440
talking rubbish.

176
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,640
If the rumor spreads,

177
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,600
the Eldest Princess will be displeased.

178
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,360
It'll hurt you either way.

179
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,440
I don't mind

180
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,440
the rumor.

181
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,584
I'm only afraid it may harm you

182
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,040
and damage your reputation.

183
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,640
In the future, it may...

184
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,040
It may affect your marriage prospects.

185
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,800
I...

186
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,840
I don't want to get married.

187
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,760
The Wen family holds you back.

188
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,640
You're long past the age for marriage.

189
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,480
It's time

190
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,240
you found a good man
to settle down with.

191
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,480
If it's not the person I love,

192
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,760
I'd rather stay unmarried.

193
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,200
Being alone is pretty free and easy.

194
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,760
I don't care

195
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,600
about the rumor.

196
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,120
I'm only afraid it will hold you back.

197
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,000
Shutting him up would be easy.

198
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,640
Just a small effort.

199
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,240
It's just that he's your brother.

200
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:44,960
Don't let that idiot

201
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,680
sully your hands.

202
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,280
This rogue fears nothing.

203
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,440
Fears nothing?

204
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,720
I know the person who can scare him.
