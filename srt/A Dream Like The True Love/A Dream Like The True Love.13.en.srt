1
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:10,800
I'm sorry.

2
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:12,880
It's my fault for making you sad.

3
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:39,760
Luo,

4
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:41,960
I...

5
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:43,600
The fever

6
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,600
muddled my head.

7
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,680
Actually, I knew everything.

8
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,680
I saw what happened

9
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,240
at the restaurant.

10
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:05,560
But don't worry.

11
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:06,920
I won't talk.

12
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,680
I won't tell anyone

13
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,760
about Mr. Wen Junior

14
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,640
and your relationship with him.

15
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,640
I'll pretend

16
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,920
nothing happened today.

17
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,080
You should rest well.

18
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,280
I've got medicine stewing.

19
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,480
I'll go check.

20
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:41,728
=A Dream Like The True Love=

21
00:01:41,728 --> 00:01:44,320
=Episode 13=

22
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,200
You...

23
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,960
Watch it.

24
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,760
You mustn't fall again.

25
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,040
Luo.

26
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,600
Have you

27
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:07,880
learned anything?

28
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,960
I went to Jishi Hall.

29
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,200
Eldest Princess

30
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,400
already asked the physician

31
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,920
to check the prisoners.

32
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,480
Master Wen and his wife are fine now.

33
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,120
It's just the jail is heavily guarded.

34
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,000
No one else can enter.

35
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,000
As long as they are okay.

36
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,680
You said

37
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,440
Eldest Princess sent help?

38
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:39,960
Yes.

39
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,280
Who else in Bianyang

40
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,440
has the authority

41
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,280
besides her?

42
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,360
(Mr. Wen Junior.)

43
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,440
Master is seriously ill in prison.

44
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,840
I naturally know.

45
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,560
Don't interfere in matters

46
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,520
of my family anymore in the future.

47
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,280
Everyone has their fate.

48
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,440
Don't try to change it.

49
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,240
You can't protect everyone.

50
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:07,920
(Right.)

51
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,640
(I am but a commoner.)

52
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,960
(Who am I compared
to the powerful princess?)

53
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,360
Baoyin.

54
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,960
It's Qixi Festival.

55
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,320
How about we hang out a bit?

56
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,480
Luo,

57
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,120
I am grateful

58
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,520
you're willing to keep a secret.

59
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,960
I shouldn't trouble you further.

60
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,760
I don't mind.

61
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,280
I just want to

62
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,080
stay by your side.

63
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,640
I don't want you to be sad.

64
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:58,920
Baoyin,

65
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,680
Su said he'd take us out.

66
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,040
When will he be back?

67
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,040
He's busy today.

68
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,880
He can't make it.

69
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,160
What a liar.

70
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,760
He always goes back on his word.

71
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,440
He doesn't

72
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,840
even come visit you.

73
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:22,600
It's fine.

74
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:28,640
Baozhu,

75
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,080
how about you go out with me?

76
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,880
I'm not going anywhere

77
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,280
without Baoyin.

Didn't His Majesty summon us?

121
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,000
Why are we here?

122
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,520
His Majesty is gravely ill.

123
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,520
As Eldest Princess,

124
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,600
I shall take charge in his stead.

125
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,080
That's why I summoned you.

can't return here at will.

127
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,520
Your regency is against ancestral rules.

128
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,920
No matter who you are.

129
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,400
I have the Tiger Tally bestowed
by the late emperor.

130
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,200
With it, I can command troops

131
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,080
and issue orders to all officials.

132
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,120
Even if my brother were here,

133
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,040
he could do nothing.

134
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,680
How vicious.

135
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,440
You even disregard His Majesty!

136
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,240
How dare you!

137
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,424
(Imperial Censor)
His Majesty is still with us.

138
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,920
If Your Highness executes
his subjects now,

139
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:19,000
it is as good as rebellion.

140
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,000
You!

141
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,800
Do you think I dare not kill you?

142
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,520
Kill any of us,

143
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,320
and you'll be the sinner of Daqing.

144
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,680
Not only can His Majesty punish you,

145
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,080
the people will also condemn you.

146
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,440
Your Highness,

147
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:40,280
have you seen this coming?

148
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,040
Before His Majesty recovers,

149
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,240
I will be in charge of court affairs.

150
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,160
If anyone doubts my authority,

151
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,720
I will show

152
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,840
no mercy.

153
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:15,720
Then

154
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,800
we would rather die

155
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,040
than comply.

156
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,080
Guards.

157
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,120
No one leaves tonight.

158
00:10:30,048 --> 00:10:33,036
(Minister Song)

159
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:50,760
Is Your Highness
trying to kill the loyal?

160
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,360
You.

161
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,000
Aren't you in jail?

162
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,640
Who released you?

163
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,320
Before His Majesty fell ill,

164
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,480
he granted a general amnesty.

165
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,000
I have also been reinstated.

166
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,360
The imperial decree is here.

167
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,240
Minister Song has long served Daqing.

168
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,240
With him here,

169
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,960
Daqing is saved.

170
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,008
Daqing is saved!

171
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:28,737
Great!

172
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,240
I take my leave.

173
00:11:57,056 --> 00:12:00,480
(Seafood Wonton)

174
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,280
Baoyin,

175
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,800
you look quite well today.

176
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,880
It seems you've recovered.

177
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,440
I can't keep staying in bed.

178
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,920
I need to earn money.

179
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,480
You've worked hard these days.

180
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,160
It's the least I should do.

181
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,760
However,

182
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,000
everyone in town is on edge.

183
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,960
We don't get many customers.

184
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,400
It doesn't matter.

185
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,120
People have to live.

186
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,520
To live is to eat.

187
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,680
We'll just do our business as usual.

188
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,280
Baoyin,

189
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:30,920
with you here,

190
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,880
all of us are relieved.

191
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,360
Imperial order!

192
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,560
It's from the capital.

193
