I...

17
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:35,480
As a woman,

18
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,440
you are too reckless.

19
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,760
How dare you secretly follow out to sea.

20
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,720
The sea's a fickle place.

21
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,800
You still dare to go?

22
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,600
If the ship flips,

23
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,000
you'd be toast.

24
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,720
I am back now.

25
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,920
Don't be complacent.

26
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,320
Think it through.

27
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:51,960
If trouble hits,

28
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,200
what would you do?

29
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,520

I mean, you're naturally careless.

33
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,280
Now you're as dark as charcoal.

34
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,320
Who would marry you?

35
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,760
No need for you to worry.

36
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,800
I've got a betrothal.

37
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,520
Once the Wen family is safe,

38
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,760
I'll head back.

39
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,720
A guy is waiting for me.

40
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,800
I just

41
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,040
don't want you
to risk your life for money.

42
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,360
You can tell me

43
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,200
if you need money.

44
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,520
I should be looking out

45
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,760
for you and Baozhu.

46
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,040
Here, take the money.

47
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,120
How did you get this money?

48
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,120
I have my ways.

49
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,040
If it runs short,

50
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,800
I'll get you more.

51
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,760
I can make money on my own.

52
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,040
The money I earned from this voyage

53
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,560
will cover our living expenses.

54
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,080
You'd sooner suffer at sea

55
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,080
than accept my money.

56
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,400
Don't overthink it.

57
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,320
I'm worried you might be broke
at the princess's place.

58
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,160
Look after yourself.

59
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,880
Money's more solid

60
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,960
when I make it myself.

61
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,400
If you want to help,

62
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,920
how about writing words for me?

63
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:39,960
What words?

that the Xirong attacked
our northern border recently.

00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,000
Daqing will fight with the Xirong.

121

What do you think I should do?

122
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,960
I dare not speak rashly.

123
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,000

Each has pros and cons.

127
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,960
It's a matter of whether it benefits

128
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,720
Daqing or serves your own interests.

129
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:38,920
Boss.

00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,480
Mr. Wen Junior,

132
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,200
why are you here?

133
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,320
It's your grand opening.

134
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:57,280
How could I miss your skills
learned in Qingzhou?

135
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,680
It's just late.

136
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,080
Is it closed?

137
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:06,840
No.

138
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,000
Eat as much

139
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,040
as you want.

140
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,600
Did I add the wrong thing?

141
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,640
Well, you tricked me!

142
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,360
It's not a trick.

143
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,400
Your wontons

144
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,320
taste amazing

145
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,640
and remind me of my mother.

146
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,440
I did use some secret recipes
from Mrs. Wen,

147
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,920
along with

148
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,080
some seafood ingredients.

149
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,400
Of course it has
the Wen family's flavor.

150
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,400
You're so clever.

151
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:36,960
No matter where you go,

152
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,800
you always have smart ideas

153
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,920
and eager to learn.

154
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,080
Your future's looking bright.

155
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,040
I have the Wen family to thank for that.

156
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,120
I saw a lot,

157
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,320
learned a lot,

158
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,480
and understood a lot.

159
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,440
Otherwise,

160
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,160
I'd still be the old Chen Pan'er,

161
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,560
and I don't think I can keep on.

162
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,480
If you like it, eat more.

163
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:14,800
No matter when,

164
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,680
I'll save you a bowl.

165
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:27,960
Delicious.

166
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,760
Baoyin!

167
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:45,480
Baoyin!

168
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,640
Do you know Chen Pan'er?

169
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,760
Who is looking for her?

170
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,440
There's a freeloader.

171
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,560
Just not paying.

172
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,760
He's insisting on seeing Chen Pan'er.

173
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,880
Where am I supposed to find her?

174
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,480
What should I do, Baoyin?

175
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,080
Don't worry.

176
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,240
I'll go check.

177
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,000
Sister, you are the Boss!

178
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,320
Why are you here?

179
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,600
Trouble at home?

180
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,520
Nothing.

181
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:41,680
Everything is fine.

182
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,440
It's just

183
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,040
that the money you send back home

184
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,600
is dwindling.

185
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,000
I heard you opened
a huge shop in Bianyang,

186
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,400
so I came to take a look.

187
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,560
Since everything is okay,

188
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,000
eat up and leave.

189
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,640
I won't ask for the money.

190
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,640
I'm your own brother!

191
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,480
Just some wontons. What's wrong?

192
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,920
You've got enough to open a big shop,

193
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,640
but you can't spare more for the family?

194
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,000
Ask for money?

195
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,480
I'll crack your head open!

196
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:12,560
Get out!

197
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,480
Get out now!

198
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,360
- Get out!
- Get out!

199
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,480
Get out!

200
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,720
Baoyin, call the authorities?

201
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,480
I'll do it if you don't leave.

202
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,880
Anyone can be my brother?

203
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,080
It's up to me!

204
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,160
Alright!

205
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,280
You have money and you don't care
about us poor relatives.

206
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,440
You can open a shop,

207
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,080
but you can't give a little
to your own family who can't eat.

208
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,480
Your sister is dead.

209
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,760
I'm Chen Baoyin.

210
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:35,760
Not Chen Pan'er.

211
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,600
Keep your distance!

212
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,200
Get out!

213
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,760
Get out!

214
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,120
Chase me away?

215
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,640
No way!

216
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:44,960
You just wait!

217
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,360
Whether you changed your name
or sold yourself,

218
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,720
you're still a Chen!

219
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,560
Just wait!

220
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,240
You...

221
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,680
Baoyin,

222
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,880
