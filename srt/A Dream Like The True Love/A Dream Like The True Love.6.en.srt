00:00:14,816 --> 00:00:17,312
=Episode 6=

3
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,200
Do you find me dirty?

4
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,400
No, no.

5
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,600
What no?

6
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,680
It's okay.

7
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,440
I don't know why,

8
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,240
but this sleep was so deep.

9
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,480
Was it

10
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,400
because of drinking wine?

11
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,080
I put datura flower

12
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,240
in your porridge.

13
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,880
They're roadside flowers.

14
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,640
A small amount can calm the mind.

15
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,880
But excessive amount

16
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,400
can cause deep sleep.

17
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,600
Last night,

18
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:38,960
you had a nightmare?

19
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,360
Last...

20
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,360
Let's forget

21
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,400
about last night.

22
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,720
Baoyin...

23
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,280
Baozhu.

24
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,200
You are...?

25
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,560
You are...?

26
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,520
Brother!

27
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,000
So you are their brother.

28
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,040
Yes, our big brother.

29
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,120
Su,

30
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,920
this is my neighbor, Luo.

31
00:03:27,296 --> 00:03:28,680
He works in a restaurant kitchen.

32
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,840
He delivers to me too.

33
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,480
He's nice.

34
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,760
It's what I should do.

35
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,840
Didn't you say the croaker sold well?

36
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,080
Here's more.

37
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,880
They're hard to find now.

38
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,120
I just mentioned it casually.

39
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,360
Thank you.

40
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,120
And the snacks for Baozhu.

41
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:44,640
Here.

42
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:45,960
Have you eaten?

43
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:46,840
Come have some.

44
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,640
I'll get the money.

45
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,160
Okay.

46
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:51,360
Su,

47
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,240
don't go.

48
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,840
Su, what brought you here?

49
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,160
Weren't you...?

50
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:57,880
I came for

51
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,000
the festival.

52
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:01,840
Su...

53
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,360
Baozhu,

54
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,640
try some of this.

55
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,000
Baoyin should've

56
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,440
told me you were coming.

57
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,400
So I'd

58
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,360
have bought some

59
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,400
nice food

60
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,760
to treat you.

61
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,000
Are you two

62
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,040
close?

63
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,760
Of course!

64
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:21,600
Look.

65
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,400
Baoyin even sewed this for me.

66
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,520
She's so nice.

67
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,000
All the neighbors...

68
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,120
Luo.

69
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,000
Do you still have to go to work?

70
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,160
No rush.

71
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,520
Su...

72
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,480
You two chat.

73
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,240
I'll go.

74
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:39,960
I'll...

75
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,320
No.

76
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,240
Su!

77
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,560
Take care, Su.

78
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,160
Really handsome.

79
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,160
Baozhu's handwriting

80
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,280
is elegant

81
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,640
with a good structure

82
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,400
and has improved a lot.

83
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,280
When completed,
this piece can serve as a model

84
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,560
to be circulated.

85
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,280
Class dismissed.

86
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,160
Go home.

87
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,360
What?

88
00:05:59,120 --> 00:05:59,800
Give it back!

89
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:01,880
Give it back!

90
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,440
Just this?

91
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,200
Is it really not well written?

92
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,400
Give it back!

93
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,080
Give me!

94
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:07,800
No.

95
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,840
Didn't the teacher say

96
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,080
it would be circulated?

97
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:12,840
Let me.

98
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:13,760
Give it back!

99
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,440
- Let me have a look!
- Let me have a look!

100
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,280
- Let me!
- Give it back!

101
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:37,760
Here.

102
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,400
Take care.

103
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,040
Baoyin,

104
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,200
bad news!

105
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:43,960
What's wrong?

106
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,400
(Madam He)
Baozhu got into trouble at school.

107
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,360
Apologize to Lord Shen and Lady Shen.

108
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,080
Not my fault.

109
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,200
She pushed me.

110
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,520
Why can't I push back?

111
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,880
If I didn't,

112
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,640
they'd think I'm too scared.

113
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,200
They will definitely bully me even more.

114
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,440
I want them to know

115
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,760
that I am not someone to be bullied!

116
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,920
Quite sharp-tongued.

117
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,640
Mister, is this
how your student behaves?

118
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,200
Admit your mistake!

119
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,200
Why?

120
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,440
They hit me.

121
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,640
I fought back!

122
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,720
I'm not wrong.

123
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,440
Nonsense.

124
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,280
Who said so?

125
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:21,640
I did.

126
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,200
Baoyin!

127
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,160
Lord Shen,

128
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:31,760
I'm her sister.

129
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:35,120
Her attending school is never easy.

130
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,600
How could we

131
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,440
cause trouble?

132
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,320
Your little sister

133
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,800
is not only domineering,

134
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,800
but also scared my girl like this.

135
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:44,840
Tell me,

136
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,200
who is to blame?

137
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,600
Of course, your daughter.

138
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,520
Was she afraid of Baozhu,

139
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,920
how could she be so rude?

140
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,200
That's unreasonable.

141
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,880
As the magistrate,

142
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,040
can't you tell right from wrong?

143
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,920
The government founded the girls' school

144
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,440
for all girls.

145
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,280
It aims to expand girls' minds,

146
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,480
make them smart

147
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,480
and help them form good connections.

148
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,160
By acting like this,

149
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,720
are you against this goal,

150
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,200
and even the government?

151
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,240
Does the Prefect

152
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:16,960
know about this?

153
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,000
You...

154
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:21,920
Never mind.

155
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,560
I am the Magistrate

156
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,440
and won't argue with street thugs.

157
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,200
You all,

158
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,640
behave yourselves.

159
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,040
Don't go.

160
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,800
Your daughter should
apologize to my sister.

161
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,280
Let there be forgiveness.

162
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,320
He's let you go.

163
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,920
With no power or influence,

164
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,920
you should know when to stop.

165
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:50,920
Baozhu,

166
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:51,880
are you fine?

167
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,400
If only Father and Mother were here,

168
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,120
how would I suffer such grievances?

169
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,840
My father was a Registrar.

170
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,800
You did nothing wrong.

171
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,960
We may have no power,

172
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,160
but we won't be bullied.

173
00:09:07,744 --> 00:09:09,520
Neither causing trouble
nor fearing trouble.

174
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,760
I taught you so.

175
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,000
You did it well.

176
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,040
Lady,

177
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,600
Headmaster wants to meet you.

178
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,440
There's a carriage for you.

179
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,440
Come with me.

180
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,280
The Headmaster?

181
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,400
Meet me?

182
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,160
Please change your clothes.

183
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,000
To meet Headmaster,

184
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,320
I have to get changed?

185
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,680
Please just do it.

186
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,280
Don't keep him waiting.

187
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,280
Headmaster,

188
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,080
