=Episode 11=

3
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:20,960
Previously, it was my fault.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,040
I apologize to you.

5
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:24,040
Order anything you want to have today.

6
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:25,240
I will treat you.

7
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,160
You are scheming and plotting.

8
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:29,960
You are not that kind, right?

9
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,800
The matter between Wen Su and me.

10
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,280
Name your price.

11
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:38,440
If you don't tell anyone,

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,280
I will accept it.

13
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:44,560
You've figured it out.

14
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:07,960
Your Highness, forgive me.

15
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,400
I'll request another one.

16
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,200
Actually, my shop

17
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,800
was funded by Mr. Wen Junior.

18
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,800
I am just a servant of the Wen family.

19
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,120
How can I afford such a great shop?

20
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,400
Let me tell you.

21
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,320
This is all because Mr. Wen Junior
is favored by Eldest Princess.

22
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,920
He received many rewards.

23
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,520
In the future, we still have to rely on
Eldest Princess to get rich.

24
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,000
You must not ruin our good fortune.

25
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:54,480
(Being with Eldest Princess
can make us so rich.)

26
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,080
Mr. Wen Junior.

27
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,200
What's going on?

28
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,000
You're turning your back on us?

29
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,440
Aren't you close with my sister?

30
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,160
Watch your mouth.

31
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,040
What sister?

32
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,360
I don't know her.

33
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,200
Mr. Wen Junior.

34
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,240
You...

35
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,040
You're ungrateful.

36
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,000
Exactly.

37
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,200
Keep it down.

38
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,760
Eldest Princess is upstairs.

39
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,680
What?

40
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,320
I suppose

41
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,640
you are Baoyin's brother.

42
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,320
Sir.

43
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,960
Do you think I have a chance?

44
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,440
What chance?

45
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,120
Serving Eldest Princess.

46
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,480
I heard that she prefers
male companions.

47
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,880
I am

48
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,200
still unmarried.

49
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,240
Isn't this perfect?

50
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,320
Are you crazy?

51
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,440
Can anyone serve Eldest Princess?

52
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,360
If you displease her,

53
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,760
you are going to be beheaded.

54
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,720
Your lover can take care of her

55
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,480
and he hasn't been beheaded.

56
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,880
I'm far better than him.

57
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,800
I'll leave.

58
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,600
Sir.

59
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,640
Please, just teach me.

60
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,960
I will surely reward you heavily
once it is done.

61
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:17,600
Stop it.

62
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,840
Just teach me.

63
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,280
You lead me to get wealthy.

64
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,720
I will surely be quite grateful to you.

65
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,080
Stop it.

66
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,640
The scandal between you and my sister.

67
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,520
I...

68
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,440
I will definitely not tell anyone.

69
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:36,960
Get up first.

70
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,600
Get up first.

71
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:41,920
Sir.

72
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:42,920
I will teach you.

73
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,520
How dare you!

74
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,520
Your Highness, spare me.

75
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,120
I am only

76
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,320
attracted by your beauty.

77
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,120
Guards!

78
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,360
Who are you?

79
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,320
Spare me.

80
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:52,880
Your Highness.

81
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,480
Spare me.

82
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,240
I am only admiring you.

83
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,520
Hearing your achievements,

84
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,160
I can't eat or drink anything.

85
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,400
That's why I can't help it.

86
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,760
What have you heard?

87
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,160
I am illiterate.

88
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,920
The people said

89
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,880
Your Highness is living Empress Wu.

90
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,160
Even the people of Xirong
have to respect you.

91
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,840
Even more formidable

92
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,000
than the Queen Mother of the West.

93
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,880
Impudent!

94
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,600
Remove his tongue.

95
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,360
Your Highness.

96
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,560
Your Highness.

97
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,360
There are many commoners here.

98
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,200
Seeing blood might be improper.

99
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,360
If you want to silence the public,

100
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,880
you shall establish authority publicly.

101
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,400
Drag him out.

102
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,280
Give him thirty lashes.

103
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,120
I want to see
who dares to gossip in the future.

104
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,240
Your Highness, spare me!

105
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:02,800
Your Highness.

106
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,360
I will never dare again.

107
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:04,960
Your Highness.

108
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,800
Your Highness, spare me!

109
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,760
Why only hit me,

110
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,840
instead of you?

111
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,720
You still want to serve her?

112
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,520
You shameless couple

113
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,040
actually plotted to frame me.

114
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,880
I am going to report to Eldest Princess.

115
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,560
Go ahead and report.

116
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,520
It will be deemed
as spiteful retaliation.

117
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,200
Who'd believe you?

118
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,360
You...

119
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,880
If you weren't her brother,

120
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,320
I would have lots of ways

121
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,400
to keep your mouth shut forever.

122
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,560
Crab wontons with extra ingredients.

123
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,440
Thank you.

124
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,840
Then I'll have them.

125
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,080
I sent my unlucky brother back

126
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,640
by ox cart today.

127
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,400
He won't dare to come back again.

128
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,120
I must thank you.

129
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,720
I hope he can learn a lesson.

130
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,600
If he dares to come again,

131
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,000
just come to me.

132
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,320
Is there something on my face?

133
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,480
Unexpectedly,

134
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,080
as you read a lot of books,

135
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,440
you are both knowledgeable

136
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,600
and cunning.

137
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,000
Didn't I do this for you?

138
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,440
It will be the Qixi Festival soon.

139
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,640
Baozhu wants to release sky lanterns.

140
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,280
If...

141
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,920
If you can come too,

142
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,880
we will enjoy the festival more.

143
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,120
Alright.

144
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,280
I will pick you up then.

145
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,480
You can come?

146
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:02,600
Eldest Princess...

147
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,000
I will find a way.

148
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:13,840
Baoyin.

149
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
You are so kind to my family.

150
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,920
What I have done is truly insignificant.

151
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,240
No matter what happens,

152
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,720
I always hope

153
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,080
you can be honest with me.

154
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,840
I serve your family

155
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,240
not just to repay kindness.

156
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,360
I have been grateful to your family.

157
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,400
When I left Chen Village,

158
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,560
I made up my mind

159
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,440
to become the one who relies on myself,

160
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,160
and protects everyone who likes me

161
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,800
and is good to me.

162
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,000
I hope

163
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,120
if anything happens

164
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,840
in the future, we can face it together.

165
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,160
Okay.

166
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,880
I promise you.

167
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,240
Then every evening, I will

168
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,960
come to have wontons.

169
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,720
It seems I have to develop more flavors

170
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,040
for you.

171
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,040
Her Highness's fox fur
has been prepared.

172
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,480
Please check it out.

173
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,240
You want to check out the jewelry?

174
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:40,960
In Qixi Festival,

175
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,960
I'd like to gift it.

176
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,880
My shop has lots of stuff.

177
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:48,040
The earrings mean
fulfilling one's desire.

178
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,000
The hairpin symbolizes one in a million.

179
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:56,520
How about this?

180
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,640
You have a good taste.

181
00:10:59,120 --> 00:10:59,960
As the saying goes,

182
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,360
the closest ties

183
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,120
are made when wrists meet.

184
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,360
The silver bracelet

185
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,000
just signifies completeness

186
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,960
and perfect match.

187
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,640
This is the one.

188
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,720
I want to engrave

189
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,760
"Bao" on it.

190
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,480
(His Majesty is gravely ill.)

191
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,120
(I have returned quickly.)

192
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,080
(Closely monitor Eldest Princess.)

193
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,520
