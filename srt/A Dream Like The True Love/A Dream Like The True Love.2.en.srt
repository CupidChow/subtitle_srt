00:00:10,944 --> 00:00:14,624
=A Dream Like The True Love=

2
00:00:14,624 --> 00:00:17,216
=Episode 2=

3
00:00:19,922 --> 00:00:21,680
(Wen Mansion, Bianyang)

4
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,720
(I was sold to the Wen family
in the west of the city.)

5
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,800
(I hear the head
of the family is a minor official.)

6
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,640
(Although the pay
for servants isn't much,)

7
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,840
(at least I earn it on my own.)

8
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,160
(Nobody takes it away.)

9
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,000
Since you're sold to the Wen family,

10
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,560
you should work hard.

11
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,000
Mr. Wen

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,320
is the registrar of Bianyang Prefecture.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:45,720
Now,

14
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:48,000
Mr. Wen Junior is studying
at Xishan Academy.

15
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:51,320
The eldest daughter Yuniang has married
into the Su family.

16
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,920
You will serve Qiongniang,
the second daughter.

17
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,960
Later, I'll take you to see the master.

18
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,120
Is that all clear?

19
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:00,440
Yes.

20
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,160
Look.

21
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:03,840
Look at that.

22
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:05,680
Master, Madam,

23
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,960
this is a newly hired maidservant
to serve Qiongniang.

24
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:09,920
Her name is Chen Baoyin.

25
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,296
Mother.

26
00:01:15,392 --> 00:01:17,040
(Qiongniang)
This sister looks so pretty.

27
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,640
Can she live with me?

28
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,480
This kid.

29
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,680
Miss.

30
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,480
I am just a maidservant,

31
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,120
not your sister.

32
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,160
(Mrs. Wen, Mr. Wen)
That's alright.

33
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,200
Qiongniang is used to having a sister.

34
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,720
Yuniang has married off.

35
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:32,720
She likes you,

36
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,080
so let her call you sister.

37
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,480
Come on.

38
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,720
It's Mid-Autumn Festival feast.
No formalities.

39
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:43,720
Sit with us.

40
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,360
Yes, Madam.

41
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,160
Come and sit.

42
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,680
(Can maidservants join the table?)

43
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,720
Sister, you sit here.

44
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:52,920
My father said

45
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,520
those who come are meant to be here.

46
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,840
We must cherish and treat them well.

47
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,760
Father, Mother.

48
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,640
Su.

49
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,080
I'm back.

50
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,560
Su, you're back.

51
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,760
Let me see.

52
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,920
Why have you lost weight?

53
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,440
You didn't eat well?

54
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,280
No.

55
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,000
I've been obedient.

56
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,120
(It's him.)

57
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,360
Su,

58
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,280
this is my new elder sister.

59
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,360
Her name is Baoyin.

60
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,320
Greetings, Mr. Wen Junior.

61
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,160
I am Wen Su.

62
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,840
Also known as Wen Ruchu.

63
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,000
(I didn't expect
that we would meet again.)

64
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,840
(It must be fate
that keeps me faithful to my promise)

65
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,320
(to repay him.)

66
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,040
Take a seat.

67
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,360
On the Mid-Autumn Festival,
Su has returned.

68
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,880
We're finally reunited.

69
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,000
Today, let's drink together.

70
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:10,720
Come on.

71
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,440
Let's drink.

72
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,680
Master, Madam,

73
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,320
there's trouble.

74
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,120
The Eldest Princess
invites Mr. Wen Junior over

75
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,320
for a drink in her mansion
in the evening.

76
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,360
Well...

77
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,560
You deal with it first.

78
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,360
Yes.

79
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,480
The Eldest Princess
likes good-looking men.

80
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,720
As soon as Su is back,

81
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,880
she wants to see him.

82
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,040
I'm afraid

83
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,440
she has long liked Su.

84
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,360
Right now,

85
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,240
Su should leave for a while
to avoid her.

86
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,240
No, I can't.

87
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,600
If I leave, it'll implicate you.

88
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,680
If you don't leave,

89
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,680
do you want me to exchange you
for our family's safety?

90
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,840
If I do so, it will be disgraceful.

91
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,280
Right now,

92
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,320
we have no choice.

93
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,480
You'll take the imperial exam next year.

94
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,160
If the Eldest Princess likes you

95
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,480
and forcibly takes you,
your future will be ruined.

96
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,440
You will suffer a lot

97
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,760
in the future.

98
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,320
Su, you must leave quickly.

99
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,280
Anyway, we have your back.

100
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:11,560
Right.

101
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,160
You leave.

102
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,160
Come on.

103
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:13,600
Hurry up.

104
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,360
I can't leave.

105
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,720
Hurry up.

106
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,880
Master, Madam,

107
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,440
have you heard of

108
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,320
the spring plague?

109
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,120
Spring plague?

110
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,160
It develops

111
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,000
and spreads rapidly.

112
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,360
Red rashes are all over the body.

113
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,640
Some may have a fever.

114
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,560
Back then, almost all people
in my village were infected.

115
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,280
Can this be faked?

116
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:35,800
I have a way.

117
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,320
I can help you deceive them

118
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,000
on the surface.

119
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,400
Okay.

120
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,280
I'll do it.

121
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,880
I'm counting on you, Baoyin.

122
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,640
If we can get through this,

123
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,160
you will be the savior of my family.

124
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,440
I am flattered, Madam.

125
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,160
I'll boil some water.

126
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,800
The spring plague
should make your body hot.

127
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,720
Mr. Wen Junior, please get changed.

128
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,280
Mr. Wen Junior.

129
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,280
Come in.

130
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,880
Let's start.

131
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,240
(You saved my life.)

132
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,480
(I will repay you in my own way.)

133
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,360
(I can make my own decisions.)

134
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,240
(They all want me dead.)

135
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,960
(Yet, I must find a way to survive.)

136
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,600
Shall my face have red rashes too?

137
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,080
Yes.

138
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,600
The facial rashes
are the most conspicuous.

139
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,200
Don't be afraid.

140
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,920
Has your wound healed?

141
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,520
I've already dressed it in the clinic.

142
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,480
It's not serious.

143
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,960
I sent people to look for you.

144
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,480
I didn't know you changed your name.

145
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,280
Mr. Wen Junior is back.

146
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,680
Did you find the person I asked you to?

147
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,720
I asked those middlemen

148
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,960
all over the market,

149
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,840
but they didn't know a girl
named Chen Pan'er.

150
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,160
(Didn't she come to Bianyang?)

151
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,800
Why did you

152
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,320
sell yourself?

153
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,728
My mother didn't have money
for treatment.

154
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,240
I am just a worthless person.

155
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,328
I can be deemed dead
with those girls at the yamen.

156
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:57,840
Selling myself

157
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,080
can let my mother live a few more years.

158
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,840
I didn't expect

159
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,880
to meet you again.

160
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,640
Alright.

161
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:30,640
It's done.

162
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,520
Sir, be careful.

163
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,560
The air in this room

164
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,920
must not be inhaled at all.

165
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,328
(Attendant to the Eldest Princess)
The spring plague is severe.

166
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:12,480
Sir.

167
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,040
In this case...

168
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,160
I'll go back and report
to the Eldest Princess.

169
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,280
You take good care of Mr. Wen Junior.

170
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,320
See you, sir.

171
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,040
See you, sir.

172
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,720
Father, Mother,

173
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,680
I'm leaving.

174
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,160
Su.

175
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,960
Take good care of yourself.

176
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,800
Father, Mother,

177
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,080
wait for me to return.

178
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,840
I will succeed in Imperial Exam.

179
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,280
Good.

180
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,240
Good.

181
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:47,920
You may go.

182
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,200
I'm leaving.

183
00:10:22,304 --> 00:10:26,784
(Su)

184
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:32,319
(Five Months Later)

185
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,600
Good news!

186
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:39,800
Mr. Wen Junior
has become the top scholar.

187
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,240
Mr. Wen Junior is back?

188
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,040
Where is he?

189
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,240
Perhaps too many people
are watching him.

190
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,040
It delayed him.

191

197
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,680
Where is Su?

Mr. Wen has gone to see him.

199
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:06,000

Thank you.

204
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,960
Today is a great day.

205
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,720
I will grant you a day off.

206
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:16,960
- Thank you.

207
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:17,800
You may go.

208
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,160
Greetings, Captain.

209
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,440
What brings you here?

210
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,440
The whole Wen family,

211
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,600
except for married daughters
and those under 15,

212
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,760
is all implicated and imprisoned.

213
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,720
Confiscate property as well.

214
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,520
Captain.

215
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,680
Why is this?

216
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,600
I have been diligent all my life.

217
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,000
For Bianyang Prefecture,
I have never committed any crime.

218
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,904
Minister Song offended His Majesty

219
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,240
and got punished for his words.

220
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,080
You've corresponded with him for years.

221
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,400
You may be his accomplice.

222
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,880
Mr. Wen.

223
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,280
It's His Majesty's order.

224
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,520
I am just following it.

225
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,000
You'll have to excuse me.

226
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,000
Proceed!

227
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,120
Madam, hurry.

228
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,480
Wait.

229
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,320
Sir, I'm wronged.

230
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,120
It's a misunderstanding.

231
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,360
It's a misunderstanding.

232
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,000
Madam.

233
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,920
Take your money and indentures

234
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,080
and leave.

235
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,640
Don't get implicated.

236
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:46,720
Leave!

237
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,400
We won't leave.

238
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,440
You take them away.

239
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,680
Let's go right away.

240
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,160
Madam.

241
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:50,960
Madam, take care.

242
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:52,720
Baoyin.

243
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,040
Why haven't you left yet?

244
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,440
Madam.

245
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,720
What about Qiongniang?

246
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,000
I can take care of her.

247
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,440
Good girl.

248
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,000
Qiongniang is lucky to have you.

249
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,040
I still have some money left.

250
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:09,800
You take it.

251
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:10,880
Take Qiongniang

252
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,720
to Su Mansion to find her sister.

253
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,640
Mother, I don't want to leave.

254
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,240
I don't want to leave you.

255
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,280
I want to be with you and father.

256
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,440
Be good.

257
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,360
You still have many days to live.

258
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,160
Mother.

259
00:13:24,576 --> 00:13:25,520
Take care of yourself.

260
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,000
You must survive

261
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,240
and live well.

262
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,240
Leave quickly!

263
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:32,800
Take her away.

264
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,120
Madam, don't worry.

265
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,400
I will send her there.

266
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,280
I will protect her with my life.

267
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:39,440
Leave!

268
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,240
Mother, I'm not leaving.

269
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,920
Let me stay.

270
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,440
I don't want to leave.

271
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,200
Qiongniang.

272
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,120
I'm not leaving.

273
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,440
Qiongniang, let's go quickly.

274
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,560
Hurry up.

275
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:57,720
Come on.

276
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,080
I don't want to leave.

277
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,000
Go!

278
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,480
Let go of me.

279
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,160
I want to stay with my mother.

280
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,360
Go!

281
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,160
Mother.

282
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,320
(You must survive)

283
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,280
