00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:17,408
=Episode 21=

3
00:00:18,803 --> 00:00:23,840
(Wen Mansion)

4
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,240
I'll head back to the inn

5
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,120
and send over the gifts.

6
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:09,920
It's been five years.

7
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,320
Your handwriting has improved greatly.

8
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,320
It's nice that you remember.

9
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,960
I thought you've long forgotten us

10
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,760
since you're doing so well in Qingzhou.

11
00:01:22,996 --> 00:01:26,592
(Wen Mansion)

12
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,160
(He knows I've been in Qingzhou?)

13
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,240
They say the national treasury
is now full,

14
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,560
mostly thanks to you.

15
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:37,920
Therefore,

16
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,520
the higher the position,

17
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,760
the sharper the tongue?

18
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,600
(She actually inquired about me.)

19
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,640
How have you been?

20
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,640
You've lost weight.

21
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,720
And you?

22
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,120
Are you well?

23
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,760
As you can see.

24
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,600
Now I'm the Minister of Revenue.

25
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,280
What could be better?

26
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,520
(Indeed.)

27
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,800
(He's doing what he wants.)

28
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,560
(What could be better than that?)

29
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,720
Mr. Wen Junior.

30
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,440
Welcome back.

31
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,840
And this is...?

32
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:26,920
I...

33
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,160
It's you, Ms. Chen.

34
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,640
You're finally back.

35
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,840
I'll tell Madam and Master.

36
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,400
Ms. Chen has returned.

37
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,480
Ms. Chen has returned.

38
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,280
Ms. Chen has returned.

39
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,720
There is a portrait of you at home.

40
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,320
All the servants know your face,

41
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,200
so they'd bring you back

42
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,960
upon seeing you.

43
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,960
Father, Mother, and Baozhu
will have a lot to say to you.

44
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,320
You should go in.

45
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,240
I have work to do.

46
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,560
Ms. Chen has returned.

47
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,960
Ms. Chen.

48
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,880
Ms. Chen is here.

49
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,160
Come on.

50
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,600
I'm here, aren't I?

51
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,600
No need to follow me.

52
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,240
Ms. Chen, you're finally here.

53
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,360
Baoyin.

54
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:35,440
Baoyin.

55
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,240
Leave us.

56
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,080
- Yes.
- Yes.

57
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,360
Come, let me take a look.

58
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,160
Come.

59
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,440
My child.

60
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,960
Silly girl.

61
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,000
You made us worried sick.

62
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,360
It's all my fault.

63
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,160
I'll do anything

64
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,880
to make it up to you.

65
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,080
Baoyin, where have you been?

66
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,800
We've missed you so much.

67
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,880
We couldn't find you anywhere.

68
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,880
Get up, let me see you.

69
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,360
My girl.

70
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,560
You left a letter and just left.

71
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,560
We have looked for so long.

72
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,960
Su sent people
to the side yards in Bianyang

73
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,160
and even your hometown.

74
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,000
We've searched

75
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,560
everywhere.

76
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,720
And then

77
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,680
we thought you'd died out there,

78
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,760
and that we'd

79
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,360
never find you again.

80
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,320
Auntie, you know me.

81
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,120
I won't go down that easy.

82
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,160
Please, don't be angry.

83
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,920
Getting worked up with me

84
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,960
is not worth it.

85
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,760
Uncle would be

86
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,960
upset too.

87
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,920
It's cold outside.

88
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,840
Come in quickly.

89
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:18,760
Come in.

90
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,440
Let's go.

91
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,240
Peach blossom cakes.

92
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,760
Your favorite.

93
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,520
We queue up every day.

94
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,600
Today you're finally back. Try it.

95
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,360
Have some tea to warm up.

96
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,160
Now tell me,

97
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,040
where have you been all these years?

98
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,560
I used His Majesty's reward
to open a restaurant in Qingzhou.

99
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,120
Business has been good.

100
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,040
For easier procurement,

101
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,920
I've opened shops in border areas,

102
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,360
southern frontier, and Xirong.

103
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,320
You've been to so many places?

104
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,760
Though you've seen the outside world,

105
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,680
life must've been hard.

106
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,920
Now that you're back, stay a bit longer.

107
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,160
Keep the two of us

108
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,120
company.

109
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,560
Yes, Baoyin.

110
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,600
I still have to take care
of the restaurant in Qingzhou.

111
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,920
Apart from

112
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,000
visiting you two,

113
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,760
I heard Baozhu is getting married,

114
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,560
so I'm here to congratulate her.

115
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:25,960
Where is she?

116
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,880
Must be with Lord Ying next door.

117
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,560
She's all about that man now.

118
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,600
If Su finds out,

119
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,800
he'll scold her again.

120
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,760
I have sent someone to inform her.

121
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,600
She should be back soon.

122
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,840
I've heard about this Lord Ying.

123
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,360
Su has doubts?

124
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,400
Su is now handling
the national treasury.

125
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,600
Lord Ying is guarding the north borders,

126
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,760
in charge of the troops.

127
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,440
Both of them are powerful officials.

128
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,320
If we are to unite,

129
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,400
we'll not only face
suspicion from others,

130
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,040
His Majesty will also be uneasy.

131
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,440
Baoyin, you liar!

132
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,240
You promised to be with me all the time.

133
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,760
How could you leave for five years?

134
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,720
I don't care.

135
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,120
This time I won't let go of you.

136
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,840
You can't leave me again.

137
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,640
Look at you,

138
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,000
you're still acting like a child.

139
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,120
It's all my fault.

140
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,760
I shouldn't have waited this long.

141
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,360
When I leave,

142
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,560
I'll take you with me.

143
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,800
If you lie to me again,

144
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,720
your nose will grow.

145
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,160
You'll soon be a wife,

146
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,240
yet still so clingy.

147
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,840
Baoyin, please talk
some sense into them.

148
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,480
I'll marry none other than Lord Ying.

149
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,840
Oh, shameless!

150
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,560
How can a girl demand to marry herself?

151
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,840
I like him,

152
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,040
so I must marry him.

153
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,040
Now it's your brother who is in charge.

154
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,400
We can't make the decision.

155
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,560
Go pester your brother, will you?

156
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,960
Baoyin must be exhausted from the trip.

157
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,360
Let her rest.

158
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,760
No way.

159
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,360
What if she leaves again?

160
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,480
I came back

161
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,360
especially for your wedding.

162
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:15,800
Don't worry.

163
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,440
I won't leave for now.

164
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,760
Baoyin, come quickly.

165
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,600
Look.

166
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,720
We brought these

167
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,520
when we moved here from Bianyang.

168
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,360
Su arranged them just as they were.

169
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,240
He cleans daily

170
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,360
to keep the room tidy.

171
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,280
He also changes the flowers
in this room every month.

172
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,320
Baoyin?

173
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,440
What's on your mind?

174
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,080
Nothing.

175
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,480
Oh my, Baoyin!

176
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,120
These pearls are bigger than my eyes!

177
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,640
This is nothing.

178
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,440
I make big money now.

179
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,640
All the best things will be yours.

180
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,600
I knew it.

181
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,400
You love me the most.

182
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,000
What's so funny?

183
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,456
It doesn't snow in Qingzhou.

184
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,080
I haven't seen snow in a long time.

185
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,800
I think it's not about the snow.

186
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:21,680
I'm not there.

187
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,080
Nor is Father, Mother,

188
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,120
or Su.

189
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,120
I think you're homesick.

190
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,440

00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,840
He's been so mean lately.

201
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,080

with that child?

214
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,080
Last I checked,

215
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,840
you're a few years older than me.

Baoyin, let's go sit.

219
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,680
He's acting like a different man now.

220
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,600
When you're back,

221
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,240
he even returns home early.

222
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:11,680
He's usually elusive and busy with work.

223
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,040
Baoyin,

224
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,760
can you talk to him

225
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,200
about Lord Ying's proposal?

226
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,600
Baozhu,

227
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,760
marriage is a big deal.

228
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,040
I have never seen Lord Ying,

229
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,480
nor do I know how he treats you.

230
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,000
How can I let you marry him easily?

231
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,600
He treats me well.

232
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,440
When I learned to ride horses,

233
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,600
I almost broke my leg.

234
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,640
It was he who saved me.

235
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,800
He taught me horse riding and archery

236
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,240
and told me about his military life.

237
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,640
He treats me just like
how you used to treat me.

238
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,240
Whenever there's something nice,

239
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,960
I'm the first one he thinks of.

240
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,000
You're truly a big girl now.

241
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,520
But even if I'm willing to help,

242
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,440
your brother has changed over the years.

243
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,320
He may not even listen to me.

244
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,160
He will.

245
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,840
He listens to anything you say.

246
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,520
He may seem aloof,

247
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,120
but it's because
life's been hard on him.

248
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,280
Since you left,

249
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,680
he'd been so depressed.

250
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:14,600
But he refused

251
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,280
His Majesty's marriage arrangement.

252
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:19,400
Father says the officialdom
is complicated,

253
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,840
so Su needs to be
more cautious on his own.

254
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,520
That's why he's become withdrawn
over the years,

255
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,400
keeping everything bottled up inside.

256
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,240
I see.

257
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,680
Actually, I know

258
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,880
Su doesn't want me to marry away

259
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,200
and move to the borders.

260
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,440
He fears even more that as a general,

261
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,440
Lord Ying may sacrifice one day.

262
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,280
But I'm not afraid.

263
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,880
As long as he treats me sincerely,

264
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,600
no matter how others think or say,

265
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,800
I will face

266
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,440
anything with him.

267
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,960
Anything.

268
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,280
Silly girl.

269
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,120
Not everyone has such courage.

270
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,200
Have you thought it through?

271
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,680
As long as we love each other,

272
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,040
I'll marry him, and only him,

273
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,360
no matter what.

274
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,800
(Such commitment.)

275
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,560
(Baozhu has really grown up.)

276
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,720
It's good that you're back.

277
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,320
Su can be a bit happier.

278
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,840
Please help me persuade him.

279
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,040
Come in.

280
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,280
I...

281
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,960
I didn't know you're getting changed.

282
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,240
So you left the door open
and let in the cold air.

283
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,200
Since you are getting changed,

284
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,440
I will come back later.

285
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:02,800
Don't you

286
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,560
have anything to say to me?

287
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:11,360
(Chen Baoyin!)

288
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,800
(Come on, find something to say.)

289
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,040
I heard about Baozhu and Lord Ying.

290
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,560
As Baozhu's brother,

291
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,480
you shouldn't ruin her marriage

292
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,720
for your own sake.

293
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,440
You're here

294
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,400
just to say this?

295
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,000
You should also

296
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,240
let go of the past and move on.

297
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,600
Your parents are getting old.

298
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,600
You should have sought another wife

299
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,080
lest they worry.

300
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,040
Well said.

301
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:08,160
So you are with that Luo Teng?

302
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,080
Nonsense!

303
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,960
Luo and I are business partners.

304
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,040
Since you haven't married,

305
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,720
have you ever thought
about me all these years?

306
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,320
No.

307
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,640
In that case,

308
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,040
why don't you look at me?

309
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,040
You!
