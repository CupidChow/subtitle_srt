3
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,720
Mother, tie a red string.

4
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,880
Thank you, Baozhu.

5
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,560
Tie it for you too.

6
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:34,080
Alright.

7
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:36,240
Hope you drive away evil,
invite blessings,

8
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,320
and dispel disaster.

9
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:38,960
Mother,

10
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,360
this is the new clothing
Baoyin made for you.

11
00:00:41,888 --> 00:00:43,560
The inner layer is made of fine cotton,

12
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:44,680
washed with water and dried,

13
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,920
and kneaded soft by hand before sewing.

14
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,680
But now I can help her with sewing.

15
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,920
The neckband inside was sewn by her.

16
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,000
Right?

17
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,680
All good.

18
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,680
Both are my little darlings.

19
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,040
Our family is in trouble.

20
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:06,600
Those intimate friends
and relatives of the past

21
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,840
all kept their distance.

22
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,600
Not one stepped forward.

23
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,480
Only you

24
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,440
have sincere intentions towards us

25
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,520
and are loyal to us.

26
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,240
I

27
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,080
toast to you.

28
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:28,360
If not for your kindness,
releasing my contract back then,

29
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,720
who knows
whether I am alive or dead now?

30
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,880
The Wen family
has given me another life.

31
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,480
Adversity reveals true hearts.

32
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,840
Such a loyal and righteous lady

33
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,040
deserves to be well treated.

34
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,280
It's a pity Su is not here.

35
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,720
Didn't you

36
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,160
hear any news about Su?

37
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,800
Please don't worry.

38
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,080
Mr. Wen Junior will be protected
by heaven.

39
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,400
He will surely be safe and sound.

40
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,040
Alright.

41
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:20,800
Baozhu,

42
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:21,640
come on.

43
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,320
Pour wine for me.

44
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,360
Baoyin is deeply affectionate,

45
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,360
always thinking of our Wen family

46
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,880
and the future of our son.

47
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,720
You are now Baozhu's sister.

48
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,280
So you are our foster daughter.

49
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,520
Mr. Wen and I

50
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,240
will treat you like our real daughter.

51
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,080
Yes.

52
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,240
For generations, my family has upheld
integrity in both action and character.

53
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,400
Su is

54
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,840
upright

55
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,600
and righteous.

56
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,280
Heaven will surely bless him.

57
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,160
(I'm not filial)

58
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,480
(and ashamed for the upbringing by you.)

59
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,240
Let's not talk about this.

60
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,720
Come on, Baozhu.

61
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,720
Fill it up for me.

62
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,600
(Now I am amidst thorns.)

63
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,360
(I no longer have the face to see you.)

Isn't this

during the festival?

00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,840
I'm afraid of disturbing your rest.

91
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,040
You've drunk too much.

92
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,160
Go inside to sober up

93
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,352

00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,120
Do you know what I'm doing?

100
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,520

A toy boy

102
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,360
is merely a tool for entertainment.

103
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,080
So what if I am a top scholar

104
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,480
or a talented person?

105
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,360
I have long lost my backbone.

106
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:21,080
I'm just a corpse even I despise.

107
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,720
Wait here.

108
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,120
I'll apply medicine for you.

109
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,480
It's useless.

110
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,000
In a few days, it'll be hurt again.

111
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,200
For all my reading
of wise and sage books,

112
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,400
I still have to rely on others

113
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,440
and grovel to protect my family.

114
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:57,960
I'm

115
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,520
no longer upright

116
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,960
or righteous.

117
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,400
It's simply laughable.

118
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,920
Mr. Wen Junior,

119
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,120
don't think like this.

120
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,320
Your parents would be heartbroken.

121
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,960
So what if they know?

122
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,840
I am too ashamed to face my parents.

123
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,440
I am unworthy to be their son.

124
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,720
Once all this passes,

125
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,800
I will find a deserted place
and end my life.

126
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,120
How can you choose to die?

127
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,640
If you have come to your senses,

128
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:16,760
sit quietly.

129
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:17,800
Let me apply the medicine.

130
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,280
You are surely meant for great things.

131
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,360
Since you have protected your family,

132
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,400
leave the rest to me.

133
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:45,240
I can certainly take care
of them properly.

134
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,960
The simplest thing
in this world is death.

135
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,760
You can use a rope

136
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:52,960
or a knife,

137
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,480
or bit your tongue to commit suicide.

138
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,840
But what one needs most
to live is courage.

139
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,920
Being upright

140
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,840
and generous is a kind of character.

141
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,480
Under great pressure,

142
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,840
making choices
is also a kind of character.

143
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,560
Since you have already made your choice,

144
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,720
why hurt yourself so?

145
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,520
Those who know and love you

146
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,120
will never abandon you.

147
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,080
You must take better care of yourself.

148
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,280
No matter what, take better care.

149
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:27,920
I am hungry.

150
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,000
Is there anything to eat?

151
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,800
Is it okay if you return late?

152
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,040
Tonight, she granted me leave

153
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,440
and let me go home to take a look.

154
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,680

00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,200
