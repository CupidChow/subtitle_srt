1
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:14,200
What...

2
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:14,880
Su,

3
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:16,000
where is Baoyin?

4
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,960
Bad news!

5
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:22,960
Baoyin is gone.

6
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,320
She left this letter.

7
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:24,920
What?

8
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,280
(Uncle, Auntie,)

9
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,720
(Baozhu, and Su,)

10
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,120
(sorry for leaving)

11
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,600
(without saying goodbye.)

12
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,560
(I hope for your forgiveness.)

13
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,760
(All of you have treated me
with great kindness,)

14
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,800
(especially Su, my lifesaver.)

15
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:44,840
(I was born poor.)

16
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,520
(Fortunately, I met you)

17
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,880
(and saw)

18
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,320
(the impermanence of life,)

19
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,600
(but I also found out)

20
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,200
(exactly what I want.)

21
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,920
(Since Su and I know each other best,)

22
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,320
(I understand more than anyone)

23
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:06,160
(the hardships he has faced
along the way.)

24
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,480
(I must know better)

25
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:11,920
(than to)

26
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,240
(take all this)

27
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,000
(for granted.)

28
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,600
(We all)

29
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,320
(have our own fate.)

30
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,800
(If it's meant to be, let it be.)

31
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,800
(If it's not,)

32
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,080
(let it go.)

33
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,160
(It's just I don't have the courage)

34
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,800
(to say goodbye)

35
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,360
(in person)

36
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,600
(to the four of you,)

37
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,760
(my dear family.)

38
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,360
(Please take care.)

39
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,280
(Yours, Baoyin.)

40
00:03:36,851 --> 00:03:40,640
=A Dream Like The True Love=

41
00:03:41,395 --> 00:03:43,200
=Episode 20=

42
00:03:44,352 --> 00:03:45,920
(Five years later in Qingzhou)
(I took His Majesty's reward)

43
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,000
(and acquired a restaurant in Qingzhou.)

44
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,440
(With my skills and experience,)

45
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,760
(I also manage several businesses.)

46
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,480
(The silver notes are light,)

47
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,200
(but they make me feel secure.)

48
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,360
(That's how I became)

49
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,120
(the first successful businesswoman
in Qingzhou.)

50
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,600
This pearl's surface is smooth and round

51
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,760
with no obvious flaws

52
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,960
and it has a delicate, lustrous sheen,

53
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,320
which can reflect

54
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,680
my image.

55
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,320
It's just that the roundness

56
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,640
is a bit short.

57
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,200
Not worth that much.

58
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,880
Ms. Chen,

59
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,920
these are all carefully selected by me.

60
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,440
They are the best from South Sea.

61
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,480
See

62
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,360
how big they are.

63
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,320
The bigger the pearl,

64
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,080
the higher the demand for roundness,

65
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,440
and the higher the price.

66
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,200
Besides,

67
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,880
these are clearly freshwater pearls
from Huai River.

68
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,080
Trying to fool me?

69
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,200
Try harder next time.

70
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,320
I didn't say I wouldn't take them.

71
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,680
These few strung pearls
are quite decent.

72
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,440
I'm making a necklace
for my little sister

73
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,400
as a wedding gift.

74
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,480
Still short a few.

75
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,720
I can pay you twenty taels

76
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,640
right now.

77
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:03,560
Well,

78
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,240
okay.

79
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,800
No wonder you do big business.

80
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,000
Not only do you have business acumen,

81
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,040
you sure can bargain.

82
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,000
Top businesswoman in Qingzhou indeed.

83
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,280
You flattered me.

84
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,400
Go get your payment.

85
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,280
Okay, take care.

86
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,640
Boss,

87
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,800
try the new dish.

88
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,000
It's the fifth anniversary,

89
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,200
and you're fooling me with this?

90
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,560
My, my.

91
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,520
You've become more and more picky.

92
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:57,360
Back then, you left without a word.

93
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,360
If I hadn't heard it,

94
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,320
I wouldn't know you opened
a restaurant here.

95
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,560
I admire that about you.

96
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,560
You never lack
the courage to start over.

97
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,160
There's nothing

98
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,600
you can't accomplish.

99
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,360
We need to keep moving forward.

100
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,040
When things feel easy,

101
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,640
it means you're going downhill.

102
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,280
When it's difficult,

103
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,000
it means you're moving up.

104
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,600
Now we're getting better and better.

105
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,160
Are you really going to the capital
for Baozhu's wedding?

106
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,760
I missed her the most

107
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,280
since I practically raised her.

108
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,160
If I'm not there on her wedding,

109
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,360
I will truly feel bad.

110
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:47,040
I heard Lord Ying has been
stationed at the borders for years.

111
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,040
He is nothing but a tough soldier.

112
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:52,160
Don't know how Baozhu
and he got together.

113
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,800
All the more reason to go check myself.

114
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,760
What about Wen Su?

115
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,760
That ship has long sailed.

116
00:07:13,204 --> 00:07:17,056
(Prefect Feng)

117
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,280
Mr. Wen,

118
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,560
may I toast you?

119
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:26,720
No need.

120
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,640
I can't stay long.

121
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,040
But rest assured.

122
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,920
Regarding the underreporting taxes,

123
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:41,000
I will report everything to His Majesty.

124
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,720
Wait for the decree.

125
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,760
Mr. Wen!

126
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,760
Please, let's talk this out properly.

127
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,320
How much do you want?

128
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,760
I won't bargain.

129
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,600
You better

130
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,160
stop talking,

131
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,040
for I will repeat everything

132
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,040
you said to His Majesty.

133
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,800
Mr. Wen!

134
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,720
Wen Su,

135
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,400
I won't let you off easily.

136
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,240
So who is the boss, Mr. Luo or Ms. Chen?

137
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,560
They're a couple.

138
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,640
They are both bosses.

139
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:24,960
Wait,

140
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,840
I remember Mr. Luo
only came to Qingzhou later.

141
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,360
And the two never got married.

142
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:39,880
Baoyin,

143
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,800
some official's here
to bring down Prefect Feng.

144
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,240
Now Feng wants a refund.

145
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,320
This old miser
should have been punished long ago.

146
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,520
He won't be around for long.

147
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,320
It's better to avoid trouble.

148
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,560
Just give him what he wants.

149
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,600
But the thing is

150
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,880
that man from the capital ate
a bowl of seafood wontons.

151
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,360
There's no way to return it.

152
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,240
Seafood wontons?

153
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,240
People from the capital also love these?

154
00:09:10,163 --> 00:09:12,928
(Capital Street)

155
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,520
Mr. Wen.

156
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,480
Mr. Wen is coming.

157
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,200
(Song Shulan)
Quickly now.

158
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,000
Tidy up.

159
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,400
Or Mr. Wen will report us.

160
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,920
That book is a private copy.
Hide it quickly.

161
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:24,960
Okay, okay.

162
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,000
So this is the God of Justice
of Ministry of Revenue,

163
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,520
Wen Su.

164
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,000
Please come again.

165
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,000
Take a look.

166
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,080
Ms. Song.

167
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,640
Apologies.

168
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,480
You know me?

169
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,680
In the entire capital,

170
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,800
you are the only woman

171
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,760
who loves to buy the stationery

172
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,440
and uses a man's folding fan.

173
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,600
And yet you rejected me three times.

174
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,840
I have my pride, you know.

175
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,240
I always wanted to see

176
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,400
what kind of man

177
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,560
the famous God of Justice is.

178
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,960
Now I see

179
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,320
you are just an average man.

180
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:15,960
We can just drop

181
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,280
my rejection.

182
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,760
I am the daughter of Minister Song.

183
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:20,760
Am I not worthy?

184
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,200
Why would you humiliate me?

185
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,640
Mr. Wen!

186
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:26,840
They're here.

187
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,680
If you'll excuse me.

188
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,200
I already said it.

189
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,840
The wine can't enter.

190
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,120
Either drink it

191
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:54,760
or throw it.

00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,120
Sir.

193
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,680
The wine is home-brewed.

194
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,000
Winter is here

195
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,960
and we are visiting relatives.

196
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,120
Please let us in.

197
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,560
Daqing Laws

198
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,040
prohibit the private sale of yeast.

199
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,840
Who knows if you are

200
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,920
gifting or selling it.

201
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,360
Luo.

202
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:27,600
Sir.

203
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,000
You've worked hard

204
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,080
in this weather.

205
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,760
Take this.

206
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,320
Buy some food for your men.

207
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,680
Take it back.

208
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,720
Rules are rules.

209
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,200
Let me tell you,

210
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,720
the Ministry of Revenue...

211
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,440
Mr. Wen is here.

212
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,000
(It's him.)

213
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,440
It's fine.

214
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,480
Let them pass.

215
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,320
She's visiting

216
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,720
my house.

217
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,880
I apologize.

218
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,480
I didn't know.

219
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,000
Please forgive me.

220
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,040
(Why has he become so stern)

221
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,600

00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,360

Why?
