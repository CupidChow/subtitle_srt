=A Dream Like The True Love=

2
00:00:14,995 --> 00:00:17,152
=Episode 19=

3
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,480
I heard that when Father
and Mother were out,

4
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,240
you brought them here to celebrate.

5
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:31,800
I'd like to have a try.

6
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:33,480
Then try the steamed mutton.

7
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:34,880
It's the specialty dish here.

8
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,080
Wen, long time no see.

9
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,520
Du, Yuan.

10
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:41,640
It's been a long time.

11
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,120
And this is...

12
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,240
My fiancée.

13
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,680
What a graceful and beautiful lady.

14
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,240
May I ask which noble family she's from?

15
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,960
Just an ordinary family.

16
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,320
Wen.

17
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,120
You're Assistant Minister
of Revenue now.

18
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,680
We must toast you.

19
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,440
Would you join us for a few drinks?

20
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,840
Of course, please sit.

21
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:15,640
Please.

22
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,480
Then let me get some wine for you.

23
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:18,520
Thank you.

24
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,360
Wen.

25
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,520
You are the top scholar

26
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,160
and now promoted.

27
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,720
You could've married a noble lady.

28
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,320
How did you end up
with an ordinary woman?

29
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,520
Indeed.

30
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,720
You have a bright future.

31
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:33,760
Why marry now?

32
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,080
There'll be

33
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,520
plenty of fine ladies
when you get to the capital.

34
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,280
Why must it be her?

35
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,520
Actually,

36
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:44,920
Baoyin

37
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,000
saved me

38
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,560
and my family.

39
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,440
And we love each other.

40
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,400
It just has to be her.

41
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,600
Given your position in the court now,

42
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,760
you should find someone
who matches your family standing.

43
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,920
With a father-in-law's support,

44
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,560
your career will soar high.

45
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,520
We all studied hard
for more than a decade.

46
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,120
Only you made it.

47
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,600
Only we know

48
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,560
the hardships in this.

49
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,280
But now, to repay kindness,

50
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,720
you are ignoring your future.

51
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,720
I truly feel sorry for you.

52
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,280
Indeed.

53
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,800
Please don't worry about me.

54
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,920
What's wrong, Baoyin?

55
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,440
I just feel that when you're talking,

56
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,240
I can't even chime in,

57
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,760
like a nuisance.

58
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,280
Don't mind them.

59
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,080
Walk with me.

60
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,000
They all say

61
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,680
you are marrying me to repay a favor.

62
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,200
What they think is their own business.

63
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,680
If there's something

64
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,320
I don't want to do,

65
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,080
no one can make me.

66
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,320
You know me the best.

67
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,480
I've been wearing it since the day

68
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,440
you gave it to me.

69
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,600
It's just that this bracelet

70
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,800
is no longer complete.

71
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,040
Now I truly understand

72
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,400
nothing in this world

73
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,320
is ever perfect.

74
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,080
Perhaps the imperfection
makes it perfect.

75
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,520
Just like this bracelet.

76
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,880
Didn't it bring you back to me?

77
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,040
Wasn't he the Eldest Princess's toy boy?

78
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:23,600
What?

79
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,640
- He's the new assistant minister.
- It's him.

80
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,040
He really was a toy boy?

81
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,800
Yes, I even saw them boating.

News!

Come on.

91
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:11,760
I want one too!

92
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,080
Give me a copy.

93
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:14,840
Give me a copy.

94
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,400
The new Assistant Minister of Revenue

95
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,360
turned out to be
Eldest Princess's toy boy.

96
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,608
(The new Assistant Minister of Revenue
was a toy boy)

97
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,360
Uncle, Auntie,

98
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,040
I know you're angry at Su

99
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,480
that he has humiliated himself

100
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,240
and damaged

101
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,320
the Wen family's reputation.

102
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,480
But they don't know

103
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,440
as much as I do

104
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,600
how he bore humiliation,

105
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,040
swallowed his pride,

106
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,680
and lived under others' roofs

107
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,840
to finally reach this day.

108
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,280
Su

109
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,080
has suffered too much.

110
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,520
It's all my fault.

111
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,800
Uncle.

112
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,880
Since you care about him,

113
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,080
don't say such nonsense.

114
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,880
We are a family.

115
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,840
No one is to blame.

116
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,920
He never speaks of his suffering.

117
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,000
That's why I came to you on his behalf.

118
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,240
His reputation is tarnished.

119
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,760
We are not afraid

120
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,800
of people's judgment.

121
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,280
But it must be hard on you.

122
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,640
Now Su has become an official,

123
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,560
he'll be in the spotlight.

124
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,480
I'm afraid

125
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,120
it'll only get tougher.

126
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,960
I am just an ordinary woman

127
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,000
with no name or power.

128
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,160
There's nothing to lose.

129
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,680
But

130
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,760
he might suffer more.

131
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,520
Dear.

132
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,280
Uncle.

133
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:40,640
Father,

134
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,440
I have failed you.

135
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,720
Please punish me.

136
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:55,920
Father!

137
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,680
Dear!

138
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,120
Father, what are you doing?

139
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,120
Su.

140
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,400
It's our fault.

141
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,960
If it weren't for Baoyin,

142
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,400
how long were you going to
endure this alone?

143
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,520
I'm alright.

144
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,960
Those people

145
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,360
would believe anything they hear.

146
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,640
They catch you on one mistake,

147
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,480
and then they embellish it.

148
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:37,000
They want to ruin you completely.

149
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,800
They don't know what you've done

150
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,000
for them,

151
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,800
almost losing your own life.

152
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,800
Are we not going to

153
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,840
clear things up?

154
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,960
Should we just pretend
nothing ever happened?

155
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,160
Mother,

156
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,120
go back and rest.

157
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,560
Su,

158
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,320
you've just made it
into the imperial court.

159
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,560
Those rumors

160
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,920
won't quiet down for a while.

161
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,200
Just let it be.

162
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,280
Father,

163
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,720
I can stand on my own.

164
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,680
Go rest please.

165
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,240
Go.

166
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,640
(Anyone can)

167
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,440
(grind down a newcomer.)

168
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:40,600
(He has sacrificed for this country)

169
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,560
(but his ambitions
are yet to be fulfilled.)

170
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,480
(If he gives in
to these slanderous words,)

171
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,360
(wouldn't all past efforts be wasted?)

172
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,440
I'm here.

173
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,160
Why are you staring at that?

174
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,680
How come you don't even make a sound?

175
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,040
I have picked a few dates
for our wedding.

176
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,160
You can choose one.

177
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I heard

178
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,400
you refused His Majesty's proposal.

179
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
You don't need to worry.

180
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,640
That's my concern.

181
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,200
You just be my happy bride.

182
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,880
If I am to marry you,

183
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,000
then we're in this together.

184
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,760
It'll be our concern.

185
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,640
If I insist on marrying you

186
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,840
and mess up your career,

187
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,440
how can I be at ease?

188
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,680
You don't trust me?

189
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,200
Those rumors

190
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,440
have never affected my love
for you in the slightest.

191
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,400
I trust you.

192
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,680
But I won't accept
being a burden to you.

193
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,560
You aren't well established yet.

194
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,760
What you need is a well-matched wife.

195
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,480
But I come from the countryside.

196
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,960
Neither of us can change that.

197
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,440
If you and I insist on getting married,

198
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,640
the future is bound to be rough.

199
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,520
What if you can't handle it?

200
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,480
I don't want to see you
in danger anymore.

201
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,840
After all those hardships,

202
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,160
you shouldn't be held back
by me anymore.

203
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,080
Nor should I.

204
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,640
Will you not

205
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,760
marry me?

206
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,160
You've risked your life
and come this far.

207
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,720
Now that you have a bright future ahead,

208
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,360
you must live up to the hardships
you've endured.

209
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,560
Should

210
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,080
our love...

211
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,360
Should our love become a burden,

212
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,600
then we must make a clean break

213
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,520
and part ways.

214
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,200
We have to

215
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,680
keep moving forward after all.

216
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,560
Don't you agree?

217
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,240
If you have made up your mind,

218
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,848
then I accept.

what's going on?

276
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,640
Read it.

Uncle, Auntie,

278
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,120
Baozhu, and Su,

279
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,320
sorry for leaving

280
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,760
without saying goodbye.

281
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,120
I hope for your forgiveness.

282
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,960
Do you take this bracelet?

283
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:06,920
Well.

284
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,360
Was this a gift?

285
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:12,760
Yes.

286
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,040
This bracelet signifies completeness.

287
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,800

288
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,640
You really want to sell it?

289
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,200
So much for the perfect couple.

00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,840
I'm to make a clean break.

291
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,280
This only reminds me of him.

292
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,880
It's not worth much.

293

294
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,040
you regret it,

295
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,560
you can come take it back.

296
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,440
(We both have our own paths to follow.)

297
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,920
(It's time to wake up from this dream.)

298
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,240
(The world is big.)

299
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,040
(There will always be)

300
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,400
(a place for me.)

301
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,560
(Farewell.)
