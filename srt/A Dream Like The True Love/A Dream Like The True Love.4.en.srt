1
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,960
It's my brother!

2
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,640
(He is a dignified top scholar.)

3
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,800
(Why would he now submit himself
to the Eldest Princess,)

4
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,120
(disregarding the safety of his family?)

5
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,360
(Does he not care about the so-called)

6
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:25,800
(integrity of a scholar?)

7
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:30,400
(Is he willing to be scorned
by people as a toy boy?)

8
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,560
(How should I explain it to Baozhu?)

9
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,312
=A Dream Like The True Love=

10
00:00:49,312 --> 00:00:51,616
=Episode 4=

11
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,280
I didn't expect him to be such a person.

12
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,360
Keep it down.

13
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,400
He's done it all.

14
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,400
Why can't I say it?

15
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,120
No wonder my brother was not imprisoned.

16
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,640
He became the Eldest Princess's man.

17
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:09,960
If this gets out,

18
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,520
how will people view our family?

19
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:12,560
Yes.

20
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,640
Mr. Wen Junior is a person
who covets wealth and comfort.

21
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,640
Only caring for his happiness.

22
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,880
Disregarding his family.

23
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,120
Let's sever ties with him

24
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,720
and no longer recognize him as a Wen.

25
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,720
It doesn't have to be like that.

26
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,240
Perhaps

27
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,400
my brother has
some unspeakable difficulties.

28
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,920
You calmed down?

29
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,640
What kind of person is Mr. Wen Junior?

30
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,880
You are his younger sister.

31
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,240
You should know best.

32
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,320
No matter what,

33
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,200
he wouldn't disregard his family

34
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,400
just to seek his happiness.

35
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,440
Before knowing the whole story,

36
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,200
we cannot jump to conclusions.

37
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,000
At least we know now

38
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,040
Mr. Wen Junior is safe and sound.

39
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,040
That's a good thing.

40
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,800
He has gone to live in luxury,

41
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,960
leaving us with plain food.

42
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,880
My parents are still suffering
in prison.

43
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,760
(Living under someone else's roof,)

44
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,760
(can it be a good life?)

45
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,240
- Greetings, Your Highness.
- Greetings, Your Highness.

46
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,960
Go take a look.

47
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:10,760
Well...

48
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,160
The dignified top scholar of Daqing

49
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:24,920
has become a toy boy, losing all face.

50
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,000
Just a mere toy boy.

51
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,760
So improper!

52
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,080
Well?

53
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,040
What is wrong?

54
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,320
Please calm down.

55
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,840
I have something to report.

56
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,680
You may leave now.

57
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,840
Yes.

58
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,600
(Li Mu)
Your Highness,

59
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,616
Prince Qi was found.

60
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,400
He has a high reputation.

61
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,520
He is Fahui, the Head Monk
of Buddha Temple.

62
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,520
Interesting.

63
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:12,280
It turns out the seventh prince
has been hiding in the Buddha Temple.

64
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,040
It's truly been difficult
for me to find him.

65
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,800
(It seems the opportunity has come.)

66
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,680
He is skilled
in both civil and military affairs.

67
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,440
If he could come out and assist me,

68
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,440
that would be like
adding wings to a tiger.

69
00:04:29,792 --> 00:04:32,992
(Buddha Temple)

70
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,280
(There are so many visitors today.
The incense offerings are prosperous.)

71
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,720
(My dishes are sure to sell out.)

72
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,760
Bless my Pan'er...

73
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,560
Mother,

74
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,880
what wish did you make?

75
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,560
I prayed to the Buddha

76
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,200
to grant you a fulfilling life.

77
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,000
What does fulfillment mean?

78
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,960
Peace and smoothness.

79
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,640
Harmony in marriage.

80
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,560
Surrounded by descendants.

81
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,280
That life is fulfillment.

82
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,760
In a woman's life,

83
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,520
the most important thing

84
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,480
is to be fulfilled.

85
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,320
(Mother,)

86
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,480
(I might disappoint you.)

87
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,280
(I do not dare to ask
for lifetime fulfillment.)

88
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,600
(I only hope that the loved ones)

89
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,760
(can all be healthy and safe.)

90
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:21,960
(This back view...)

91
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,760
(Why does it look so familiar?)

92
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,120
I trust you.

93
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,320
You must have a reason for doing this.

94
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,400
Your family was

95
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,560
sentenced to death,

96
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,680
but now spared from execution.

97
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,120
I think

98
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,560
you must've been working behind this.

99
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,600
Thanks for taking care of Qiongniang.

100
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,360
You've worked hard.

101
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,480
Today I came
without informing Her Highness.

102
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,600
I can't say much to you.

103
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,200
Some day,

104
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,800
I'll thank you in person.

105
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,520
Please take care.

106
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,640
Your family is still hoping
for your safe return home.

107
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,920
Aren't you afraid that my family
and I are bad people?

108
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,200
I only know your family treated me well

109
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,680
and you once saved me.

110
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,080
That's enough.

111
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,760
Greetings, Prince Qi.

112
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,440
(Fahui, Head Monk)
Zhao Huaiying is no longer in this world.

113
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,120
There is only a monk named Fahui here.

114
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,280
I rudely interrupted.

115
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,480
I hope you can forgive me.

116
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,880
But the Eldest Princess
already knows your identity.

117
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,200
She's searched for years.

118
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,800
This day would come.

119
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,880
Reassure the Crown Prince.

120
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,480
I promised him

121
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,840
and I won't break it.

122
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,960
It's hard on you to stay
by her side as an informant.

123
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,120
(With these words from Prince Qi,)

124
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,800
(the Crown Prince will achieve it.)

125
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,160
Bring an extra jar next time.

126
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,800
Your pickles taste really good.

127
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,000
Okay.

128
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,760
(I don't know if I will meet
Mr. Wen Junior again later.)

129
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,840
Madam, who are you looking for?

130
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,520
Go away!

131
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:50,520
(Oh no.)

132
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,280
(Wen Su came without her knowing.)

133
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,760
(If she sees him...)

134
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,280
Wen Su,

135
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,760
you heartless man!

136
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:18,680
With status,

137
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,920
you'll break our engagement?

138
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:20,520
No way!

139
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,400
It's not like that.

140
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,600
I can explain.

141
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,560
Explain what?

142
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,640
Back then, you seduced me,
a maid at the Wen Mansion,

143
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,960
wanting to get engaged to me.

144
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,520
Now the Wen family is in trouble.

145
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,000
You ignore your sister
and parents' well-being

146
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,080
and deny our engagement.

147
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,760
Should be a swallow from the old nest.

148
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,400
You've flown up to a high branch.

149
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,920
As it was a private engagement,

150
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,280
it doesn't count.

151
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:53,960
I came here

152
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,160
just to tell you

153
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:55,800
not to wait.

154
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,800
Take this money.

155
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,480
Find a good family to marry into.

156
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,880
(Isn't this sum of money
too unconvincing?)

157
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:12,880
Your Highness.

158
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,920
Your Highness?

159
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,640
Who are you fooling?

160
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,640
With this little money,

161
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,880
nobody would help!

162
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,800
Your Highness, forgive me.

163
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,880
Please give me justice.

164
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:33,960
Please forgive me.

165
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,840
It's all my fault.

166
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,080
I believe you.

167
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,520
This young woman is
so greedy and insatiable.

168
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,080
Just kill her.

169
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,080
How can the pure land
of Buddhism allow killings?

170
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:21,840
(My brother?)

171
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,520
Brother.

172
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,920
It's been years apart.
You made me search long for you.

173
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,880
Prince Qi died in that great fire
12 years ago.

174
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,320
I am merely an old monk devoted
to chanting Buddha's name

175
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,600
without concerning himself
with worldly matters.

176
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:51,960
Brother,

177
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,160
I have much to say to you.

178
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,840
No matter who you are now,

179
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,280
I will always see you
as my most respected brother.

180
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,040
Everyone knows

181
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,920
the wise and mighty Prince Qi back then
did not deserve such an end.

182
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,080
Let it be.

183
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,080
If you can spare
these two innocent people,

184
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,520
I will invite you to come in for a talk.

185
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,640
Heaven has a virtue of cherishing life.

186
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,760
You should seek merits for yourself.

187
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,400
It would not be in vain
for my years of prayers for you.

188
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,240
Now hurry and get lost!

189
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,400
Well?

190
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,120
Still thinking of your lover?

191
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,840
Your Highness, do not jest.

192
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,920
Or

193
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,280
are you thinking of your family?

194
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,200
I just like to humiliate you,

195
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,360
letting you love but not attain.

196
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,680
It's a festival today.

197
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:38,160
Truly a good day for a family reunion.

198
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,960
Still thinking you're
the aloof top scholar?

199
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,000
Beg me.

200
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,320
Then I'll let you go
and visit the prison.

201
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,560
So similar.

202
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:12,520
If you didn't resemble
that person somewhat,

203
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,960
I wouldn't have had the kindness
to save your whole family

204
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,280
and that woman.

205
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,960
Your Highness, if you're not serious,

206
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,960
you will lose.

207
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,360
It's just your reluctant demeanor

208
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,560
that tugs at my heart the most.

209
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,880
I know you have a strong character,

210
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,280
but since you are with me,

211
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,720
your pride

212
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,320
should be discarded early.

213
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,240
Otherwise,

214
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,480
it will harm others

215
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,920
and yourself.

216
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,680
I lost this round.

217
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,560
Look how serious you are.

218
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,280
As long as I'm happy,

219
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,000
it's easy to let someone survive.

220
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,240
Today is a festive day,

221
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,480
so I grant you a day off.

222
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,880
Go to the jail to see your parents.

223
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,360
See how good I am to you.

224
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,440
Don't pull a long face all day

225
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,600
as it makes you look
ungrateful and annoying.

226
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,240
These ants

227
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,200
are interesting.

228
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,440
Thanks, Your Highness.

229
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,120
Baoyin, you're busy?

230
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:02,880
My mother made tangyuan.

231
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,560
I brought some over for you and Baozhu.

232
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,160
Thank you, Luo.

233
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,200
Just in time,

234
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,800
I made some seasonal dishes.

235
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,840
Take them home to eat.

236
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,880
Then I won't be polite.

237
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:13,600
Wait.

238
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,320
Your clothes got torn?

239
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:16,840
I'll mend them for you.

240
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,200
It's no big deal.

241
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:21,080
You run a business
and take care of your sister every day,

242
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,040
which is too hard.

243
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,320
I can handle it by myself.

244
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,440
It's not hard. The needle is right here.

245
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,400
Compared to before,

246
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,240
now I can earn money
and have enough to eat,

247
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,640
which is better than many people.

248
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,160
Done.

249
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,160
Thank you.

250
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:07,240
If there's nothing else,
I'll head back first.

251
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,360
It's fine.

252
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,520
- I'm going now.
- Luo.
