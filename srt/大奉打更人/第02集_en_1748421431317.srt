1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,560
You have nobody to wear

2
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,840
That's true

3
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:33,840
后会哪有时后避

4
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,280
What will you compare including many filme

5
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,920
Beyond the ocean, through evil stuff

6
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,920
We'll still blindfold ourselves

7
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:39,840
till the day we sociable

8
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:48,420
With you, I'll be

9
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,300
Blackpink

10
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,200
Blackpink

11
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'm so hungry.

12
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Chen Jing!

13
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
What are you doing?

14
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Wait.

15
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Go to the door.

16
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Go.

17
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Go.

18
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Go.

19
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You're not alone.

20
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Don't go to the door.

21
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Chen Jing,

22
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
you can't open the door.

23
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Go.

24
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Go.

25
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Go.

26
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Go.

27
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Go.

28
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Go.

29
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Chen Jing,

30
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
you can't open the door.

31
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Go.

32
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Go.

33
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Go.

34
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Go.

35
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Go.

36
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Go.

37
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Go.

38
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Go.

39
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Go.

40
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Go.

41
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Go.

42
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Go.

43
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Go.

44
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Go.

45
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Go.

46
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Go.

47
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Go.

48
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Go.

49
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I can't open the door.

50
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
It's open.

51
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
It's out.

52
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
It's out.

53
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
We're doomed.

54
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
It's open.

55
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
You're a bad boy.

56
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Don't go.

57
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
It's okay.

58
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
What's wrong?

59
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
It's all right.

60
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
It's all right.

61
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
It's all right.

62
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
The stool is rolling on the ground.

63
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Goodbye.

64
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
What's the matter?

65
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It's all over the place.

66
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
It's on the ground.

67
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Goodbye.

68
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
It's open.

69
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Are you okay?

70
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
How did you come back?

71
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
The neighbors didn't see me, did they?

72
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
No.

73
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I was relieved.

74
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Guo,

75
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
the neighbors said you went on the street.

76
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
What's so good about going on the street?

77
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Doctor, please save my son.

78
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
He's been lying on his head.

79
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
He's unconscious.

80
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
This...

81
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
You're back.

82
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Are you okay?

83
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
What's the matter with me?

84
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
This old man.

85
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Someone got sick at home.

86
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Well...

87
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
You're sick.

88
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Is it serious?

89
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Not serious.

90
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
That's good.

91
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
That's good.

92
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Well...

93
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Let's go.

94
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
This clothes...

95
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
What's going on?

96
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Renyi.

97
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
This arrangement is too terrible.

98
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,100
will have something with you.

99
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,120
before the wedding,

100
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,160
I'll rest at home,

101
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,520
and may you go back home to rest.

102
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:22,940
My dear

103
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:23,800
A-bu,

104
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:34,320
have I yet to eat to

105
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,120
feed you?

106
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,000
fordly.

107
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,160
Go quickly,

108
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,680
find his wife to go upstairs to feed him first.

109
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,440
Lord Chaos is taking care of us.

110
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,400
Our step Photoshop Tschu.

111
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,640
Will you go upstairs to do it first?

112
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,720
I can't remember his family.

113
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,600
I finally got a good experience.

114
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,560
And I came here.

115
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,760
I'm so cheap.

116
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,200
I haven't used all the money in the bank card.

117
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,200
I haven't read all the three novels

118
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,600
just finished.

119
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,960
What the hell is this place?

120
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,320
What is this?

121
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,120
And the magic tree.

122
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,400
Can't they really go out?

123
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:18,800
No.

124
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,000
If they can't do anything,

125
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I'll be mad.

126
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,040
I won't go.

127
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,440
I want to eat a meal.

128
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,240
I want to eat a meal.

129
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,680
Just come here at the right time.

130
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,240
Just come here at the right time.

131
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:31,880
I'm not here.

132
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:32,840
How can I eat?

133
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,600
Sister, you're the best.

134
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,680
This dish is so delicious.

135
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,600
Brother, what's wrong with him?

136
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,280
He was laughing just now.

137
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:45,840
This is called

138
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,040
the magic short-term comprehensive medical test.

139
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,400
This is only a major blow

140
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,520
in the specific situation.

141
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,520
The memory may completely disappear.

142
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,480
But the basic skills of the body

143
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:01,840
won't affect.

144
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,240
The behavior

145
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,600
won't be a big problem.

146
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,320
You don't have a seat, do you?

147
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,840
Feng Ni, have a seat.

148
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,280
Just one meal, okay?

149
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,280
I said,

150
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,320
why are you so confused?

151
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,760
I'm not the one who's fast.

152
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,440
Give me a break.

153
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:27,840
Oh, right.

154
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,000
Just have a good rest.

155
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:29,840
No big problem.

156
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,320
But don't mention the past.

157
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,200
The memory will be confused easily.

158
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,080
Leave the rest for a while.

159
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:35,920
I'll be back.

160
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,840
You're so kind today.

161
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,360
How dare you help me?

162
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,400
Sister,

163
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,400
why are you always looking at me?

164
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,080
I just think

165
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,800
you're different from before.

166
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,240
You're different in words and actions.

167
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
How could you break the case?

168
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:01,880
Of course.

169
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,120
I'm also a big fan of you.

170
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:07,240
How could you break the case?

171
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,040
The past is probably like this.

172
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,040
So our family was released.

173
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,640
It's here.

174
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,600
Why didn't I think of it?

175
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,400
You're so rude.

176
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,200
You even don't know how to hold a cold.

177
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,600
Uncle,

178
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,800
when they were buying the silver,

179
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
weren't you at the market?

180
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,320
Oh,

181
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,920
you gave me a bottle of wine.

182
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,320
I didn't know the wine.

183
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,480
I was so thirsty.

184
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,360
I just drank a few cups.

185
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,240
You didn't say anything in the word.

186
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,960
I don't think

187
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,240
it's a small thing.

188
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,840
Small thing?

189
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,400
You almost killed my family.

190
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,240
I'm so stupid.

191
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,720
I won't drink wine again.

192
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:04,640
Mom,

193
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,000
Mom, you're so sweet.

194
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,360
Why's going wrong again?

195
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,320
I've been saying

196
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,360
it's Yan Z现在's problem.

197
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,280
Just now, I saw brother this time

198
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,960
and said it drank fine.

199
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,040
Jani!

200
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,600
I'm the one who broke the gold.

201
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,480
The Rainbow...

202
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,560
ja, the rainbow is the cake.

203
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,400
It's okay.

204
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,080
It's okay.

205
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,120
It's okay.

206
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:32,880
His Majesty ordered us to

207
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,960
practice fake sleepiness here.

208
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,680
He said that this thing

209
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,360
is powerful and powerful.

210
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,160
It's a great reward.

211
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,240
But we failed to practice it in a hurry.

212
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,280
We didn't have any progress.

213
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,280
Please, Sister Caiwei,

214
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,400
wait for us to clear the way.

215
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,520
Sister Caiwei,

216
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,320
you've seen the practice fake sleepiness yourself.

217
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,720
Why?

218
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,160
Yes.

219
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:46,600
Yes.

220
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,240
Yes.

221
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,400
It seems that it's not a problem.

222
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,760
But he did practice it.

223
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,600
The legendary practice of the ancient legend,

224
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,240
Shen Ao Hui Si.

225
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,240
It's not that you can learn it

226
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,280
if you say it here.

227
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,560
You need to practice the magic tree

228
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,360
to practice the skills.

229
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,920
I'll teach you a word of the first word.

230
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,680
It's a word of the first word.

231
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,200
Qinghai, Li Pingpong, Danan,

232
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,120
Funan, and Meizhu Guilin.

233
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,200
Qinghai.

234
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,160
What's the meaning of this word?

235
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,000
I don't know what it means.

236
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,600
Anyway,

237
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,520
the word of the first word is Xu Qian.

238
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,920
Xu Pingzhi, the son of the emperor,

239
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,360
ran in the seven-spanning law.

240
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,000
You can find him.

241
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,440
By the way,

242
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,440
the fake silver is from him.

243
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:34,920
Master.

244
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,720
Cai Wei is here.

245
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,160
Master.

246
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,960
What is the golden tree?

247
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,320
I don't know.

248
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,640
There are things that master doesn't know.

249
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,520
That's too much.

250
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,040
Master doesn't know

251
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,440
where the few thieves

252
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,160
went 19 years ago.

253
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,720
Here we go again.

254
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:03,920
Master, you always say

255
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,520
the thief was hateful 19 years ago.

256
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,640
You can't tell me who they were.

257
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,120
What did they steal recently?

258
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,200
You can't steal anything.

259
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,240
Master.

260
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,240
You know it, but you don't say it.

261
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,600
It hurts to choose a new one.

262
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,440
It's really me.

263
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,120
Well, master.

264
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,760
Your taste.

265
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,080
You can control the past and the future.

266
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,160
It doesn't matter.

267
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,640
Then you must know

268
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,120
why Xu Qian

269
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,520
is the one who knows the golden tree.

270
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,520
This one.

271
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:54,440
Today is the seventh day of my life.

272
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,320
I've gradually accepted

273
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,920
the reality that I can't go back.

274
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,600
I've accepted this move

275
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,440
but I've thought about my future.

276
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,640
In short,

277
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,480
the team I knew

278
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,120
is in the process.

279
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,520
In this way,

280
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,800
I can plan my life peacefully.

281
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,320
The family of the owner

282
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,880
seems to be nice to me.

283
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,600
Uncle, don't say it.

284
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,200
Take me as your son.

285
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,440
He is a master of seven-digit jade knives.

286
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,040
Xu Qian.

287
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,080
He is a worker in the company.

288
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,520
He lives in an outside house.

289
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,880
His family is a seven-digit jade.

290
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:36,160
Uncle, you saved us.

291
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,600
You have taken out

292
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,560
the silver in the house.

293
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
What should we do?

294
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,960
Yes.

295
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,400
What should we do?

296
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,920
Get up.

297
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:52,840
Get up.

298
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,800
Your right leg.

299
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,680
Lift it up.

300
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,880
I'll give you one.

301
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,000
Then remember

302
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,920
to go to the moon last month.

303
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,320
This month?

304
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,520
Last month.

305
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,200
Aunt

306
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,840
is not good at dealing with it.

307
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,920
Like the finance director

308
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,640
of our company.

309
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,680
Two sisters

310
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:27,880
are good at personality

311
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,560
and can do administrative work.

312
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:32,360
They are smart and smart.

313
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,360
They are good at everything.

314
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,960
They are good at looking at people.

315
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,960
They are good at understanding.

316
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,400
They are good at being in love.

317
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,680
As for the little sister,

318
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,560
she is a good friend.

319
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:49,000
Or a good friend.

320
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:50,720
By the way,

321
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,520
I almost forgot my brother.

322
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,360
He is a scholar.

323
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,400
But he looks

324
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:58,200
like a man with a bad temper.

325
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,240
He is a man.

326
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,280
He has a thousand gold.

327
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:02,960
No.

328
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,440
I have to observe him

329
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,600
to prevent him from eating the building.

330
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,160
From now on,

331
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,280
I am not Yang Ling.

332
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,040
I am Xu Xi'an.

333
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,080
In my last life,

334
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:17,360
I gave up my dream.

335
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,280
And here,

336
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:21,800
I am the best in the business.

337
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,840
I will

338
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,680
make my dream come true.

339
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,320
How is it?

340
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,760
Are you all clear?

341
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,320
Anyway, this is my plan.

342
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,040
I want to make money.

343
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:38,160
You have to make money, too.

344
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,840
I know that

345
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,360
I have a bad plan.

346
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,680
You can't understand

347
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,040
the asset management and the contract.

348
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,040
But please don't worry.

349
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,600
I believe in my ability.

350
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,560
Many people

351
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,800
are just not good at

352
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,560
developing themselves.

353
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,680
Mingyue,

354
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,960
the clothes are dirty.

355
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:57,840
I got it.

356
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,600
Brother,

357
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,480
I heard that you are in

358
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,840
some kind of school, right?

359
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,360
Yunlu School.

360
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,200
How about this?

361
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,360
Get a fund for your brother.

362
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,320
When I am in business,

363
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,360
you can count the money

364
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,320
in your room.

365
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,400
Okay.

366
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,240
Uncle,

367
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,520
I heard that you are a carpenter.

368
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,760
You are not good at business.

369
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,840
You are a carpenter.

370
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:23,640
Help me.

371
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,240
I want you to be a little antique.

372
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,440
Daodiang,

373
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,480
do you have the money to make money?

374
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,360
Give him some money.

375
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,320
I will give you the money to buy a car.

376
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,600
Okay.

377
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,640
Meizi,

378
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,360
you are in charge of the money in the house.

379
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,680
Be patient.

380
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,080
I will help you to make money.

381
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:48,480
How about it?

382
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,000
What do you want?

383
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:50,440
Xu Ningye.

384
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,800
First, don't quarrel.

385
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,040
I am thinking for this family.

386
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,320
Okay.

387
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,240
Mingyue.

388
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,120
Brother,

389
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,280
you have to take care of it.

390
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,920
What do you mean?

391
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,160
You owe this family

392
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,920
tens of years of money.

393
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,520
The rent of your room

394
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,600
is 632.5 yuan.

395
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,160
If you can make this family well,

396
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,080
you can change the clothes for your mother.

397
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:19,360
You can make money

398
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,880
by making money.

399
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,400
Make money?

400
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,920
It's impossible to make money.

401
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,960
I can't make money in my life.

402
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,480
Uncle,

403
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,640
I just said that you don't understand.

404
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,520
Go to your wife.

405
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,800
Hurry up.

406
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,840
You will deduct money

407
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,520
if you are late.

408
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,320
You...

409
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:37,760
Meizi,

410
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,600
don't be impulsive.

411
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,440
I didn't hear you.

412
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,840
Help me.

413
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,560
I will make money for you.

414
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,080
You don't need to wash clothes here.

415
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:44,760
I will wear you.

416
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:45,960
Lin Yan.

417
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,800
Go to play with Mu Maqian.

418
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,360
Xu Ningye.

419
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,240
Help!

420
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,760
Kill them!

421
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:11,800
I won't let you go!

422
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,240
I won't let you go!

423
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,280
I won't let you go!

424
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,280
I won't let you go!

425
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,560
I won't let you go!

426
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,080
I won't let you go!

427
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,280
I won't let you go!

428
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,960
I won't let you go!

429
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:26,240
No one can stop me from making money.

430
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,480
According to my guess,

431
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,320
today is the 15th year of the year.

432
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,880
It's not far from the end of March.

433
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,760
The business plan is officially starting.

434
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,280
I think

435
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,880
the world is using the blood to build a house.

436
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,640
There is a mirror.

437
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,520
Let's buy a mirror.

438
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,960
I know why

439
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,000
the invention failed.

440
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,600
All the things

441
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,640
were made by the Four Heavens.

442
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,480
Inventions are not allowed.

443
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,040
I can still be injured.

444
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,800
I believe that if there is no longer any medicine,

445
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,960
I can have a bright future.

446
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,200
You'd better think about it.

447
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,440
I have the limit.

448
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,840
Gongzi,

449
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,320
I have the limit.

450
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,480
Do you really want to buy it?

451
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,840
You're wrong.

452
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:18,560
I'm not buying it.

453
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,720
I'm just saying.

454
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,760
I'm not saying I'm not buying it.

455
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,520
So what's your profit?

456
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,040
Just tell me, boss.

457
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:29,120
The cost is 20,000 yuan.

458
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,480
It's the profit of the five-letter company.

459
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,280
I have another idea.

460
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,280
If I write out the five-letter novel

461
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,200
and the net text,

462
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,480
I can earn money by lying down.

463
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,040
Oh my god.

464
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,240
I give up.

465
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,480
I wrote out a few hundred million

466
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,520
with a pencil.

467
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,920
It's not realistic.

468
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:53,080
And I can't remember the content of the novel.

469
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,000
Okay.

470
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,920
The plan is temporarily suspended.

471
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,480
Actually, doing business is not that easy.

472
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,560
And it requires jazz.

473
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,560
1,000,000 yuan

474
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,600
Quick‧

475
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:14,800
Who′es?

476
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,120
Chang Le, keep your hand up,片子 long Philoogic

477
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,360
Fine.

478
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,720
I can go to eyesee the work day.

479
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,660
Blend into a big fan

480
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:39,040
to discover progress.

481
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,260
This is a beautifulаш so get some money

482
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:54,280
before you get off work.

483
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,380
Who lost the money?

484
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:03,200
Who lost the money?

485
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,800
Let's get some money.

486
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,400
I'm not getting any money.

487
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,400
You're so unlucky.

488
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,800
You can't break the case.

489
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,400
You lost your money.

490
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,000
Don't let me be a fool.

491
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,600
I'll kick you to death.

492
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,600
Xu Qian.

493
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,200
Why are you back?

494
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,000
Isn't it Liu Fangzi?

495
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,000
So...

496
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,400
the case broke?

497
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,400
Ning.

498
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:43,800
You're so unlucky.

499
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,200
You were in jail for a few days.

500
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,000
You were in the hospital.

501
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,400
You were killed by a broken-up wound.

502
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,000
You're in prison for a day.

503
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,600
You're chasing Wang Butong every day.

504
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,600
He ordered me to break the case.

505
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Wang Butong was in jail.

506
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
He couldn't get away.

507
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,000
But don't worry.

508
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:00,800
Ning.

509
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,200
You weren't there.

510
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,000
It's okay.

511
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,400
I'll ask for your help.

512
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I'll keep you

513
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,000
no matter what.

514
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,800
I'll be honest with you.

515
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,400
How about...

516
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,400
touching the fish?

517
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,400
Touching the fish?

518
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,000
You're touching the fish too?

519
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,400
I mean,

520
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,600
since the case is hard to handle,

521
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,200
it's a job.

522
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,000
It's not a fish.

523
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,200
Please relax.

524
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,400
Relax.

525
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,800
Touching the fish is good.

526
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,400
Ning.

527
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,200
You're right.

528
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,200
It's a job.

529
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,600
It's better to relax.

530
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,200
Don't worry.

531
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,000
We're all

532
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,600
the messengers of the prison.

533
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,400
We're all bad people.

534
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,200
Touching the fish?

535
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,800
You mean, you're looking for the body?

536
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,200
It's a head.

537
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,400
Although they're in prison,

538
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:25,400
they're not guilty.

539
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,400
You're talking about touching the fish?

540
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,400
How about

541
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,400
giving me the body?

542
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,200
I dare to ask you, Xu Bupai.

543
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,400
Who is the murderer?

544
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,800
Where is he?

545
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,200
The victim, Jiang Yourui,

546
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,800
is in the hospital.

547
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,000
He was left alone in the morning.

548
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:08,200
He was 20 years younger than himself.

549
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
20 years younger?

550
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,400
He's got a brain.

551
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,600
The old cow is really noisy.

552
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,600
Go!

553
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,400
But

554
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,800
the murderer is the one.

555
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,800
How did you two kill Zhang Yourui?

556
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,200
Find him from the pool.

557
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,600
Of course, we didn't kill him.

558
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,600
How could he kill his own father?

559
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,400
Let me ask you.

560
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,200
When the case was closed, where were you?

561
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:46,600
In the study.

562
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,200
Why didn't you kill him?

563
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,800
I was looking at the pictures.

564
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
And the witness.

565
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:54,200
Where did the witness come from?

566
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,200
Zhang Yang.

567
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:59,600
You married Zhang Yourui for 10 years.

568
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:02,200
Why are you pregnant now?

569
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,400
Tell me.

570
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,600
Are you dating the son of the emperor?

571
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,800
You're trying to kill your own father?

572
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:07,200
My lord.

573
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,200
I'm wronged.

574
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,800
I'm not well.

575
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:15,800
I was so ill that I couldn't get pregnant.

576
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,200
How could you do this?

577
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,200
My lord.

578
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,200
You said you were pregnant.

579
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,200
You said you saw the man who killed the man.

580
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:29,200
Why didn't you search the garden today?

581
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,800
You didn't find any footprints.

582
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,800
You didn't find any traces of flowers.

583
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:35,800
Well...

584
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:36,800
My lord.

585
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,800
How did the thief get into the house?

586
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,600
How did mother know?

587
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,600
If you can't find out,

588
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,800
you'll be punished by my mother.

589
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,000
You're so polite.

590
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,000
You even turned the tables.

591
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,600
This man looks like a seal.

592
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,600
He even turned the tables.

593
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:58,400
Guards.

594
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,400
Yes, my lord.

595
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,800
Give me the account book.

596
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:01,600
Yes, my lord.

597
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:03,600
My lord.

598
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,000
My lord, you're so cold.

599
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,000
My lord.

600
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,800
Are you going to fight Chengzhou?

601
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:19,000
The family is in a hurry.

602
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:20,600
Of course.

603
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,000
Aren't you afraid of being punished?

604
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:24,600
How dare you!

605
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,000
What's the meaning of the word?

606
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,000
The meaning...

607
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,000
The meaning...

608
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
The meaning...

609
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:45,000
Can't be used in front of the hall, right?

610
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
You...

611
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:51,800
You're so shy.

612
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,400
Zhu Jianling was going to fight Chengzhou.

613
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,200
Did you see the crowd?

614
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,400
How dare you!

615
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,600
How dare you!

616
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:01,200
My lord!

617
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:01,800
My lord!

618
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:02,800
My lord!

619
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:03,800
My lord!

620
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:04,800
My lord!

621
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:05,800
My lord!

622
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:06,800
My lord!

623
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:07,800
My lord!

624
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:08,800
My lord!

625
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:09,800
My lord!

626
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:10,800
My lord!

627
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:11,800
My lord!

628
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,800
My lord!

629
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:13,800
My lord!

630
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,800
We're not the only ones left.

631
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:16,800
I have a choice.

632
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:17,800
My lord!

633
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:18,800
My lord!

634
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:19,800
My lord!

635
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:20,800
My lord!

636
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:21,800
My lord!

637
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:22,800
My lord!

638
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:23,800
My lord!

639
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:24,800
My lord!

640
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:25,800
My lord!

641
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:26,800
My lord!

642
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:27,800
My lord!

643
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:28,800
My lord!

644
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:37,800
Don't be nervous.

645
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
I'm here to help you.

646
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,800
You can call me Xu San.

647
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:47,400
Xu San?

648
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,200
Yes.

649
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,200
In the evening,

650
00:27:49,400 --> 00:28:15,420
Li Cheng and Jiang Yourui went to the

651
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:24,600
trial together for the criminals.

652
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,200
Hence, you can cover up the crime

653
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,200
for the criminals.

654
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:35,200
Re système is a public threshold.

655
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:38,200
You can put to太 armor

656
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,400
to be blamed.

657
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:46,800
Everybody will let therap attack you.

658
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,160
My lord,

659
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,800
you can't be so bold.

660
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,880
The line is only the corner of the exit.

661
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,640
There's no corner of the house.

662
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,680
If there's a good way,

663
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,400
the escapee will be able to fund it.

664
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,000
It's impossible to leave the corner.

665
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,120
This is the first.

666
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:07,600
Second,

667
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,680
Zhang Youwei died in a fight.

668
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,160
He was forced to die.

669
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,840
The scene didn't find the tool to make the case.

670
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:16,440
It means the murderer was brought along.

671
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:21,320
Every thief will be punished at any time.

672
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,720
Isn't it a matter of love?

673
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:24,760
You can't say that.

674
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,400
Third,

675
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,400
when Zhang Youwei died,

676
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,640
the body was on the ground,

677
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,560
with the legs on the court.

678
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,120
The wound was on the back of the head.

679
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,920
This means the murderer was brought along.

680
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,280
So the thief was in the hospital.

681
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:41,400
And he was behind Zhang Youwei.

682
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,280
If he was a thief,

683
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,480
either he was a secret weapon or he was completely gone.

684
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:50,440
He was behind the main entrance

685
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:54,000
while the master was trying to kill him.

686
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,720
How is that possible?

687
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,760
He was almost alive.

688
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,000
The next one is the key.

689
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,760
When I came in,

690
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,080
the county magistrate gave me a statement.

691
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,000
Zhang Xian's statement.

692
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:14,880
What do you want?

693
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,960
I heard that...

694
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:23,800
Give me back my bag.

695
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,040
I want to know why you've come in.

696
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,160
I broke thesighs'

697
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:30,640
które

698
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,480
meeting the ruffial mask.

699
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,240
Why didn't you tell me that?

700
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,240
You forced all the things

701
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:37,240
that you wanted to do.

702
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,240
You killed the person.

703
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,240
So he wants to give you 500 taels of silver

704
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:48,240
and pay the price of the people in the family.

705
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:51,240
Use this statement as a reference

706
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,240
to understand this case.

707
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:08,240
I just said that I was here to help you.

708
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,240
As long as you confess to the crime,

709
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,240
you will be punished by the late Lord of the Alliance.

710
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:18,240
You will be punished by the death penalty.

711
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,240
Tang Zhen.

712
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,240
Tang Zhen.

713
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,240
You are so stupid.

714
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,240
How dare you call me a man?

715
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,240
This is my late Lord of the Alliance.

716
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,240
Even if it's the end of the world,

717
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,240
you have no right to interfere.

718
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,240
In the past years,

719
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,240
he dared to use the death penalty

720
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,240
that he was afraid of.

721
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,240
It must be a war.

722
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,240
I was also looking for it.

723
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,240
From Zhang Xian to the late Lord of the Alliance,

724
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,240
Xu Dane went to the Ministry of Justice

725
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,240
and didn't leave yet.

726
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,240
Let's talk about the conclusion.

727
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,240
It's not a good idea to let people go.

728
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,240
I think it's better to let people go first.

729
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:36,240
This matter can be a big deal.

730
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,240
You mean...

731
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,240
I heard that

732
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:42,240
Li Yucheng, Li Yingluo,

733
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,240
who was a man of the people,

734
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:45,240
was just appointed as the late Lord of the Alliance.

735
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,240
If he can make up for this matter,

736
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,240
he might be punished.

737
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:53,240
I think it's better to let people go.

738
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,240
I think it's better to let people go.

739
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,240
I think it's better to let people go.

740
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,240
Zhang Xian, you can go now.

741
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,240
It's delicious.

742
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,240
It's delicious.

743
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,240
Let's have a toast.

744
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,240
Cheers.

745
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,240
Here, have a taste.

746
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:27,240
I've got this

747
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,240
fresh and sweet orange.

748
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,240
Thank you.

749
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,240
Have a taste.

750
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,240
Thank you, Lord.

751
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,240
This case

752
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,240
is not bad.

753
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,240
I also want to

754
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,240
give you a little credit.

755
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,240
How many years have I been doing this?

756
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,240
I've never heard him say this.

757
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,240
Ninth Brother.

758
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,240
Brother Ding.

759
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,240
Let's have a toast.

760
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,240
Ninth Brother.

761
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,240
This case,

762
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:01,240
you're the head of the company.

763
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,240
Yes.

764
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,240
Yes.

765
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,240
Thank you, brothers.

766
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,240
Ninth Brother.

767
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:11,240
You don't look like a man.

768
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:12,240
We're so capable.

769
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:14,240
How can you break up with us?

770
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:15,240
Tell us.

771
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:16,240
Actually, it's nothing special.

772
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:18,240
That woman's ears are soft.

773
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,240
She's not surprised.

774
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:20,240
When she saw it,

775
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:22,240
when she saw the statement we wrote,

776
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:24,240
she was shocked.

777
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:26,240
Thank you.

778
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:27,240
Thank you.

779
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:28,240
Thank you so much.

780
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:29,240
Thank you so much.

781
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:30,240
Come on.

782
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:44,240
Head.

783
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:47,240
I heard that Zhang Xian was released.

784
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:50,240
Mingye.

785
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:52,240
As a fast-grower,

786
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:54,240
our duty has been done.

787
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:58,240
The rest is to be handled by the head.

788
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,240
Can you handle it?

789
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,240
Don't worry.

790
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,240
Come on.

791
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,240
No, no, no.

792
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,240
Wait.

793
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,240
If we can't handle it,

794
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,240
Zhang Yang will be dead.

795
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,240
After all, he provided the statement.

796
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,240
I told you to rest assured.

797
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,240
You put the letter in your stomach.

798
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,240
I saw it.

799
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,240
Chief Xu

800
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,240
has already dared to go to the gas station

801
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,240
with the statement.

802
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,240
Gas station?

803
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,240
What are you doing?

804
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:43,240
I'm here to see Li Yingluo,

805
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:45,240
the head of the county department of Changle.

806
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,240
The family is gone.

807
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,240
They are going out to work.

808
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:57,240
Chief Xu really went to the gas station?

809
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:01,240
This is the Wan Nian boat of Xiaoxin City.

810
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:03,240
We thought about a long-distance line,

811
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:06,240
but it was full of expensive and expensive goods.

812
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,240
Of course, we should be careful.

813
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:13,240
What is the matter in the gas station?

814
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,240
We can't handle it.

815
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,240
You drank too much.

816
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:21,240
Where is the big man?

817
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,240
Big man?

818
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,240
Big man?

819
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:30,240
The heaven's dance

820
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:33,240
is a firefly.

821
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:35,240
You really drank too much.

822
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,240
Where is the big man?

823
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:39,240
Who is the big man?

824
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,240
The big man.

825
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,240
Go, go, go.

826
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,240
Head.

827
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,240
Head.

828
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,240
Head.

829
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,240
Head.

830
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:49,240
The big man is the spy.

831
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,240
The heroine is the heroine.

832
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:53,240
I'm the heroine of Xiaoxin City.

833
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:55,240
I'm the heroine.

834
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:59,240
Especially Wei Yingwei.

835
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:01,240
Wait for me to go back to the water.

836
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,240
Okay.

837
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,240
When you have the chance to see him, you'll know.

838
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:08,240
My lord, we have a good plan.

839
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:11,240
Let's reward Mingyu.

840
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,240
I'm so happy.

841
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,240
Let's shake the money.

842
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,240
Head.

843
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,240
You are the rule.

844
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,240
I'm not.

845
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:20,240
Black.

846
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,240
Black.

847
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,240
Yes.

848
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,240
Just like you said.

849
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:24,240
Shake it.

850
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,240
Shake it.

851
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,240
Shake it.

852
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,240
Shake it.

853
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,240
Boss.

854
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,240
Come and drink some sugar.

855
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,240
Just a little.

856
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,240
Wait a minute.

857
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,240
Well,

858
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,240
take care.

859
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,240
Thank you, boss.

860
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:53,240
Why are you so quiet?

861
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,240
A group of people from the Five Great Trees

862
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,240
came to the water pool.

863
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:09,240
And a sip of sugar.

864
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:13,240
There must be a situation.

865
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:18,240
Second-class merit.

866
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,240
Take your water.

867
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:35,240
Be careful.

868
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:39,240
There is a problem.

869
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:43,240
The Great Trees are in a hurry.

870
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:45,240
The law is not allowed.

871
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,240
The law is not allowed.

872
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,240
The court is at 30.

873
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,240
Close the door.

874
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,240
The King of the Trees.

875
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,240
The court is at 50.

876
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,240
Die.

877
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,240
I'm going to...

878
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:06,240
Ouda Yai entered the prison for three years.

879
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,240
Let's go.

880
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:24,240
Boss, the ball is here.

881
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,240
Let's go.

882
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,240
The ball is here.

883
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:31,240
The dead is not dead yet.

884
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:42,440
Just kill perfection

885
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:46,540
Just kill perfection

886
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:06,620
Kill

887
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:08,680
Finish

888
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,800
Who's that?

889
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,600
cendo

890
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:29,440
No.

891
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:32,360
Come out.

892
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,580
I'm so happy to be back in the top qi class Live until that when I find you

893
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:44,320
everyone even I met me

894
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:47,480
I cry

895
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:50,840
All the time

896
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:04,760
Hello Daniel

897
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:07,800
So maybe I can go back

898
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:53,200
Su plateau

899
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,480
armor hunting did well

900
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:56,500
the efforts are

901
00:41:57,540 --> 00:42:03,380
I can not run away fromb

902
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,400
a mere plot

903
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,980
You are still a Ogre after all

904
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:41,400
The first round of the game is over.

905
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:43,400
The first round of the game is over.

906
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,400
The first round of the game is over.

907
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:47,400
The first round of the game is over.

908
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,400
The first round of the game is over.

909
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,400
The first round of the game is over.

910
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,400
The first round of the game is over.

911
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:55,400
The first round of the game is over.

912
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:57,400
The first round of the game is over.

913
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:59,400
The first round of the game is over.

914
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,400
The first round of the game is over.

915
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,400
The first round of the game is over.

916
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:05,400
The first round of the game is over.

917
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:07,400
The first round of the game is over.

918
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:09,400
The first round of the games is over.

919
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:11,400

920
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:13,400

00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,400
The first round of the game is over.

922
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:17,400
The first round of the game is over.

923
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:19,400
The first round of the game is over.

924
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:51,960
I will sing the song of the past, and sing the song of the future

925
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:55,440
You are my companion, I will sing the song of the past, and sing the song of the future

926
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,400
I will sing the song of the past, and sing the song of the future

927
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:59,400
I will sing the song of the past, and sing the song of the future

928
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:03,400
The world is not a city, but a place where we can meet

929
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:07,400
The fate is not fair, but it is not a city

930
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:11,400
The people are not cruel, they are cruel

931
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:16,400
Only want me to be the black and white part, and I will be the blue part of the road

932
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,400
Who is he?

933
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,400
Who is he?

934
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,400
Who is he?

935
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,400
Who is he?

936
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,400
Who is he?

937
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,400
Who is he?

938
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,400
Who is he?

939
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:35,400
Who is he?

940
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:39,400
Who is he?

941
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:41,400
Who is he?

942
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:43,400
Who is he?

943
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:47,400
I have lost my balance and blame the one for my nature

944
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:50,400
I lied and don't like to be gentle, and I feel the same as before

945
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,920
I was an abortion girl from North Harlem, and I consider my Lord

946
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:55,400
Who is he?

947
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:56,400
Who is he?

948
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,400
Who is he?

949
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,400
Who is he?

950
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:04,400
I have lost my balance and blame the one for my nature
