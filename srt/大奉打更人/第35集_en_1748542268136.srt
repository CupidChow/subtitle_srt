1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm afraid I'll be a little bit late

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm curious what I'm going to do

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I don't want to think about the future

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Let's make this night a quiet place

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
It's not too much

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
When you're here

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'll keep the rules

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'll keep my mouth shut

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'll get this big piece of Wanji

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
We're suddenly more like one step by step

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
We're suddenly

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
From the top to the bottom

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
We're suddenly

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
From the top to the bottom

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm never gonna add up

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
We're suddenly

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
From the top to the bottom

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
We're suddenly

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Why do you give me articles

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
pride in my heart

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
This hands are not able to salty

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,820
Imagine how long I'll spend

23
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:19,320
I'm in the Internet for now

24
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,880
Charity

25
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,080
Are a little bit despair

26
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,600
Do you know what I'm going to do

27
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,040
My memory is made by the curfew

28
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,220
of the ev Convenience Store

29
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,100
The ending of one year

30
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,480
is the end to all regrets

31
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:34,920
All the crossings have been torn

32
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:35,760
to pieces

33
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,600
and I'm just an offer

34
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:39,300
When my fate is finished

35
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,480
I'll make a decision

36
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,120
Request

37
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:54,600
And so advanced

38
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,820
Ties

39
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:57,820
I'm asking you.

40
00:01:58,820 --> 00:01:59,820
When did you open this place?

41
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:01,820
My Lord,

42
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,820
the Western Courtyard has never closed it.

43
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:05,820
Why did you open it?

44
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:06,820
What did you say?

45
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:26,820
Good.

46
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,820
The capital of the capital is Chuzhou.

47
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:31,820
The city walls in Chuzhou

48
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:33,820
are full of towns and villages.

49
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:34,820
The walls are solid.

50
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,820
The top three are high-end and high-end.

51
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:40,820
It's really a rare sight.

52
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,820
In the north of the town,

53
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:44,820
the city of Chuzhou is not as weak as the capital.

54
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:46,820
It seems that

55
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:47,820
the people of Chuzhou

56
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:50,820
have avoided many troubles.

57
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:08,820
Chuzhou

58
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:19,820
You!

59
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:35,820
Lord Zheng,

60
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:38,820
it's been three years since you left the capital.

61
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:45,820
General Li,

62
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:48,820
the north of the town is full of people.

63
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:50,820
Please wait for the next day

64
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:51,820
to leave the town.

65
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:52,820
No need.

66
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:53,820
I'll be there in time.

67
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:55,820
Let's go.

68
00:03:58,820 --> 00:03:59,820
The war in Chuzhou is normal.

69
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:00,820
It's normal.

70
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:05,820
Lord Zheng,

71
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,820
how can I help you?

72
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,820
I need the report of the border guards

73
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,820
and the documents of the cities in Chuzhou.

74
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:21,820
This is...

75
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:22,820
This is the man of the south palace,

76
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:24,820
the emperor and the officials of the palace.

77
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:25,820
I heard that

78
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,820
there are 3,000 blood-draining pictures in Chuzhou.

79
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:29,820
They asked me to investigate this matter.

80
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:31,820
I heard that

81
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:33,820
the chief official Xu Yin Luo is not well-known.

82
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,820
The picture is still dead.

83
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,820
Without the chief official,

84
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,820
this is a form of action.

85
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:43,820
Of course.

86
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,820
The documents of the cities in Chuzhou

87
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,820
can be read by you.

88
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,820
But the record of the border guards

89
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:56,820
is...

90
00:04:58,820 --> 00:04:59,820
It's not a record.

91
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:03,820
Only the chief official has the right to ask.

92
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:05,820
But

93
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:08,820
I can be the king of the north of the city.

94
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:09,820
But I'm not sure

95
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:11,820
I can get his approval.

96
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:14,820
Then you have to thank Lord Zheng.

97
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:17,820
In that case,

98
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,820
I'll take my leave.

99
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,820
How is the official of the city?

100
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:34,820
Don't worry, sir.

101
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:35,820
This man

102
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,820
has been in Chuzhou for many years.

103
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:38,820
He is a man of the people.

104
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,820
He is very considerate.

105
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:41,820
Such a character.

106
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,820
If there is really something in Chuzhou,

107
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:44,820
he can report that

108
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:45,820
there are 3,000 blood-draining pictures.

109
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:47,820
Is there anything wrong?

110
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,820
The picture is true.

111
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:51,820
Zheng Xin Huai just

112
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:53,820
killed the chicken.

113
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:00,820
Just give it back.

114
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:01,820
Who has killed him?

115
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,820
There are plenty ofcast and players.

116
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,820
The miscellaneous battle has been developed.

117
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:09,820
Actually,

118
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:11,820
we need to methodize the last way.

119
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:12,820
By the way,

120
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,820
the pass 크� operators

121
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,820
are showing differentamy to each move.

122
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:18,820
I'll introduce

123
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,820
the photo time when you run to Xiaowen.

124
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:21,820
Mr. Jiang isn't that person.

125
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:22,820
Please, Mr. Jiang.

126
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,140
정말横着,

127
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:26,780
Complete 15 bags of food at once!

128
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:50,100
First I should take the buns.

129
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,340
I don't feel right to leave

130
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:52,660
and walk around soon.

131
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:53,980
When my friend comes back

132
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:54,980
Here.

133
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:56,980
Come and eat some snacks.

134
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:58,980
Let's go.

135
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:03,980
Yu Qian.

136
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:05,980
You're back.

137
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:06,980
Where's the wallet?

138
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,980
Why are you so sure that your wallet is here?

139
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:10,980
It must be here.

140
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:11,980
Give it to me.

141
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:16,980
It's not over yet.

142
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:17,980
I'm almost there.

143
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:18,980
I know.

144
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:25,980
Here.

145
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:27,980
Take it.

146
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:30,980
Take it.

147
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:45,980
One gold melon is two silver.

148
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:49,980
One silver is two hundred.

149
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:50,980
Two hundred thousand.

150
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:51,980
Two hundred thousand?

151
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:54,980
I just gave him one gold melon.

152
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:58,980
Is it enough?

153
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:07,980
His ancestors were three generations.

154
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:09,980
They were close friends of his relatives.

155
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:10,980
They ate meat every day.

156
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:12,980
They don't have close friends.

157
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:16,980
They came all the way from Beijing.

158
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:18,980
The aristocrats killed their village.

159
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:19,980
Their relatives died.

160
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:21,980
The old man with the little one.

161
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:24,980
His grandson came here all the way.

162
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:29,980
Yu Qian.

163
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:32,980
When will you take me to Chuzhou?

164
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,980
You saw it all the way.

165
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:35,980
It's safe.

166
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:37,980
No bloodshed.

167
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:51,980
You're so stupid.

168
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:53,980
You're a ghost.

169
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:57,980
Do you want to see the world?

170
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:58,980
No.

171
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:00,980
I'm leaving.

172
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:01,980
Protect yourself.

173
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:03,980
You've been alone with me.

174
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:04,980
Yu Qian.

175
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:13,980
Bastard.

176
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:14,980
Stop it.

177
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:15,980
Look at this.

178
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:18,980
That's the secret of the king of Huai.

179
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:21,980
It's obvious that it's a murder.

180
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:24,980
The people of the Kui tribe are in the secret of the king of Kui.

181
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:28,980
So why don't we leave?

182
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:30,980
Why?

183
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:40,980
It's you.

184
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,980
You're going back to the West Coast.

185
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:44,980
You're going back to the West Coast.

186
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:45,980
You're in the school.

187
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:47,980
You can return in half an hour.

188
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,980
You're going to solve the problem?

189
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:51,980
Yu Qian.

190
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:13,980
Go.

191
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:15,980
Stay here.

192
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:20,980
Go.

193
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:34,980
Thank you for your help.

194
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:35,980
The situation was urgent.

195
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:36,980
I have to go.

196
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:37,980
Please excuse me.

197
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:39,980
I have to go?

198
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:44,980
Xu Qian and I

199
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:46,980
sent the order to Chuzhou.

200
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,980
We found the blood picture is 3,000 miles.

201
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:49,980
Xu Qian?

202
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,980
You're a criminal.

203
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:55,980
Who can hurt her?

204
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:59,980
She did have a scar on her neck.

205
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:01,980
Why did she bring a woman?

206
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:03,980
It's Princess Consort.

207
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:06,980
She is your princess.

208
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:10,980
Thank you for finding her.

209
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,980
You must be in a serious situation.

210
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:13,980
How about this?

211
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:14,980
I'll ask you a few questions.

212
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:16,980
I'll answer you in time.

213
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:17,980
I'll leave Princess Consort to you.

214
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:18,980
Please tell me.

215
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:20,980
The blood picture is 3,000 miles.

216
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:21,980
What's going on?

217
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:23,980
3,000 miles?

218
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:26,980
I don't know what's 3,000 miles.

219
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:27,980
How about this?

220
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,980
I'll go back to the camp with you.

221
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:31,980
I'll calm Princess Consort down.

222
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:32,980
After that,

223
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,980
if you need any help,

224
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:37,980
I'll cooperate with you.

225
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:39,980
When we arrive at the camp,

226
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:41,980
I'll be your fish on the board.

227
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:42,980
Right?

228
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:44,980
What are you talking about?

229
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:46,980
You're the chief officer of the emperor's family.

230
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,980
I don't want to bring you up.

231
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,980
But you're not telling the truth.

232
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:53,980
I'm looking at you with my forgotten number.

233
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,980
Forgotten number?

234
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:02,980
Lord Jin, don't be impulsive.

235
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,980
I want to investigate the case in the three counties.

236
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:06,980
I'm afraid I'll be blamed by the emperor.

237
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:08,980
I'm your sister.

238
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:09,980
But I have faith in you.

239
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,980
I hope you can be kind.

240
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:17,980
Listen.

241
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:20,980
First,

242
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:22,980
the princess is not kidnapped by the Kui tribe.

243
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:23,980
It's hard to keep it from me.

244
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,980
As long as you investigate it later,

245
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:26,980
the end of the group

246
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:29,980
is enough to get rid of the princess.

247
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:32,980
You don't need to prove who the emperor wants to deal with.

248
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:34,980
As long as he thinks you're the enemy.

249
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:36,980
Second,

250
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,980
you saved the princess and got the palace.

251
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:40,980
The emperor has been a soldier for many years.

252
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:42,980
What he likes the most is to reward and distribute the word.

253
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:45,980
As long as you give the princess the order,

254
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:47,980
Xu Yingluo will definitely be a good man.

255
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:50,980
Wei Yuan can only improve your position.

256
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,980
But Lord Huai is the king.

257
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,980
He can improve your position.

258
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:56,980
Keep talking.

259
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:58,980
Third,

260
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,980
the case is just a case.

261
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:03,980
It's not a case that will affect your reputation.

262
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:05,980
Why do you have to be a woman

263
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:06,980
who is not related to the case

264
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:09,980
and is not related to your own business?

265
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:11,980
The future is the most important.

266
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:12,980
Isn't it?

267
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,980
As you said,

268
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:20,980
as long as I stop the case

269
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:22,980
and hand over the princess,

270
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:25,980
Lord Huai will be able to save me

271
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,980
if he can't save me.

272
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:28,980
Of course.

273
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:32,980
A woman who has never seen him before

274
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:35,980
is so important to Lord Huai.

275
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:37,980
Can't stand it anymore.

276
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:40,980
It's okay to tell you.

277
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,980
Lord Huai is very important to you.

278
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,980
It's okay to tell you.

279
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:46,980
Lord Huai is not the one who is important to him.

280
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:48,980
He is the one who is in his body.

281
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:54,980
In his body?

282
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:55,980
Yes.

283
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:56,980
Lord Huai has two charges.

284
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:58,980
He needs the one in his body.

285
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:07,980
So the Kui Clan is fighting for the princess

286
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:08,980
because of Ling Yun?

287
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:09,980
Yes.

288
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:14,980
If Ling Yun is taken away,

289
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,980
what will I do?

290
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:17,980
You are a woman.

291
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:18,980
If Ling Yun is taken away,

292
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:20,980
you will not have any value.

293
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:35,980
Hello?

294
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:36,980
Xu Qian,

295
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:37,980
I have found out

296
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,980
that there is a way

297
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,980
to increase the power quickly

298
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:42,980
in the Kui Clan.

299
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:44,980
The power of Ling Lian Qi Jing.

300
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:46,980
Qi Jing?

301
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,980
The Kui Clan has a secret recipe.

302
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:50,980
It is a secret recipe for the Kui Clan

303
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:51,980
and Qi Clan of the human body.

304
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:52,980
It is a secret recipe for the Kui Clan.

305
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:53,980
It can be used as a tool

306
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:54,980
to break the Kui Clan's spirit.

307
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:56,980
Kui Clan?

308
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,980
You just said Kui Clan.

309
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:00,980
Yes.

310
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:01,980
Except for them,

311
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:03,980
no one can be so generous.

312
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:05,980
But this is a very serious matter.

313
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:08,980
Because if you want to break the Kui Clan's spirit,

314
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,980
and you want to break the Kui Clan's spirit,

315
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:13,980
the lives of the head of the clan

316
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,980
will be wasted.

317
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,980
Is Ling Yun

318
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:36,980
able to help you to enter the body?

319
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:42,980
What?

320
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:44,980
Why don't you take action?

321
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,980
How long have I been

322
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:49,980
at the river side?

323
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:52,980
About ten hours.

324
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:01,980
So,

325
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:03,980
why didn't you run away this time?

326
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:06,980
You have been in my life

327
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:07,980
for a long time.

328
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:10,980
You have been in my life for a long time.

329
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:12,980
I can't run away.

330
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:14,980
You have taken it back.

331
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:16,980
You have asked for the secret recipe.

332
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:18,980
In your north,

333
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:20,980
I wanted to use you

334
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,980
to stop the north king.

335
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,980
I have taken the time to investigate the case.

336
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,980
Now I know the case.

337
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:29,980
You are free.

338
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:08,980
Thank you.

339
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:12,980
Thank you.

340
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:22,980
Thank you,

341
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:26,980
but I don't know where I should go.

342
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:39,980
What a sour character.

343
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:43,980
I only ate it when I was a child.

344
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:46,980
I was a child.

345
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:48,980
I was a child.

346
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:50,980
I was very mature.

347
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:52,980
I went to the Imperial Buddha's temple

348
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:53,980
with my parents

349
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:55,980
at the age of nine.

350
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:57,980
After the four-leaf clover tree saw me,

351
00:17:58,980 --> 00:17:59,980
I wrote a poem.

352
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,980
It was a great poem.

353
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:04,980
How did you say it?

354
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:05,980
I heard it.

355
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,980
But my parents and my parents

356
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:10,980
were very good at protecting me.

357
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:12,980
I only knew when I was a child

358
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:15,980
that they didn't love me.

359
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:19,980
I was afraid that the precious goods

360
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:21,980
would be given away.

361
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:23,980
Finally,

362
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:25,980
at my thirteen,

363
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:27,980
the emperor sent me to the gate

364
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:28,980
to enter the palace.

365
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:30,980
After I entered the palace,

366
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,980
I only met the emperor once.

367
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:36,980
I was cold-blooded.

368
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:39,980
I didn't know the reason

369
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:42,980
and gave it to the king of Huai

370
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:44,980
as his dowry.

371
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:47,980
I was always a goods

372
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:48,980
and kept giving it to others.

373
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:51,980
If I lose the value one day,

374
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:54,980
I will be humiliated.

375
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:58,980
So you used me

376
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:00,980
to take me as a horse

377
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:01,980
and make me the emperor of Zhenbei.

378
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:03,980
I didn't blame you at all.

379
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:05,940
I am your son.

380
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:08,940
Since

381
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:12,980
I may be near you,

382
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:14,980
I won't hold a grudge

383
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:19,980
to my life.

384
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:21,820
Siyang,

385
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:23,980
your father and feminism

386
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:26,980
were time-consuming,

387
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:28,980
right?

388
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:30,980
He was so mean and straightforward.

389
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:31,980
I am afraid that

390
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:33,080
we would have great 빤 Mariakishap

391
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,080
in my family.

392
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:35,940
If possible,

393
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:39,180
I'll kill him.

394
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:00,980
Hello?

395
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:01,740
Xu Qian,

396
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:03,580
I have a big discovery.

397
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:05,180
I can't believe it.

398
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:07,980
Do you know who the third brother of the blood is?

399
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:09,740
Zhenzhen.

400
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:11,980
How do you know?

401
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:15,780
Why are you so quick?

402
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:17,380
What's the problem?

403
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:19,780
Director,

404
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:21,180
this is not the key.

405
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:24,980
Xu Qian,

406
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:27,380
I have a guest here.

407
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:29,580
He said that his master

408
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:32,380
knew the real location of the third brother of the blood.

409
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:34,780
What?

410
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:36,980
Tell me.

411
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:38,580
What?

412
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:39,980
He's so cautious.

413
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:41,180
I have no chance

414
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:42,380
to tell him the truth.

415
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:44,180
Actually,

416
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:45,380
as long as I get close to him,

417
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:46,780
he'll be dead.

418
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,180
Ning Si doesn't want to take me

419
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,180
to see his partner.

420
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:50,580
Do they have any conditions?

421
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:52,380
Yes.

422
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:53,180
You.

423
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:54,180
Me?

424
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:54,780
Yes.

425
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:56,180
He said he wanted to see

426
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:58,180
the chief officer of the third brother of the blood, Xu Yun Luo.

427
00:20:58,580 --> 00:20:59,380
Before that,

428
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:00,380
he said nothing.

429
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:02,580
Okay, I got it.

430
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:04,580
What's wrong?

431
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:08,180
I have to go.

432
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:09,580
Why are you going?

433
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:10,580
To see your husband.

434
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:12,180
Oh, right.

435
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:15,380
You go to the most famous building in Shih He Jun.

436
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:16,780
Find a girl named Xing Er.

437
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:17,580
She'll protect you.

438
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:19,380
Will you be the king of Zhenbei?

439
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,180
But then,

440
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:23,980
I wish you a happy 100 years.

441
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:24,780
I'm going.

442
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:28,180
Why did you get hurt?

443
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:29,180
Dawang left.

444
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:30,180
Who gave you the idea?

445
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:32,180
Go.

446
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:33,300
Did you use the name

447
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:34,580
net or do you want to blend?

448
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:35,580
You're dreaming?

449
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:36,580
Nope!

450
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:39,060
I had going out

451
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:40,900
to play with Grandpa.

452
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:42,380
Quit air cuandoodoазe.

453
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:43,180
Stop with the aud� about it.

454
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:44,180
The reason is that

455
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:45,300
you need curtailaring programmes

456
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:46,180
with little hands.

457
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,020
Work out the daily preferred peers.

458
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:47,820
No need to be tyέςada.

459
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:48,380
No need .

460
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:48,580
Pین 😊

461
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:51,300
You want to know

462
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,940
many types of curtailing symptoms

463
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:53,900
of acat's canoe.

464
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:56,800
If you can't defeat her,

465
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,460
you must be alive.

466
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,020
Get up.

467
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:05,240
Get up.

468
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,160
Our tuppered kız?

469
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:14,820
He seems to have a serious operation.

470
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:16,940
I need to wait.

471
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:18,440
There's no need.

472
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:19,940
income.

473
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:20,740
No need.

474
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:22,820
Just go with him.

475
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:27,300
Ning Yan.

476
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,140
Xu Qi.

477
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:52,540
What's wrong?

478
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:53,980
I'm about to fall.

479
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:00,060
Where is he?

480
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:01,900
I let him come here

481
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:03,060
to avoid suspicion.

482
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:03,780
Smart.

483
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:05,020
Let's meet up

484
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:06,020
and talk to him.

485
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:06,660
Okay.

486
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:08,300
The problem is...

487
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:09,940
Xia probiotics.

488
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:12,820
Ye Qi.

489
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:17,700
Hello.

490
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:21,220
Xin,

491
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:24,860
Qing Mei has gone to an appointment with him.

492
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:25,900
New customer.

493
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:28,020
Say something.

494
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:35,620
Tell me.

495
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,620
Is this a trap?

496
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:40,940
No.

497
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:41,980
What do you mean?

498
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:48,340
Xu Qi!

499
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:52,900
I can't stand it anymore.

500
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:54,660
Let's talk about it when there's someone else.

501
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:57,220
By the way,

502
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:58,780
send someone to the kitchen

503
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:00,100
and bring the male worker here.

504
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:01,220
I'm going.

505
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:09,460
Mr. Lu.

506
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:11,060
The car is not bad.

507
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:12,100
Get up!

508
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:13,060
Someone's coming.

509
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,860
Why are you so slow?

510
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:25,580
Brother,

511
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:27,140
you're Zhao Jing?

512
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:29,420
It's me.

513
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,500
Who's your master?

514
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:34,220
Why are you here?

515
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:39,220
Mr. Xu.

516
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:42,340
You're Xu Qi?

517
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:46,820
Why are you here?

518
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,580
You know the evidence on the vulnerable group in Chu,

519
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:50,340
right?

520
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,340
Mr. Xu reported the case

521
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:51,780
secretly

522
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:52,660
to the exit team

523
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:54,860
in order to investigate them by voting in secret.

524
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:57,380
Well done.

525
00:24:59,100 --> 00:24:59,780
Mr. Xu.

526
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:00,380
Yes.

527
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:01,660
You tried to defame me,

528
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:03,360
but made you ally

529
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:04,800
against the rules

530
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:06,460
and był gled at the court.

531
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:07,060
Well.

532
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:08,500
But I think

533
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:09,660
the best match is

534
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:10,860
the high tempo

535
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:12,700
for the audience at at least 1 in 100,000.

536
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:13,820
I think

537
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:15,420
you need to use your hot blood

538
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:17,100
instead.

539
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:17,740
How come

540
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:19,140
the problem

541
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:21,620
is already fully discarded?

542
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:34,780
So close!

543
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,020
Come on.

544
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:39,660
I don't think it's worth mentioning.

545
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:41,580
Who is your master?

546
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:44,260
My master is from the State of Chu.

547
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:45,740
Zheng Xinhuai.

548
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:04,980
Sir,

549
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:06,700
there's a move on the side of the flying girl.

550
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:18,740
No way.

551
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:21,580
Zheng Xinhuai is in the State of Chu.

552
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,180
How could he be your master?

553
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:23,980
No way.

554
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:26,660
We'll leave the State of Chu after we get out of there.

555
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:28,300
We can only

556
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:30,900
hide in the wilderness in the secret restaurant in the north.

557
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:31,860
From now on,

558
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,660
we'll never go to the State of Chu.

559
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:36,980
Hello.

560
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,020
Sir.

561
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:40,180
How could Zheng Xinhuai be your master?

562
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:44,140
We just needed to see him by himself.

563
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:54,860
I come to see your master.

564
00:26:59,020 --> 00:26:59,540
What's the matter?

565
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:01,740
Chang Xiao is so fit and garden- attempting.

566
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:03,700
He is도

567
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:04,820
he doesn't really study.

568
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:06,580
Where is she?

569
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:07,500
Where is she?

570
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:08,980
The hair cut.

571
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:16,900
Wait.

572
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:26,500
Send Yutong in.

573
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:29,820
Leave me the car here.

574
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:30,940
You need to leave first.

575
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:34,120
Xiao Xiao.

576
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,000
Xiaorou,

577
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:08,280
I have less martial arts in my life.

578
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,760
You are also one of them.

579
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,120
Did you go out just now?

580
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,280
Then try again.

581
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:21,960
Just try.

582
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:37,160
Ending

583
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,480
It's here.

584
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:06,600
Umm, we can't let go of your loving two hands.

585
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,600
Zhaixing and Lin are the same.

586
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,120
Then what happened next?

587
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,720
Both of them came wasn't there?

588
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,560
You watch everything.

589
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:16,640
It's not as if you want to be to worry about the future.

590
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,140
After the sake oficky Main永,

591
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:21,140
you will have to face the world.

592
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:26,920
Red and P Follow, Red and P Follow

593
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,360
On the other hand,

594
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:32,760
Tao Ling won by strong Jiang you are a far déjeuner.

595
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:33,560
I'll go.

596
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,360
Are you Xu Yingluo?

597
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:55,960
Yes.

598
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,360
I'm Zheng Xinghuai,

599
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,160
from the Guzheng clan of Chuzhou.

600
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,360
This is not the place to talk.

601
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:07,560
Please come in.

602
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,560
They are all the guests in my house.

603
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,960
When they came out,

604
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,160
there were more than twenty people.

605
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,760
Now, there are only a few of them.

606
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,760
If I were to save them,

607
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,360
I would die too.

608
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,160
After we left Chuzhou,

609
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:50,560
we also asked for the help of the Jianghu and Haojie.

610
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,760
We sent a message to the old friend

611
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,160
who gave me the old friend of Prince Zhenbei.

612
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,560
I met someone before.

613
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:00,560
He told me about the 3000-liter blood

614
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,960
before he died.

615
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:03,960
He...

616
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,760
He had a mark on his face.

617
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:13,760
3000-liter blood.

618
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,560
He's Qian Youyi.

619
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,960
Why didn't you directly contact Prince Zhenbei

620
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:32,960
at the Chuzhou observation ground?

621
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:34,960
It's useless.

622
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,960
That would only harm them.

623
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,360
Once the news is out,

624
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,960
Prince Zhenbei will be arrested.

625
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,760
And you saw it too.

626
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,760
Chuzhou is still in good condition.

627
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,560
Who would believe it?

628
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,560
But you should know that

629
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,960
the court sent a team to investigate it.

630
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:56,960
Mr. Xu,

631
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:58,960
we heard from Zhao Chong

632
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,960
that he will send the message back.

633
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,960
But we don't dare to find the truth.

634
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,160
There are only a few of them.

635
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:09,760
We're afraid that they might be killed.

636
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,760
Please allow Yingluo

637
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,360
to be arrested.

638
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:28,360
Yingluo is being arrested by the Chuzhou people.

639
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:30,560
Mr. Zhen.

640
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,160
Mr. Zhen, please get up.

641
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,360
Since you're here,

642
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:36,960
I'm sure you'll give

643
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:39,360
a explanation to the Chuzhou people.

644
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:41,360
But before that,

645
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:42,360
I need to know

646
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,560
the details of the 3000-liter blood.

647
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,360
Yao Zhen, please tell me the truth.

648
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:49,360
Yes, sir.

649
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,360
Mr. Zhen,

650
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:57,760
close your eyes.

651
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,760
The only thing that I can tell you is the details of the picture.

652
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,160
They're Zheng Qinghuai's family.

653
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:10,160
I'm going to speed up his memory

654
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,760
with the sight of Zheng Qinghuai.

655
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:12,760
Sister,

656
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,360
I have one too.

657
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,160
Mr. Zhang,

658
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:19,360
I'm sorry.

659
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:21,160
I'm sorry.

660
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:21,960
I'm sorry.

661
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:22,760
I'm sorry.

662
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:23,560
I'm sorry.

663
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,160
Mr. Zhang, please calm down.

664
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,560
Erlang is mistaken.

665
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:27,760
Let him come back for dinner.

666
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:30,960
Here.

667
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,160
Erlang,

668
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:38,160
you're now a couple of people.

669
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:38,960
Mr. Zhang.

670
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,160
Why are you still

671
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,160
so stubborn and ungrateful?

672
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,560
You can't be like your brother.

673
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:50,760
Dad,

674
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,160
I'm just drinking.

675
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:53,760
I'm not a bad person.

676
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:54,960
I'm not a bad person.

677
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:56,760
I'm not wrong.

678
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,760
Why are you still talking about me?

679
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,160
Dad, calm down.

680
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:02,760
Erlang is mistaken.

681
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:03,960
Next month,

682
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,560
my father will be in a big trouble.

683
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,360
I want to go home and see him.

684
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:08,760
Are you crazy?

685
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:10,760
The Kui Clan is so fierce outside.

686
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:12,760
Chu Zhongcheng is so close to the ice.

687
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:13,960
He's so confused.

688
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:15,760
What if he meets the Kui Clan?

689
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,560
He's a coward.

690
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,960
How could I give birth to you?

691
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:22,560
You...

692
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,760
Erlang, you're wrong.

693
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:24,560
Sir,

694
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:27,160
he's a big threat to the Kui Clan.

695
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:29,160
He's a threat to the Kui Clan?

696
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,160
Where? Who's the leader?

697
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,760
The people are in the four directions in the northeast and northwest.

698
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:35,560
The leader is the commander of the Kui Clan.

699
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,160
The Ministry of Defense is very brave.

700
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:39,360
He should be in the south now.

701
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:40,560
The Kui Clan?

702
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:41,360
Is it...

703
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:41,960
Yes.

704
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,560
I want to go see him.

705
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,360
You two go with me.

706
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:47,960
Dad, thank you.

707
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,960
Uncle Zhao,

708
00:34:58,060 --> 00:34:59,960
Let's go together!

709
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:14,060
Hello, another boy!

710
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:14,860
What?

711
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,560
I 안head I tai,

712
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,560
whom does Da父 y'all piękwa sliao irm duwet?

713
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:19,680
All of you

714
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,960
know Da Father's is Double Prime?

715
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,860
what you were talking about

716
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:29,660
So what are you doing

717
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:33,400
Get out

718
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:36,960
Get out

719
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:41,120
Get out

720
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,160
Come on.

721
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,080
Come on.

722
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,080
Come on.

723
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,080
Come on.

724
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,080
Come on.

725
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,080
Come on.

726
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:53,080
Duke Huo, what do you want to do?

727
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,080
Lord Zheng,

728
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,080
you came just in time.

729
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,080
I came to ask you.

730
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:01,080
The imperial clan entered the military gate

731
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,080
and killed the robbers.

732
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,080
It's a great deal.

733
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,080
Do you know

734
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:07,080
why?

735
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:10,080
What does this have to do with the people?

736
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:12,040
Of course it has to do with the people.

737
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:14,040
As the people of Dafaeng,

738
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:16,040
the security of Dafaeng's border

739
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:19,040
is to attack the robbers and kill the robbers.

740
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,040
The official policy

741
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:24,040
is that what I said

742
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,040
makes sense.

743
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:32,040
It's a great deal.

744
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,040
Everyone, follow me.

745
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,040
Let's go home.

746
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,040
Okay.

747
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,080
Let's go.

748
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,080
Brother Qu Yongxiu,

749
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:53,080
you dare to kill the people.

750
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,080
Do you want to rebel?

751
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,080
Don't worry, Lord Zheng.

752
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:02,080
It's your turn soon.

753
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,080
Go.

754
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,080
Go.

755
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,080
Go.

756
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,080
Li Hai, take the people away first.

757
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:15,080
Kill them all.

758
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:17,080
None of them can be killed.

759
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,080
Old Yu.

760
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,080
Old Yu.

761
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:36,080
Old Yu, you're awake.

762
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,080
Master, you're awake.

763
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,080
Don't worry.

764
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,080
We'll take you out.

765
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,080
Father,

766
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:48,080
did Qu Zuchang come in?

767
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,080
No, father.

768
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:51,080
He killed the people.

769
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,080
We have to get out of here quickly.

770
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,080
Okay.

771
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,080
Captain Tang,

772
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,080
let's go.

773
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,080
Li Hai.

774
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:18,080
Li Hai.

775
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,080
Mother.

776
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:23,080
Tong Xin.

777
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,080
Tong Xin.

778
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,080
Mother.

779
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:27,080
Don't come near me.

780
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,080
I...

781
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,080
Lord Zheng,

782
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:46,080
where are you going?

783
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,080
Qu Yongxiu.

784
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:54,080
What are you going to do?

785
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:58,080
Do you want to rebel?

786
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:00,080
Qu Xun, you're a bastard.

787
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:02,080
Why do you need to rebel?

788
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,080
Qu Yongxiu.

789
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:05,080
Lord Zheng,

790
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:08,080
you're not allowed to act in public.

791
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:11,080
You're not allowed to act in public.

792
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:12,080
Before,

793
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,080
Lord Zheng,

794
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:15,080
you were in charge of the military case.

795
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:17,080
You killed three of my three men

796
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:19,080
in the battle of military.

797
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:21,080
Do you know

798
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,080
that you'll be here today?

799
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:28,080
This is all from the past.

800
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,080
You've got it.

801
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,080
What?

802
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,080
What?

803
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,080
Xiao'er.

804
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:45,080
Don't...

805
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:46,080
Don't be afraid.

806
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:49,080
You won't die.

807
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:56,080
Qu Yongxiu.

808
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:58,080
Qu Yongxiu.

809
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:08,080
Huai.

810
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:21,080
He's gone.

811
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:23,080
The battle is over.

812
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:28,080
Xiao'er.

813
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:39,080
Huai.

814
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:42,080
I'll go out first.

815
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:52,080
Xiao'er.

816
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:58,080
Xiao'er.

817
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:29,080
Is it Chu Zhou City?

818
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:31,080
The place with 3,000 blood.

819
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:34,080
Yes.

820
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:42,080
Sorry.

821
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:44,080
I'm sorry.

822
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:52,080
We need to go to Chu Zhou City.

823
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:54,080
Before we die,

824
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:56,080
we need to organize the death penalty.

825
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:58,080
We need to look at the map again.

826
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:02,080
Lord Zheng's map

827
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:04,080
is for the gold and gold list.

828
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:05,080
It's for the second level.

829
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:08,080
But the time needed for the train to arrive is up.

830
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:10,080
So he chose Chu Zhou City.

831
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:13,080
He's in charge of the four main buildings

832
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:14,080
and all the people.

833
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:16,080
But I've met many soldiers

834
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:18,080
from Chu Zhou City.

835
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:20,080
They don't know about the people

836
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:22,080
who killed Lord Zheng.

837
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:24,080
They may have been modified.

838
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:26,080
They may not know

839
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:28,080
what they did.

840
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:30,080
But no matter what,

841
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:32,080
they can't do it without a father.

842
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:35,080
So Lord Zheng and his helpers

843
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:39,080
are helping him with other things.

844
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:40,080
Lord Wu.

845
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:41,080
Yes.

846
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:54,080
The legend of the Red Cross

847
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:55,080
is about to begin.

848
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:56,080
He's the general.

849
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:57,080
All the good brands.

850
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:59,080
If you like it, bring it home.

851
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:00,080
The top brands

852
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:02,080
are all the brands you want.

853
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:03,080
The price you like

854
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:05,080
is all in the top brands.

855
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:25,080
The legend of the Red Cross

856
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:27,080
is about to begin.

857
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:29,080
The people who killed Lord Zheng

858
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:31,080
are all the brands you want.

859
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:33,080
