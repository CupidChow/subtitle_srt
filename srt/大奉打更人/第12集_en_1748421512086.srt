1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm a friend who has lost all the tears

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I'm afraid I'll be a little bit late

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I'm curious what I'm talking about

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I don't want to think about the future

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
The whole book in my mouth

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Let this bowl of soup and a piece of cake

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
It's not too much

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
When you're here

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I'll give you the rules

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I'll keep my mouth shut

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'll take this big piece of bowl

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
We're all like a step by step

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
We're all like a step by step

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
We're like a step by step

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Me and my enemies

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
We're all together

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
We're all like a step by step

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
We're all like a step by step

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Everyone appears in my heart

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,820
I can't focus my both hands

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm looking at the disc with too many heart pauses

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,960
Looking back, I'm needing more more

23
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,000
The time has passed and my heart wants to change

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Don't you dare butterfly

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Xiaohou, Xiaohou, Tsinghua, ChupShop

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Episode 1

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:40,000
The End

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Episode 1

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The End

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Episode 1

31
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
The throat hurts.

32
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I can't take it.

33
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I can't either.

34
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
The throat is dry and it hurts.

35
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
It might be the virus.

36
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
It's a disease.

37
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
It's a disease.

38
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Episode 1

39
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
The End

40
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Episode 1

41
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
No.

42
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I'm just a small person.

43
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I think you don't need to hide this.

44
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Can you return the mirror?

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Episode 1

46
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Are you all right?

47
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
If you're all right, let's go.

48
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I'll be on the road tomorrow.

49
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
No.

50
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
You've been staying here for so long.

51
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Can you tell me your true name?

52
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Xing Mu Ge Ping.

53
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I'm not a man of your word.

54
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I'm Chen Jing Nan.

55
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
You made this?

56
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Yes.

57
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
But there are some coincidences.

58
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Tell me.

59
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
You can see that the He Xing Cheng Yuan of the Heavenly Emperor

60
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
is a long-time member and also a supporter of the Yushu Mirror.

61
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
With the name of the Mirror,

62
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
No. 1 is now in the capital.

63
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
He's a man of the court who is not afraid of the small things.

64
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
No. 6, Xing Ge Ge Zhi.

65
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Nice to meet you.

66
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
He's a good breakthrough.

67
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
No. 3, Ying Jun Xiao Sa.

68
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Xing Ge is a man of the word.

69
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
He's a man of the word.

70
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
He's a man of the word.

71
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
He's really a man of the word.

72
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
As for No. 5, No. 7, No. 8,

73
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
we've got no discussion on this until now.

74
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
No. 2, Li Miao Zhen.

75
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
He's in Yun Zhou,

76
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
he's hot-tempered and has a good name,

77
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
He's called the Flying Pigeon.

78
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
No. 4, Chu Yuan Zhen.

79
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
He's a big disciple of the Ling Bao Ge.

80
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
They're similar in style and have been dating for a long time.

81
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Chu Yuan Zhen.

82
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
He's a man of the word.

83
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
He's a man of the word.

84
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
No. 10, Wei Gong.

85
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Li Miao Zhen is a man of the word.

86
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
There's been a long battle between the two.

87
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
There must be a battle between the two.

88
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Do you have any questions about the purpose of the Tian Di Society?

89
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Jin Lian said that the first leader is the master of the sect.

90
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
So he's the one who's the master of the Tian Di Society.

91
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:46,020
They've split upmond seedlings have any choosing between the three other?

92
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,900
They convinced them to?

93
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:51,900
They hope they'll do well in their job in the future.

94
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:55,020
Secretly możemy.

95
00:04:55,020 --> 00:05:04,120
I still have no idea what'sемoch

96
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,920
What do you think this is about the first?

97
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,480
Yes.

98
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,280
I meant

99
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,680
the position of 먹는 Taoist

100
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,000
as a mayor

101
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,440
may come Laoduo.

102
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,120
From now on in

103
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,080
you may work

104
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,480
in the panel or

105
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,280
with higher audience.

106
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,120
When you need some,

107
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,440
do me a favour!

108
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,840
Yes!

109
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,320
You'veudent enough, I guess.

110
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,520
I've been practicing the juexue for a long time.

111
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,520
I'll ask Li Yu to pick one for you

112
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,000
until the time you're in the Cangjing Pavilion.

113
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,640
Are you using a knife or a sword?

114
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:46,640
A knife.

115
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,040
A knife.

116
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,400
When choosing a sword,

117
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,640
you must choose a simple and pure knife.

118
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,440
You don't need to change all the complicated and fancy things.

119
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:57,720
Remember,

120
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,880
the dancers and other body parts are different.

121
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,920
There are not many gods and demons.

122
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,240
There are only monsters.

123
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:05,960
So,

124
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,800
the simpler the dancers are, the better.

125
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,640
In the future, you'll understand

126
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,120
the more advanced you are.

127
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,840
Thank you for your help.

128
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,280
The juexue is so good.

129
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,560
It's a good place to play.

130
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,360
Wei Gong asked me to do it.

131
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,080
I can't help it.

132
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:43,720
This way, please.

133
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,920
No need. Let me do it.

134
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:55,040
There are 407 knives in the secret library.

135
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,840
They're all here.

136
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,680
I'll go and get them.

137
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,520
Do you want to ask me

138
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,640
which of the most powerful knives in the secret library?

139
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,960
There are two types of juexue.

140
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:17,000
One is ji and the other is dao.

141
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,120
Don't think about the latter.

142
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,320
The sweet one is not as weak as the strong one.

143
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,280
It's just a person.

144
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,520
This is my Yanxi knife.

145
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,480
Do you want to tell me?

146
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,640
70 or 20?

147
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,760
When you choose,

148
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:40,040
you must choose the simple and pure knife.

149
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,280
You can't change all the complicated and fancy ones.

150
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:47,640
Caoer,

151
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,440
I think this knife is too wonderful.

152
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,320
I'm afraid it can't be used in my palace.

153
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,200
Don't say it's you.

154
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:01,720
Even I'm not fully familiar with the content here.

155
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,120
Choose one yourself.

156
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,280
Yes.

157
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,000
Fire Cloud God Palace.

158
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,120
There's really something like this.

159
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,200
Jiu Long's method.

160
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,120
I'm not good at learning this.

161
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,960
One hundred and thirty-six knives in a juexue.

162
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,440
What kind of knife is this?

163
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,440
It's not that good.

164
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:29,880
It's not done yet.

165
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,560
Is there a new juexue?

166
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,120
I know.

167
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,120
Two days ago, I sent a juexue to the palace.

168
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,040
I asked the master to make a magic weapon.

169
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,400
I sent it back to the school.

170
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,120
Otherwise, it's like a paper.

171
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,720
Magic weapon?

172
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:48,520
That's a good idea.

173
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,680
Bro, please bring it here.

174
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,040
I want to study it.

175
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:52,800
Okay.

176
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,280
One knife.

177
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:04,560
There's nothing that can't be broken with one knife.

178
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:08,920
If there is, my suggestion is to run away.

179
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,560
The enemy of the five is the most natural.

180
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,520
How can you run away easily?

181
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:21,360
One knife is like a heartless fish.

182
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,280
The world can be broken.

183
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,880
When you find something,

184
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,120
kill it.

185
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,080
There is a man who can break your heart in the earth.

186
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:39,880
He can't save remaining exist for long.

187
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,360
Even if the гр geschengdom of the dropping soils means

188
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,360
in the earth.

189
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,600
Look at this.

190
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,320
It's intentional and elegant.

191
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,160
And i don't get it.

192
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:52,760
I think...

193
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,700
What exactly would be preserved in the future,

194
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,860
the samänderttening correctivesfect anymore.

195
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:59,440
One last chance,

196
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,400
Pyre?

197
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,760
Nothing.

198
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,000
Just he.

199
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,440
Earth moon sword?

200
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,500
It is true.

201
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:12,660
I have told him

202
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:21,920
to show firm watermelon

203
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,760
Well...

204
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,320
What's the matter?

205
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,680
After Xu Tongluo learned this,

206
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,080
he needs to learn 300 or 200 words,

207
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,320
saying he didn't have enough money to make it up.

208
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,800
I don't think he would want to give it to him.

209
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,320
He should deduct it from his salary.

210
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,880
Yes.

211
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,920
Situ Tianjian.

212
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:47,840
Teacher,

213
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,400
with Wei Gong's plan,

214
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,720
we should be able to find out

215
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,440
what he's doing.

216
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,520
It's okay.

217
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,320
Anyway,

218
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,080
we can't hide it from him.

219
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,320
I really can't hide it from you.

220
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,440
It's indeed Princess Huaiqing's plan.

221
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,640
I knew it.

222
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,760
It's too coincidental that

223
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,120
she came here today.

224
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,480
I visited Situ Tianjian before.

225
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,360
I followed the witness

226
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,840
and asked her to take care of him.

227
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,960
You know this well,

228
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,640
but you're too much.

229
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,440
You can't tell anyone

230
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,440
about this.

231
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,240
You're not Situ Tianjian.

232
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,440
You're just a spy.

233
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,040
You're not guilty.

234
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,240
About this?

235
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,440
What happened today?

236
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,640
I...

237
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,240
I think I've lost my memory.

238
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,440
I don't remember

239
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:41,840
what happened today.

240
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,840
I'm here.

241
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,240
I'm here.

242
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,640
I'm here to help you.

243
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,240
I'll treat you to a drink today.

244
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,640
Sit.

245
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,240
Mr. Nian.

246
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,240
Princess Huaiqing

247
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,440
is a noble and virtuous lady.

248
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,440
She's a noble and virtuous lady.

249
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,840
She's a good woman.

250
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,440
She's my wife.

251
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,440
Come on.

252
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,240
I'll drink.

253
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,240
Let's start with the princess.

254
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,840
Thank you for your mercy.

255
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,840
Cheers.

256
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,440
Cheers.

257
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,240
It's your turn.

258
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,440
You're the senior

259
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,840
of the position of the court.

260
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,040
Cheers.

261
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,040
You mean

262
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,040
you're willing to follow me

263
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,640
to reward me?

264
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,640
Of course.

265
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,440
If someone

266
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,640
rewards you more,

267
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,840
and rewards you more,

268
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,440
even if it's not Huaiqing,

269
00:12:59,040 --> 00:12:59,840
will you

270
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,040
be willing to follow me?

271
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,040
How is that possible?

272
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,440
Although I'm not like the master of the treasure,

273
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,040
I know how to repay you.

274
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,240
I won't be the one

275
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,640
who's been cursed by the master.

276
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,240
Don't be so nervous.

277
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,240
I'll just drink.

278
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,240
What if I agree?

279
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:16,840
You agree?

280
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,240
I agree.

281
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:19,440
In this case,

282
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,440
you're not the one

283
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,240
who's been cursed by the master.

284
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,240
Are you willing

285
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,240
to follow others?

286
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,440
Let's say so.

287
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,440
What's the condition?

288
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,640
You're willing to

289
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,040
not follow Huaiqing,

290
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,640
but follow others?

291
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,440
I'm not.

292
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,240
I'm not.

293
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,240
I'm not.

294
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,240
I'm not.

295
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,240
I'm not.

296
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,240
I'm not.

297
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,440
I understand.

298
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,240
Why are you leaving?

299
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,640
The princess is looking for a lover.

300
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,240
Why does she have to do that?

301
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,640
Don't worry.

302
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,040
I'll give all my love

303
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,240
to the princess's team

304
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,440
in my heart.

305
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,840
I'll be the one to disturb them.

306
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,240
Girl.

307
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:20,640
I...

308
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,440
I... I didn't mean that.

309
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,440
Xu Qian,

310
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,440
what are you doing?

311
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,040
I said I didn't mean that.

312
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,440
What... What do you mean?

313
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,240
I just said it casually.

314
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,240
Cacally?

315
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,440
You asked me to change my mind.

316
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,040
It's not a secret.

317
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,840
It's to protect the last image.

318
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,040
I should break up.

319
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,440
I drank the wine and wanted to sing.

320
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,040
I swear.

321
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,640
If I'm a secret,

322
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,040
I'll be the one to take it.

323
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:57,840
I can't be a fan.

324
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,440
Xu Qian also swear.

325
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,440
I'm worried about the princess.

326
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,240
No matter what,

327
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,840
the sky is long and the sky is wide.

328
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,240
I'll never change.

329
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,240
I'll fight with the princess.

330
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,800
Isn't thatigo bad?

331
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:11,840
Taisou,

332
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,040
how did she ashamed me?

333
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,640
That's inappropriate.

334
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:31,640
Shen Hao.

335
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,240
Shen Hao.

336
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:35,840
From now on,

337
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,440
I'll be a fanator of the princess.

338
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,440
You can leave now.

339
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,440
We haven't finished drinking yet.

340
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,440
Get out!

341
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,440
Okay.

342
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,440
Then I won't bother you.

343
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,440
You're so sweet.

344
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,440
You're so sweet all day.

345
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,440
Princess, that's not the way.

346
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,440
Xu Qian is so fond of Princess Huaiqing.

347
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:57,440
Now she can be happy.

348
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,440
Fond of Princess Huaiqing?

349
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,440
Then kill her.

350
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,440
Five-year-old Yuwen, ten-year-old Shunzhu,

351
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,440
a positive experience.

352
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,440
This kid is really sweet.

353
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,440
I'm Xu Qian, the eldest son of the Heavenly Buddha.

354
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,440
I'm a genius.

355
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,440
You're so red-skinned.

356
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,440
I'm just a little bit of a hypocrite.

357
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,440
I'm a little bit of a hypocrite.

358
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,440
I'm a little bit of a hypocrite.

359
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,440
Today's show is over.

360
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,440
Happy birthday.

361
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,440
Come to the New Year's Day party.

362
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,440
Open the full of year-long love.

363
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,440
Change your life and become a father and a son-in-law.

364
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,440
The atmosphere in the legend.

365
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,440
He's the best.

366
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,440
All good brands.

367
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,440
Like it, bring it home.

368
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,440
Go to the event.

369
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,440
Go to the red street.

370
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,440
The brand you want.

371
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,440
The price you like.

372
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,440
All at the event.

373
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,440
Take it.

374
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,440
You said that

375
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,440
how can you build that

376
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:53,440
unbreakable heart between people?

377
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,440
How simple is it?

378
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,440
You take it to the office.

379
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,440
Drink some wine.

380
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,440
It's not possible to keep it.

381
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,440
The other party is too high.

382
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,440
It's not worth it.

383
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,440
Why don't you keep it?

384
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,440
I'll give it to him.

385
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,440
It's not enough.

386
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,440
He's still a hundred percent to me.

387
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,440
Wang Xiao, did you see that?

388
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,440
He's got half of the money.

389
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,440
Take it.

390
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,440
He's working hard for the money.

391
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,440
We're in the wrong place.

392
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,440
If not for him,

393
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,440
he would be the one who's curious.

394
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,440
Boss, I've finished the lunch.

395
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,440
Give me the spoon.

396
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,440
Okay, thank you.

397
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,440
I'll go back to the bar.

398
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,440
I'll go to the second floor.

399
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,440
It's so fragrant.

400
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,440
What's so fragrant?

401
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,440
The money you're giving me

402
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,440
is my money.

403
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,440
I've been giving money to you

404
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,440
all the time.

405
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,440
I'm giving you that 20 silver.

406
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,440
Don't say that.

407
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,440
You're the one.

408
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,440
Write down your name.

409
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,440
Tell me.

410
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,440
Look,

411
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,440
I said that to you.

412
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,440
It's mine.

413
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,440
Really?

414
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,440
Where did you get the money?

415
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,440
I don't know.

416
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,440
I don't know.

417
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,440
Where did you get the money?

418
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,440
What's going on?

419
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,440
Hong Guang is trying to get us.

420
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,520
He's usually in a situation of

421
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,440
surveillance or surveillance.

422
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,440
Maybe that big brother

423
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,440
met a suspicious person.

424
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,440
He ran away.

425
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,440
Hong Guang's distance

426
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,440
should be close to us.

427
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,440
Bro, what's going on?

428
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,440
The bear was killed.

429
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,440
Two colleagues who were responsible for the crime

430
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,440
were also injured.

431
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,440
The thief escaped with a secret place.

432
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,440
He's not in the police station for now.

433
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,440
Pingyuan?

434
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,440
What's the secret?

435
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,440
Why are you standing there?

436
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,440
Hurry up and leave.

437
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,440
Okay, get in.

438
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,440
Everyone,

439
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,440
I'm No. 6.

440
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,440
I'm in the capital.

441
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,440
Can you help me?

442
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,440
No. 6,

443
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,440
what trouble did you encounter?

444
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,440
I was trapped in there.

445
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,440
I was facing

446
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,440
the search of the Dagger.

447
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,440
No.

448
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,440
The Dagger didn't find me.

449
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,440
But in less than an hour,

450
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,440
the number of people in the temple

451
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,440
would be reached.

452
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,440
I'll be in trouble

453
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,440
when I get there.

454
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,440
But my distance is too far.

455
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,440
The border is too long.

456
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,440
Pinghao,

457
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,440
how do you think

458
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,440
I can get through it?

459
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,440
No.

460
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,440
The distance is too far.

461
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,440
There are still Dagger and

462
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,440
the person in the temple.

463
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,440
Besides,

464
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,440
there are still

465
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,440
the city and the city outside.

466
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,440
Do you have a secret weapon?

467
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,440
No.

468
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,440
Pingdao has it.

469
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,440
I can't just send it to you.

470
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,440
Don't worry,

471
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,440
if I can't escape this time,

472
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,440
I'll keep Xiaojing in the place.

473
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,440
You can find the weapon tomorrow.

474
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,440
No. 6,

475
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,440
what nonsense are you talking about?

476
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,440
No. 1,

477
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,440
he's in the capital.

478
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,440
No. 1,

479
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,440
can you help me?

480
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,440
What did you do?

481
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,440
I burned Pingyuanbo.

482
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,440
Sorry,

483
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,440
I can't help you.

484
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,440
No. 1,

485
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,440
I believe that

486
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,440
the same person in the temple

487
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,440
can help you.

488
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,440
No. 6,

489
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,440
I don't think you can do anything.

490
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,440
No. 6,

491
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,440
you helped me once.

492
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,440
I can also help you.

493
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,440
But you have to tell me

494
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,440
why you killed Pingyuanbo.

495
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,440
Why?

496
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,440
If he's a good person,

497
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,440
I'll help him.

498
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,440
I'll take him to the temple.

499
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,440
If he's a bad person,

500
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,440
I can get his trust first.

501
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,440
Until he's in the right place,

502
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,440
I'll give him a fight.

503
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,440
I'll take him to the palace.

504
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,440
I can't do anything anyway.

505
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,440
You can say no,

506
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,440
but you should think it through.

507
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,440
Only I can help you.

508
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,440
No. 6,

509
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,440
since he's willing to do anything,

510
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,440
don't hide it from me.

511
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,440
Right.

512
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,440
You broke into such a big trouble.

513
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,440
You want people to help you,

514
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,440
but you still don't get any sincerity.

515
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,440
A year ago,

516
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,440
my junior disappeared.

517
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,440
I suspect that he was sold by others.

518
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,440
You secretly took the path to send him out of the capital.

519
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,440
I've checked and checked

520
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,440
the market.

521
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,440
I've finally decided to organize a mute organization.

522
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,440
And the behind-the-scenes of this organization

523
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,440
is Pingyuanbo.

524
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,440
So you're the one who killed him?

525
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,440
I went to Pingyuanbo's mansion

526
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,440
and forced my junior to go down to Wei State.

527
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,440
Then I killed him.

528
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,440
I was so guilty.

529
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,440
So you're a criminal.

530
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,440
You can actually report to Pingyuanbo.

531
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,440
You killed him and you don't know the truth.

532
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,440
You're a criminal.

533
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,440
Why don't you report to the police?

534
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,440
Look.

535
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,440
The number one is Li Zhidu.

536
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,440
You're a criminal.

537
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,440
If the report is useful,

538
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,440
I would have died long ago.

539
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,440
I'm a official and a rich man.

540
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,440
I'm a criminal.

541
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,440
I'm a criminal.

542
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,440
This is better than the number six.

543
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,440
I have a reason.

544
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,440
In a year,

545
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,440
I saved many children.

546
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,440
Most of them are disabled,

547
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,440
and have a bad memory.

548
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,440
They suffer from a lot of torture.

549
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,440
They are suffering from a lot of problems.

550
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,440
They are suffering from a lot of problems.

551
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,440
If they can get some money,

552
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,440
they will have a cold meal.

553
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,440
If they can't get money,

554
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,440
they will only be able to eat a lot.

555
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,440
Then,

556
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,440
where are those children now?

557
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:47,440
I will take the children to the orphanage.

558
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,440
I found out later that

559
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,440
they were all being controlled by the orphanage.

560
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,440
They came from different places.

561
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,440
The number six,

562
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,440
do you really mean it?

563
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,440
Yes, I do.

564
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,440
Pingyuanbo secretly cultivated the orphanage.

565
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:07,440
They tried to take revenge on the people in the capital.

566
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,440
They sold the children and women

567
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,440
who came from the orphanage

568
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,440
to the brothels and black-stained rooms.

569
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,440
They couldn't even raise the bandits.

570
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,440
Even the bodies of the disabled

571
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,440
were all killed.

572
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,440
So,

573
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,440
even if I don't have my junior,

574
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,440
I will never let go of Pingyuanbo.

575
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,440
Only by killing him

576
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,440
can I destroy the orphanage.

577
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,440
So that more people

578
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,440
can face the difficulties.

579
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,440
Good.

580
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,440
You killed him well.

581
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,440
You are so useless.

582
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,440
Not bad.

583
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,440
The number six

584
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,440
is the five-time-taste of the orphanage.

585
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,440
No. 3.

586
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,440
If you can save No. 6 this time,

587
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,440
I will owe you the money you saved.

588
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,440
You owe me the money.

589
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,440
No. 3.

590
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,440
I hope you can save the orphanage.

591
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,440
Although the cause is true,

592
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,440
but the death of the nation is serious.

593
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,440
It's hard to save the people

594
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,440
from the gang.

595
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,440
It's even harder to save the people from the south.

596
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,440
No matter who wins,

597
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,440
they will definitely save the people from the south.

598
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,440
You are too many people.

599
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,340
It'll be great trouble

600
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:24,880
if we go and save

601
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,440
people,

602
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,440
and save people.

603
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,440
No. 6

604
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,440
Listalk coloca

605
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,040
Where is Listalk coloca?

606
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:41,000
I wanna know their Definitly

607
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,120
I'd like to know

608
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,720
Is there a mistake

609
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,640
I need to check

610
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,760
Have any ideas

611
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:56,640
Go

612
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,120
Take your dust pack

613
00:24:59,320 --> 00:24:59,920
Commander

614
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,640
Forever

615
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:04,480
Report

616
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:04,880
Commander

617
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,420
Han Deru

618
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,240
Here.

619
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,040
Furnace of an attribute puts stating that attachegon of a son.

620
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,440
She might even eat on the land.

621
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,840
Immediately suspected it was a yarn from theervist Support Committee.

622
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:05,080
Why'd you pick her up?

623
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,200
Gold and steel.

624
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,120
This brother word is theaktik.

625
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,060
Weird.

626
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,240
Why is the sky no longer visible?

627
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,080
I saw it.

628
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,600
Chunfeng took Song Mingfeng,

629
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,040
Chunfeng took Zhu Guangxiao,

630
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,600
and defeated Jiang Jinluo.

631
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,760
Did you find the murder of the murderer?

632
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,480
We searched the street and found it.

633
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,680
I didn't find anything here.

634
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,360
My Lord,

635
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,360
Xue Guang is here.

636
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,840
Are you questioning us?

637
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,160
I dare not.

638
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,520
Have you searched the next place?

639
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:01,640
I have.

640
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,400
Not yet.

641
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:04,780
Not yet.

642
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,680
In your portrait they are

643
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,440
assologating to me?

644
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:22,520
My Lord.

645
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:23,480
The murderer…

646
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:24,280
Master,

647
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:27,920
my Lord.

648
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:28,760
Let's go.

649
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,840
It seems like a magic weapon.

650
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,200
How could there be a magic weapon in the water?

651
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,640
I think it was a murderer.

652
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:54,880
Go back to the report.

653
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:56,640
Yes.

654
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:57,560
Wait.

655
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,080
Mr. Xu.

656
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:02,960
Mr. Xu.

657
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,200
Mr. Xu.

658
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,800
You haven't been to the Four Heavens, right?

659
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,280
Brother Song is waiting for you.

660
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:07,920
Yes.

661
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,000
Mr. Xu,

662
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,480
please come to the Four Heavens to have a tea.

663
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,080
We are waiting for you to ask for the training.

664
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,320
Training?

665
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,560
I'm doing the work.

666
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,320
Okay.

667
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,800
Sir, this is mine.

668
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,600
Yours?

669
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,800
Which hall are you from?

670
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,440
He's from Chunfeng Hall.

671
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,720
His name is Xu Ji'an.

672
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:34,600
Sir,

673
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,480
this is from Wei Gong.

674
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,120
Can you please come to the Garden Master?

675
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,600
Why are you in the collusion?

676
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,440
I was just making a mess.

677
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,640
Maybe it's

678
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,720
when you were doing the work,

679
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,280
you came out.

680
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,520
Come in.

681
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,760
Sir, if you won't believe me,

682
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,520
you can ask the Wei Gong for purgatory.

683
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,320
Son, he's so cute.

684
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,880
excess interchangeable official刻 squad

685
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,960
We are the jegians of Ordinaryよしolol that know each other.

686
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:15,920
I've been knowing Wei Gong,

687
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,120
and he may know me.

688
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,520
What?

689
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,400
Brother Song team, you know that point, right?

690
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,680
He went and vegaged 100 years in prison

691
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,560
He's a master of the art of learning.

692
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,640
But what did you know about

693
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:29,840
what Brother Song said recently?

694
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:33,880
Xu Ningye is really a master of martial arts.

695
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,400
Tomorrow you go to the Chunfeng Hall

696
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,880
and bring this kid over.

697
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:43,480
Yes.

698
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,520
Brother Qi, you're so good.

699
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,600
You really give us the whole Chunfeng Hall.

700
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:50,960
Shut up.

701
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,080
You're a good person.

702
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:54,360
Why are you afraid of Brother Xu?

703
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,600
He's a little bit nervous.

704
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:56,680
How can I help you?

705
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:57,840
Look at him.

706
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,360
Practice martial arts.

707
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,800
We can't do it.

708
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:02,720
I can't afford it.

709
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,280
I'll run first.

710
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,040
What are you laughing at?

711
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:07,480
Sir.

712
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,520
Steal the car.

713
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:10,800
Hurry up and search.

714
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:11,520
Okay.

715
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,120
Hurry up and search.

716
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:12,720
Don't laugh.

717
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:13,200
Hurry up and search.

718
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,080
davonoyer.

719
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,440
Henry,

720
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,600
why do you throw me here?

721
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,040
I'll go get it.

722
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,040
I'll go get it.

723
00:30:58,760 --> 00:30:59,440
Come on.

724
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,600
It's been a night.

725
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:02,920
I got nothing.

726
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,640
I caught two little bandits.

727
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,280
Not bad.

728
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,640
At least I can win the prize.

729
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,400
I don't know how I'll win the prize.

730
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,920
I have to go home and report it.

731
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:14,760
Lin,

732
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:15,840
do you want to go with me?

733
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,440
I have something to do.

734
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,320
You go back first.

735
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,240
I'll see you at the door.

736
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,720
This guy...

737
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:24,640
No.

738
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:26,600
What's wrong?

739
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,760
Is he a stranger?

740
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:29,720
No.

741
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,320
He's not a stranger.

742
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,520
He's wearing a suit.

743
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:33,880
He must be

744
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,120
a little different.

745
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,080
His feet are a bit thin.

746
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,560
He's like a grasshopper.

747
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:40,920
And

748
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:43,680
he's from that place.

749
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,160
Could it be that...

750
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,120
Not bad.

751
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,480
He must be.

752
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:02,480
I went to teach Fang Si.

753
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,440
I want to teach Fang Si too.

754
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,600
I'll go tonight.

755
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:10,720
I'm so tired.

756
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,600
I'm so tired.

757
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,040
Let's go home and rest.

758
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,120
I don't want to

759
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,400
teach Fang Si at all.

760
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,120
Let's go.

761
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:39,400
Brothers.

762
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,840
What time is it?

763
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,320
Can we help you?

764
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,840
We've taken care of your paper box.

765
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,160
Now,

766
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,200
we welcome our лousy customer to

767
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,200
I didn't even get a chance to talk.

768
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,200
Why are we in such a hurry?

769
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,200
It's not right.

770
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,200
It's not like it's a big deal.

771
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,200
There's something strange.

772
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,200
It's not good for the shape.

773
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,200
Weiguang, you can't help but be a assistant.

774
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,200
You should die quickly.

775
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,200
Weiguang is like this.

776
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,200
You can't be a good student.

777
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,200
You should be a good student.

778
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,200
I've searched all over the city

779
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,200
with people from the night.

780
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,200
All the famous guest houses

781
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,200
in the city

782
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:29,200
may not find any traces of the murder.

783
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,200
The White Doctor of Siyan Sword

784
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,200
has also been visited

785
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,200
for the benefit of killing people.

786
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:36,200
I'm willing to do my best.

787
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,200
You're really a good person.

788
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,200
If you have someone from Siyan Sword

789
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,200
you can let them run away.

790
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,200
Do you know

791
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,200
the various ghosts and snakes in the court

792
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,200
are waiting to see

793
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,200
our brother's effect?

794
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,200
I'm going to send people

795
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,200
to expand the search area.

796
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,200
I'll definitely

797
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,200
take this brother in today's case.

798
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,200
I hope I can get him back safely.

799
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,200
All right.

800
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,200
You've been looking all night.

801
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,200
You're tired too.

802
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,200
You should go back and rest.

803
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,200
Yes.

804
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,200
I dare to ask you

805
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,200
if you can give the legal wife

806
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,200
to him today.

807
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:17,200
As the saying goes,

808
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:20,200
I have another thing to report to the Wei Palace.

809
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,200
Father,

810
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,200
I'm willing to do my best

811
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,200
to investigate the case.

812
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,200
I'm afraid I want to find the murderer first

813
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,200
and attack the person who killed him.

814
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:37,200
I can't find the clues

815
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,200
of the person who killed him.

816
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:39,200
What can I find

817
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,200
from those bandits?

818
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,200
Greetings, Wei Palace.

819
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:43,200
Thank you.

820
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:45,200
Greetings, Wei Palace.

821
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,200
I'm Xu Tongluo.

822
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,200
I have a key report.

823
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,200
Father.

824
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,200
Wei Palace,

825
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:09,200
I have a key report to you.

826
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,200
What?

827
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,200
You want to push us back

828
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,200
with a little coin?

829
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,200
You may leave.

830
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,200
You may leave.

831
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,200
Come up and talk.

832
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,200
Yes.

833
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,200
The case of the world conference

834
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,200
is the choice of Ping Yuanbo.

835
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,200
The one who killed Ping Yuanbo

836
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,200
is the sixth of the world conference.

837
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,200
What's the reason?

838
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,200
You let the criminal go.

839
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,200
You're guilty of the crime.

840
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,200
Are you crazy?

841
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,200
I'm guilty.

842
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,200
I'm guilty.

843
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,200
I know I'm guilty.

844
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,200
I'm in the dark.

845
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,200
I can't escape from the suspicion.

846
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,200
I'll confess to Wei Palace.

847
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,200
Do you want to kill or release me?

848
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,200
I'll do it.

849
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,200
I'm in a dilemma

850
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,200
with Tong Liao today.

851
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,200
I know

852
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,200
he was punished by His Majesty.

853
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,200
He was arrested by the court.

854
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,200
He was attacked.

855
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,200
If you want to take me to Enzhong,

856
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,200
I...

857
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,200
Shut up.

858
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:49,200
Enzhong is too much.

859
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,200
Tell me the reason.

860
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:00,200
Ping Yuanbo is keeping the teeth in the case.

861
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,200
He's trying to get rid of the criminal.

862
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,200
The teeth are deceiving the girl.

863
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,200
He sold her to the brothel.

864
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,200
He sold her to the black kitchen.

865
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,200
He let me be a criminal.

866
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,200
He even killed the body.

867
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,200
Even after I heard it,

868
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,200
I can't stop him.

869
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,200
Get up and talk.

870
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,200
Yes.

871
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,200
Xu Qian.

872
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:43,200
How much do you know about the Heavenly Emperor?

873
00:37:45,200 --> 00:38:06,080
How much do you know about the Emperor's

874
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,200
and the Heavenly Emperor's death?

875
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,200
Maybe

876
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,200
Ping Yuanbo involved in other things.

877
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,200
Maybe

878
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,200
the teeth organization

879
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,200
did something

880
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,200
to kill the body.

881
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,200
Have you thought about

882
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,200
all of this?

883
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,200
He asked me to do something.

884
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,200
He really wants to be with me.

885
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,200
No matter what,

886
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:38,200
don't worry about it.

887
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,200
I'll send others to investigate.

888
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,200
You'll continue to be in the Heavenly Emperor's meeting.

889
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,200
The main goal in the meeting

890
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,200
is to clear everyone's identity.

891
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,200
And

892
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,200
protect yourself.

893
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,200
I'll do my best.

894
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,200
You're so rude.

895
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,200
Tang Tang Jin Luo

896
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,200
was killed by Tong Luo.

897
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,200
He didn't put you in his eyes.

898
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,200
Give me the sword and mask.

899
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,200
You know what he's thinking.

900
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,200
I want to train him.

901
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,200
You know it too.

902
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,200
What do you want?

903
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,200
But he didn't put you in his eyes.

904
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,200
You know it too, right?

905
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,200
But he's in my mind.

906
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,200
That's true.

907
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,200
Good.

908
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,200
Wait for me.

909
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:57,200
Take care.

910
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,200
Take care.

911
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,200
Take care.

912
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,200
I should take it.

913
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:18,200
You're finally back.

914
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,200
Why are you dressed like this?

915
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,200
I did something.

916
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,200
You can't take the pot in Tang.

917
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,200
I'll figure out a way

918
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,200
to solve the silver.

919
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,200
Sixth.

920
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,200
Sixth.

921
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,200
Sixth, are you safe?

922
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,200
How is it?

923
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,200
Are you safe?

924
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:56,200
I didn't know about it.

925
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,200
I didn't even dare to ask.

926
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,200
Thank you for

927
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,200
being safe for now.

928
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:05,200
So...

929
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,200
did Third save you?

930
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,200
Yes.

931
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,200
Thanks to Third,

932
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,200
I could escape.

933
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,200
Why didn't Third show up?

934
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,200
Something happened, right?

935
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,200
Third is the most responsible person.

936
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,200
Nothing happened.

937
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,200
Third.

938
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,200
Sixth, I got the news.

939
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,200
Someone has found the clues

940
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,200
that are unknown.

941
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,200
They will investigate you.

942
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,200
You have to be prepared

943
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,200
and be prepared.

944
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,200
Thank you for the news.

945
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,200
No.

946
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:38,200
Third saved No. 6

947
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:40,200
and entered the inner part of the building.

948
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,200
He's really a good guy.

949
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,200
Sixth,

950
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:45,200
Third is here.

951
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,200
Can you tell us

952
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,200
how you saved him?

953
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,200
Third.

954
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:51,200
I...

955
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,200
Can I say it?

956
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:55,200
Why not?

957
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,200
You're a gentleman.

958
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,200
Please.

959
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,200
Okay.

960
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:01,200
Here's the thing.

961
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,200
Third

962
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:03,200
gave me a mountain.

963
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:05,200
He helped me

964
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,200
to stop the sand.

965
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:07,200
That's right.

966
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:10,200
But the sand is not enough.

967
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:12,200
So I have to take No. 6

968
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:14,200
to a secret inn.

969
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,200
Hide.

970
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,200
That's right.

971
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,200
You're a gentleman.

972
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,200
How did you escape?

973
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,200
Of course I escaped.

974
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,200
Of course,

975
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,200
I found the clue No. 6

976
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:28,200
and the evidence.

977
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:30,200
I have to be prepared.

978
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:31,200
What did you say?

979
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:33,200
I found No. 6 in advance.

980
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,200
I took his jacket.

981
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,200
I put it on him.

982
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,200
I broke through the door.

983
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:37,200
I hid in the room.

984
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,200
I was there.

985
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:39,200
I was there.

986
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,200
I was there.

987
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:41,200
I was there.

988
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,200
No. 6 was safe.

989
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,200
I was there.

990
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,200
I was there.

991
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,200
Right?

992
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,200
No. 6.

993
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:54,200
Yes.

994
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:55,200
Yes.

995
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,200
It seems that

996
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:00,200
No. 6 is a bit different.

997
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,200
It's okay.

998
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:03,200
It's amazing.

999
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,200
No. 3

1000
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:05,200
is really interesting.

1001
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,200
No. 3

1002
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:08,200
you hid in the search again.

1003
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:11,200
To be honest,

1004
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:14,200
I'm in the water now.

1005
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:16,200
I searched the whole night.

1006
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:18,200
They still didn't give up on my chase.

1007
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:19,200
Then

1008
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:21,200
do you still have the evidence?

1009
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,200
There is only one thing

1010
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,200
that Da Ru gave to Rushan.

1011
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:25,200
I gave No. 6.

1012
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:28,200
It seems that I can only wait for the strength

1013
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:30,200
to disappear.

1014
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:32,200
If I was arrested before this,

1015
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:33,200
please rest assured.

1016
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,200
I will not let No. 6

1017
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:37,200
and everyone in the world know.

1018
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,200
No. 3

1019
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:40,200
for No. 6,

1020
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,200
you actually...

1021
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:42,200
You are a dead person.

1022
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:44,200
The plot before No. 6

1023
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:46,200
is to drive people to the grave.

1024
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:47,200
To make the right decision

1025
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,200
to the justice of No. 6,

1026
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,200
he shouldn't be arrested.

1027
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:51,200
He shouldn't be beaten

1028
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:53,200
by the people inside.

1029
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:56,200
As No. 6's classmate,

1030
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:59,200
I should take these as my responsibility.

1031
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:00,200
Don't worry.

1032
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:02,200
Even if I die,

1033
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:05,200
I will not regret it.

1034
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:31,200
No. 6

1035
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:01,200
No. 6

1036
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:31,200
No. 6

1037
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:01,200
No. 6

1038
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:31,200
No. 6

1039
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:01,200
No. 6
