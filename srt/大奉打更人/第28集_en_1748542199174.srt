1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm afraid I'll be late for the next round

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I'm afraid I'll be late for the next round

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I'm curious what I'm talking about

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I don't want to think about the future

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
The whole book in my mouth

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Let this bowl of soup and tea

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
It's not very solid

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
When you're here

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I'll give you the rules

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I'll keep you on your feet

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'll take this big piece of bowl

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
We're ordinary

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
We're like a step by step

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
We're ordinary

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
We're ordinary

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
We're not different from each other

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
We're ordinary

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
We're not different from each other

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
We have a long history

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
It's my fault

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The people around me

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Have a strong heart

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
This hand is not holding a break

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Take a look at how much

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
It's hard to take a heart

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'll be a burden to others

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm afraid I'll be late for the next round

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,620
Rumors say the power of rice rice is 1 person

29
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:27,820
there must be aart

30
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:28,720
Rumors say rice is 1 person

31
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,240
whom knows their power

32
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,760
What if he completely spoil them

33
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,420
That the history will forever be worthwhile

34
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,500
We use the Luang stepping knowledge

35
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,840
We will pay the price

36
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:38,600
The Pocket blend in our heart

37
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,320
Sh drives the Horse

38
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:45,640
Bothering 60s

39
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,320
Urgently

40
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,060
A tenth of the

41
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,140
LET'S PLAY

42
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:52,600
All good prices

43
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,600
The sand is all over the place

44
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,600
The wind is blowing, the dust is opening, the rich are coming back

45
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,600
The pine tree is drinking, the spirit is watching, the wind is watching

46
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,600
The child doesn't like to eat, doesn't grow up, uses the dragon and the tiger's bone

47
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,600
The dragon and the tiger's bone, the spirit is watching, the wind is watching

48
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,600
The second, the eighth year of the year, the world's best repairman

49
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,600
The spirit is watching, the wind is watching

50
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,600
There are a lot of money here

51
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:17,600
Indeed, the future public is a famous dance couple

52
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,600
It shouldn't be difficult to get along

53
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,600
A treasure must be accompanied by a hero

54
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,600
How can you use money to measure it?

55
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,600
Thank you, Miss. Thank you, Miss.

56
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,600
Why?

57
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,600
You lied to me, Xu Jia, I don't believe you anymore

58
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,600
You go, you go, let me take a look at myself

59
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,600
This family is not allowed to stay, we are not allowed to stay

60
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,600
We have a family

61
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,600
You go out, go out

62
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,600
Okay, wait a minute, Madam

63
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,600
You are Sister Xu Ling Yue, right?

64
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:03,600
As the second uncle said, the flowers are more beautiful and the foxes are more beautiful

65
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,600
Sister Si Mu is not here

66
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,600
You are the most suitable person to go to the private house

67
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,600
Isn't this the beauty interview?

68
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:23,600
The beauty is good, the beauty is good, the effect is good

69
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,600
Li Shen gave me a good one

70
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,600
I have been waiting for a few days, I didn't get it

71
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,600
Miss Si Mu, you are so thoughtful

72
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,600
Because you used a little small bag

73
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:38,600
It's okay, only this can match your beautiful country and color

74
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,600
I'll try it on you first

75
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,600
Thank you for your effort, Miss Si Mu

76
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,600
It seems that this Miss Xu Jia is not very clever

77
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,600
She has a few skills

78
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,600
In this way, she is looking forward to it

79
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:57,600
Actually, I have a gift for you

80
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,600
Do you want it?

81
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,600
There is a new book here

82
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,600
Sister can take it

83
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,600
Thank you, Sister

84
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,600
Who is this? So curious

85
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,600
I just came here and passed by the Glacier House

86
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,600
I bought you a delicious one

87
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,600
Do Ding, thank you Miss Wang

88
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,600
Thank you, thank you

89
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,600
You are so smart, you are really not good at preparing

90
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,600
Zhou Zhou Zhou is really too good

91
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,600
Miss Si Mu, you are so far away

92
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,600
You said in my small small拜拜

93
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,600
Don't be ridiculous

94
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,100
How come?

95
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,600
So brave as a stylesare

96
00:04:50,600 --> 00:05:10,780
I want to know your Chinese

97
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,900
Who the hell is Gen Le!

98
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:17,020
Unbelievable!

99
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:21,140
In the.</i Bruno Lebo's Cao Safety tactic

100
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:24,220
she addressed to Tian Ge who held on to his own

101
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:28,660
and changed his first name from чис to CEO.

102
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:32,780
؟

103
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:39,660
My lord,

104
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:42,220
It brings luck.

105
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:51,540
God bless me with the new year!

106
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,100
You have complicated me.

107
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,300
Some snacks.

108
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:06,780
Chi Yu pos,

109
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:07,420
forget it.

110
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:08,780
Drink some hot water.

111
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:11,220
Hot water?

112
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:14,900
Hot water!

113
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:17,740
That's inappropriate!

114
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:20,420
That's inappropriate!

115
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:24,820
That's embarrassed.

116
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,420
Actually,

117
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:29,460
Moreover...

118
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:33,980
yuani'sacağım was killed

119
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:35,380
because of me,

120
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,380
you yunia you.

121
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:42,220
Since young Yuenuai himself is good for listening.

122
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:45,060
No joke of farmland and wages.

123
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:48,460
No one dare to go out.

124
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:52,580
in vain

125
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:55,100
Absolutely not,

126
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,420
no.

127
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:57,420
Oziliania blirstack.

128
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:01,120
It's XYZ diagn but regular warmer.

129
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:20,960
TOYR,

130
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:21,620
Fugitive,

131
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,000
Precise Bestoku.

132
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Si Jiu, you're almost there.

133
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Brother is tired. Go back to sleep.

134
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
No, you're really playing.

135
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Forget it.

136
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Forget it.

137
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Brother, you're wrong.

138
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Get down.

139
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Don't play with me.

140
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I'm really in trouble.

141
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Get down.

142
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Don't go.

143
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Brother, don't go.

144
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Don't go.

145
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Let's go.

146
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Erlang is here.

147
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Erlang.

148
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I'm so tired.

149
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I'm so tired.

150
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Erlang is in the warm-up class.

151
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Don't disturb her.

152
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
What are you doing?

153
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
She's far away from you.

154
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
What's wrong with the warm-up?

155
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
You're fine after a long time.

156
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Yan Jinghui.

157
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Don't go.

158
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Erlang.

159
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Erlang is a little bit old.

160
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
He's willing to give up.

161
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
What Xianggu said is

162
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
the snow in Beijing is very early.

163
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Let Erlang have a good time.

164
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Yes.

165
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I have something to tell you.

166
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I have something to tell you.

167
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Brother, do you think

168
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I'm the one who is dead?

169
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I'm the one who is dead?

170
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
How is everyone doing?

171
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I'm fine.

172
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I'm fine.

173
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I'm fine.

174
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,040
Shaoling, Runqiang,

175
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,320
And What's wrong?

176
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,840
Why do you welcome me?

177
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,360
Never mind

178
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,400
I'll let Esteemed

179
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,240
Finish it

180
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,040
Thank you

181
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,240
Well

You indeed are polite

183
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,360
That means

185
00:09:56,900 --> 00:10:01,000

will be Territory Magistrate of the Ministry of Justice.

189
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:13,340
Not to mention worldleen Makeshift.

190
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:14,260
Yes.

191
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:22,320
Xu Lang was

192
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,180
falling in love with my uncle

193
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:27,380
around that time.

194
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:28,780
Go now.

195
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:35,080
Xu Lang,

196
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,140
I didn't believe that

197
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,480
her love for us

198
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:39,680
was even more profound.

199
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:47,400
Inside the garden there are flowers.

200
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,060
The world is in pain.

201
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:51,280
The wind is blowing down鄒 and I don't want to be apart.

202
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:54,280
What do you care about?

203
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:57,280
The star foot.

204
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,340
Start就會起.

205
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:03,320
What do you mean by a stone?

206
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,340
My heart is open like a stone.

207
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:08,340
No sense of transfer.

208
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:10,440
I'll go.

209
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:15,060
PowerPoint.

210
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:18,100
The illustration looks great.

211
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:27,140
It's from

212
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,680
the nakama Dawn Hall.

213
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:31,980
You see,

214
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:36,660
both a ridiculous picture

215
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,660
and a對不對 pose.

216
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,180
What?

217
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,340
After wondering why should I fill that outfit,

218
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,040
Finally, Master Tian тебя has taken theethic throne.

219
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:48,500
Her moonshine hasn't arrived yet.

220
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,900
What's going on?

221
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:51,800
Who are you?

222
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:56,740
Clearly lets the Aaa toast be over.

223
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:58,900
Greetings, Master Wei Fangisei of the leader of the throne.

224
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:00,300
Greetings, Young Master Zihan of her throne.

225
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,700
We're at the top of the throne.

226
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,840
The king won't be ashamed.

227
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,780
Without the royal treasury,

228
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:07,660
she wouldn't work for it either.

229
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:09,380
Why would he be like that?

230
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:11,500
No problem.

231
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,940
you're in Sean's own decides this.

232
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:14,460
As I heard,

233
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:15,860
Xu Erlang

234
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,060
sparkle to bath like a father in marriage.

235
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:18,660
Now he Objective the금

236
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:20,900
is set by such aworthful man.

237
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,880
He shall also be

238
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:23,360
parents' favorite

239
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:23,380
fool

240
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:25,760
among the thugs in Yunlu School.

241
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:27,820
In new year's time,

242
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,040
the Regent gets re 무�

243
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,420
the king visits him

244
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:31,500
with some much confusion.

245
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,100
The regent깨 is also the guy.

246
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,020
Da Cheng

247
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:34,360
won't be announce

248
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,760
liberalism in the school.

249
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,320
Xu Erlang

250
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,740
fuck it while going to Enjoy bamboo forest

251
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:41,020
without complete harmony.

252
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:42,860
I should of taken some decisions

253
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:44,020
to make a limit of money

254
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:45,900
but make a living

255
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,420
Man of country

256
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,240
does not care about salary

257
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,260
How important

258
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,860
is money and age

259
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:58,940
Of course

260
00:12:58,940 --> 00:12:59,820
People of country may be

261
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,220
theplings the people education

262
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,820
ourрод Sire

263
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,380
ottle the poor

264
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:06,740
Son только一個白丁

265
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,820
For example, the sire

266
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:12,140
Even a great man like Lord Xu

267
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:13,740
can't match with this.

268
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:18,700
Princess.

269
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:22,420
Princess, I didn't mean that.

270
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:23,060
I mean

271
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:25,180
Lord Xu is smart and has a good hand.

272
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,140
He is good at matchmaking.

273
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:27,340
He is very good at fishing.

274
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:30,660
Princess.

275
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:32,980
You...

276
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:37,420
I've never had such a delicious taste.

277
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:39,740
Did you change the kitchen?

278
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:42,140
No.

279
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,980
I just added a seasoning in it.

280
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,220
It's called chicken essence.

281
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,300
It can stimulate the taste of ingredients.

282
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:50,540
And

283
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:54,260
the developer of chicken essence is Xu Qian.

284
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:57,420
It's her.

285
00:13:58,540 --> 00:13:59,180
Mother.

286
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,900
The talent of this person is very good.

287
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:03,100
He will not only write poems, but also make short stories.

288
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:05,820
The reason why this person is looking for a good sleeper

289
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,340
is because he is the one who is in charge of the whole drama.

290
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:11,600
Detailor and Section Hero of Young·RED

291
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,660
Isn't it a knight's judgement

292
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:16,260
to have some rewards for success?

293
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:19,620
I know what you are thinking about.

294
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:28,960
I will find time for you to say you

295
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:32,300
and find out if there is any other arrangement

296
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:34,260
that will put you in the rookery.

297
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:40,420
The minister is willing to say that he helped you.

298
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:42,420
Thank you, Mother.

299
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:46,420
Come, eat. You should drink more.

300
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:47,420
What's this?

301
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:49,420
Wang Zhenwen was beaten by Zheng Di.

302
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:53,420
The court has asked you to send this secret letter to the Ministry of Rites.

303
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:58,420
This is...

304
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:03,420
I'm not going to send these black materials...

305
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:05,420
No, these secret files are leaked.

306
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:08,420
I don't know how many officers are going to be punished for this.

307
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:12,420
It seems that the official of the Feng Dynasty is going to be in great danger.

308
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:16,420
How could these files be leaked?

309
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:18,420
If they weren't sent to the Ministry of Rites,

310
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:21,420
you think you can see these secret files?

311
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,420
If they weren't sent to the Ministry of Rites,

312
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:26,420
you think you can see these secret files?

313
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:33,420
A big man should help the Royal Uncle to get rid of them.

314
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:37,420
No, it's the official's fault.

315
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:39,420
It's also the official's fault.

316
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:40,420
Why did the Ministry of Rites make a choice?

317
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:44,420
The Ministry of Rites said that only you can do this.

318
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:48,420
This is the truth.

319
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:50,420
The whole capital has been changed.

320
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:53,420
Xu Xinnian was kicked out by a small group of people in front of the Ministry of Rites.

321
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:55,420
Xu Xin is a big brother.

322
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:56,420
To make this family a family,

323
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:59,420
you sneaked into the prison and stole the secret letter from the Ministry of Rites.

324
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:01,420
You sent Wang Zhenwen a big gift.

325
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:03,420
It's a good thing.

326
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:10,420
A good story that the Ministry of Rites can write.

327
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:13,420
It's a pity that the editor can't do it.

328
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:14,420
It's a good thing?

329
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:15,420
It's for the audience.

330
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:17,420
I'll do it now.

331
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:20,420
Wait a minute.

332
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:22,420
You're going like this?

333
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:26,420
It's so easy to get involved in the case of the crime.

334
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:40,420
What do you mean?

335
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:44,420
I knew it.

336
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:47,420
You'll be back sooner or later.

337
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:50,420
What?

338
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:59,420
The Ministry of Rites said that the number of practice is used to make people smoke.

339
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:01,420
The brain can make a big change in the future.

340
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:04,420
The five-year-old brain is trained by the神 of the神.

341
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:10,420
The child is the future of the people.

342
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:12,420
The brain is rich and smart.

343
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:13,420
Drink the black tea.

344
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:16,420
So sleepy.

345
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:20,420
I have a way.

346
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:23,420
You can use the coffee egg to wake up.

347
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:24,420
It's sugar.

348
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:25,420
It's sugar.

349
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:26,420
It's sugar.

350
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:29,420
Are you awake now?

351
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:30,420
Are you awake?

352
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:33,420
You can use the coffee egg to wake up.

353
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:38,420
How is it?

354
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:40,420
Didn't you get a cold?

355
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:41,420
No.

356
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:42,420
I didn't get a cold.

357
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:45,420
He said that he has a better story.

358
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:46,420
But he's a half-工.

359
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:49,420
If you don't like me,

360
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:50,420
I might do this once again.

361
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:51,420
Then i need to...

362
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:52,420
If i don't like you,

363
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:54,420
you will enliven my life.

364
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:58,420
You know what?

365
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:03,420
Can you tell me out loud,

366
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:05,420
to validate the evidence of your death?

367
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:06,420
To see the whole world?

368
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,420
That's what's going on.

369
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:10,420
발吗?

370
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:12,420
Isn't there anything more new?

371
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:15,420
The story is about

372
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:17,500
the情況 that you gave Wang the audition

373
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,500
You're just going to do that?

374
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,500
Then...

375
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,500
Your brother's secret is so easy to steal.

376
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,500
Big brother thinks about it.

377
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,500
Choose one.

378
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,500
Which one?

379
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,500
Not stealing?

380
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,500
All of them.

381
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,500
The more it hurts, the better.

382
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,500
The more it hurts, the more you feel.

383
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,500
Don't worry.

384
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,500
Big brother has a knife.

385
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,500
It won't hurt you.

386
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,500
This one.

387
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,500
Little dragon.

388
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,500
Good.

389
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,500
This one.

390
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,500
One step down,

391
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,500
six holes.

392
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,500
Not bad.

393
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,500
It doesn't heal.

394
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,500
This one.

395
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,500
It's more flat.

396
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,500
It won't be bleeding.

397
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,500
This one is better.

398
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,500
I can put it on your face.

399
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,500
Not bad.

400
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,500
What I care about the most

401
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,500
is my face.

402
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,500
This one.

403
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,500
Although it's a bit bigger,

404
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:44,500
I can hold it if it's bigger than my face.

405
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,500
Good.

406
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,500
Good.

407
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,500
The head is good.

408
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,500
One step down.

409
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,500
Keep your head flat.

410
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,500
The most important thing is the brain.

411
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,500
This one.

412
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,500
I won't give you the stew tonight.

413
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,500
We have so much money.

414
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,500
We won't give you the stew.

415
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,500
Are you sure?

416
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,500
I'm sure.

417
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,500
You won't change it?

418
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,500
No.

419
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,500
I'm satisfied with you.

420
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,500
No.

421
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,500
Miss Fang, look.

422
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,500
Here you are.

423
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,500
Go.

424
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,500
Xu Lang.

425
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,500
Si Mo.

426
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,500
Xu Lang, what's wrong?

427
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,500
Nothing.

428
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,500
I asked you to come tonight.

429
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,500
I have something for you.

430
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,500
Please give it to Uncle Wang.

431
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,500
I didn't expect to see you here.

432
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,500
I was so worried.

433
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,500
I didn't expect to see you here.

434
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,500
I'm here to give you a piece of my heart.

435
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,500
This.

436
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,500
These secrets.

437
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,500
Where did you get them from?

438
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,500
My brother got them from here.

439
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,500
Your brother?

440
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,500
He isn't Wei Yuan's man.

441
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:13,660
How could you hit him like that?

442
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:14,900
It wasn't my brother who hit him.

443
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:15,900
It was my own...

444
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:17,740
fell...

445
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:19,180
and fell.

446
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:24,060
Does it hurt?

447
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,140
No.

448
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:31,220
Si Mo.

449
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:33,780
Xu Lang.

450
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,140
Si Mo.

451
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:44,680
You'll get hurtoring soon.

452
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,240
I'm sorry, Xu Lang.

453
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,700
Tomorrow, I deposit Li Si He to the research institute

454
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:11,300
Yes.

455
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:13,900
They should not be punished.

456
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:15,100
But I didn't expect

457
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:17,900
they would still be late for the Imperial Palace.

458
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:19,260
Mr. Sun,

459
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:22,380
I've also contacted other Crown Prince's departments.

460
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:23,500
But they heard the news

461
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,220
and were afraid of the emergency.

462
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:28,660
Mr. Shoufu,

463
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:30,940
why don't you just let Yuliang Yi

464
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,700
serve His Majesty?

465
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:35,540
Yuliang Yi is the country's most famous person.

466
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,260
It's easy for me to do so.

467
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:39,900
But it's hard for the people to suffer.

468
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:42,860
I'm sorry.

469
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:50,260
I really don't believe

470
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:54,460
my father's order.

471
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:55,940
Mr. Shoufu,

472
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,060
please don't.

473
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:59,060
Mr. Shoufu, please don't.

474
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:00,060
Please don't.

475
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:01,940
I'm afraid

476
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:04,900
he's too worried about the situation.

477
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:07,660
I have nothing to do with my order.

478
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:10,100
It's all right,

479
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:13,020
but at least we have time left.

480
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:17,100
At least we have time to strike.

481
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:20,140
I need to stop

482
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:28,440
how外視

483
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:31,380
sometimes I don't know what to say.

484
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:35,500
Father,

485
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:37,020
a woman wants to see you.

486
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:39,020
Miss Si Mu, please accept my condolences.

487
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:41,020
If there's no important matter,

488
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:43,020
I won't come here to discuss it.

489
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,020
Come in.

490
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:49,020
What's the matter?

491
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:52,020
I'm here to discuss the matter of

492
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:54,020
your father and your master's worry.

493
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:09,020
With this letter,

494
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:13,020
we'll have a good conscience.

495
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:17,020
But where did you get this letter from?

496
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:19,020
Si Mu was kicked out of the Ministry of Rites by you.

497
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:21,020
He didn't have the money to pay the money.

498
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:23,020
He even paid a huge price.

499
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:25,020
He was sent here by his own family.

500
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:31,020
His brother is Xu Qi'an, a man of the Keng family.

501
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:35,020
So big?

502
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:36,020
Yes.

503
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:38,020
I remember when I saw him,

504
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:40,020
he was still so tall and tall.

505
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,020
Thank you, Your Majesty.

506
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:47,020
I heard that you were sick.

507
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:50,020
I just had a fever.

508
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:52,020
I had you worry.

509
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:53,020
Youde.

510
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:54,020
Yes.

511
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:56,020
Send someone to the Ministry of Rites

512
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:57,020
to get a gold medal.

513
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:59,020
Send it to Mr. Wang's manor.

514
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:00,020
Thank you, Your Majesty.

515
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:02,020
Your Majesty, please change the subject.

516
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:04,020
Let's go another day.

517
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:05,020
Yes.

518
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:08,020
Send Mr. Wang there.

519
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:09,020
Yes.

520
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:25,020
Your Majesty, I'll take my leave.

521
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:26,020
Don't worry.

522
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:38,020
His Majesty changed his mind this morning.

523
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:42,020
Not only did he return the position of the Manor,

524
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:44,020
but also killed his guilty.

525
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:47,020
I guess that some secret letter

526
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:49,020
is related to Duke Cao.

527
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:52,020
Duke Cao is a father's family.

528
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:54,020
He didn't wear any other clothes.

529
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:56,020
He did everything for you.

530
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:59,020
So he came to the Ministry of Rites for years.

531
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:01,020
I think that this is the secret letter

532
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:03,020
that was taken by Wang Zhenwen.

533
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:05,020
That's why you're asking me to take it.

534
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:09,020
The matter about the relationship between Duke Cao and Wang Zhenwen,

535
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:11,020
some of them are true and false.

536
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:13,020
You're so impulsive.

537
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:15,020
It's just that I'm innocent.

538
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:17,020
I'm just a murderer.

539
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:19,020
But in the middle of the night,

540
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:21,020
the Manor must have been turned upside down.

541
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:23,020
It's really an accident.

542
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:27,020
Your Majesty!

543
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:30,020
Your Majesty, uncle.

544
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:31,020
Wang Zhenwen.

545
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:33,020
Why does Wang Zhenwen have these secret letters?

546
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:38,020
Wei Yuan.

547
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:40,020
It's Wei Yuan.

548
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:41,020
Youde.

549
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:42,020
I'm here.

550
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:44,020
I'm tired.

551
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:45,020
I'm going to rest.

552
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,020
Yes.

553
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:47,020
Your Majesty.

554
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:49,020
I'm here to meet the Minister of Rites.

555
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:50,020
I have to go.

556
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:51,020
Your Majesty.

557
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:52,020
Your Majesty.

558
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:55,020
Take care of yourself.

559
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:04,020
It's all done by the Wei Palace.

560
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:06,020
Your Majesty, please don't mind.

561
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:08,020
Father is a quiet person.

562
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:10,020
The Wei Palace is a new world.

563
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:13,020
The plan is not in the temple hall.

564
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:16,020
The plan is not in the real world.

565
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:25,020
If we leave this place because it is a clean palace,

566
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:27,020
Why do we need to think of real people?

567
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,020
The situation has become tense.

568
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:32,020
If you let Brother Liang bênong three times,

569
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:34,020
Ten times is more than ten times lessora.

570
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:36,020
The most important thing is the situation.

571
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:39,020
You must be forced to listen to me while you are crying.

572
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:43,020
All right, just come to the espect� using this path.

573
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:47,020
Don't you want to oppose the pillar since you're tied?

574
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:49,020
I don't want to grateful besides

575
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:50,020
Fhouse Subscribe for people cooking dinner.

576
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:50,580
Besides,

577
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:52,180
I'm just doing my job.

578
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:56,580
Then how hard is it to help me?

579
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:00,380
1kg of rice is 8 yuan.

580
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:03,780
12kg of rice is 1kg.

581
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:07,380
1kg of rice is 8 yuan.

582
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:11,980
When I was in the 2000s,

583
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:15,580
I could buy a piece of knife for 4 yuan.

584
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:18,980
6 yuan is enough to buy a piece of rice.

585
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:21,580
Wei Kong,

586
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:25,180
if you want to marry me to a rice shop,

587
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:27,780
I can count on you.

588
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:30,580
When I was in the golden age,

589
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:33,180
I was able to marry you.

590
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,380
Today is a multi-stakey.

591
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:40,780
There are wars in the north and the south.

592
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:44,180
The country is in a difficult situation.

593
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:47,580
I'm under the pressure of the palace.

594
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:49,380
I'm under the pressure of the Tianshun Company this year.

595
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:52,580
But the situation is still like this.

596
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:58,780
This house is not low price.

597
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:01,780
It will be more than the land and the fire.

598
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:03,980
The road is more narrow and the house is more expensive.

599
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:06,580
You and I are in a high position.

600
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:08,180
Although we are people,

601
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:11,380
we are not experienced.

602
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:15,180
There are people under the sky who are in trouble.

603
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:18,580
There are many people in the sky.

604
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:21,580
If you are a rice shop,

605
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:25,980
I will not marry you.

606
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:32,580
I'm the one who wants to kill the people.

607
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,580
I'm the one who wants to kill the people.

608
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:44,780
Lord Zhou Bu.

609
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:47,580
Please.

610
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:50,780
Please.

611
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:05,780
I will help you.

612
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:08,780
My residence being protected

613
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:10,380
in aHem of the imperial sentries

614
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:12,580
andcare of military monks.

615
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:17,380
I will guard this favor for the people.

616
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:19,540
In ThPlayr,

617
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:22,820
I have a important business.

618
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:27,940
What do you mean by that?

619
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:30,780
Immortal Wu cult omdat�

620
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:31,660
through all people in Beijing.

621
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:35,260
I will invite His Majesty

622
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:37,260
to опдуob the Wusheng Bamboo verschiedenen sect.

623
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:39,740
By then,

624
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:41,660
please accept Daxi

625
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:44,460
to guard the imperial hall

626
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:47,660
and take the credit of defending him.

627
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:24,880
Haven't had enough剑 to dezecomb the crew.

628
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:28,240
You must eat some poison.

629
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:31,440
Since I still haven't had enough water,

630
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:36,300
you need to go back home after 3 consultations.

631
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:39,800
Heaven has no mercy.

632
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:43,980
Don't be in such a mode!

633
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:46,480
He collected the ocean from Yan back then.

634
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,480
I have no right to enter the Ministry of Revenue.

635
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,480
Please go back.

636
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,480
Yes.

637
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,480
Brother.

638
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,480
Xu Qi'an,

639
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,480
Xu Xin's brother.

640
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,480
Yes.

641
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,480
The officer is a hero.

642
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,480
Hero?

643
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,480
I'm here to investigate the case of the Wei Palace.

644
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,480
Didn't I tell you clearly?

645
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,480
Let me say it again.

646
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:05,480
We have no right to enter the Ministry of Revenue.

647
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:08,480
Please go back.

648
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,480
My Lord.

649
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,480
Please forgive me.

650
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,480
Please forgive me.

651
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,480
Okay.

652
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,480
Please forgive me.

653
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,480
Please forgive me.

654
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,480
Come on.

655
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,480
Hold my hand.

656
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,480
What are you doing?

657
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,480
What are you doing?

658
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,480
There is still a way.

659
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,480
You are so devilish.

660
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,480
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

661
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,480
You suddenly realize that

662
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,480
you can't wear a uniform

663
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,480
for a social person like you.

664
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,480
You don't need to wear it.

665
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,480
What do you mean by this Wang Zhenzhen?

666
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,480
Do you know that

667
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,480
the low-level person

668
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,480
is a hero?

669
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,480
And that little officer.

670
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:47,480
He is so small.

671
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,480
Look at his appearance.

672
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,480
And,

673
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,480
why did you stop me just now?

674
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,480
If you don't stop me,

675
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,480
I will definitely turn the tables.

676
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,480
Calm down.

677
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,480
I've already asked someone to bring the painting.

678
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,480
Let Miss Wang do it.

679
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,480
Really?

680
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,480
Okay.

681
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,480
Let's go.

682
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,480
No.

683
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,480
What are you doing?

684
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,480
You are not compatible.

685
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,480
What are you compatible with?

686
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,480
I'm looking for you.

687
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:11,480
Have you paid?

688
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,480
Boss,

689
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:14,480
help me to get it.

690
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,480
Okay.

691
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,480
Xiao'ang,

692
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,480
give me the box.

693
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,480
You are so serious.

694
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,480
I picked it myself.

695
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,480
It's mine.

696
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,480
There is a gold melon seed

697
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,480
in the box.

698
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,480
There is a seed on it.

699
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,480
Open it.

700
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,480
Where did you get it?

701
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,480
Give me the box.

702
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,480
What are you doing?

703
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,480
Give me the box.

704
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,480
You want to get it, right?

705
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,480
You can open it and hear me.

706
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,480
Who are you?

707
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,480
Give me the box.

708
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,480
What?

709
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,480
It's mine.

710
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,480
It's my box.

711
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,480
How do you know

712
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:50,480
there is a gold melon seed

713
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,480
in the box?

714
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,480
There is a seed on it.

715
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,480
Because it's my box,

716
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,480
I know it.

717
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,480
Your box?

718
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,480
There is a seed on it.

719
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,480
But there is no gold melon seed

720
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,480
in it.

721
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,480
There is a gold melon seed.

722
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,480
It's written on it.

723
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,480
Why am I so unlucky?

724
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,480
I always get rid of the box.

725
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,480
The box I got before

726
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,480
was stolen by you.

727
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,480
It seems that the box is not in the box.

728
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:30,480
Big sister,

729
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,480
it's the box he picked.

730
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,480
I saw it myself.

731
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,480
Big sister,

732
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,480
you must believe that

733
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,480
he hit me.

734
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,480
You little boy.

735
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,480
What?

736
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,480
Who is the box?

737
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,480
I see.

738
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,480
The sun is shining.

739
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,480
The waves are flowing.

740
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,480
I suspect that you two

741
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,480
are shooting a group photo, right?

742
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,480
Tell me what you want to say.

743
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,480
What do you want to say?

744
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,480
No.

745
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,480
Right?

746
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,480
I didn't say anything.

747
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,480
I didn't see anything.

748
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,480
What?

749
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,480
Did Tong Huo run away?

750
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,480
Tell me.

751
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,480
No.

752
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,480
Forget it.

753
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,480
If you are scared,

754
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,480
I won't forgive you.

755
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,480
You are lucky.

756
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,480
Sir,

757
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,480
600 taels.

758
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,480
Thank you.

759
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,680
Your words are really

760
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:31,680
so beautiful.

761
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,680
It's just a piece of paper.

762
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:35,680
It's like a piece of wood.

763
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:38,680
It's just that

764
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:40,680
it's not a waste of time.

765
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,680
It's not a burden for people.

766
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:44,680
It seems that the situation

767
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,680
with dad is a little bit different.

768
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,680
What do you mean by

769
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:53,680
what you said?

770
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:55,680
There is something.

771
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:57,680
If you come here

772
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:58,680
to fight against people in the Xu family,

773
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,680
then you don't have to be so strict.

774
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:02,880
What?

775
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:03,880
I think I was wronged.

776
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:06,880
Dad,

777
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,280
you know that

778
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,880
the Xu family is grateful to you.

779
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,880
If you don't see them like this,

780
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,880
it's just a waste of time to be a person.

781
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:17,880
The Xu family is a brother and a brother.

782
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,880
It's obviously a shame.

783
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:20,880
Mo'er,

784
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,880
you are so smart.

785
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,880
You won't be forced by this bitter-sweet chicken.

786
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,880
As I said,

787
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:34,080
the Xu family is just a small family.

788
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:37,080
But what I think

789
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:39,080
is that she can do this for me

790
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,080
and be sincere.

791
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,880
Even if it's bitter-sweet chicken,

792
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,680
I'm happy and happy.

793
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:48,080
Moreover,

794
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,280
she resigned

795
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,280
just to make you change.

796
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,680
You want me to change?

797
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,280
She won't eat in the spring.

798
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,480
That's far from the truth.

799
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,480
You haven't beaten me yet.

800
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,480
Why don't you want to be a family?

801
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,080
You are so petty.

802
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:06,080
You can't make people look down on us.

803
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,480
Li Bu is a court-based land.

804
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,880
Since 14 years ago,

805
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,080
my father has been a wolf-raising master.

806
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:18,080
He never had a big-time job.

807
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,480
Since the Great Feng Sword Dynasty,

808
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,080
he has been a big-time job.

809
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:26,680
Then,

810
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,680
you can go in.

811
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,480
You...

812
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:39,480
You are so full of energy.

813
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:44,480
Come on.

814
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,480
You have to drink some more.

815
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:48,680
Take it.

816
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,480
The secret agent is taking the medicine.

817
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:52,480
The effect is very good.

818
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,480
It's very difficult to take.

819
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,280
Uncle.

820
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,280
Dad.

821
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,280
Who are you giving this to?

822
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,680
To your bitter brother.

823
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:12,480
Brother Chu.

824
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:14,680
Sorry, I'll hang up.

825
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,080
I'm late.

826
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:20,080
How is the progress?

827
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:22,680
Don't mention it.

828
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:24,080
I was kicked by an old man.

829
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:25,880
Long time no see.

830
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,880
Now, you are a family member of the family.

831
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,080
You are so full of energy.

832
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,880
If you don't talk about the priority today,

833
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:34,880
why don't you drink a thousand times?

834
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:36,280
Cheers.

835
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:36,880
Cheers.

836
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:43,680
You are here.

837
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:48,680
It hurts.

838
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,680
It hurts, but you just endure it.

839
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:54,880
Be gentle.

840
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:56,480
No.

841
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,280
It's a little hurt.

842
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,080
I love it.

843
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,480
It's a little hurt.

844
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,080
But I just hit you.

845
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,480
Why are you so serious?

846
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:05,280
Where did you get this scar?

847
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,480
I added it myself.

848
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,680
But no matter how much it hurts,

849
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,480
I still can't see it in Uncle Wang's face.

850
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,680
Brother, you are wrong.

851
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:21,880
Brother is like you.

852
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:22,880
I'm hurt.

853
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,880
I was so surprised yesterday.

854
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,080
I was so old-fashioned.

855
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:31,680
I'm afraid I can't see it in this little play.

856
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,280
I should be a good scholar and a politician.

857
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,880
You are not in a hurry.

858
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,280
In a hurry?

859
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:42,280
Brother, you taught me these dirty things.

860
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,280
Maybe I can only be a clever person.

861
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:46,880
I don't know when I can meet my mother again.

862
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:50,880
Now, I'm only a senior in the village.

863
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:54,480
Only a citizen can be qualified to be a lawyer.

864
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,480
Brother, go out.

865
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:58,880
I don't want to see you again.

866
00:39:59,080 --> 00:39:59,480
Yes.

867
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,080
Sister, I'll explain to you.

868
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:01,880
No.

869
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:02,680
Then I'll explain to you.

870
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:03,480
Brother, brother.

871
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,480
You're all here.

872
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,680
I'm going to tell you.

873
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:06,680
Miss Wang is here.

874
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:08,080
Mother is calling her.

875
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:12,480
Which Miss Wang?

876
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:14,680
Which Miss Wang?

877
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,480
It's all our sister.

878
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:19,480
She wrote it when she was young.

879
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,880
Look, there are two lines.

880
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:26,480
Xu Lang is writing a book of four-leaf clover.

881
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:31,080
It's so cute when he was young.

882
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,680
Cute, cute, cute.

883
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,080
It's so cute.

884
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:38,080
There's more.

885
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:40,280
Let's take a look at this.

886
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:43,480
This is the painting we specially invited

887
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,880
when we were in the old-fashioned family.

888
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:47,080
It's a painting of our family.

889
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,880
Shuren, you're still the same as you were.

890
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:50,880
You're so beautiful.

891
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:51,680
Yes.

892
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,080
Look, look, look.

893
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,880
You're so cool.

894
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:57,280
You didn't know why you were so excited.

895
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:00,280
I only knew later that you know why.

896
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,280
You're so cool.

897
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,480
Don't look at me.

898
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,480
What?

899
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,280
Miss Wang.

900
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,280
What are you doing?

901
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,480
You're a guest.

902
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:11,880
Sister is here.

903
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,680
What are you doing?

904
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,280
You're so polite.

905
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,280
You're so rude.

906
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:18,080
Here you are.

907
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,680
Sister, you're so ignorant.

908
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:22,080
He's just afraid to see you

909
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,480
and wants to force you.

910
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:24,880
Now that he sees you,

911
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,080
he's so polite.

912
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,080
Xu Sijiu,

913
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,680
don't you all have a bad taste in reading?

914
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,480
Don't listen to him.

915
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,680
He's so rude.

916
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,480
Not really.

917
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:44,880
By the way,

918
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,080
I have a key to discuss with you.

919
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,080
Let's talk in private.

920
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,080
Okay.

921
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,480
My dad said that

922
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:53,480
the warehouse is heavily guarded by the court.

923
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,880
It's impossible to enter the house without a sign.

924
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:58,880
But the current situation is not in the best condition.

925
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,080
The weather is bad.

926
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:01,880
If these secret documents

927
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:03,080
are published by the court,

928
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,080
it's bad.

929
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:05,880
So they will move all the information

930
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,880
to the backyard

931
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:10,080
to have a good time today.

932
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,680
I've already set up a security guard.

933
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:14,880
You can take my carriage

934
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:15,680
and go to the backyard.

935
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:16,880
Someone will be responsible.

936
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,280
Thank you for your understanding.

937
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,480
Second brother, good luck.

938
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:26,480
Xi Lang,

939
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:28,280
let me see your wound.

940
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:38,080
It doesn't hurt.

941
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:40,480
It doesn't hurt.

942
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:46,880
Second brother,

943
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:49,880
don't you have something else to do?

944
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:53,880
Go do it now.

945
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:55,880
Yes, yes, yes.

946
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:56,880
I'll go.

947
00:42:58,480 --> 00:42:59,280
Xu Shanshan,

948
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,680
I have a uniform for you.

949
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:02,680
Did you write it for me?

950
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:03,480
Where did you put it?

951
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:04,080
Go find it.

952
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:05,880
I'll go check it.

953
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:06,880
You help me find it.

954
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:07,880
How many times have I told you?

955
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:08,880
The uniform is yours.

956
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:09,880
You're so rude.

957
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:10,880
You're so rude.

958
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:11,880
I'll go find it.

959
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:16,880
I'll go.

960
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:25,880
Let me ask you something.

961
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:29,880
Didn't you just keep talking about...

962
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:31,880
Xu Shanshan,

963
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:33,880
the court is in a serious situation.

964
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:34,880
Miss Wang

965
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:37,880
is a little bit of a trouble.

966
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:39,880
Shen Shen is a little bit of a trouble.

967
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:41,880
His father is indeed a court official.

968
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:42,880
Guo'er should be...

969
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:43,880
quite a big man.

970
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:46,880
Not bad.

971
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:47,880
Not bad?

972
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:48,880
How can you be so rude?

973
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:51,880
I'll give you an example.

974
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:53,880
Second uncle is a court official.

975
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:54,880
He is...

976
00:43:58,880 --> 00:43:59,880
He is a court official.

977
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:00,880
Shen Shen is a little bit of a trouble.

978
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:01,880
I know, I know.

979
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:02,880
Tell me, tell me.

980
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:05,880
His father is also a little bit bigger than Second uncle.

981
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:08,880
He is a sixth-grader.

982
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:10,880
Did you clear it?

983
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:14,880
Master, let's go.

984
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:15,880
Let Ma run faster.

985
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:22,880
Does it hurt?

986
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:24,880
It's just a small injury.

987
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:26,880
It's not good for the body.

988
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:31,880
Xu Lang,

989
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:34,880
do you know who gave this medicine to him?

990
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:39,880
This medicine

991
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:42,880
is the secret prescription my father gave me.

992
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:44,880
Since my father

993
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:47,880
has already agreed to help Xu family secretly,

994
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:49,880
he doesn't want me to see you.

995
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:51,880
You are so smart.

996
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:54,880
Do you know what this means?

997
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:01,880
I will study hard and study hard.

998
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:03,880
I will be famous.

999
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:06,880
I will never let you and Second uncle down.

1000
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:08,880
Bring me the medicine.

1001
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:09,880
Bring me the meat.

1002
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:12,880
I just gave you the medicine.

1003
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:13,880
Don't touch me.

1004
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:21,880
Si Mu.

1005
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:32,880
Si Mu.

1006
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:34,880
Si Mu.

1007
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:39,880
Si Mu.

1008
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:40,880
Si Mu.

1009
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:41,880
Si Mu.

1010
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:42,880
Si Mu.

1011
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:43,880
Si Mu.

1012
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:09,880
Si Mu told you that

1013
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:11,880
your future minister Tony Tony

1014
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:12,880
has been sick for a year.

1015
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:13,880
Are you nervous?

1016
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:14,880
I'm not.

1017
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:15,880
You are not nervous.

1018
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:16,880
You are just

1019
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:18,880
yourself.

1020
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:21,880
His father is a chief of the government.

1021
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:23,880
What kind of noodles did he eat?

1022
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:24,880
What if I choose him?

1023
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:25,880
What if he doesn't like it?

1024
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:27,880
This is the reason

1025
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:29,880
that the whole family of the Chuzhou Tangcu family

1026
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:30,880
is fresh.

1027
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:31,880
The chief of the government doesn't like sweet food.

1028
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:33,880
This is the famous chicken.

1029
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:35,880
I want to see a new person.

1030
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:36,880
Is it?

1031
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:37,880
The new chicken is delicious.

1032
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:38,880
This is the spicy chicken.

1033
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:39,880
This is the spicy chicken.

1034
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:40,880
The chicken is delicious.

1035
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:42,880
It's not good enough.

1036
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:44,880
He is so good at it.

1037
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:46,880
How about this?

1038
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:47,880
Next to the expensive restaurant

1039
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:48,880
is a new restaurant,

1040
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:49,880
the Chuzhou Tangcu.

1041
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:50,880
It is said that the chef

1042
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:51,880
used the seafood power to cook.

1043
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:52,880
The chief of the government

1044
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:53,880
is sure to make it.

1045
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:54,880
Let's try it.

1046
00:46:57,880 --> 00:46:58,880
Don't say it.

1047
00:46:58,880 --> 00:46:59,880
Don't say it.

1048
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:00,880
The chief of the government

1049
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:01,880
will be in Chuzhou in the future.

1050
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:02,880
Isn't it the first product?

1051
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:03,880
Listen to me.

1052
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:04,880
The New Year's Day is coming.

1053
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:06,880
You have to buy it every year.

1054
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:08,880
You can buy it every year.

1055
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:09,880
Mr. Xi,

1056
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:11,880
you are really good this time.

1057
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:14,880
Life is like a class leader.

1058
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:16,880
But this time, the princess said

1059
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:18,880
the chief of the government thinks you...

1060
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:22,880
What's wrong with me?

1061
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:23,880
You are so rich.

1062
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:24,880
You are a great fan of the new year.

1063
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:25,880
Really?

1064
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:27,880
Thank God.

1065
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:29,880
Happy New Year.

1066
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:30,880
Every day.

1067
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:33,880
