1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The hand is not able to hold the wave

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Look at the heart of the young sister

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Look at the heart of the young sister

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Look at the heart of the young sister

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Look at the heart of the young sister

6
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The time has cut me into a piece of lies

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm curious about what I'm going to do next time

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I don't want to think about the future

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
The whole number in my mouth

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Letting this bowl of gold sugar and the third place

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
It's not too hard

12
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
When you're here

13
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
The rules to be accepted are under my control

14
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Just keep on being sick

15
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'll be the one to remove this big piece of Wanji

16
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
We suddenly want to step by step

17
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
We suddenly never want to fight

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
We suddenly stop listening to the difference

19
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
We can always be lonely

20
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
It's my fault for being lonely

21
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
There are people who rely on my heart to be elegant

22
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
This hand is not able to hold the wave

23
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Look at the heart of the young sister

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Look at the heart of the young sister

25
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
The time has cut me into a piece of lies

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm curious about what I'm going to do next time

27
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm curious about what I'm going to do next time

28
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I don't want to think about the future

29
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The whole number in my mouth

30
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Letting this bowl of gold sugar and the third place

31
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
It's not too hard

32
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
When you're here

33
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
The whole number in my mouth

34
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Letting this bowl of gold sugar and the third place

35
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
It's not too hard

36
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
When you're here

37
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
The rules to be accepted are under my control

38
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Just keep on being sick

39
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'll be the one to remove this big piece of Wanji

40
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
You mean

41
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I don't dare to say anything

42
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
But this time I'm here

43
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm here to remove the seal of the lake

44
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'm here to remove the seal of the lake

45
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
That's definitely not a normal

46
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
It's not a normal

47
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
It's not a normal

48
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I have the power to seize power in the court

49
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I have the opportunity

50
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I have the opportunity to seize power in the court

51
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Xu Qian

52
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
You're so bold

53
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
How dare you suspect Prince of Zhenbei

54
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Prince of Zhenbei

55
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Prince of Zhenbei

56
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Yes

57
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Your Majesty

58
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
He's a lucky young man

59
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
He hasn't returned to the capital

60
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Your Majesty

61
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Do you have the plan to

62
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Take Prince of Zhenbei back to the capital

63
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I've never seen

64
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
a very boring man

65
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Your Majesty

66
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Xia Qi is as good as a good man

67
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I'm willing to come here

68
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
with you again

69
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
You guys

70
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
You're good

71
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
You're good

72
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
You're good

73
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
You're good

74
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Xia Qi

75
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Yes, Your Majesty

76
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I'm not bold

77
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I have no idea what you're doing

78
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I'm only doing the case

79
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
What's your suspicion?

80
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
You're right

81
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
You're indeed a good man

82
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Do you want to

83
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
work for me?

84
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Of course I'm begging you

85
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
But I'm now a guest of Princess Ling'an

86
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Although I'm a man of the word

87
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I'm still a man of the word

88
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
If I'm now in your door

89
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I'm afraid I'll be in a hurry

90
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I'm not afraid

91
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I'm just afraid of the bad effect

92
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
that Princess Ling'an will have

93
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
on me

94
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I'm not afraid

95
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I'm willing to be a man of the word

96
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Get up

97
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Yes

98
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I'll take you to Wenyuan Pavilion

99
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Yes

100
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Yes

101
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Come and take a look

102
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
In the capital

103
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
except for the palace

104
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Yunlu Academy

105
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
except for the four heavens

106
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
only this

107
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
can be forgotten

108
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Which treasure do you want?

109
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
The one with the theme pig

110
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
600 taels

111
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Thank you

112
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
No way

113
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Was it the one

114
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Zhou Chi Xiong did in the carriage?

115
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
No

116
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
It's said that

117
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Zhou Zhongying is a woman

118
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
What's wrong?

119
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Nothing

120
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I've finished the carriage

121
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I still haven't found

122
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
the legal equipment

123
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
The legal equipment is always in the way

124
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I can't remember

125
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
the name of the person

126
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
It seems that

127
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I have to go back today

128
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
But

129
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I've thought about it

130
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I wonder if it's related to the legal equipment

131
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
One year ago

132
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
the princess of Pingyang

133
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
was not satisfied with the marriage

134
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
and father was furious

135
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
He ordered that the four heavens

136
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
would use the forgotten equipment

137
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
to chase her

138
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
and she would be fine

139
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Is it possible

140
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
to have the legal equipment

141
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
on the princess of Pingyang?

142
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I'm not sure

143
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
But someone

144
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
is close to Pingyang

145
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
You're right

146
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Could it be...

147
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Lin An?

148
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Princess

149
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
It's so warm

150
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I'm asking for a good view

151
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
from the palace

152
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Princess

153
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I just went to the Gui Yue House

154
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
and bought the most delicious food

155
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
for you

156
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
And the ice cream

157
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
It's so delicious

158
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
You haven't eaten yet

159
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Do you want to

160
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
try it?

161
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
You're so mean

162
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
You're a dog slave

163
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
You're a bastard

164
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Princess

165
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
You're the princess of the country

166
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
You're so generous

167
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
You're so capable

168
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
You're so good

169
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
You're so good

170
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Why do you need a little

171
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
little Xu Qi'an?

172
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
He's a good man

173
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
What's the point of being a good man?

174
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Even if you don't take part in the meeting

175
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
and you're smart

176
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
you can still

177
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
suppress the princess

178
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Really?

179
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Of course

180
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Then tell me

181
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
what I'm smart about

182
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
You...

183
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Tell me

184
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Your eyes are big

185
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
and your temper is good

186
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Your temper is good

187
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
and you can still have a cat

188
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Princess

189
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Look at them

190
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
They're just saying

191
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
you're so kind

192
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Princess

193
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I'm a princess

194
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I'm so good at it

195
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
So what's the point of being smart?

196
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
No, no, no

197
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
So what's the point of being smart?

198
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
But I can find

199
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
the most intelligent person

200
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
to be my guest

201
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
You're right

202
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
There are so many people

203
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
who can be so good

204
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
to Xu Qi'an

205
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I'm the one who's the best

206
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
in the world

207
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
You're so good, princess

208
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
You finally stand up

209
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I stand up

210
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I thought Xu Qi'an

211
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
would be so anxious

212
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
and I was in a dilemma

213
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
between Huai Xing and me

214
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I didn't expect that

215
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
he was so good at it

216
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Who am I?

217
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I'm the first princess of Da Feng

218
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I'm not a bad person

219
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I've never

220
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
met him since I was born

221
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I'm not good at it

222
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Right, you're not good at it

223
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
You're not good at it

224
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Princess

225
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I'm going to ask

226
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
your secret confidant

227
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I don't believe it

228
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
It's a big event

229
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
and he can't be Xu Qi'an

230
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Right, let's go now

231
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Let's go

232
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Ruza, Ruza

233
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Xu Tonglu is outside the door

234
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Xu Qi'an

235
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
You're still here for business

236
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Wang

237
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I'm here to ask Huai Xing

238
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I'm here to ask Ling An

239
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
to talk to you

240
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
You're angry

241
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
You won't see you

242
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Go back

243
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
You're angry?

244
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Who's angry

245
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
with the fool?

246
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Tell me

247
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I'll kill him

248
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Why are you so serious?

249
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Princess

250
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Why are you still laughing?

251
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
He's so shameless

252
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
He's just fighting with you

253
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
but he's not good at it

254
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
But I'm the one who's lying to him

255
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
He's angry with me

256
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Let's settle this

257
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Princess

258
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
You just said

259
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
you wanted to fight with him

260
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I'm not a good person

261
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I'm not a good person

262
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I'm not a good person

263
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I just said

264
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I can't fight with him

265
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Right

266
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I don't usually

267
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
say

268
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I want to send you out of the palace

269
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
This is a plan

270
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I can't say it

271
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
No, princess

272
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
If you let him go so easily

273
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
he will think you're a good talker

274
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
How can he treat you like that?

275
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
It makes sense

276
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
It makes sense

277
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
You have to let him remember it

278
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
It's been an hour

279
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Jinmei called me out

280
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
but he didn't come out to see me

281
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
He just wanted me to remember it

282
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
It's not a good idea

283
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
No

284
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
There is

285
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Yes

286
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Yes

287
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
He's still here.

288
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
What?

289
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
He's still here.

290
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
He's really here.

291
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Come in.

292
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Princess.

293
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
No.

294
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Why?

295
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
It's a little hot in the neighborhood.

296
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
If you can't bear the test,

297
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
how can you be filial to the princess?

298
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I'm filial to the princess.

299
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
So...

300
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
But...

301
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Master.

302
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Master.

303
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Master Xu fainted at the door just now.

304
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
He fainted?

305
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Master Xu said he stood too long at the door.

306
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
He was struck by a fever and a heart attack.

307
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
He was injured and repressed several days ago.

308
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
He didn't let him stand under the fever.

309
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
He said it was a sincerity.

310
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
A sincerity?

311
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Master Xu also said

312
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
if he can't bear the test,

313
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
how can he be filial to the princess?

314
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
It's my word.

315
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Your word?

316
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
He also said

317
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
he asked Wen to leave him alone.

318
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
He wanted you to return to your country

319
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
and live a life of peace.

320
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
You also want the land and the sea to cool down.

321
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
He's asking me to beg you.

322
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
He wants you to be soft and soft.

323
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Please come in.

324
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Princess.

325
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
You let him go?

326
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
It's too much.

327
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
But he did it on purpose.

328
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I know.

329
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
The sun is so big.

330
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Even if he's hurt,

331
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
he'll be hit.

332
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Princess.

333
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Don't be soft.

334
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Kangzi, forget it.

335
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Princess.

336
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Kangzi.

337
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Princess.

338
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Kangzi.

339
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
No.

340
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I'm here today.

341
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Go out and see him.

342
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Who am I?

343
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Who said I'm the princess?

344
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Who said I'm the princess?

345
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
You said I'm the princess.

346
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Please come in.

347
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Yes.

348
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Yes.

349
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Thank you.

350
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
The moon falls without a single drop.

351
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
The wind and the fire.

352
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
The enemy is gone.

353
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
The people are all dead.

354
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Is this really the poem written by Li An?

355
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Yes.

356
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Your Majesty.

357
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
The Prime Minister of the State of Zijian

358
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
praised Princess Lin'ai.

359
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
He's so close.

360
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
He also said that when Princess Lin'ai was married,

361
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
she must have been a new star of the poem.

362
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
She can compare with Princess Huaiqing.

363
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Guo Zhen is my daughter.

364
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Yes.

365
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Once she's happy,

366
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
she's really talented.

367
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Yes.

368
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Hui Yuan, look.

369
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
What did Lin'an do?

370
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Congratulations, Father.

371
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
It seems that you've been alone for a while.

372
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
How is it?

373
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
The fire is on.

374
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Yes.

375
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Your Majesty.

376
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Linglong just got out of the water.

377
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Linglong?

378
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I haven't seen him in a while.

379
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
But Linglong is not very happy today.

380
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Or she's annoyed.

381
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
The few princes and concubines

382
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
have been thrown down by him.

383
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
It's strange.

384
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Linglong is gentle and gentle.

385
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
She's 100% gentle to His Majesty.

386
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
How could she be so innocent?

387
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Take a look.

388
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Yes.

389
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Your Majesty.

390
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Is Hu Pan here today?

391
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Yes.

392
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
The person who's interested can still write a poem.

393
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
It's good to be satisfied.

394
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
What's wrong, Wei?

395
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Nothing.

396
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
What's wrong with you?

397
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Why did the princes play with you since you were little?

398
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Why did they play with you since you were little?

399
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
It's been years since I've seen you.

400
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I think you're very lonely.

401
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Your Majesty, you're kind.

402
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Since you came,

403
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Linglong has been so happy.

404
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I think Linglong's journey

405
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
is also because of your idea.

406
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Princess.

407
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Princess.

408
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
You're awake.

409
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
He can't take a discussion with His Majesty.

410
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,960
He always makes the most of matters things in an早,

411
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,000
anything he wants to do,

412
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I think he's too anxious because

413
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
it wouldn't make sense for him to come home today.

414
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Who would have thought that,

415
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
you would have come to Hi-Hong?

416
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
What did you expect?

417
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
How could that be?

418
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
You should have started with that place earlier.

419
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
But I'm here this time.

420
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Don't bother.

421
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I'm back for work.

422
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Yong Yun.

423
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
You're going to see the princess, because she can't do it?

424
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,440
I'll come back to you and ask for your forgiveness.

425
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,320
What for?

426
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,400
I'll be punished.

427
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,160
Third,

428
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,280
first,

429
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,080
I'll be able to congratulate you on your marriage.

430
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,040
You'll be the head of the Shihui Pavilion.

431
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,040
Second,

432
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,240
as a guest,

433
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,760
I'll be able to find you

434
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,760
a new wife.

435
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:37,360
Third...

436
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,200
Enough.

437
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,240
Say it.

438
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:40,720
What's the purpose?

439
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:41,560
The purpose?

440
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,360
I'm just here to ask for your forgiveness.

441
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,800
You're not...

442
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,640
I'm just here to ask for your forgiveness.

443
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,360
I'm just here to ask for your forgiveness.

444
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,200
What?

445
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,080
What's wrong?

446
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,040
He didn't take care of you?

447
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:57,920
He did.

448
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,320
But I refuse.

449
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,800
Princess Ling'an brought me here.

450
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,720
I'm the one who's been waiting for you.

451
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,320
I'm here to ask for your forgiveness.

452
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,920
she pushed me?

453
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,360
Have you gone mad?

454
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,560
She pushed me away?

455
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,960
Shut up!

456
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,080
I don't seem to understand

457
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,040
your Babe.

458
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,640
What do you know?

459
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,340
There is a strict rule

460
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,600
aboutuge of loser.

461
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,320
How beautiful!

462
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:42,800
Still so equally trivial.

463
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,000
I was rich and had no trouble to sleep in.

464
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,080
And I was offended.

465
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,640
What I had at last was among three times

466
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,360
was Huaixing's atmospheric composure

467
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,840
which gave listeners my recommendation,

468
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,680
saving me from water and disaster is inevitable.

469
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,120
How could you make me think about resiting?

470
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,160
Compliments

471
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:11,960
I'm a sinner who will be executed

472
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,080
If I'm not the princess today,

473
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:18,960
I can't refuse a prince, a crown prince,

474
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,960
or even a eunuch

475
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,560
I can't refuse

476
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,960
You're right. You're the princess

477
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,960
No

478
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,160
No

479
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:49,600
Forget it

480
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:51,960
Get up

481
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,160
Though I took off the secret token of Her Highness Huaiqing,

482
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,480
my heart

483
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,880
still makes me disgusted

484
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:10,640
I'm not talking about these words.

485
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,720
You made me lose my favor in front of everyone.

486
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,320
That's because I lied to you first.

487
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:29,800
And I told Wei Yuan Bu

488
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,760
that I didn't let Jian Zheng blackmail you.

489
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,720
I told you these words

490
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:39,160
because I wanted you to be loyal to me.

491
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,640
That's what I wanted.

492
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,000
I'll just take it as a fairytale.

493
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:53,600
Princess, you're really a good girl.

494
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:01,440
Then you can be my guest in the future.

495
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:04,040
As for Huai Qi.

496
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,560
If you had concerns, then we'd be willing to give up on him.

497
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,560
Can we come up with another way to keep you intact?

498
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,640
It's just a good thing.

499
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,720
I want to buy a land

500
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,720
Buy land

501
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,720
The death of the princess

502
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,720
It's alive

503
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:48,720
What's the meaning of this

504
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,720
This is my loyalty to the princess

505
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,720
I said

506
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,720
Not only this

507
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,720
Just go back if you're okay

508
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:06,720
Anything else

509
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,720
No, no

510
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,720
Go

511
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,720
Then I will leave

512
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,720
Don't be so anxious

513
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,720
Just say something

514
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,720
I have one thing

515
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:48,720
Do you know Princess Pingyang

516
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,720
Princess Qibing

517
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,720
Xu Tongluo

518
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,720
I saw Princess Ling'an

519
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,720
Now

520
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,720
The two of them went to the garden

521
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,720
What did you find

522
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,720
Princess Pingyang is related to the Sangbo case

523
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,720
But it's just a guess

524
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,720
Now the case is closed

525
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,720
How do you get into the case

526
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,720
So

527
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,720
Princess Pingyang is missing

528
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,720
Please don't be so serious

529
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,720
I don't want to

530
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,720
Then don't tell others

531
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,720
I will know about this alone

532
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,720
I don't know how to talk

533
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,720
But Pinggong sister

534
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,720
Is my best friend in the palace

535
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,720
Also the best person in the world

536
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,720
Lingyan, come here quickly

537
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,720
I'm coming

538
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:00,720
Take it

539
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,720
Lingyan, give me the scissors

540
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,720
Keep going

541
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,720
Okay

542
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,720
Don't be found

543
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,720
Hurry up

544
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,720
We grew up together

545
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,720
The whole wind and rain

546
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,720
We are the same

547
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,720
We are precious

548
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,720
But in the past

549
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,720
I was taught to be virtuous and virtuous

550
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,720
Not so free

551
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,720
Lingyan

552
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,720
I'm sorry

553
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,720
I'm sorry

554
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,720
Lingyan

555
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,720
You two are like princess and princess

556
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,720
But you climb the tree and pick the 16

557
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,720
So good

558
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,720
Forget it, don't laugh

559
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,720
I'm sorry

560
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,720
But we are very lucky

561
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,720
To meet each other and become friends

562
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,720
He is like

563
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,720
The other me in the mirror

564
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,720
Do you dare to catch 16

565
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,720
Who doesn't dare

566
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,720
I thought

567
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,720
Life will be so peaceful

568
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,720
Growing up

569
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,720
Family

570
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,720
It's old

571
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,720
But

572
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,720
But I didn't expect

573
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,720
He is more powerful than me

574
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,720
And more brave than me

575
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:32,720
Princess Pingyang is the one who is going to marry you

576
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,720
I didn't find it before

577
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,720
But now I feel

578
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,720
Maybe

579
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:46,720
From the person we met in the Qinglongtang

580
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,720
Sister's heart

581
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,720
Is more than you want to escape

582
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,720
Qinglongtang

583
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,720
That person

584
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,720
Is the one in the Qinglongtang

585
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:02,720
It's called Henghui

586
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,720
Take it

587
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:06,720
Yes, yes

588
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,720
And this

589
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:08,720
That day

590
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,720
We often go to Qinglongtang

591
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,720
To help those poor children

592
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,720
Lingyan

593
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:20,720
How are you

594
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,720
Don't cry, don't cry

595
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:36,720
Are you okay?

596
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:38,720
Come

597
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,720
You'll be fine after a while

598
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,720
Henghui was there

599
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,720
When she appeared with us

600
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,720
She came and went

601
00:27:58,720 --> 00:27:59,720
She was familiar

602
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:04,720
The city of Jianzhou is located in the west of the capital

603
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,720
From the waterway to the river

604
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,720
It can reach Jianzhou

605
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,720
The wind blows during the spring

606
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,720
The water flows

607
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,720
So it is called the heaven

608
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,720
The river flows into the rain

609
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:20,720
And the wind blows again

610
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,720
Henghui is a dizzy person

611
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,720
He has seen the great wind

612
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,720
And the great mountains

613
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,720
And the wind is strong

614
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,720
I envy him

615
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,720
I think he is the same as you

616
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:56,720
Good

617
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:04,720
You go

618
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,720
Just a little bit

619
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:16,720
So good

620
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:34,720
Until that day

621
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,720
My father gave Pingyang a wedding

622
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,720
After that

623
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,720
He asked me

624
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,720
If people can grow wings

625
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,720
Will not be comforted by this high wall

626
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,720
I think one day

627
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,720
He will be shocked and hurt

628
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,720
But I didn't expect

629
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,720
Lingyan

630
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,720
I'm leaving

631
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,720
No

632
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,720
How can you escape the royal court

633
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,720
There are forgotten books in the temple

634
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,720
If they catch you

635
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:30,720
You will be finished

636
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,720
Lingyan

637
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,720
Don't worry

638
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,720
We have arranged everything

639
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:40,720
I come

640
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,720
Just want to see you before I leave

641
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:44,720
But

642
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:45,720
The world of money

643
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,720
Including the thousands of ideas

644
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,720
I don't want to be trapped in the forest

645
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,720
I need to live

646
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,720
The land of Henghui

647
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:00,720
Only the great wind

648
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,720
But I want my family

649
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,720
To change the world

650
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,720
Lingyan

651
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,720
Can you help me

652
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,720
Yes

653
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,720
I can't take Nanjing

654
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,720
I want to give you a letter

655
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:43,720
Wait for me

656
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,720
I will come back to you

657
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,720
Sister Lingyang

658
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,720
Can you leave

659
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,720
The royal court

660
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:26,720
The royal court

661
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:28,720
The royal court

662
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,720
The royal court

663
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:30,720
The royal court

664
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,720
Is forced to raise ministry of turbo drain

665
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,720
Yes

666
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,120
This paper

667
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,720
Is in the heart of the people around

668
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,720
And even sister Lingyang's family

669
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:41,720
Was involved

670
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,720
Y 용INGING

671
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,720
This paper

672
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:48,720
I heard

673
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,720
Yworming died

674
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,720
By high filial piety

675
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,720
Because she became a humpback

676
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,720
No

677
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,720
YONGinging is appropriate

678
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,120
and told me not to run away from marriage.

679
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,320
But it was because of the war against the palace.

680
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,120
So I was attacked by the enemy.

681
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,400
Attacked by the enemy?

682
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,640
Do you know who did it?

683
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:15,200
No.

684
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:20,840
Now there is only one person left in the family.

685
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,040
He is a fighter.

686
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:26,880
I can't get up.

687
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,160
I don't want to marry you.

688
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,640
You don't have to blame yourself.

689
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,040
It's not your fault.

690
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:44,840
There are many regrets and mistakes in this world.

691
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:51,560
You are right.

692
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:55,960
What's important is finding your sister and the family.

693
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:56,960
What's the situation?

694
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,040
After Princess Pingyang was born,

695
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,320
did she ever appear?

696
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:04,440
No.

697
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,040
Even the royal uncle is sad.

698
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,640
He won't love me.

699
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:16,080
What if that good man is not there?

700
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,480
What if they are in danger?

701
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,720
Princess, don't worry.

702
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,320
When they left,

703
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,360
they brought a weapon that can cover the flag.

704
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,680
If you want to hide the traces,

705
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,040
it's not a difficult task.

706
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,320
Maybe.

707
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:34,280
Sister Dan didn't want to take me.

708
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:37,680
She told me where she wanted to go.

709
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,640
After the war,

710
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,080
I asked someone to look for her.

711
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:46,200
But she disappeared like Pinggong did.

712
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,360
Disappeared?

713
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,640
Did Princess go to Qinglongtang

714
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,200
to ask for a meeting?

715
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,040
She did.

716
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,640
But she didn't see the only

717
00:34:56,920 --> 00:35:00,600
good brother in the whole Southland.

718
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:02,600
She is far away.

719
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,280
Yes.

720
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,000
She is not good at making troubles.

721
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:11,800
Really?

722
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:15,640
Thank you, Princess.

723
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,280
You are a useful clue.

724
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,080
You helped me a lot this time.

725
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,680
I will go to the capital.

726
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,080
I will go to the capital.

727
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,280
I will go to the capital.

728
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,480
I will go to the capital.

729
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,800
I will go to the capital.

730
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,120
I will go to the capital.

731
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,520
I will go to the capital.

732
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:34,800
I will go to the capital.

733
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,120
I will go to the capital.

734
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,520
I will go to the capital.

735
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:38,840
I will go to the capital.

736
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,080
I will go to the capital.

737
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,520
I will go to the capital.

738
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:42,680
I will go to the capital.

739
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,880
I will go to the capital.

740
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,080
I will go to the capital.

741
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,200
I will go to the capital.

742
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,360
I will go to the capital.

743
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,600
I will go to the capital.

744
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,800
I will go to the capital.

745
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,080
I will go to the capital.

746
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,240
I will go to the capital.

747
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,360
I will go to the capital.

748
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,960
I will go to the capital.

749
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:59,000
I will go to the capital.

750
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,280
I will go to the capital.

751
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,560
I will go to the capital.

752
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,600
I will go to the capital.

753
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:08,440
I will go to the capital.

754
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,920
I will go to the capital.

755
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,520
I will go to the capital.

756
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:12,920
I will go to the capital.

757
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,960
I will go to the capital.

758
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:17,400
I will go to the capital.

759
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,280
You can go to the capital.

760
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,800
no

761
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,000
How much is one due to the level of basic income?

762
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,200
Let go of her!

763
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,120
Kill them well

764
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,520
시에

765
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,800
Kill them all

766
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:52,800
Father

767
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,800
What's wrong with Linglong?

768
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,800
She wants to escape.

769
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,800
Stop her!

770
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,800
If you find out about Pingyang,

771
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,800

00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:18,800
Okay.

00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:27,840
No, no.

775
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:54,440

780
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:25,520

781
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:27,360

782
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,640
Yes, it's me here.

783
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,200
Go explain why you were here.

784
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:34,440
I forgot to ask my uncle

785
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,200

791
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,280

793
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:53,900
I wanted to cry out loud

794
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:54,380

795
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:55,420

00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:26,440

Don't be afraid. It's okay

802
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,440
Don't be afraid

803
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,440
It's okay

804
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,440
Don't be afraid

805
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,440
Don't be afraid

806
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:23,440
This is so boring

807
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:25,440

What's up, brothers?

810
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,440
You usually take care of this little boy, right?

811
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:51,440
He doesn't understand much

812
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,440
Father

813
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,440

00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,440
It's okay

817
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:09,440

This person is the one who investigated Sangguan's Xu Xi'an

825
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:30,440
The one who broke the sleep pill before is this person

826
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:32,440
Da Gengren?

827
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:36,440
Ling'an has mentioned you to me

828
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:39,440
You are indeed young and well-behaved

829
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:42,440
Father, Xu Xi'an saved me

830
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,440
Should I reward him?

831
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,440
Of course, reward him

832
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:48,440

He's saved Ling'an's life

838
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:05,440
How will Ling'an pay it?

839
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,440
So please ask Father

840
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,440
to bless him, so as not to be a wicked attack

841
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:14,440

The deadline is still half a month.

847
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,160

848
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:34,640
I will naturally spare your death.
