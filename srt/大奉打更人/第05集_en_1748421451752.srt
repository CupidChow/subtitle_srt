This world, once I was lonely.

3
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:07,200
I got used to it.

4
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:10,520
In my head, someone imprisoned me.

5
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,860
Fights in your left hand remains.

00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:17,600

I'm a loser, I'm a coward, I'm a coward

12
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:36,880
I'm a coward, I'm a coward, I'm a coward

13
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,280
I'm a loser, I'm a coward, I'm a coward

14
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:43,760

15
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,640
Don't be scared.

16
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,240
This is a gift from Mr. Jian.

17
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:02,680
I'm a loser, I'm a coward, I'm a coward

20
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:14,680

21
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,560
Xiao You taught me a lesson.

22
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,480
I also gave Xiao You a gift.

23
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,480
Thank you, Mr. Guan.

24
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:28,480
The teacher is not here.

25
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,480
You can go.

26
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,480
Thank you, Mr. Jin.

27
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,480
He must be busy.

28
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,480
He heard it.

29
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,480
He heard it.

30
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,480
I heard it, he didn't.

31
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,480
What are you doing?

32
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,480
Pack up.

33
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,480
Pack up.

34
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,480
So this is the book of the year.

35
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,480

36
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,480

37
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,480
No.

38
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,480
He's hitting me.

39
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,480

40
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,480

Ft. Sword.

the boleh pickle for the guests.

52
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,160
Tap the candles.

53
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,440
Delicious tea,

54
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,040
best in origin.

55
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,600
It must be an old foreign少OOEDE.

56
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,520
Quickly.

57
00:04:54,480 --> 00:05:13,040
다� visual

58
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,040
You see a man,

59
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:18,860
seems like not a Sayudan Sword deutlich

60
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,820
Wei Got the point, Xuquan

61
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,320
Exactly.

62
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,680
He's an interesting person.

63
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,680
Interesting?

64
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,680
Tell me about it.

65
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:35,960
Xu Qian.

66
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,960
He's a genius.

67
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,200
A genius in the realm of the world.

68
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,520
If he's not in the wrong way,

69
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,600
if he's in the private world,

70
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,320
he'll surely have his name in the history book.

71
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,440
This person is just ordinary.

72
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,680
When did you see the private world?

73
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,360
I've sent him a gift.

74
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,040
It's not Kang Kai.

75
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,480
It's the exchange of the wait.

76
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,160
The exchange of the wait?

77
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,440
Interesting.

78
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:20,240
Today, I'll write a poem for you.

79
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,680
Don't worry about the future.

80
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,360
No one in the world is a king.

81
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:29,360
I've listened to the poem of the family.

82
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,800
I wonder which one of you wrote it.

83
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,600
This poem is not from the book.

84
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,520
It's from Chang Le County.

85
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,520
Three years ago,

86
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:47,560
the Northern Kui Clan went back to the seclusion and violated the border.

87
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,560
The Southern Kui Clan was in a bad mood.

88
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,880
They attacked the military.

89
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,160
The state of Tianyu refuted the psychophiles

90
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,840
andsofied a squadron at the border.

91
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:00,000
And the imperial council arrested the imperial superiors,

92
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:03,160
losing control of his people pictures and books.

93
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:07,200
It's not the time the edict was at stake.

94
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:12,200
Now the battle is complete.

95
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:17,080
he is the best archmage trainer in this country.

96
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:20,960
Though King Zhenwen blocked Yu to dis Elementary School,

97
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,600
We finally caught the sick man.

98
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,480
We can get rid of him.

99
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,160
Fei Yi.

100
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,760
Just do as you wish.

101
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,560
Let him do it.

102
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,160
Yes.

103
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:51,800
Cixiu.

104
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,000
You really don't have to follow me.

105
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,720
You're not done yet.

106
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,520
I'm a martial artist.

107
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,200
I came to the Academy of Art.

108
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,520
If I hit the teacher,

109
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,960
I'll be punished.

110
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,440
I'll be in trouble.

111
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,800
I'm not talking about you.

112
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,440
You're thinking too much.

113
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,280
Look.

114
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,640
Qing Yun Shang is so big.

115
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,920
We're in the same boat.

116
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,520
When can we get to the Academy of Art?

117
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,840
Why don't you go down?

118
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:13,720
Brother, go down.

119
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,520
No, right?

120
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:14,920
No.

121
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,520
Sit tight.

122
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,080
Go.

123
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:18,960
Wrong.

124
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,360
You're so impolite.

125
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,680
This is the rule.

126
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,160
The Saint is wrong.

127
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,480
He's a great man.

128
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,200
Saint?

129
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,960
Did the Saint say that?

130
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,440
Brother Fei.

131
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,280
The Saint is...

132
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,520
The Academy of Art

133
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,680
talks about Saint's theory.

134
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,000
It's too little.

135
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,840
It's true.

136
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,920
He's a man.

137
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:43,760
Old man.

138
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,280
He's a man.

139
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:45,880
Your Majesty.

140
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,080
Your student is in the new year.

141
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,240
Why did he come back?

142
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,160
I don't see him.

143
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,240
He's just like

144
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,480
his brother.

145
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,800
Xu Xian.

146
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,640
He's coming.

147
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,920
Come on.

148
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,040
What a good thing he brought.

149
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,400
Greetings, Mr. Xu.

150
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,160
I've seen you two in the new year.

151
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,200
Did you finish

152
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,240
the three-hand skill?

153
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:10,560
No.

154
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,320
I'll do it now.

155
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,160
Forget it.

156
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,960
Go get some tea.

157
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,280
What?

158
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,600
I'll get you some tea.

159
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,600
You're so good.

160
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,640
You'll get it.

161
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,720
What are you waiting for? Go.

162
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:22,760
Yes.

163
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,160
Ningning.

164
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,880
You said you had a lot of mistakes yesterday.

165
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:30,920
Could you please

166
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,360
show me some?

167
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,120
Yes.

168
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,040
You have a lot of mistakes.

169
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,160
It's a pity that you didn't do anything today.

170
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,120
Why?

171
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,640
I have a favor to ask you.

172
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,280
But I can't.

173
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,320
I have a sister.

174
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:51,840
She's beautiful.

175
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:54,160
I'll call her Fang Si.

176
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,720
I want to make a wish for Xu Feng.

177
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,080
What's this?

178
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,280
It's a bit hard to make a wish.

179
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,960
I can't make a wish.

180
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,600
It's the rules of the Yuncheng Hall.

181
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,560
The royal family

182
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,200
didn't...

183
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,680
They didn't make a wish.

184
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,040
Yes.

185
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,960
It's a pity.

186
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,000
I'll take my leave.

187
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,760
No.

188
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:42,760
What else?

189
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:43,760
Well...

190
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,720
You said

191
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,920
you had a family to study.

192
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:51,520
Yes.

193
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,560
We have a second sister.

194
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,160
Look.

195
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,480
So interesting.

196
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,840
So interesting.

197
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,880
I can't let the rules of the Yuncheng Hall

198
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,880
fail.

199
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:00,840
I can't fail.

200
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,920
I can't fail.

201
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:04,920
How about

202
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,640
we help you think of a way?

203
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,040
Thank you.

204
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,400
I'll go.

205
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,360
Don't forget to go!

206
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,840
Brother Dan,

207
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:24,960
I remember

208
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:25,880
the opening ceremony

209
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,320
in the Yuncheng Hall tomorrow.

210
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,120
Yeah.

211
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,800
Is the opening ceremony

212
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,680
a防 Di indeed

213
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:34,560
for the virtual alchemist?

214
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,160
Well,

215
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,100
theoisforward

216
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,880
does not go on there tomorrow.

217
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,600
Su 구�呀

218
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,440
If you could touch on a film

219
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,440
I can give you a single run

220
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,960
to persuade the teacher.

221
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,040
You can do it there.

222
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:49,640
Okay.

223
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,760
I see.

224
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,040
I can persuade the teacher.

225
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:53,640
Wait.

226
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,960
Not enough for one hand.

227
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,080
You can count it.

228
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,680
The president needs to persuade the teacher tomorrow.

229
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,920
The next day,

230
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,480
the teacher needs to persuade the teacher.

231
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,000
Brother Wen,

232
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,360
you need to persuade the teacher.

233
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:04,960
Yes.

234
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,440
You can count it.

235
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,800
Fifty-fifty-eight-seven.

236
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,480
Twenty-five.

237
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,000
Yes.

238
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,360
Twenty-five.

239
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:14,600
Yes.

240
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,200
Brother Wen,

241
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,360
it's not a matter of one hand.

242
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:20,800
Yes.

243
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,600
Twenty-fifty-eight-seven.

244
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,880
It's really hard.

245
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:23,640
But

246
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:26,440
you think about our difficulties.

247
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,760
You are very good at this.

248
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,840
If you don't make it into

249
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,720
the mouth of each person,

250
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,640
it's hard to do it, right?

251
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,440
Yes.

252
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,400
I understand.

253
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,480
I understand.

254
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,680
The teachers and the teachers

255
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,880
lent me a toothpick.

256
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,040
Let me think about the test.

257
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,720
Test?

258
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,000
Tu'er, please.

259
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,040
The teachers have checked it.

260
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,440
Twenty-fifty.

261
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,720
The teachers really dare to mention it.

262
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,960
You are really brave.

263
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,360
No.

264
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,600
They are too much.

265
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,760
I will go find them and give them a lesson.

266
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,080
The mountains have roads, the love is quiet.

267
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:11,480
The mountains have no teeth, the bitter is the porridge.

268
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,600
Brother Wen said

269
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,480
they will take a harsh end to their reputation.

270
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:16,800

271
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:17,560

The little chant you got

282
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,360

How come-

291
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,360
Why is there no lower part of the sentence?

292
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,200
And there's only a name.

293
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,520
It's all blank.

294
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:38,560
This...

295
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,360
Qi An.

296
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,160
This...

297
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:41,560
This is...

298
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,960
The students are really experienced.

299
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,960
There's not much to write in one hour.

300
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,560
I hope you two can understand each other.

301
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,160
Forget it.

302
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:54,560
Go.

303
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,560
Teacher promised me.

304
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,360
Don't worry.

305
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,160
I'll do my best.

306
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,520
Then I'll fulfill my duty.

307
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,640
I can't believe I have to go.

308
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:20,920
It is bothering me.

309
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,480
At the thought of it,

310
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,720
you are silent for half an hour.

311
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,760
But I thought I could fulfill your duty.

312
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,560
I Because completed eating in I had gone for three hours.

313
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,280
I'll go.

314
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,520
No matter how good the food is,

315
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,240
it's a waste of time.

316
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,720
What a pity.

317
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:47,960
Where are you going?

318
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:48,880
What are you looking at?

319
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:49,800
It's a waste of time.

320
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:50,800
Throw it away.

321
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,880
Don't think

322
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,480
you're making a deal.

323
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:53,960
I...

324
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,160
You got the good food

325
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,720
and you're the one who made it.

326
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,280
You're not a famous person.

327
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,280
You little brat.

328
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,680
You're a scholar.

329
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,080
How can you use the excuse?

330
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,080
You're a good student.

331
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,280
I'm tired of your name.

332
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,880
Why are you dragging me in?

333
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:08,720
I'm not.

334
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:09,840
What are you doing?

335
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,760
I'm not.

336
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,200
Fine, you're not.

337
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,320
I'm not.

338
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,520
I'm not.

339
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,520
Mr. President.

340
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,000
It's not a good thing.

341
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,480
Zhang Shen and Li Mu Bai

342
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,520
are fighting each other.

343
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,600
Why are you doing this?

344
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,400
This...

345
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,280
This...

346
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,240
This is...

347
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:26,800
This is...

348
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:27,400
This is...

349
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,520
This is...

350
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,280
This is...

351
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,120
This is...

352
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:30,920
This is...

353
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:31,720
This is...

354
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,280
This is...

355
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,040
This is...

356
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,160
Zhang Shen.

357
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,720
You're a shameless man.

358
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,240
You can just take me as a student.

359
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,200
Today,

360
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,360
you're going to do

361
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,520
a shameless thing.

362
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,480
You're a student.

363
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,040
You've learned a lot.

364
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,120
You're a scholar.

365
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,080
You can't

366
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,240
accept the teacher's words.

367
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,240
I've seen

368
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,680
their friends in the past.

369
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,800
I've always let you do it.

370
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,000
If you're a shameless man,

371
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,440
you'll be ashamed of me.

372
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,520
You old man.

373
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,760
You made it clear.

374
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:58,600
I let you do it.

375
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,960
You didn't let me do it.

376
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,280
If you're a shameless man,

377
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,360
I won't do it.

378
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,160
Who's afraid of who?

379
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:04,880
Come on.

380
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,760
Come on.

381
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,240
Come on.

382
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:07,920
Come on.

383
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:08,760
Come on.

384
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:09,800
I...

385
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,520
I'll let you do it.

386
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,600
Greetings, President.

387
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:23,440
President.

388
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,200
Greetings, Princess.

389
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:25,920
Good job.

390
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:27,840
What's going on?

391
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,480
Nothing.

392
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,000
I and Mu Bai

393
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,320
are in the same room.

394
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,440
We're a bit different.

395
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,680
We can't convince anyone.

396
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,240
Right?

397
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,080
Yes.

398
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,560
So we changed the way

399
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,120
and made it clear.

400
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:41,800
Made it clear.

401
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,640
Made it clear.

402
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,240
President.

403
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,400
They're doing this

404
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,760
to get Xu Qian's corpse.

405
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,320
Who did this?

406
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,920
My student.

407
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,800
That hand was also made by

408
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,400
the Qing Zhou of the Yangtong Palace.

409
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,360
He did it.

410
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,520
It's Chang Le's hands.

411
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,040
Yes.

412
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,160
His name is Xu Qian.

413
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,560
He's also my student.

414
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,040
Even if he only knows how to make poems,

415
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,840
he's enough for me to be in the manor

416
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,240
and to be a tombstone.

417
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,520
For a great time,

418
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,520
he's not like an old man.

419
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,960
He's been trained

420
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:26,200
to be a man.

421
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,400
Even the simplest

422
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,160
and most powerful man

423
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,280
can't be afraid of him.

424
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,360
He can teach people.

425
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,280
All right.

426
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,160
You can go back.

427
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,160
Remember.

428
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,960
Don't lose the identity

429
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,400
of the head of the Yunlu Academy.

430
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,240
Well.

431
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,280
Goodbye.

432
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,200
Goodbye.

433
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,320
Goodbye.

434
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,160
OK, good-bye.

435
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:15,840
warriors.

436
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,320
Whatver 그냥

437
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:17,880
dry.

438
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,840
You've tried several times before.

439
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:20,760
bitterness.

440
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:21,960
Just the top.

441
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,000
And you.

442
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:24,640
Emperor Chenred.

443
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,120
I heard he went to this tomb.

444
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,120
I'm sure it's more than I thought.

445
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,120
You mean

446
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,120
you didn't mean to keep it?

447
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,120
I'm telling you the truth.

448
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,120
Actually, I didn't do it.

449
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,120
I saw it in the ancient book.

450
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,120
The reason I kept it

451
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,120
is because I only remember it.

452
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,120
I regret it now.

453
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,120
If I knew it,

454
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,120
I should have

455
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,120
kept it in my heart.

456
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,120
Ancient book?

457
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,120
Brother,

458
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,120
did you do it on purpose?

459
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,120
Don't worry.

460
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,120
I don't like you.

461
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,120
I've decided a new thing.

462
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,120
Tomorrow, when the girls come here,

463
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,120
we can focus on dealing with the divorce.

464
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,120
Brother, I have something to remind you.

465
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,120
The divorce can't be let by the girls.

466
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,120
Don't let them

467
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,120
be alone with you.

468
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,120
I have my own opinion.

469
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,120
I'll use your suggestion.

470
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,120
Okay.

471
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,120
By the way,

472
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:27,120
you've been working hard these days.

473
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:32,120
I thought a lot yesterday.

474
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,120
If it wasn't for you,

475
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,120
maybe my father would have been killed.

476
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,120
The girls were called Fang Si.

477
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,120
If it wasn't for you,

478
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,120
Ling Yue would be in danger.

479
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,120
She might have been killed by that guy.

480
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,120
If it wasn't for you,

481
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,600
Xu Jia Yu might have been

482
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,120
killed by the girls.

483
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,120
She might have been killed by the girls.

484
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,120
Thank you.

485
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,120
Sit down.

486
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,120
Sit down.

487
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,120
Hold my hand.

488
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,120
Hold my hand.

489
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,120
Hold my hand.

490
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,120
You're wrong.

491
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,120
Brother, did you hear me?

492
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,120
Brother, did you hear me?

493
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,120
I didn't hear you.

494
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,120
I'm sorry.

495
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,120
I'm sorry.

496
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,120
You didn't help me.

497
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,120
I'm sorry.

498
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,120
Greetings, Mr. Jian Zheng.

499
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,120
You're here.

500
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,120
You're here, Xiao You.

501
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,120
The Four Heavens

502
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,120
has been closed for 500 years.

503
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,120
Do you feel boring?

504
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,120
Boring?

505
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,120
Yes, I do.

506
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,120
Since you're boring,

507
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,120
why don't you consider

508
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,120
my suggestion?

509
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,120
25 years ago,

510
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,120
I asked you to consider my suggestion.

511
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,120
I was wrong.

512
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,120
I'm heartless.

513
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,120
I'm not as good as you.

514
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,120
You're like a student

515
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,120
who's been with Yunlu Academy

516
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,120
for five years.

517
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,120
Isn't that boring?

518
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,120
You were a five-stress,

519
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,120
I was a second-ranked martial artist

520
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,120
in Yu Yan Da Fengjiang.

521
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,120
But you ended up

522
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,120
being a cultivation master.

523
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,120
Actually, I was not

524
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,120
able to get out of the mountain

525
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:38,120
or restore my cultivation.

526
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,120
As long as you want to.

527
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,120
I know what I want.

528
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,120
It's better if you..

529
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,120
In the first visit

530
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,120
to Your Majesty 25 years ago,

531
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:57,620
I thought you

532
00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:07,540
were a

533
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,120
senior saber-fingering sect.

534
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,120
You should have stayed

535
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,120
there more.

536
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,440
Y cent Crane Desk

537
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,440
I shall do the same

538
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,560
if I can come back.

539
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:35,240
However,

540
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,120
I've achieved what I shouldn't have done.

541
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,720
You...

542
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,760
Are expecting someone else?

543
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,240
So far,

544
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,840
Great Wind Disciple only needs Feng Bujiang.

545
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,200
And, another man

546
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,260
who can act Pandian

547
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:57,940
and turn money into a dependencies.

548
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,160
Sadly,

549
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:07,400
he is not chosen.

550
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,920
It must be right.

551
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,600
Mom.

552
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:23,960
What do you think?

553
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:26,800
Come on.

554
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,920
It should be ok.

555
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,080
We are close now.

556
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,560
Someone came toор far away.

557
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:40,360
Hello?

558
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:41,920
He wants to ask you what to serve.

559
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:42,500
Who didn't ask?

560
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:43,620
What's the point of that?

561
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:44,820
Someone is following me.

562
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:46,180
Zhou Li?

563
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,060
You dare to block my way?

564
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,220
Break him down!

565
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:52,020
Yes!

566
00:24:58,340 --> 00:24:59,540
What's going on, Brother?

567
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:00,820
We've been followed.

568
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:02,580
The person who was taken?

569
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:06,580
It seems that the plan to visit the Yunluo Academy is right.

570
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:08,180
Although we can protect ourselves,

571
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:10,500
I'm worried that Jia Zhong will be in danger.

572
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:13,660
I'll go.

573
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:15,740
Open the door.

574
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:16,420
It's me.

575
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:17,820
Hurry up.

576
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:24,060
Why are you locking the door?

577
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:25,620
We've been followed by the people in the Zhou family.

578
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:26,380
So fast!

579
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:27,100
Little boy.

580
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:29,900
The Yunluo Academy has called.

581
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:30,860
Tomorrow,

582
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:32,380
we can send my sister and mother to the academy.

583
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:32,900
It's over.

584
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:34,460
Thanks to the help of my brother,

585
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:35,540
I know that

586
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:38,060
the most correct thing in my life

587
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:39,460
is to send you to the academy.

588
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:41,980
It's all Brother's credit.

589
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:43,420
It has nothing to do with me.

590
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:44,740
You're a good boy.

591
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:48,460
You're a good boy.

592
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:51,020
The most wrong thing in your life

593
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:52,700
is to send you to the academy.

594
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:53,660
Stop talking nonsense, Uncle.

595
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:55,420
You should know the way to talk to the doctor.

596
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:56,940
Let them strengthen the father's patrol.

597
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:57,460
By the way,

598
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:59,180
there's a thief coming out.

599
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:00,300
Don't mention Zhou Li's matter.

600
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:01,860
Okay. I'll go now.

601
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:03,700
Go behind.

602
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:05,700
Yes. Go behind.

603
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:06,580
Go behind.

604
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:07,500
Be careful.

605
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:11,260
Let's eat.

606
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:13,620
Okay.

607
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:16,900
Go.

608
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:33,780
Sister.

609
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:34,860
Here's your gift.

610
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,700
Thank you, Brother.

611
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:42,220
Eatte gameplay.

612
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:46,500
Big Brother, I think it's better that you ultra- downloaded the price materials

613
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:46,940
and bought some cheap stuff for yourself

614
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,580
I wonder why you should be so course of playing here

615
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:53,340
Don't be shy

616
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:55,540
Leng Chen

617
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:57,780
You will grow better

618
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:00,300
Look at that

619
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:06,980
Eat it by yourself

620
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:11,780
Really

621
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:15,380
So many silver.

622
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:20,700
Though they're東 and jun invited,

623
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,140
That little punk.

624
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,700
You're quite killing it.

625
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:28,080
Ms. Teng,

626
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,520
Listen to me.

627
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:33,240
It's extremely expensive.

628
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:38,200
So I sent 2 rest- makes and一些 tuning in.

629
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,300
Nice.

630
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,560
Shansheng,

631
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,520
in my opinion,

632
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,400
this is totally a great thing.

633
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,280
As you see,

634
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:50,280
the sisters are going out to see the visually impaired and eating.

635
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:53,080
Maybe upload one more student count for our Xu family.

636
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,680
Then, we will take over our Xu family.

637
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,560
Someone will be kommerated.

638
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,640
You got something on your face.

639
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,600
Brother's right.

640
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,160
But,

641
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:03,400
if our parents upload your sisterðr online through it,

642
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,740
I have some kind of worries.

643
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,340
Why don't you

644
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:07,800
meet with the lady

645
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:08,900
and join her in the future?

646
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,480
I do.

647
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,500
Mom, I don't want to go.

648
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,500
I want to go.

649
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:20,500
Lin Yue, take sister back to her room.

650
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:21,500
Let's go.

651
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,500
I'll disturb mother and brother.

652
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:28,500
Why are you standing here?

653
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,500
I'll wipe it for you.

654
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,500
Is it porridge?

655
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,500
Eat.

656
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,500
Is it serious?

657
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,500
No, it's a small matter.

658
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,500
You'll stay in the room for a few days.

659
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:01,500
You'll be better off in the forest.

660
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:04,500
I'll be better off in the forest.

661
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:09,500
I left some food for you in the basement.

662
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,500
Remember to eat.

663
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,500
I also left some money.

664
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:17,500
If it's not enough, I'll take it and take it.

665
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,500
Don't worry.

666
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:25,500
I'll take good care of Lin Yue.

667
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,500
They're cold.

668
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,500
I'll rely on you.

669
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:38,500
Don't worry, Aunt.

670
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:51,500
I've sent someone to strengthen the patrol of the four states.

671
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,500
I didn't find anything.

672
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:57,500
Are we too noisy to take soldiers?

673
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:59,500
If we were just following us,

674
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,500
they're really from the Zhou family.

675
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:04,500
They've missed the best time to take action.

676
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:08,500
But it's possible that in the eyes of Zhou Shi Lang,

677
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,500
we can just stick to the plan at any time.

678
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,500
We can't be anxious to deal with it.

679
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,500
There's something we can confirm.

680
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,500
Zhou Shi Lang is not out.

681
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,500
We'll die.

682
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:24,500
Uncle, what did you find today?

683
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:29,500
I followed Zhou Li all day.

684
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:32,500
He was in a safe place all day.

685
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,500
I think Zhou Shi Lang warned him.

686
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:37,500
But during the following process,

687
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:40,500
I found that he was always in a house.

688
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:43,500
This house hasn't been changed.

689
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,500
I think he bought a private house.

690
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:48,500
There's a girl, a wife,

691
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:51,500
an old man and a woman.

692
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,500
Who's the woman?

693
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,500
She's the one who raised him.

694
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,500
After that, he went to the mansion

695
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,500
to greet Zhou Shi Lang.

696
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:03,500
Then he went to the teaching office.

697
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:06,500
I heard that Zhou Li was very interested in

698
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:10,500
the flower-patterned lady of the teaching office.

699
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:13,500
She was always in a hurry to make people laugh.

700
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:17,500
But that lady didn't know this.

701
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:20,500
Who's the lady?

702
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:22,500
You don't even know the lady.

703
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:25,500
The lady is the master of the teaching office.

704
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:28,500
Her name is Shi Qin Shuang Jue.

705
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,500
She's famous for her broad-spirited voice.

706
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,500
And the lady likes

707
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,500
the talented scholar.

708
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:35,500
Wait a minute.

709
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,500
Why do you know so well?

710
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:42,500
I heard from others.

711
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:46,500
But I think this is a breakthrough.

712
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,500
Do you think that

713
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,500
Zhou Li might have a good luck?

714
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:52,500
Yes.

715
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,500
It's the easiest to find a breakthrough

716
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,500
in front of a wine-coloured lady.

717
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:58,500
I suggest that you go to the teaching office

718
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:01,500
and find this woman to inquire about the news.

719
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:07,500
Don't look at me.

720
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,500
I'm a scholar.

721
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,500
I've been to that flower-patterned place.

722
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:15,500
Why are you looking at me?

723
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,500
Do I know a person like that?

724
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:20,500
The lady likes the talented scholar.

725
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:22,500
I can't even read the words.

726
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:23,500
I went there and I didn't go.

727
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:24,500
And

728
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:26,500
you know what I've been like to your mother

729
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:27,500
these years.

730
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:30,500
Can I go to that place?

731
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,500
Don't look at me.

732
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,500
I'm a popular person.

733
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:45,500
I've been to many places.

734
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,500
Besides, I'm a true teacher.

735
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,500
I'm a good student in Yaman City.

736
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:50,500
I'm going to let Tong Liao know.

737
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:51,500
How can I be a person?

738
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,500
Do I have to be a scholar?

739
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:56,500
Okay.

740
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,500
This plan is temporary.

741
00:32:58,500 --> 00:32:59,500
Okay.

742
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:10,500
Okay.

743
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:13,500
What's this?

744
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,500
Tong Zhe, the first floor is the second floor.

745
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,500
You're so generous.

746
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,500
Welcome to the 32nd floor of the 2nd floor of the palace.

747
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,500
Please come in.

748
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,500
Mr. Liu.

749
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:38,500
I'm Yang Lin, a talent from Chang Le County.

750
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:40,500
I'm here to greet you.

751
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,500
Please look at your face.

752
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:50,500
Sorry.

753
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:51,500
Sorry.

754
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:52,500
Sorry, everyone.

755
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:53,500
Sorry.

756
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,500
The first floor of the 22nd floor is the second floor.

757
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,500
Go.

758
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,500
Mr. Zhang, you've been missing for a long time.

759
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:01,500
What do you want to do today?

760
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:03,500
I want to do a big show.

761
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,500
The first floor of the 32nd floor of the palace is the second floor.

762
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:06,500
The second floor of the palace is the second floor.

763
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:08,500
Mr. Zhang, you've been missing for a long time.

764
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:09,500
Mr. Li.

765
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,500
The first floor of the 22nd floor is the first floor.

766
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:13,500
The second floor of the palace is the second floor.

767
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,500
The first floor of the palace is the third floor.

768
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:17,500
Mr. Huang.

769
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,500
The first floor of the palace is the third floor.

770
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,500
The first floor of the palace is the third floor.

771
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:23,500
Please come in.

772
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,500
I haven't brought many things in the first floor.

773
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,500
Brother, give me a small horse tent.

774
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,500
I'll sit next to it and make a ride.

775
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:39,500
Next.

776
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:40,500
No.

777
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:42,500
Next.

778
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:45,500
And the first floor of the 12th floor is the third floor.

779
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,500
Go.

780
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:50,500
The first floor of the 12th floor is the third floor.

781
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:52,500
What is this called?

782
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,500
It's called Xiao Jingku.

783
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,500
The first floor is the first floor.

784
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,500
I pay a lot of money every day.

785
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:00,500
I pay for a few months.

786
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,500
Two thousand silver dollars.

787
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:08,500
How come the money has changed a lot?

788
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:09,500
Go.

789
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,500
I don't care.

790
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:19,500
Go.

791
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:23,500
Go.

792
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:26,500
The last one.

793
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:27,500
Go.

794
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,500
Old man.

795
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:31,500
My master said that the profit is 600 taels.

796
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,500
I'll give you all the things in the position.

797
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,500
Rules are rules.

798
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:37,500
You...

799
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:39,500
Go.

800
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:41,500
Old man.

801
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:43,500
How much money do you want?

802
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:45,500
Two thousand silver dollars.

803
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:52,500
The eyes are turning.

804
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:03,500
Go.

805
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:04,500
Go.

806
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:05,500
Go.

807
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:08,500
Go.

808
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,500
Go.

809
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,500
Go.

810
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:13,500
Go.

811
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:14,500
Go.

812
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:15,500
Go.

813
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,500
The eyes are turning.

814
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:18,500
The luck is good.

815
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:21,500
Is this the revenge I had in this world?

816
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:22,500
Old man.

817
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,500
It's all gone.

818
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:24,500
Congratulations.

819
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:25,500
Wait a minute.

820
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:33,500
Young master.

821
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,500
It's yours.

822
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:35,500
No. Wait a minute.

823
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:37,500
I want the gold and silver.

824
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:38,500
What is this?

825
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:42,500
One silver is enough for two gold coins.

826
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:45,500
Only three of them can get this.

827
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:47,500
I don't need this.

828
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:48,500
I only need gold and silver.

829
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:49,500
How about this?

830
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:50,500
The last one is for me.

831
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:51,500
How about this?

832
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,500
Rules are rules.

833
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:56,500
This house is called the little house of the royal family.

834
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:58,500
It's a treasure of the Han family.

835
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,500
Actually, the royal family can be criticized.

836
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:02,500
Young master.

837
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:06,500
The gold and silver are all gone.

838
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,500
The royal family is called the little house of the royal family.

839
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,500
How does it look like a phone?

840
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,500
What's the use?

841
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:15,500
I don't know.

842
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:19,500
I only know that he is waiting for his real cause.

843
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,500
Take it back.

844
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,500
First of all, I'm not a cause.

845
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,500
I just want gold and silver.

846
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,500
You'd better not give me the bet.

847
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,500
Are you scolding people?

848
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,500
Don't you recognize me?

849
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:32,500
I don't recognize you.

850
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,500
What are you doing?

851
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:34,500
Rules are rules.

852
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:35,500
What rules?

853
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:36,500
What's the difference?

854
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:37,500
Rules are rules.

855
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,500
What's the problem?

856
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:40,500
This is the problem.

857
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,500
My master wants to ask you a favor.

858
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:45,500
If you help my master to get the treasure,

859
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:46,500
my master will say that

860
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,500
he wants to get 600 silver coins.

861
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:52,500
How much?

862
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,500
600 silver coins.

863
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:57,500
Master.

864
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:58,500
Master.

865
00:37:58,500 --> 00:37:59,500
My master also said

866
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:01,500
you can get the gold and silver more often.

867
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:02,500
We'll get the gold and silver.

868
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:04,500
If you fail, you can't get the gold.

869
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:07,500
Which treasure do you want?

870
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,500
The one with the theme.

871
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:12,500
The one with the most swordsmanship

872
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:15,500
can get the gold and silver.

873
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:20,500
This is the gold.

874
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:27,500
Good.

875
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:31,500
Good.

876
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:41,500
Good.

877
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:47,500
Congratulations, master.

878
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:51,500
You're lucky.

879
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:53,500
By the way, brother,

880
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,500
you gave me the gold and silver.

881
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,500
It's not convenient for me to get the gold and silver.

882
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:59,500
Master, 600 silver coins.

883
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:03,500
Thank you.

884
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:05,500
If you need anything, you can ask me.

885
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:25,500
Where are they?

886
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:39,500
Sorry.

887
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:41,500
I told you.

888
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:43,500
You didn't bring so much gold

889
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:44,500
when you left.

890
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:45,500
You're smiling.

891
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:47,500
The highest standard is...

892
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:48,500
The highest standard is...

893
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:56,500
Next.

894
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:57,500
No, wait.

895
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:58,500
I was still in the table just now.

896
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,500
Really.

897
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:00,500
Next.

898
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:02,500
Come on.

899
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:03,500
One-on-one.

900
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:05,500
I'm with Li Sheng.

901
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:06,500
You're one-on-one.

902
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:07,500
One-on-one.

903
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:08,500
One-on-one.

904
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:10,500
You gave me the gold and silver.

905
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:11,500
No.

906
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:12,500
You throw it out.

907
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:14,500
Open the door.

908
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:16,500
The glass.

909
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:19,500
You throw it out.

910
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:21,500
Open the door.

911
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:22,500
Open the door.

912
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:34,500
The master is still opening the window.

913
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:38,500
Congratulations, master.

914
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:39,500
You're lucky.

915
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:40,500
You're lucky.

916
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:41,500
You're lucky.

917
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:42,500
You're lucky.

918
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:43,500
You're lucky.

919
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:44,500
You're lucky.

920
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:45,500
Ladies and gentlemen.

921
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:47,500
I'm Yang Ling,

922
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:49,500
the master of Chang Le County.

923
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:50,500
Yang Ling.

924
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:01,500
0.9.

925
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:03,500
1.

926
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:05,500
2.

927
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:07,500
3.

928
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:13,500
4.

929
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:14,500
5.

930
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:15,500
6.

931
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:16,500
7.

932
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:17,500
8.

933
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:18,500
9.

934
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:19,500
10.

935
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:20,500
11.

936
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:21,500
11.

937
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:22,500
12.

938
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:23,500
13.

939
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:24,500
14.

940
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:25,500
14.

941
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:26,500
15.

942
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:27,500
16.

943
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:28,500
17.

944
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:29,500
18.

945
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:30,500
18.

946
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:31,500
19.

947
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:32,500
19.

948
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:33,500
19.

949
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:34,500

950
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:35,500
19.

951
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:36,500
19.

952
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:37,500

Nice to meet you.

999
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:35,860
Is this

1000
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:38,540
the name of my brother-in-law?

1001
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:41,420
This is Brother Xu.

1002
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:42,260
Let's take a look.

1003
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:45,940
Why are you here?

1004
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:48,060
Didn't I ask you to send you a gift?

1005
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:49,900
You're so self-sufficient.

1006
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:51,540
You're not wrong.

1007
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:52,540
I don't want to.

1008
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:53,300
Really?

1009
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:54,900
I'm here to think.

1010
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:56,540
Mr. Li.

1011
00:42:57,140 --> 00:42:57,660
Hello.

Why didn't you come here a few days ago?

1021
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:15,700
When we came back from the faraway gate,

1022
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:18,820
we came here to meet you.

1023
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:21,780
Then we should have a drink today.

1024
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:29,460
