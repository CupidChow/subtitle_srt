- Sir,
- Lingyue.

43
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,720
he insulted me first.

44
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,960
Ningyan stopped that man.

45
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,440
Why are you arresting him?

46
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,520
I'll judge

47
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,470
whether he's guilty or not.

48
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:01,910

resisting arrest

53
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,670
will make things worse.

You're playing right into their hands.

00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:30,830
Are you hurt, Lingyue?

56
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,600
Get up.

57
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:43,550
Mr. Zhu,

58
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:44,870
please take care of my cousins.

59
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,080
I will.

60
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,480
Take him away!

61
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:53,990
Mr. Zhou,

62
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,640
I'll take it from here.

63
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:57,670
No need.

64
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:00,320
I'll question him myself.

65
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:01,550
After you.

66
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,870
Who are you?

67
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:30,960
A constable

68
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:33,200
from the Changle County Government.

69
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,200
So?

70
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:36,590
I'm here to see Caiwei.

71
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:37,990
Senior Caiwei?

72
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,040
A friend asked me to give her

73
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,830
(The Codex of Alchemy)
this book

74
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:44,110
with a message.

75
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,920
"Xu Qi'an is in trouble.

76
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,760
Help him."

77
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,760
What happened?

78
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,200
It's the 48th time.

79
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,390
Senior Song has been faking the tax silver

80
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:53,760
for two days but failed.

81
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:55,520
In the Astronomical Bureau,

82
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,200
he's the most talented alchemist.

83
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,800
I can't believe he failed.

84
00:04:59,030 --> 00:04:59,870
Let's go and check.

85
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:01,590
Excuse me. Coming through.

86
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,110
It's working!

87
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:18,060
(Song Qing, Astronomical Bureau,
6th Rank Alchemist)

88
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,680

89
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:22,230
Senior Song!

90
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,480
Senior Song!

91
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,360
Senior Song!

92
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:25,390
Are you alright?

93
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,780
Did you get hurt?

94
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,030
It's not the salt

95
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:42,560
or the temperature

96
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:47,710
and definitely not my alchemy skills.

97
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:49,560
You're right.

98
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,030
Why couldn't I make it?

99
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,520
Senior Song!

100
00:05:57,910 --> 00:05:58,790
Senior Song!

101
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:00,120
Senior Song!

102
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:01,960
A constable came to see Senior Caiwei

103
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:03,230
with a message.

104
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:04,350
"Xu Qi'an's in trouble.

105
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:05,230
Help him."

106
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:08,710
Xu Qi'an?

107
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:11,320
That name sounds familiar.

108
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,000
What else did he say?

109
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,470
He left this book, too.

110
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,910
"Equivalent exchange

111
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:23,030
is the unchanging principle of alchemy."

112
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:26,350
"Equivalent exchange"!

113
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:31,960
Yes! That's right!

114
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,520
When teaching me alchemy, Master said

115
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:37,830
the essence of it isn't change

116
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:41,030
but transformation.

117
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,790
(The Codex of Alchemy)
Who gave you this book?

118
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,300
(The Codex of Alchemy)

119
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,470
What's "chemistry"?

120
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,000
What does "atom" mean?

121
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:59,200
I know every character in the book,

122
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:00,680
but together,

123
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:02,560
I'm completely clueless.

124
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,640
What about you, Senior Song?

125
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,040
Be quiet.

126
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:06,990
Read it carefully.

127
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:10,320
"To fake silver,

128
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,030
step one,

129
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,640
filter the salt water."

130
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:14,630
Yes.

131
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:15,880
I did so, too.

132
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,520
"Step two,

133
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:18,790
evaporate it

134
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,960
for crystallization

135
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,590
and melt the crystals."

136
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:22,830
"Step three,

137
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:23,990
be careful.

138
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:26,560
It's the key to making the tax silver.

139
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,560
Your success

140
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:28,910
depends on it."

141
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:33,710
Step three!

142
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:43,710
- That's it?
- It...

143
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:44,910
Where's the rest?

144
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:46,910
He only gave you this?

145
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,120
Yes, just this one.

146
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:50,150
So what's

147
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,640
step three?

148
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:54,030
He meant to leave us hanging.

149
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,830
I'll ask you again.

150
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:58,320
Who gave you this book?

151
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,120
Uncle Pingzhi?

152
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,150
He scared me.

153
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:43,910
I am

154
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:47,080
Xu Pingzhi, Baihu of the Imperial Guards.

155
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,710
I'm sorry that my nephew

156
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:51,200
offended you.

157
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,470
My apologies.

158
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,910
Xu... Pingzhi?

159
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,680
Yes, that's me.

160
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,440
Mr. Zhou,

161
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,710
can we end things

162
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:09,560
here and now?

163
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,520
Yes. Sure.

164
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:17,710
The Baihu of the Imperial Guards said so.

165
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:19,960
Sure, let's end it.

166
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:22,120
Hey,

167
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,160
how about this?

168
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:27,230
You can

169
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,230
stab and kill him

170
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,630
and then kill yourself.

171
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:32,710
That way, we're even.

172
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:33,670
What do you say?

173
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:41,510
A lowly Imperial Guard is

174
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:45,680
nothing more than a man of straw.

175
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,080
How dare you get in my way!

176
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:49,590
Finish him!

177
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:50,430
Yes!

178
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,160
Ningyan,

179
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:16,870
I'm here for you.

180
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,590
No one can take you away.

181
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:44,350
Bring it on!

182
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,280
I was reckless.

183
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:54,160
I thought they'd fight fair and square,

184
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,080
doing one-on-ones,

185
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:58,630
but they beat me together.

186
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:00,630
So shameless!

187
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,280
But don't worry.

188
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:10,350
I always have a backup plan.

189
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:11,920
Before I came,

190
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:14,560
I had asked your aunt to see Cijiu

191
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,960
to get help from the Yunlu Academy.

192
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,320
Also,

193
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:23,710
I had sent a message to the Imperial Guards.

194
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,350
Once my men come,

195
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,320
they'll get us out

196
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,560
in no time.

197
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,040
Imperial Guards?

198
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:33,800
Given their speed,

199
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,320
they'll arrive in a few minutes.

200
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:36,710
Just wait.

201
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:44,050
Uncle,

202
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:46,160
are the Imperial Guards

203
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,560
- really good?
- Yes.

204
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,590
Can they handle Zhou Li?

205
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,160
They'll die for me!

206
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,160
Fine.

207
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,830
Master, Mr. Mubai,

208
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,110
please do me a favor.

209
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,120
What is it?

210
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:00,400
Brother offended
Vice Minister of Revenue's son

211
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:02,160
to protect my sister.

212
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,560
Please

213
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:04,800
help him.

214
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:06,990
Your brother,

215
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,630
the one who wrote,

216
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,470
"Fear not you've no admirers.

217
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:12,040
There's someone
who loves your song"?

218
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:12,920
That talent?

219
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,550
- Yes.
- Cijiu,

220
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:16,280
I'll help him out. Don't worry.

221
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,510
Go back with your master

222
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:18,350
to study.

223
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:19,960
This is none of your business.

224
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,960
I'll deal with my student's trouble.

225
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:22,950
Come on!

226
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:24,990
Where's your brother now?

227
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,080
In the Changle County.

228
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:28,400
(Heart Spell)
I go miles away with one step.

229
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,160
That old geezer is such a busybody.

230
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,590
(Dustless Spell)
I should leave.

231
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:34,160
I'm going to Changle.

232
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:45,830
I'm still learning it.

233
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,830
You're...

234
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:51,350
good enough.

235
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,990
I thought those two masters

236
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:54,440
wouldn't help out.

237
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:58,680
How should we...?

238
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:00,920
We'll ride!

239
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:01,760
Let's go!

240
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:05,490
Where's Ningyan?

241
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:07,350
The Ministry of Justice took him away.

242
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:12,920
Don't worry, Miss Xu.

243
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:14,830
We've done what Ningyan

244
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,110
told us to do.

245
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,710
If the Astronomical Bureau steps in,

246
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,400
I'm sure

247
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,320
he'll be fine.

248
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,960
He has connections there?

249
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,680
He's something else.

250
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:26,870
Ningyan is wonderful.

251
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:28,040
If they hurt him,

252
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,510
I'll fight them with my life!

253
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:30,400
Yes, me too!

254
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:33,990
Are he

255
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,680
and his colleagues close?

256
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:37,880
Ningyan

257
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,870
is

258
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:41,280
quite special.

259
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,200
Special?

260
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,350
Mr. Wang,

261
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,920
can you tell me more about him?

262
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,560
It's kind of embarrassing,

263
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:57,590
but officers like us

264
00:13:58,350 --> 00:13:59,440
are hardly

265
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:01,110
clean and honest.

266
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,080
The best we can do is

267
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,080
not exploit the civilians.

268
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:07,400
As for

269
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,440
the loaded ones,

270
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,510
getting money from them

271
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:12,350
isn't

272
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:13,870
wrong, is it?

273
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,400
But Ningyan never does that.

274
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:22,870
Civilians

275
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:24,870
or rich people,

276
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,440
he never extorts money from them.

277
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,510
When your family was in trouble,

278
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:35,990
I meant to

279
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,230
help him

280
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:40,320
get some money.

281
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,280
He smiled

282
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,590
and agreed.

283
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:50,400
But when I gave him his share,

284
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,710
he had it

285
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:54,750
returned quietly.

286
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:58,350
He's smart.

287
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:01,040
No fish survive if water is too clear.

288
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,750
It's simple as that.

289
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:04,350
But he doesn't know.

290
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,440
When you think he's dumb,

291
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,080
he's sophisticated

292
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,200
and tactful.

293
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,800
He knows the ways of the world

294
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,870
and gets along well with us.

295
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,080
Now that he's in trouble,

296
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,110
all of us are worried.

297
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:41,760
Uncle.

298
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:44,640
Uncle?

299
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:52,950
Uncle.

300
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,280
It's been two hours.

301
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:56,920
Where are the Imperial Guards?

302
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,320
They must've caught up with something.

303
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:02,870
Be patient.

304
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:08,350
There they are!

305
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:18,950
Xu Qi'an,

306
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:20,750
it's time to take your last meal.

307
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:26,670
Get out.

308
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:30,230
Listen,

309
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,160
don't play tricks with me.

310
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,870
I don't want to break your limbs

311
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:36,040
and drag you out.

312
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:38,830
Move it!

313
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:43,520
Come on!

314
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,000
Let's go!

315
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,400
Ningyan!

316
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:56,510
Where are you taking him?

317
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,520
Ningyan!

318
00:16:58,830 --> 00:16:59,670
Come back!

319
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,040
Zhou Li,

320
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:04,080
my men will come anytime.

321
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:06,560
If you lay a finger on Ningyan,

322
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,630
I'll kill you!

323
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,590
Just now, you said,

324
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,080
"A mad ordinary man..."

325
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,350
What's the rest again?

326
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:28,950
Are you mute?

327
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,000
Alright.

328
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,280
Give him that.

329
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:49,780
(Confession)

330
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,830
Sign it.

331
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,510
To spare myself torture?

332
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,800
So you aren't mute.

333
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,990
But you got it wrong.

334
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:01,990
What I'm saying is

335
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,840
torture before signature

336
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:07,550
or the other way around.

337
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:11,100
(Xu Qi'an will be exiled to Yunzhou.)

338
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:35,590
Are you mad?

339
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,640
You're so short-fused.

340
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,920
If you're mad now,

341
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,960
how will you react later?

342
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:46,200
Each and every tool here

343
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:50,030
can cause you excruciating pain,

344
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:53,470
but it won't kill you.

345
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,270
I'll show you

346
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,070
that you're

347
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,030
a man of straw after all.

348
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,160
It only takes

349
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,070
a pinch

350
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,270
to finish you for good.

351
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,640
Report, Minister!

352
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,030
Two masters of the Yunlu Academy

353
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:21,440
demand to see you.

354
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,750
(Sun Jingzong, Minister of Justice)

355
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:25,270
Yunlu Academy?

356
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,680
Stop following me!

357
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,710
This isn't your business, you know.

358
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:29,840
It's mine.

359
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:30,750
It's not your concern.

360
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,480
Chunjing.

361
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:35,150
Jinyan.

362
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,280
What

363
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,400
brings you to

364
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,240
my office?

365
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:42,230
Your men arrested my student, Xu Qi'an.

366
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:44,510
Please release him,

367
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,120
Minister Sun.

368
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,680
The Ministry of Justice

369
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,840
never arrests people easily.

370
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:53,310
Tell me what happened.

371
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,470
- He...
- Report!

372
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:58,360
Minister Sun,

373
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,960
alchemists of the Astronomical Bureau

374
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:00,800
are breaking in.

375
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:01,760
We can't stop them.

376
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:03,120
Supervisor

377
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:04,710
of the Astronomical Bureau's disciple,

378
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:05,550
Song Qing

379
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,200
greets you, Minister.

380
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:11,270
Breaking into the Ministry of Justice

381
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,070
is against the law.

382
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,120
Leave now!

383
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:16,200
Minister Sun,

384
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,400
I'm here to ask you

385
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,600
to release a man.

386
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:21,910
Who is it?

387
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,440
Xu Qi'an.

388
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:29,200
He was falsely arrested earlier today.

389
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:34,350
Minister.

390
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,440
Did our officers

391
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,880
arrest Xu Qi'an earlier?

392
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:39,070
As far as I know,

393
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:40,470
we made

394
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:41,470
no arrests today.

395
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,520
No?

396
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:45,230
But he is...

397
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,640
in our prison.

398
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:51,920
Who brought him back?

399
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:52,830
Well...

400
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,000
Director Huang!

401
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:56,800
Come here.

402
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,550
- Minister.
- Did you

403
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:03,880
have him arrested?

404
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:06,360
Yes, Minister.

405
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,120
Explain the whole thing

406
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,200
in front of everyone!

407
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,510
Here's the thing.

408
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:17,790
Mr. Zhou filed a suit

409
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:20,200
that someone beat him in the street.

410
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,640
It was too sudden,

411
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,160
so I didn't have time

412
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,160
to get an arrest warrant.

413
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,600
I thought we should arrest him first

414
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:28,400
before he ran away.

415
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:33,470
Gents should be honest.

416
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:35,620
(Heart Spell)
So should ordinary men.

417
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:37,470
Heart Spell!

418
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:39,840
Mr. Zhou wanted Xu Qi'an

419
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:41,200
to die in our prison.

420
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,640
It was easy, so I did him a favor.

421
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,160
4th Rank.

422
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:49,550
Heart Spell.

423
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:56,760
Minister!

424
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:15,920
I heard

425
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,030
your uncle brought you up.

426
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,360
So I have reason to believe

427
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:25,790
you two planned this together.

428
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,040
Zhou Li,

429
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:31,880
leave my family alone!

430
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:34,550
You also have a cousin

431
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,070
who's pretty.

432
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:40,790
She can go to the Imperial Office of Music!

433
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:42,790
That's not included in the confession.

434
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:44,030
Add it now!

435
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,400
Do it right here

436
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:51,270
in front of him.

437
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,520
Yes.

438
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:00,790
Take him away.

439
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:02,070
(There they are.)

440
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:03,960
(Finally!)

441
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,520
Sir,

442
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,360
I haven't done

443
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:11,990
questioning him.

444
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,160
This is our ministry,

445
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,790
not the Ministry of Revenue.

446
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:16,680
If you like questioning others,

447
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,960
go to your father's ministry.

448
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,960
That is if it's a judiciary, too.

449
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,600
Did you not hear my order?

450
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,640
Take him away!

451
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,480
Hold on!

452
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:26,720
Sir,

453
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:30,270
this man meant to kill me in public.

454
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:31,920
I'm the victim.

455
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,440
Sir,

456
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:34,840
you'd better

457
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:37,550
not interfere.

458
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:38,640
Mr. Zhou,

459
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:40,310
say that

460
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,400
to Minister Sun

461
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,030
who's right outside.

462
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:50,350
Director Huang,

463
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,070
you've gone too far!

464
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:53,310
This is huge.

465
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:54,880
How dare you act on your own!

466
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:56,310
You're disgracing

467
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:57,840
our whole ministry!

468
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:17,200
You should be glad I'm not dead.

469
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,680
I'll reintroduce myself.

470
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,880
I'm the new disciple
of the Astronomical Bureau.

471
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:33,600
Xu Qi'an

472
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:35,160
greets you, seniors.

473
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,230
Did you write this book?

474
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:46,590
Senior Song,

475
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,440
this isn't the place to talk.

476
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,840
Once we get out,

477
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:50,990
ask me anything.

478
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:52,750
I'll tell you

479
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:53,920
all I know.

480
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:57,470
Qi'an, I'm here.

481
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:59,510
It's fine. I'll protect you.

482
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:02,680
Minister Sun,

483
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,840
why are those alchemists...?

484
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,230
They're here for that man.

485
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:10,590
And

486
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,550
those two masters of the Academy...

487
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,550
They're also here for him.

488
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,400
Are you Xu Qi'an?

489
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:26,070
Yes.

490
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:27,880
I'm Cijiu's master.

491
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:29,400
Greetings.

492
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:31,680
"Fear not you've no admirers.

493
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,230
There's someone
who loves your song."

494
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,470
Did you write that?

495
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:37,800
No, actually.

496
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,440
I'll explain it to you later.

497
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,230
- You...
- We're done here.

498
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,030
It's time to leave.

499
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:45,390
Fine.

500
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:48,070
Wait.

501
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:52,310
I have something else to do.

502
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,470
Please give me a minute.

503
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,360
Xu Qi'an,

504
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:29,440
what do you want?

505
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,160
You're insane...!

506
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:35,830
Masters...

507
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:39,030
Masters, have you had lunch?

508
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,120
Xu Qi'an,

509
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,750
my father is the Minister of Revenue!

510
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:55,880
Please.

511
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,710
Not here.

512
00:26:58,070 --> 00:26:59,600
Please stop.

513
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,880
- Mr. Zhou!
- Minister!

514
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:04,600
This is your office!

515
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,750
I'm assaulted in broad daylight!

516
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,550
I demand justice!

517
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:09,640
Calm down, Mr. Zhou.

518
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:10,840
I'll tell His Majesty

519
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:12,440
in court tomorrow.

520
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,360
Get up now.

521
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,200
Zhou Li.

522
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:16,910
What now?

523
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:18,960
I'm showing you

524
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:21,070
that ordinary men can get mad.

525
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:24,750
A furious ordinary man...

526
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:51,200
I see.

527
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,360
Luckily, Masters came in time

528
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,920
to help you out.

529
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,680
By the way, Cijiu,

530
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,680
since when do I become so popular

531
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:02,200
that two masters are fighting over me

532
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:04,070
to be their last disciple?

533
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,400
And they invite me

534
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,840
to the Yunlu Academy

535
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,230
to talk about poetry and Taoism.

536
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:09,550
You see,

537
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:11,120
they love your poems,

538
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:12,150
such as

539
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:14,550
Seeing Yang Gong off to Qingzhou
at Mianyang Pavilion.

540
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,710
I thought they valued my character.

541
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:19,270
Turns out, it's my poetry.

542
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:21,680
When did I write that poem?

543
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,400
You don't remember?

544
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,360
Why did those

545
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:27,750
of the Bureau also come?

546
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,550
I had Constable Wang

547
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:31,120
bring a book to them

548
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,600
that would pique their interest.

549
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:36,310
Also, they invited me

550
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:38,880
to give them a lecture tomorrow.

551
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:41,160
I couldn't say no!

552
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:42,230
I'd like one.

553
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:43,750
I'll try it and buy some next time.

554
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:44,590
Be careful.

555
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:46,840
Yogurt! Creamy yogurt!

556
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:47,680
Young lady,

557
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:48,990
would you like one?

558
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:50,440
(Yogurt)

559
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,280
Excuse me.

560
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,680
I'd like some.

561
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:53,920
- Sure.
- I'll take them.

562
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:55,970
Here you go.

563
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:57,200
Thank you.

564
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,040
Take it.

565
00:28:58,880 --> 00:28:59,750
One for you.

566
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:00,590
Thank you.

567
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:01,510
Taste it, Cijiu.

568
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:02,550
Here.

569
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:05,960
This is good.

570
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,640
As for the melon-favored one...

571
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,280
Aunt,

572
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:13,790
thanks for everything.

573
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:14,830
Here.

574
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,790
I didn't do it for you!

575
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,640
Had something happened to you,

576
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,120
everyone in the Xu Clan

577
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,200
would've been affected.

578
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:33,840
Xu Lingyin!

579
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:35,170
Stop!

580
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,570
- You'll fall!
- Be careful.

581
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,470
Come on!

582
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:40,840
Here, Lingyue.

583
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:41,900
(Gu Ruohan, the Swordsman)

584
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,550
You...

585
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:45,790
Take it

586
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:46,920
before your mother sees it.

587
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:47,910
Come on!

588
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:51,830
Ningyan,

589
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,200
how did you know?

590
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:54,750
I knew a long time ago.

591
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,030
He's low-paid.

592
00:29:57,030 --> 00:29:57,960
I'll buy

593
00:29:58,270 --> 00:29:59,230
the books you like.

594
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,710
I'm richer than you.

595
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:05,150
Where's my uncle?

596
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,040
He hasn't come back?

597
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:08,720
Zhou Li,

598
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,550
my men will come anytime.

599
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:15,360
If you lay a finger on Ningyan,

600
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:17,200
I'll kill you.

601
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:19,600
Zhou Li,

602
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,360
my men will come anytime.

603
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,470
If you lay a finger on Ningyan,

604
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,750
I'll kill you!

605
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:28,030
Somebody help!

606
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:30,680
Help...

607
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:39,800
Well,

608
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,310
correct me if I'm wrong.

609
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:48,070
Did you forget about me?

610
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:53,710
Cijiu,

611
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,550
your father is asking you.

612
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:59,030
He... he's talking to you!

613
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:04,680
Father...

614
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:08,790
Eat up.

615
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,230
Sit down.

616
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:12,640
Lingyue, sit.

617
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:18,640
You ingrates!

618
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:20,600
Don't blame us.

619
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,230
What... what did you

620
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,070
promise me

621
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:25,120
back then?

622
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,710
You said you'd get it done.

623
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,680
You were reckless.

624
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:31,070
I was eager to help.

625
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:32,880
Yes! Right!

626
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,120
It was all Zhou Li's fault.

627
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,640
He insulted my cousin.

628
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:40,360
We must make him pay.

629
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:41,640
Right, Cijiu?

630
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,360
I'd do the same as Ningyan!

631
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,600
Good boy!

632
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,470
You boors are alike.

633
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,000
Let's eat.

634
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:49,910
Dig in.

635
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,750
Don't act on impulse ever again.

636
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,960
Don't be like your uncle.

637
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:03,270
Lesson learned, Aunt.

638
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:08,880
It turned out to be a blessing.

639
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:10,360
From now on,

640
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:11,840
our family

641
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:13,920
will be of one heart

642
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,710
and one mind.

643
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:17,440
Let's eat.

644
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,240
Miss,

645
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,240
you're...

646
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:27,310
Is Xu Qi'an in?

647
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:31,640
You weren't in the Astronomical Bureau.

648
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:33,920
No, the Municipal Office.

649
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:36,600
You were so lucky

650
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,200
that you found Senior Song.

651
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,240
Hadn't it been me,

652
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:40,170
that blue book wouldn't

653
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:41,150
have worked.

654
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:44,830
By the way,

655
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,550
why did you and Zhou fight?

656
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,230
When we were shopping,

657
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:50,200
he tried to hit on my cousin.

658
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:52,470
She's indeed a beauty.

659
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:53,400
Yes, she's pretty.

660
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:54,600
As pretty as you.

661
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:56,840
Of course.

662
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,120
We're as fair

663
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,840
as fairies.

664
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,360
I'm here for business, though.

665
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:07,360
It's about the Tax Silver Case.

666
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,440
Do you know

667
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:10,550
who swapped your uncle's tax silver?

668
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,030
I'm a low-ranking constable...

669
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:14,600
They were a Qianhu

670
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:15,710
of the Imperial Guards,

671
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:16,680
Lu Changzhi,

672
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,120
and a clerk of the Revenue,

673
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,030
Zheng Xin.

674
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:21,630
So?

675
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:24,200
Vice Minister Zhou Xianping of Revenue,

676
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,470
who's also Zhou Li's father,

677
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:27,790
is behind them.

678
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,680
It only takes a pinch

679
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,920
to finish you for good.

680
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:39,360
Zhou Xianping is

681
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,360
Zhou Li's old man?

682
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:45,840
Since you solved the Tax Silver Case,

683
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,120
you've made enemies with him

684
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:50,360
and got involved in it.

685
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:53,160
What happened in the street that day

686
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:54,880
was a trap they set.

687
00:33:54,990 --> 00:33:57,120
They wandered around me

688
00:33:57,470 --> 00:33:58,840
and hit on my cousin

689
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,400
to provoke me

690
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,510
so that they could kill me.

691
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:02,800
You're smart.

692
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,240
Hey,

693
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:08,200
is that why you're here?

694
00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:10,310
Thanks.

695
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:14,510
There's something else.

696
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:17,640
Say it.

697
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:22,200
Following the leads,

698
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:24,230
we've found Zhou Xianping,

699
00:34:24,470 --> 00:34:25,680
but he's high-ranking

700
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:26,600
and well-connected.

701
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,470
We don't want to alert him,

702
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:30,880
so now, we're stuck.

703
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,030
But His Majesty said

704
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:34,070
I could only return to

705
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:35,160
the Bureau after this case.

706
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:36,310
So

707
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:37,480
Xu Qi'an,

708
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:39,990
I read the cases you solved in the Office.

709
00:34:39,990 --> 00:34:41,840
You're quite good.

710
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,790
Do you need my help with your case?

711
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:47,550
Fine. Let's hear it.

712
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,000
Father.

713
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,070
What are you looking at?

714
00:34:58,310 --> 00:34:59,470
You freaked me out!

715
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,680
Who's that girl?

716
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:04,270
She came to

717
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:06,150
see Ningyan so late.

718
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,360
Is something going on between them?

719
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,800
She's with the Astronomical Bureau,

720
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,400
Astrologer Chu Caiwei.

721
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:14,840
That bureau?

722
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:16,560
Yes.

723
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:18,590
She also handles the Tax Silver Case.

724
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:20,320
That boy is good!

725
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,470
An astrologer like her is

726
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:24,760
too good to let go.

727
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:27,720
I think it's a bad idea.

728
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,320
We're no match

729
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:31,590
for the Vice Minister of Revenue.

730
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,200
Ningyan,

731
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:35,990
you know those of the Bureau.

732
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:38,990
Cijiu studies at the Yunlu Academy.

733
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:40,470
With your backgrounds,

734
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:42,760
if we behave ourselves,

735
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,920
no one can harm us.

736
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:46,880
We're like the meat

737
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:48,110
on their chopping block.

738
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:50,110
They're in control.

739
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,190
We don't have a say here.

740
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,240
Exactly.

741
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,590
When the case happened,

742
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,670
wasn't I at the Yunlu Academy?

743
00:35:57,990 --> 00:35:59,440
Ningyan returned safe and sound

744
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:01,670
because of Zhou Li's rough handling.

745
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:02,510
He was at fault.

746
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,110
If his father acts

747
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:05,800
and creates another case

748
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:08,360
to kill all of us legally,

749
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:09,990
will the Bureau

750
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:11,670
and the Academy

751
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,470
break into the jail to rescue us?

752
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:16,310
What to do then?

753
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:18,880
Act against Vice Minister Zhou?

754
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:20,110
We're humble,

755
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:22,400
while he's 4th Rank!

756
00:36:22,990 --> 00:36:24,840
Here's what I think.

757
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,280
One,

758
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,720
someone must be behind him.

759
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,080
Two,

760
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:32,320
His Majesty is trying to

761
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:35,400
maintain a delicate balance.

762
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,110
Caiwei once said

763
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,510
when the Secretary of Revenue

764
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:40,800
impeached Zhou,

765
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,630
His Majesty brushed it aside.

766
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,470
Were his rivals trying to bring him down?

767
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:45,720
Throughout history,

768
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,990
all emperors use the art of balance.

769
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,760
His Majesty didn't dismiss Zhou,

770
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,880
meaning it's a matter of power struggle.

771
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,720
Even the Municipal Office can't touch him.

772
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,120
Not exactly.

773
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,080
First off,

774
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:59,280
why did he create the Tax Silver Case?

775
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:00,800
Not for corruption.

776
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,440
He could take bribes anytime.

777
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:04,430
Yes.

778
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:07,670
No need to do it during the inspection.

779
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:13,390
Was he

780
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:16,070
in urgent need of money?

781
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:17,720
He needed it

782
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,070
to fill the hole

783
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,240
that would be discovered

784
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:22,880
during the inspection.

785
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:25,280
I get it.

786
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,920
So we need to uncover their plot

787
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:29,840
so that Zhou can't get away.

788
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:31,920
Battle wolves with tigers.

789
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:34,550
We won't deal with him ourselves.

790
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:35,880
We'll be the spark

791
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,920
to start a fire to kill him.

792
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,510
Do it as soon as possible.

793
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:41,720
Step back further.

794
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,760
We don't need to target him.

795
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:45,760
A high-ranking official like him

796
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,590
is cunning and crafty.

797
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:49,550
So far, we aren't his match.

798
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:51,760
Still,

799
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:53,840
he has a weak spot.

800
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:55,870
Zhou Li.

801
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:56,910
Correct.

802
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:58,070
Compared with his father,

803
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,990
Zhou Li is spoiled and dumb.

804
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,920
If there aren't enough charges,

805
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,670
we'll make some,

806
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:06,590
giving Zhou Xianping's rivals leverage.

807
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:09,110
You can become the Prime Minister.

808
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:11,280
Knock it off, Uncle.

809
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:12,590
Use your connections

810
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:14,720
to check out Zhou Li.

811
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,150
Who does he hang out with?

812
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,590
Does he have any quirks?

813
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:18,760
Where does he usually go?

814
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,320
We need all the information.

815
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:21,550
It's on me.

816
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:23,360
Cijiu, go to the Academy tomorrow.

817
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:25,550
Ask your masters to protect the girls.

818
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:26,640
Sure.

819
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:31,310
What about you?

820
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:32,870
Me?

821
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:36,550
I'll find a way out for the Xu Clan.

822
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,240
(It looks like a modern building.)

823
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,360
Have you been here before?

824
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,160
It's my first time.

825
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,550
You don't look surprised.

826
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,030
I've seen skyscrapers.

827
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:56,110
There are a lot in Shanghai.

828
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:00,070
I...

829
00:39:00,990 --> 00:39:03,280
I've always been calm.

830
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,990
I can keep a straight face

831
00:39:04,990 --> 00:39:06,280
in front of anything.

832
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:07,470
Perhaps

833
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,190
it's a gift.

834
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,280
Very well.

835
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,110
He who has a calm mind

836
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:16,110
can work with me.

837
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:22,670
Please let me know

838
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,440
if there's anything wrong.

839
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,240
Begin.

840
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:39,190
(In my previous life, if I could)

841
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,990
(make a fire with a flick,)

842
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:42,280
(that'd be awesome!)

843
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:50,510
Hold on.

844
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:54,840
Have you failed

845
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,550
at this step repeatedly?

846
00:39:56,550 --> 00:39:57,390
Yes.

847
00:39:57,990 --> 00:39:59,590
Please guide me.

848
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:02,880
Your failures aren't

849
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:04,880
due to the materials,

850
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,280
the temperature,

851
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,990
or your alchemy skills.

852
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:09,880
The problem lies in

853
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,160
two words.

854
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:13,400
(Materials)
Electric voltage,

855
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,630
in layman's terms,

856
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,990
means the strength of a shock.

857
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,760
Both water and voltage

858
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:23,280
flow from high to low.

859
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:29,590
If you spill water

860
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,720
from this cup on a person,

861
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:35,720
it's fine, right?

862
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:36,760
Yes.

863
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:39,110
But what if it's a waterfall?

864
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:40,960
If one gets hit by it,

865
00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:43,280
its impact can break

866
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,670
that person's bones

867
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:46,360
or even kill him or her.

868
00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:49,030
Electricity is the same.

869
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:51,190
I call this phenomenon

870
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,160
voltage.

871
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,240
I know it.

872
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:56,880
You're clever.

873
00:40:57,070 --> 00:40:57,920
Is what you just said

874
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,880
included in that book of alchemy?

875
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:01,190
Of course.

876
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:03,280
Also, only I have

877
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,920
read and studied

878
00:41:04,990 --> 00:41:06,320
that book.

879
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,920
The note sent to you earlier is only

880
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:11,110
a drop in the ocean.

881
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,920
That book introduces

882
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:14,550
all kinds of knowledge

883
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:16,990
and alchemy techniques

884
00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:19,920
that are unheard of.

885
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,200
I've decided

886
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,720
to share this book

887
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:28,440
with the Bureau.

888
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:30,110
Great! Brilliant!

889
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:31,360
Yes!

890
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,510
That blue book was a gift to thank you

891
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:35,400
for helping me.

892
00:41:35,590 --> 00:41:38,880
I've perfected the making of fake tax silver

893
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,550
and told you about voltage.

894
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:42,240
That's not free.

895
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:43,440
Always keep in mind

896
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:45,320
the principle of alchemy is...

897
00:41:50,070 --> 00:41:52,600
"Equivalent

898
00:41:52,990 --> 00:41:55,870
exchange".

899
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,030
Of course.

900
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:00,110
Name your price then.

901
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:02,110
How rude.

902
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:06,030
Alchemy can't be bought with money.

903
00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:09,960
(What's free)

904
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:11,360
(is most expensive.)

905
00:42:17,550 --> 00:42:18,630
All set, huh?

906
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:22,990
"Huan".

907
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:24,600
"Qian".

908
00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:28,910
"Yang".

909
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:31,360
It's Yang Qianhuan,

910
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:32,670
my senior,

911
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:33,990
the sole formationist

912
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:35,440
in the Dafeng.

913
00:42:40,630 --> 00:42:42,590
And those two are...?

914
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:45,360
Supervisor prepared them for you.

915
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:47,800
Do you use sabers or swords?

916
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:48,990
Sabers.

917
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:51,920
A fan of sabers?

918
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:19,760
Calm down.

919
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:21,590
It's a gift from Supervisor.
