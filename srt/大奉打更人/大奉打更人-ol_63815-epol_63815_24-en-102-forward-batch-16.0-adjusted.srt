That little Silver Gong.

He dropped it.

00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:44,860
Let's go.

48
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:53,670

- Ningyan!

Ningyan!

50
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,800

- Ningyan!

00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,200
Xu Qi'an...

52
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,760

- Ningyan!
- Ningyan!

56
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,640
It's confirmed the Commissioner
of Yunzhou, Song Changfu,

57
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,120
colluded with The Witcher's Sect

58
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:38,890
in stealing tax silver to fund rebels.

59
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,760
Silver Gong Xu Qi'an solved this case

60
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:43,240
single-handedly.

61
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,960
He crushed the rebels with his team,

62
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,390
retrieved almost 150,000 liang of tax silver,

63
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,720
and destroyed The Witcher's Sect's scheme.

64
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:53,710
Unfortunately, he was ambushed and killed.

65
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,460
He devoted himself to our state

66
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:57,770
and safeguarded it with his life.

67
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:00,750
Xu Qi'an deserves
a posthumous title of nobility.

68
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:02,590
I, Wei Yuan,

69
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:04,520
beg you, Your Majesty.

70
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:07,360
Xu Qi'an was a rare talent.

71
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,240
What a shame.

72
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:13,920
Mr. Wei's asking for
a posthumous title for him.

73
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:16,670
What do you think?

74
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:17,710
Your Majesty,

75
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:20,520
he made the greatest contribution
to this case.

76
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,760
He should

77
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:23,390
be rewarded.

78
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:24,710
Your Majesty,

79
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:26,110
objection!

80
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,670
Although he solved this case,

81
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:30,110
it doesn't change the fact

82
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:31,920
that he was of humble birth.

83
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,080
Giving his family a higher pension is enough.

84
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,350
A title of nobility is too much.

85
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,560
Please think twice, Your Majesty!

86
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:39,800
Your Majesty,

87
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,880
I agree with Vice Minister Xu.

88
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,560
Xu Qi'an was a mere Silver Gong.

89
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:47,150
Being killed in action was his honor.

90
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:50,960
Were he granted a posthumous title,

91
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:55,440
that'd make a nobody
as great as the nobility.

92
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,470
We cannot

93
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:58,030
set such a precedent!

94
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,560
Don't you agree, gentlemen?

95
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,150
Yes.

96
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:06,230
That's right.

97
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,680
That's ridiculous.

98
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,560
Such a reward is over the top.

99
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:13,790
- Right?
- Of course.

100
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:15,590
We can't allow it.

101
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,040
Lord Wei,

102
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:22,230
Xu Qi'an was a lowly Silver Gong.

103
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:23,830
Just give his family more...

104
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,840
You...!

105
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,840
You...

106
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:30,230
You... You... You...

107
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:42,070
Your Majesty,

108
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,270
Wei Yuan slapped officials in public.

109
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:46,150
He insulted you and the law.

110
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:47,520
He must be executed,

111
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,590
Your Majesty!

112
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:07,200
Why are you laughing?

113
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:11,080
Your Majesty,

114
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,880
I saw you laugh,

115
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,120
so I followed.

116
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,800
Father.

117
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:29,070
Father.

118
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,710
Silver Gong's body had been brought back.

119
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,080
It was escorted

120
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,230
to his home as you asked.

121

00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,750
stop playing dead.

189
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,630
Don't think we'll cry for you again.

190
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,590
Did Ningyan

191
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:40,560
leave any last words?

192
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,040
My condolences.

193
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,520
Ningyan

194
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:03,110
died too young.

195
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:06,880
What a shame.

196
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:08,960
What a pity.

197
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:36,510
His colleagues want you to have this.

198
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,800
Lord Wei said

199
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,320
if your family needs help in the future,

200
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:42,750
go to the Guardian Yamen.

201
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:44,040
No prior notice is needed.

202
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,470
I thank Lord Wei.

203
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,590
I can't believe he died.

204
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,040
Miss, what are you doing?

205
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:03,710
Just to double-check it.

206
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:07,830
He wrote to me from Yunzhou,

207
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:12,320
saying once he retrieved the tax silver,
I could leave the Municipal Office.

208
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,630
However,

209
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:17,510
the tax silver was back intact,

210
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:20,930
but he wasn't.

211
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,040
Everyone,

212
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:49,830
it's time

213
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,830
to let Ningyan

214
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,350
rest in peace.

215
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:56,870
Hang on a minute

216
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:58,640
Cijiu...

217
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:00,920
he hasn't come back.

218
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:02,280
Let's wait for him.

219
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:05,470
No need.

220
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,320
Bury Ningyan now.

221
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:45,350
Stop that cat in case

222
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:46,350
Ningyan becomes a zombie!

223
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:57,830
Xu Qi'an,

224
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,750
wake up.

225
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:02,960
(Where am I?)

226
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:05,680
(What's with the noise outside?)

227
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:08,280
(Who's calling my name?)

228
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:38,080
Lord Wei?

229
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,120
Follow me.

230
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:45,800
Yes.

231
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:00,680
Where exactly am I?

232
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,160
The Battle of Linyuan Pass.

233
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:18,470
Who...

234
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,120
are you?

235
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:23,180
(Shen Shu)

236
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,160
Who am I?

237
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:29,920
Yes, who am I?

238
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,200
Why am I in the Battle of Linyuan Pass?

239
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:42,230
The Battle of Linyuan Pass.

240
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,810
The Battle of Linyuan Pass?

241
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,230
What's that?

242
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,600
Didn't you bring it up?

243
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:56,640
I did?

244
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:01,550
But who am I?

245
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,200
You're one big...

246
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:05,350
fool.

247
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:11,710
I remember now.

248
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:15,880
Uh, sorry.

249
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,440
I was joking with you.

250
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,070
What... what's this?

251
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,600
We're

252
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:48,360
in his memory.

253
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:49,550
He?

254
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:51,440
Who's he?

255
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:55,350
This

256
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:58,030
is him.

257
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,520
Get lost!

258
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,040
Go away!

259
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:24,320
Get out! Out!

260
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,200
Get lost!

261
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,440
Go away!

262
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,000
Get out!

263
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:32,830
Over there...

264
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:35,440
Over here...

265
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:39,350
Get out!

266
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:56,310
He's moving.

267
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:57,750
He's a zombie!

268
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:58,590
A zombie!

269
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:33,700
(Peace and Happiness)

270
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:06,710
Water...

271
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:08,680
I need water.

272
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,160
I'm parched!

273
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,230
Ning... Ningyan,

274
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:15,160
do you have more last words to say,

275
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:17,270
or do you have any regrets?

276
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:19,990
Last words?

277
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:36,910
He's not a zombie.

278
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:37,880
His heart is beating.

279
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,160
The Gazing Spell can see him.

280
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:40,310
He's alive.

281
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,230
But how...?

282
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,960
Xu Qi'an

283
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,310
is back alive!

284
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,880
Ningyan!

285
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,120
Ningyan! Ningyan!

286
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,120
Ningyan!

287
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,990
- Ningyan!
- Uncle!

288
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:03,270
I cried for nothing!

289
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:05,710
There, there. I'm fine.

290
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,200
Ningyan...!

291
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:11,900
(Haoqi Tower)

292
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:17,460
(The Witcher's Sect)

293
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:37,800
Father.

294
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,470
He floated in the canal for over 10 days.

295
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,400
Wait no more.

296
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,790
Have his family

297
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,550
bury him soon.

298
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:54,350
Father,

299
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:55,630
Xu Qi'an

300
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:56,720
is back alive.

301
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:36,160
Was that a dream?

302
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,960
But why did I have such a strange one?

303
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,200
Hello.

304
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,310
Xu Ningyan,

305
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:54,550
have you finished

306
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,120
the rest of the poem?

307
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:58,800
Soon.

308
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,750
Didn't you promise
to work on it after the case?

309
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:03,030
It's been 10 days. Where were you?

310
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:04,300
Why didn't you return my message?

311
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,240
I was dead.

312
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:08,840
Xu Ningyan?

313
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,200
Xu Ningyan?

314
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:40,970
Hey,

315
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:43,230
since when are you addicted to being a cat?

316
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:46,640
Such a trifle doesn't matter.

317
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:48,440
What brings you here?

318
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:52,680
I heard you were
killed in action earlier today.

319
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:53,680
I didn't believe it

320
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,120
and came to see for myself.

321
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,750
I knew it.

322
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:59,510
You were dead physically,

323
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:02,790
but I sensed subtle movements
of your primordial spirit.

324
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,070
Then I gave you a hand

325
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:07,790
to bring it back to your body.

326
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,640
Thankfully, you came in time,

327
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:13,710
or I'd be buried alive.

328
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:14,990
I know, right?

329
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:16,150
Thank you

330
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:19,640
for saving my life.

331
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:23,710
It's an equivalent exchange.

332
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,920
You owe me one.

333
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:32,800
Yes, of course.

334
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:35,630
By the way,

335
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:39,230
did you see No. 2, Li Miaozhen, in Yunzhou?

336
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,750
She wasn't there.

337
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:41,840
When I asked,

338
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,230
she said she was on her way to the capital.

339
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:47,160
I had meant to ask her for help,

340
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,710
using her force to solve the case.

341
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,550
With her assistance,

342
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,920
I wouldn't have suffered so much.

343
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:57,160
Looks like you were doomed

344
00:25:58,070 --> 00:26:00,030
to suffering.

345
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:03,120
I'll show myself out.

346
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:06,350
One more thing.

347
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,440
What is it?

348
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,840
Nice body.

349
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:18,820
(Guardians)

350
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,640
Summon Silver Gong Xu at once.

351
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,510
Lord Wei asks for him.

352
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:23,680
Yes.

353
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:28,990
There you are.

354
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:29,990
Others might think

355
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:32,230
Father has adopted another son.

356
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:33,310
Don't get in my way.

357
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:34,640
You should've died in Yunzhou.

358
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,200
He dodged my punch!

359
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,550
How come?

360
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:51,800
Lord Wei!

361
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:56,270
Greetings, Lord Wei.

362
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:06,630
Come.

363
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,310
I read Song Tingfeng's report,

364
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,070
saying you went missing
after capturing the rebels.

365
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:16,920
You might've been killed.

366
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,310
But I know how skilled you are.

367
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,120
Most people can't kill you.

368
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:24,160
I wasn't sure what that was,

369
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,230
but it wasn't any rebel.

370
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:32,230
Xu Qi'an...

371
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:36,680
Xu Qi'an,

372
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,990
any last words?

373
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:49,390
Lord Wei,

374
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:51,030
I'm confused.

375
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,600
Was it Zhu Yang who killed me?

376
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:56,640
He's sorting evidence against
the Guardians at the Ministry of War.

377
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,780
How could he have killed you?

378
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:00,350
Father,

379
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,840
His Majesty summoned you urgently.

380
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:03,880
The Ministry of War?

381
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:04,830
Zhu Yang?

382
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:05,660
Yes.

383
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:07,710
When you were in Yunzhou
in the last three months,

384
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:09,120
he switched sides and joined them.

385
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:11,360
He, as a Gold Gong, accused us of corruption

386
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,070
and bending the law before His Majesty.

387
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:15,120
His Majesty ordered a thorough investigation.

388
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:17,440
Two Gold Gongs and a dozen Copper Gongs

389
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,980
were jailed by the Ministry of Justice.

390
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,680
That was to retaliate against me.

391
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:25,600
Are you affected, Lord Wei?

392
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:26,760
No.

393
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,510
That's a relief.

394
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,270
Father's playing along.

395
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:34,840
He's using Zhu Yang's attack

396
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:37,750
to clean house in the Guardian Yamen.

397
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:39,680
If that wasn't Zhu Yang,

398
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,270
what exactly did I see?

399
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,270
Hallucination.

400
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:44,680
Hallucination?

401
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:47,750
The 3rd-Rank Hypnotizer

402
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,200
of The Witcher's Sect

403
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,310
uses hallucination to kill.

404
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:53,120
Once hypnotized,

405
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,750
you'll be haunted by all the obsessions

406
00:28:56,990 --> 00:28:58,600
and fears you had,

407
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,070
falling at his disposal.

408
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,200
Hypnotizer?

409
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,040
Lord Wei,

410
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:11,750
I'm a nobody.

411
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:14,440
It was beneath a 3rd-Rank Hypnotizer

412
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,880
to kill me. Why did he do that?

413
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,750
Had he meant to kill you,

414
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,750
could you sit here with me now?

415
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:32,960
Lord Wei,

416
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,920
I still don't understand.

417
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:36,550
Don't think too much.

418
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,310
As a Guardian,

419
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,230
just fulfill your duty.

420
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:42,310
Remember,

421
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,160
should the sky fall,

422
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:45,790
I'll hold it for you.

423
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:47,680
Yes.

424
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:49,960
Wait,

425
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,070
how did you come back to life?

426
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:54,310
Jinlian of the Realm Sect...

427
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:56,230
The Elixir of Life.

428
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,840
You took the Elixir of Life
of the Astronomical Bureau.

429
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:01,550
If someone asks,

430
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,230
just say so,

431
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,000
understand?

432
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:08,070
Yes.

433
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:13,310
Good day, Lord Wei.

434
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:15,590
Wei Yuan,

435
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:17,470
stop lying.

436
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,470
Xu Qi'an couldn't have been

437
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:21,750
brought back to life by the Elixir of Life.

438
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:23,710
It's invaluable.

439
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:25,680
Even His Majesty failed to obtain one.

440
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:28,710
Never would the Bureau give it to Xu.

441
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,600
Whether or not that's true,

442
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:33,200
you may check with the Bureau,

443
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:34,710
Your Majesty.

444
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:37,070
Sure.

445
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,360
Have someone go there to confirm it.

446
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:41,640
Besides,

447
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,230
the title of nobility

448
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,270
is put on hold

449
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,960
for the time being.

450
00:30:57,470 --> 00:30:59,440
Where's everyone?

451
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:02,200
They used to act like my buddies

452
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:04,750
but didn't come to my funeral.

453
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:06,790
Let's drink after work.

454
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:08,150
Go to the brothel!

455
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,160
Yes, of course!

456
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:10,360
You know what?

457
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,310
Someone saw Xu Qi'an just now.

458
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:13,960
- Saw him? No way.
- Impossible!

459
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,230
His burial is today.

460
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:18,600
Could that be his ghost?

461
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,400
Ghosts can't come here.

462
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,070
- Hey, I...
- Later. We aren't done yet.

463
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,520
Truth be told,

464
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,680
I never liked Xu Qi'an.

465
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:27,710
He beat me at gambling,

466
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:28,710
drinking,

467
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,310
and work.

468
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,470
I'm glad he died.

469
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:32,990
-Yes!
- That's right.

470
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:39,750
Who is this?

471
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:40,710
Save your trick.

472
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:41,990
Who is this?

473
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:47,750
Xu...

474
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:49,360
Mr. Xu!

475
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,960
Mr. Xu's become a zombie!

476
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:54,800
Run!

477
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:06,790
A zombie!

478
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:19,550
Who was glad I died?

479
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,840
Him!

480
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,790
Was it you?

481
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:35,960
I'm sorry.

482
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:37,960
Alright, alright.

483
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:40,190
Mr. Xu...

484
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:41,510
Didn't you

485
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:43,680
die earlier?

486
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,520
Yes.

487
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:48,840
I forgot to introduce myself.

488
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,640
I'm Xu Qi'an's twin brother,

489
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,480
Xu Ba'an.

490
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:54,270
I'll take over his post by Lord Wei's order.

491
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:55,440
I have a question.

492
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,840
Where are those of the Breeze Hall?

493
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,200
They... they went to

494
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:00,880
Yunzhou.

495
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:01,960
Yunzhou?

496
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,470
Why did they go there?

497
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:07,640
Hearing your brother died there,
Gold Gong Yang and Silver Gong Li

498
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,920
were grieved and furious.

499
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:09,990
They blamed themselves.

500
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:13,710
They gathered all their members before dawn

501
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,120
to go to Yunzhou.

502
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:17,070
They meant to avenge your brother's death

503
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,070
on all the rebels

504
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:20,840
and The Witcher's Sect.

505
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:26,710
It's all set.

506
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,030
Ningyan,

507
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:33,510
rest in peace!

508
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:34,640
We're going to Yunzhou

509
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:37,310
to wipe out the remnants
of The Witcher's Sect

510
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:40,640
to avenge your death.

511
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,280
Mr. Yang,

512
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,440
we're ready.

513
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:52,200
Set sail.

514
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:41,550
You robbed others, huh?

515
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:44,240
You bullied others, huh?

516
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,070
You abused others, huh?

517
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:50,190
You assaulted others, huh?

518
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,110
Listen carefully.

519
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:53,670
If you do that again,

520
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:55,550
I'll break your legs.

521
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,280
We won't do it again.

522
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:58,960
Please spare us, Miss.

523
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:00,720
Get lost.

524
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:01,870
Yes, Miss.

525
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:06,150
Aren't you bold

526
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,190
to carry a saber again?

527
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:08,350
No, no.

528
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,200
It's yours.

529
00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:10,060
All yours.

530
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,240
Master,

531
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,110
you're amazing!

532
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,080
You bet.

533
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:18,990
Let's go.

534
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:27,510
Good job. You've stopped injustice 88 times.

535
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:29,110
Be accurate.

536
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:30,630
It's 89 times.

537
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,190
I acted twice when passing by Mount Wushan.

538
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,320
You're the best!

539
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:37,840
However,

540
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,800
you're fighting constantly on the way.

541
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,720
When can we get to the Dafeng?

542
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:43,920
We could've arrived in three days by mount.

543
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:44,840
As of now,

544
00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:46,670
we've wasted over three months.

545
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:47,840
Waste?

546
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,800
We didn't waste our time.

547
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,070
This trip is to see the world
and train ourselves.

548
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,470
See the world?

549
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:56,470
I thought it was to solve my problem.

550
00:35:58,720 --> 00:35:59,880
Yes, that too.

551
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:04,440
Your problem matters the most.

552
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:08,560
No. 3?

553
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:10,960
Yes, that's right. Four of my friends

554
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:12,670
sailed to Yunzhou.

555
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,280
Please keep an eye on them.

556
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:17,630
I'll let you know their looks later.

557
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:19,440
Yunzhou has been unsafe lately.

558
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,800
It is, right?

559
00:36:20,990 --> 00:36:23,190
They mean to raid The Witcher's Sect.

560
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,070
What are they thinking?

561
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,030
If you find them,

562
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:29,670
tell them Xu Qi'an didn't die.

563
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:31,510
Don't act rashly and return to

564
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:32,800
the capital at once.

565
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,840
But I'm right outside the capital.

566
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:38,110
Don't worry.

567
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:40,070
I'll relay your message by a carrier pigeon.

568
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:41,680
Alright.

569
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:42,980
Wait,

570
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:45,280
when I arrive, I need a favor from you.

571
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,120
Where can I find you?

572
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:47,920
Find me?

573
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:50,550
What's wrong? You won't help me?

574
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,960
Don't forget you still owe me one.

575
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,360
I... I know.

576
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,360
You see, the Spring Exam is near.

577
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,880
I've been too busy studying at school

578
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,720
to see you.

579
00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:09,920
How about you go to see my brother?

580
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,280
Your brother?

581
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:13,510
My brother, Xu Qi'an,

582
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:14,510
is a Guardian.

583
00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:16,280
He's much better than me.

584
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,440
He's extremely smart,

585
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,670
and sharp.

586
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:21,400
Also, he's good-looking

587
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,960
- charming...
- That's enough.

588
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:24,150
Where can I find him?

589
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,550
Just go to the Guardian Yamen.

590
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,240
Ningyan, Ningyan!

591
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,720
Caiwei is here to see you.

592
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,150
Sorry, I have to go.

593
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:32,590
Remember to relay my message.

594
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:35,910
No. 3?

595
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:37,440
No. 3?

596
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:40,360
He seems so unreliable.

597
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,240
We're doing our best to help him,

598
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,110
but look at him

599
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:44,510
pushing us to someone else.

600
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,280
How dare he brush me off!

601
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:48,880
Xu Qi'an, huh?

602
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,320
I'll show him what I'm capable of.

603
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:52,640
Let's go!

604
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:54,150
Beat more bag guys to vent my anger.

605
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,360
Make it 90 times then.

606
00:37:58,720 --> 00:37:59,560
Caiwei,

607
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:00,800
what brings you here?

608
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:02,390
Taste it.

609
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:09,360
I'm here for two matters.

610
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:10,800
One,

611
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:13,370
don't go to the Bureau these days.

612
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,110
Hearing that you came back to life,

613
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:16,550
everyone at the Bureau was shocked.

614
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:17,800
They couldn't wait to see you,

615
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,030
but I stopped them.

616
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:22,360
So...

617
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,980
how did you come back to life?

618
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:29,880
I...

619
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:33,990
I took the Elixir of Life.

620
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:37,280
The Elixir of Life.

621
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:39,440
Do you even know what that is?

622
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:43,240
It takes the Bureau 60 years to make one.

623
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:44,190
If you're dying,

624
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:45,880
take that elixir and you'll live.

625
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:48,720
If those of the 7th Rank take it,

626
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,240
they'll reach higher ranks.

627
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,960
How could a humble Guardian like you

628
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:55,550
gain such an elixir?

629
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:00,880
Because

630
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:02,760
I...

631
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,190
Because I...

632
00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:05,800
Because you

633
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,110
got it from me.

634
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:10,040
My master gave me this

635
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:12,190
when I first joined the Bureau.

636
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,720
It's been with me in this pouch

637
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:14,840
for 10 years.

638
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,360
So that's yours.

639
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:26,400
That leads to my second matter.

640
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,470
My Elixir of Life

641
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:30,590
is now yours.

642
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:34,870
I don't know why, but Master

643
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:35,840
had me bring it to you,

644
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:36,760
so here I am.

645
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:39,990
You have to pay me back.

646
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:41,440
If you invent other rarities

647
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,760
such as chicken powder,

648
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:43,610
you have to tell me.

649
00:39:43,610 --> 00:39:44,710
It's an equivalent exchange.

650
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:45,600
You got it.

651
00:39:45,610 --> 00:39:46,480
Thanks.

652
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:52,590
It's really good.

653
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:53,920
Give me the recipe later.

654
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,070
- No problem.
- See you.

655
00:39:58,590 --> 00:39:59,430
Wait.

656
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:05,990
What's this?

657
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:07,920
After taking the Elixir of Life,

658
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,990
your body will go through minor changes.

659
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:12,880
Take this medicine

660
00:40:12,990 --> 00:40:15,320
to make up for what you lose.

661
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:16,950
Goodbye.

662
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:23,800
What will I lose, an arm or a leg?

663
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:32,510
By telling His Majesty

664
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,760
the Bureau gave Xu Qi'an an Elixir of Life,

665
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:36,600
Lord Wei

666
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:38,880
meant to test you.

667
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:41,590
That's fine.

668
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:45,470
Give it to him if he wants.

669
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,360
Xu Qi'an's resurrection

670
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,190
needs to be justified anyway.

671
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:52,840
After the Sangbo Case,

672
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,240
you pleaded illness to stay indoors.

673
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:57,070
Then the evil object was sent to Yunzhou.

674
00:40:57,510 --> 00:40:58,800
After all that happened,

675
00:40:59,110 --> 00:41:02,190
Lord Wei must've figured out your goal.

676
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:03,880
Never mind.

677
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:06,030
He's

678
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:08,440
also waiting for someone.

679
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:12,400
Looks like great minds

680
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:14,440
like you two are alike.

681
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,030
Just now,

682
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,510
I saw Xu Qi'an going here and there

683
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:27,190
as if he had forgotten everything.

684
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,240
Well,

685
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:31,400
he'll recall it.

686
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:47,760
Xu Qi'an!

687
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,550
