Only fear not for my had

4
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,720
My hands are bent

How many per retribution abscess and annihilator?

6
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,760
Perhaps more than ten.

00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,800
I'd rather a sales Shake Together's a future.

8
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:51,920

10
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:55,840
T wins the prize.

Happy spilled out.

12
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,800
I love you.

13
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,560
Your Majesty.

14
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,740
I respect you.

15
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:10,860
And I genere my tracks and rights.

16
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:11,700
Tian!

17
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:15,260
Such aörened hand mark.

18
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:37,540
Master turns out to be a aura bright.

19
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:40,540
He owes no extra debt to Shallot vide Farmers College.

20
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,140
Ji Zhongqing and Zhu Caiwei were appointed to해도.

21
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:46,580
No one has come to visit three empires of same gods.

22
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:48,140
Sir, you have some efficiency.

23
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:49,660
It' s under my way.

24
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,380
The royal decree is attached to your letter.

25
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:53,260
I have mixed feelings for it.

26
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,260
The Tider bawdy associate

00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,900

00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:01,780
But princess lian®i� writing

30
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,100
is theormuşin former your speech.

31
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:06,980
The majesty dirte.

32
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:07,980
Princess Ling An.

33
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:09,980
How is it?

34
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:12,980
Princess Ling An is a kind and righteous person.

35
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,980
She is not as noble as before.

36
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:18,980
His Majesty ordered her to leave.

37
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:21,980
She has been unwilling to leave for a long time.

38
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:28,980
It's so short.

39
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,980
Why is she going to the court?

40
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,980
She is a carousel and is making trouble for His Majesty.

41
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,980
She is just a child.

42
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:35,980
She is a child with a poor family.

43
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:37,980
That's why she is going to the Prince of Yu's Mansion.

44
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:40,980
But she is so stupid.

45
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:42,980
Why did His Majesty say that?

46
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:44,980
It's because she is a child of the court.

47
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:46,980
She never dares to leave the court.

48
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,980
But now, she went to the court last time.

49
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,980
She has been in a bloodbath and is in a hospital.

50
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,980
His Majesty didn't say anything.

51
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:53,980
He didn't even think about it.

52
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,980
His Majesty is considering you as a new wife.

53
00:03:58,980 --> 00:03:59,980
At this point,

54
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:01,980
you should be more careful in the future.

55
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:05,980
I am not.

56
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:06,980
I am not.

57
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:07,980
Father is suspicious.

58
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:08,980
But I am a servant.

59
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:10,980
How to gain his trust

60
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:12,980
is also a lesson I must learn.

61
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,980
But for a woman who doesn't know how to fight,

62
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:17,980
she lost His Majesty's love.

63
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:18,980
Is it worth it?

64
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:21,980
It's worth it.

65
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:25,980
She is not a woman who doesn't know how to fight.

66
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:28,980
She just wants freedom.

67
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:31,980
Is there anything wrong?

68
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:36,980
Look at her.

69
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:37,980
What is this attitude?

70
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:41,980
It's because of this.

71
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:43,980
Although Li Anwei's mother is a man of the past,

72
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:44,980
she can still be called a lover.

73
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:46,980
If you blame Li Anwei for me,

74
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,980
you can tell her to be a father and a son-in-law.

75
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:50,980
Or I will be a helpless person.

76
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:05,980
Sister.

77
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:09,980
Are you free now?

78
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:24,980
Hongyuan, you can go now.

79
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:35,980
I will go now.

80
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:56,980
Let's go.

81
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:08,980
I have told you everything.

82
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:13,980
But what are you going to do in the future?

83
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:20,980
By the way,

84
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,980
His Majesty has made a judgment.

85
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:23,980
After three days,

86
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:27,980
Zhang Feng and his son will be in prison for execution.

87
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:35,980
I will go now.

88
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:36,980
I will go now.

89
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:37,980
I will go now.

90
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:56,980
I want to see Princess Jiang.

91
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:58,980
No need.

92
00:06:58,980 --> 00:06:59,980
Sit.

93
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:01,980
The case is over.

94
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:03,980
Zhang Feng is in prison.

95
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:06,980
The Ministry of War is in the air.

96
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:07,980
It's so urgent.

97
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:11,980
The imperial court must be trying to break the bloodline.

98
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:12,980
Today, the court will have

99
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:14,980
you and I to share the news.

100
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:16,980
Yes.

101
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:25,980
Princess Qibing.

102
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:28,980
It's okay.

103
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:32,980
The court will have you and I to share the news.

104
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:34,980
I will let the Ministry of War

105
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:35,980
to fight for the bloodline.

106
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:37,980
Where is Wei?

107
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:39,980
Wei will not share the news with anyone.

108
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:48,980
Wei Xing is really an art person.

109
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:52,980
I am afraid that there will be no more people to choose from.

110
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:53,980
If so,

111
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:56,980
Cao Qing,

112
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,980
the people in the Ministry of War will choose

113
00:07:58,980 --> 00:07:59,980
what you say.

114
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:01,980
Yes, Your Majesty.

115
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:03,980
Okay.

116
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:05,980
You can leave now.

117
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:07,980
Your Majesty, I have something to say.

118
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:10,980
Tell me.

119
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:12,980
Tong Luoxi and Qi An

120
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,980
have been in prison for the murder of Princess Pingyang.

121
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:18,980
Please forgive me.

122
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:22,980
The memorial was submitted yesterday.

123
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:25,980
Your Majesty.

124
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:28,980
I think the case is over.

125
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:32,980
It's time to face the fear.

126
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:58,980
You...

127
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,980
You actually brought this place

128
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:08,980
into this house?

129
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:10,980
How dare you!

130
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:11,980
Your Majesty, please calm down.

131
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:13,980
I know I was wrong.

132
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:17,980
Look.

133
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:18,980
Look.

134
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:19,980
Look at me.

135
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:20,980
Look.

136
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:21,980
Where is it?

137
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:22,980
It's dirty.

138
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:23,980
You brought it all in.

139
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:24,980
I...

140
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:25,980
I never said

141
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:27,980
that you would save the family.

142
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:29,980
I never said that.

143
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:30,980
I remember.

144
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:31,980
Look.

145
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:32,980
The water is clean.

146
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:33,980
The witness is here.

147
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:35,980
And there.

148
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:37,980
It's dirty.

149
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:40,980
It's dirty.

150
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:42,980
Your Majesty.

151
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,980
The Wei State has retreated to the capital.

152
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:49,980
I hope it's to keep your life.

153
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:53,980
The favor of the Wei State and the head of the palace

154
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:55,980
is truly unimaginable.

155
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:57,980
But no one else

156
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:59,980
would be so kind and bold.

157
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:01,980
Your Highness is right.

158
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:02,980
When the three-leafed case was over,

159
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:04,980
I broke his marriage.

160
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,980
Then I made a mistake.

161
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:08,980
He was my eyes.

162
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:09,980
But don't worry.

163
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:10,980
I'm not a soft man.

164
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,980
I won't let him humiliate you.

165
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,980
What's the motive for the Eastern Palace?

166
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,980
The Crown Prince is not participating in the court.

167
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:26,980
The Lin-an-Yi is only a blood book.

168
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:28,980
It's a new blood-sucking.

169
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:30,980
The Crown Prince is a good-looking man.

170
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:32,980
He should be a good-looking man.

171
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:38,980
I heard that Your Majesty

172
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,980
is not satisfied with the princess of Lin-an.

173
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:42,980
As a princess,

174
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,980
she interferes with the court.

175
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:46,980
She is in a hurry to get rid of you.

176
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:48,980
Princess of Lin-an

177
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,980
just wants to help the princess.

178
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:51,980
She is not fair.

179
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:53,980
Who would want to be a good-looking man?

180
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:55,980
She has her own reason.

181
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:57,980
But when I heard that

182
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:59,980
she was in a hurry to get rid of you,

183
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:01,980
I couldn't thank her.

184
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:03,980
I heard that

185
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:06,980
she didn't want to go to the Palace of the Silver-Glowing.

186
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,980
She won't see you today.

187
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:16,980
She won't see you either.

188
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:20,980
Master Xu,

189
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,980
the princess won't see you.

190
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:23,980
Please go back.

191
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:25,980
I know that the princess is not happy with the new blood-sucking.

192
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:27,980
But she can't stand the low-mildness.

193
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:28,980
Give her this.

194
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,980
Tell her to work hard and take care of herself.

195
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:35,980
Try it.

196
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:36,980
Try it.

197
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:37,980
And this.

198
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,980
Please take the princess with you.

199
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:46,980
Princess,

200
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,980
you have been in a coma for days.

201
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:49,980
If you continue like this,

202
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,980
your body will be broken.

203
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:54,980
Xu Qian

204
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,980
sent it over here just now.

205
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:57,980
She also said

206
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:58,980
to make you take care of yourself

207
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,980
and take care of yourself.

208
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:05,980
But Huang Su,

209
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:07,980
how did she know that the princess loves food?

210
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,980
She is a good-looking man.

211
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,980
She is a good-looking man.

212
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:14,980
How did she know that the princess loves food?

213
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:16,980
She is kind of kind.

214
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:19,980
Princess,

215
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:20,980
so many people care about you.

216
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:22,980
Do you want to get up and have a taste?

217
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,980
I'll put it here for you.

218
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:47,980
Young Master.

219
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:49,980
Watch out.

220
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:50,980
Don't hang up.

221
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:51,980
Okay.

222
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,980
Okay, I'll help your actions.

223
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:55,980
Wait.

224
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,700
Only..

225
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,100
Only you should know how

226
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:00,980
to prepare this.

227
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:03,980
Uh-Oh.

228
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:05,980
No!

229
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:06,980
Please go inside.

230
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:07,980
Please.

231
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:08,980
Let's go inside.

232
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:09,980
Okay.

233
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:11,980
Let's go.

234
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:16,580
Hope the princess of Qing свет

235
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:18,740
can set a defense.

236
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,360
They protect her.

237
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:21,980
Don't worry.

238
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,380
Her highness should

239
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:25,180
bring more rivi.

240
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:26,600
Will you stop?

241
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:29,100
Sister Shangyun

242
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,380
it is very heavy and

243
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:32,740
not strong.

244
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:34,560
You have always

245
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:35,900
been salesman to us.

246
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,360
Calm and flowery you're

247
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:41,620
in love with its beauty.

248
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:45,600
Now, Concubine Zhen.

249
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:15,180
We'll never be able to keep going like this.

250
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:16,780
Good.

251
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,180
Let's take a break today.

252
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,740
Why don't we just let it go for a while?

253
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,220
We're not in a relationship.

254
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:28,980
Why bother to make a fuss?

255
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:30,700
Let's have a big dream.

256
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:32,820
Let's not waste our time.

257
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:35,380
Lin Yan, let's have fun today.

258
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:38,260
I'm so happy!

259
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:40,420
I'm so happy!

260
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:42,620

Ot bad news!

262
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,660
Your Highness, what'RE we painting?

263
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:19,900
The paintings of theน's sub turn in the aftermath.

264
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,100
I accidently discovered it by surprise,

265
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:24,180
so I bought it as part of its direction.

266
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,740
The scenery over there,

267
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,100
Lin HeLin and the princess,

268
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,340
is a secret treasure.

269
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:31,420
But you know it's a secret.

270
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,500
You still love poetry and plays DianHuangSu.

271
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:37,260
Listen to the hails of these threeértry politely.

272
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:38,900
only Stromaus has a world

273
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:40,520
that is yours

274
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,720
You think so

275
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,060
Here comes Dfören

00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:52,840
Herjourney, Your Yourself

277
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,540
It's a disaster

278
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:10,460
The luck is full of red bags

279
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:11,980
I'm sorry again

280
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:14,140
More importantly, I'm so cool

281
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,100
Who said this?

282
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,540
I said it's good for people

283
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:17,260
Good for people

284
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:18,300
Is it also a luck?

285
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,060
No, it's mainly his sense of sense

286
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:22,380
Use the action sense

287
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:23,500
The year is coming to an end

288
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,380
So many years

289
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:25,660
Can't buy or buy

00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:27,020

291
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,060
What should we do?

292
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:29,020
What?

293
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:30,700

295
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:32,540
Happy cooperation

00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:33,820

Good price

298
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:36,380
No wonder the luck is so good

The point

310
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:08,980
Big Bro bought a good ginseng for you.

311
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:09,940
Here.

312
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:10,900

Where are yourловisouched Similarly?

315
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:18,420
Go to the bookstore to try things out.

316
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:24,940
Sister-in-law.

317
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:26,380
What's the matter?

318
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:28,140
You're eating so much meat, right?

319
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:29,860
So, of course,

320
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:31,940
we aren't disciple enough to stay home.

321
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:36,260
Big Bro, father,

322
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:36,860

Shan Shan.

326
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:41,780

00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:43,380
we just paid the monthly salary.

328
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:46,780
The annual salary is expected to be over half a year.

329
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:50,220
Why don't you pay the monthly salary?

330
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:52,420
I have a few months left.

331
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:53,940
Why are you in a hurry?

332
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:54,860
It's raining.

00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:56,060
It's raining. I'll pay more.

334
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:56,740

338
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,220

00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:03,340
You don't remember?

340
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,100
No.

341
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,340
When did I say that?

Okay.

351
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:27,820
You'll have vegetables in your whole life.

352
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:30,620
Vegetables are good.

353
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:32,380
I like vegetables.

354
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:33,700
Vegetables are delicious.

00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:34,900
Of course.

Second Uncle, let me tell you.

357
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:37,340
Vegetables are good.

358
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:39,860
Vegetables are helpful to our martial arts.

359
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:41,540
They are nutritious.

360
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:43,060
And there are a lot of good food

361
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:44,620

00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:46,260
They are helpful to our martial arts.

00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:47,020
Yes.

364
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:48,140
Vegetables are delicious.

365
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:48,940
I've never found that

367
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:52,100
We'll eat vegetables in the future.

368
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,020
Who wants to eat meat?

369
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:54,100
Who wants to pay the monthly salary?

370
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:54,940
Right?

371
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:55,780

get on board to follow Great Ming Bay's order.

382
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:31,660
The crown prince is the best.

383
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:33,660
The gold is the best.

384
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:36,660
The dragon is the best.

385
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:40,660
The white nose is the best.

386
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:44,660
Thank you, Your Majesty.

387
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:52,660
Mr. Xu.

388
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:54,660
Congratulations.

389
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:57,660
Go back to the palace.

390
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:01,660
Take care, Eunuch Yang.

391
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:03,660
I'll go home and have lunch.

392
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:04,660
Okay.

393
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:06,660
Thank you, brothers.

394
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:07,660
Take care.

395
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:08,660
Take care.

396
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:10,660
Go.

397
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:11,660
Go.

398
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:12,660
It's okay.

399
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:13,660
It's okay.

400
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:14,660
Go.

401
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:25,660
What's wrong with me?

402
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:29,660
I'm the only one who's not guilty.

403
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:34,660
Father, mother.

404
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:37,660
These things are from His Majesty's gift.

405
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:38,660
It's not for you.

406
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:40,660
Why are you so happy?

407
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:50,660
Ying Ying.

408
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:51,660
It's cold.

409
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:52,660
Have some tea.

410
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:53,660
Take some rest.

411
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:54,660
I'll make some tea.

412
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:56,660
I'll make some tea and make some tea.

413
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,660
What's the use of tea?

414
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:03,660
It's cold.

415
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,660
You should wear more clothes.

416
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:07,660
You can feel the coldness.

417
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:09,660
It's the last time.

418
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:10,660
Be a good boy.

419
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:11,660
This is the new clothes

420
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:13,660
I made for you.

421
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:17,660
It's important to wear clothes and warm up.

422
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:19,660
But you still have to be careful.

423
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:20,660
Look.

424
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:21,660
In the past 20 years,

425
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:22,660
thanks to my care,

426
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:24,660
I've become a good boy

427
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:26,660
with no power

428
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:29,660
and a long-time son.

429
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:30,660
And I've got the reward

430
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:32,660
of His Majesty and His Highness.

431
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:33,660
Right?

432
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:34,660
I've received

433
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,660
some of your kindness.

434
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:38,660
You're my close friends.

435
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:41,660
So?

436
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:43,660
So?

437
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:44,660
So?

438
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:47,660
So this reward,

439
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:49,660
you don't have to worry.

440
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:51,660
I'll make it right.

441
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:03,660
Let me think about it.

442
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:05,660
Shen Shen has a good family.

443
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:07,660
These gold coins

444
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,660
can only be used

445
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:11,660
on the knife.

446
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:15,660
You're right.

447
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:17,660
This is a gift.

448
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:19,660
This house

449
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:21,660
has been in our house for more than 20 years.

450
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:23,660
So annoying.

451
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:25,660
Let's go to the new house

452
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:27,660
in the city.

453
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:29,660
Good.

454
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:31,660
Before moving,

455
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:33,660
eat something good.

456
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:34,660
I want to eat meat.

457
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:36,660
I want to make some protein.

458
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:39,660
What do you want?

459
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:40,660
Two buns.

460
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:41,660
Okay.

461
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:45,660
I want one.

462
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:46,660
Okay.

463
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:47,660
One bun.

464
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:51,660
Two buns.

465
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:55,660
Here. Two buns.

466
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:56,660
Thank you.

467
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:58,660
What do you want?

468
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:01,660
It's been a year.

469
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:03,660
I can't even eat a bun.

470
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:05,660
You know what?

471
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:06,660
After the water supply,

472
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:08,660
our house has been empty.

473
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:11,660
Plus, it's been a long time.

474
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:13,660
I'm afraid it's not enough

475
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:14,660
to use this month's house.

476
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:16,660
It's not good to use it.

477
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:17,660
I can't make money

478
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:19,660
with my writing.

479
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:20,660
I can't save money.

480
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:22,660
But how can you read

481
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:24,660
the books on the road?

482
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:26,660
How about I share them with you?

483
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:27,660
No need.

484
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:29,660
The book has gold and gold.

485
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:31,660
I'm a new year.

486
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:32,660
I can read the book

487
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:34,660
in the Qing Zhou.

488
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:43,660
What's wrong, Zijiu?

489
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:45,660
It's weird.

490
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:46,660
Didn't the book

491
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:47,660
not allow people to enter?

492
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:48,660
Those two people.

493
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:52,660
Who are they?

494
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:53,660
Are you a bad guy?

495
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:54,660
Zijiu.

496
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:55,660
Come on.

497
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:56,660
I'll share the sausage with you.

498
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:57,660
No need.

499
00:23:58,660 --> 00:23:59,660
It's just here.

500
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:00,660
There's someone.

501
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:10,660
He's Xu Qian's brother, Xu Xinian.

502
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:11,660
He's the third one.

503
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:13,660
Fortunately, you know

504
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:14,660
the third brother

505
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:15,660
in the Ya Manli.

506
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:17,660
We can find the third one.

507
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:20,660
If it wasn't for the third one,

508
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:21,660
my brother's revenge

509
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,660
wouldn't have been successful.

510
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:26,660
I wouldn't have left the dungeon so soon.

511
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:30,660
But I'm afraid it's not a good time

512
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:31,660
to thank you.

513
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:33,660
I found out

514
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:35,660
that there was a miracle.

515
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:37,660
It must be Zhao Shoukang.

516
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:38,660
Yes.

517
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:40,660
You and I

518
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:41,660
shouldn't have appeared

519
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:42,660
in the Yunlu Academy

520
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:44,660
to trouble the third brother.

521
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:46,660
Then choose another opportunity

522
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:48,660
and wait until you get off the mountain.

523
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:50,660
You'll be able to convey the message

524
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:51,660
to him.

525
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:53,660
You're right.

526
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:06,660
I'm so sorry.

527
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:07,660
I'm sorry.

528
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:14,660
As time goes by,

529
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:16,660
you came along well with me.

530
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:18,660
I feel as if you would

531
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:19,660
support me.

532
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:21,660
I'm so lucky that

533
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:25,660
you know the magic of wealth!

534
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:26,660
My goodness!

535
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:29,660
You're right.

536
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:32,660
You are...

537
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:35,660
Just a moment.

538
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:37,660
lements!

539
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:40,660
Here.

540
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:44,660
I'm so full.

541
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:46,660
I can't bring my sister-in-law here.

542
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:48,660
If you can't bring her here, you'll be in trouble.

543
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:50,660
Take it.

544
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:53,660
I'm so sorry.

545
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:54,660
I'm so sorry.

546
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:56,660
I'm thanking you for your sister-in-law.

547
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:09,660
Thank you for the dinner

548
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:11,660
at the small meeting yesterday.

549
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:15,660
It's a pity.

550
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:18,660
I've been so drunk since the day I was born.

551
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,660
Your Majesty still hasn't said anything

552
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:22,660
to prevent your death.

553
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:24,660
I know.

554
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:26,660
Someone deliberately tried to kill me.

555
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:30,660
It's a small matter.

556
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:32,660
The key is

557
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:36,660
that Your Majesty doesn't like you.

558
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:38,660
It's not right.

559
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:43,660
It's just a small pain.

560
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:45,660
Why should I be the one to blame?

561
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:53,660
Because Linglong...

562
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:00,660
It's okay.

563
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:01,660
Don't be afraid.

564
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:04,660
Linglong is the emperor's son-in-law.

565
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:07,660
He only lives with the emperor.

566
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:09,660
When investigating Sangbo,

567
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:11,660
he was close to you

568
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:13,660
under the broad public.

569
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:18,660
Why is Linglong close to me?

570
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:21,660
Those are not the key.

571
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:23,660
The important thing is

572
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:25,660
how to make you live.

573
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:30,660
I'll go to the next meeting.

574
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:33,660
I'll do as you say.

575
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:35,660
Please give me a chance.

576
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:38,660
There's only one way.

577
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:40,660
Wait.

578
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:44,660
Since today,

579
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:47,660
all the beads and marquises have been solved.

580
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:50,660
Once the time is up,

581
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:53,660
if His Majesty wants to kill you,

582
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:57,660
I'll find a way to replace you.

583
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:00,660
No one can suspect you.

584
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:03,660
If...

585
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:06,660
you catch the car,

586
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:10,660
will you be able to escape?

587
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:18,660
It's a pity.

588
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:23,660
Who's there?

589
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:27,660
Second,

590
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:29,660
did you catch the car?

591
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:30,660
Did you know what it is?

592
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:32,660
What do you mean?

593
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:33,660
You're caught.

594
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:37,660
Put it in the car.

595
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:38,660
Put it in the car.

596
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:40,660
Take a look.

597
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:45,660
Linglong, drink it.

598
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:46,660
Okay.

599
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:52,660
It seems that these women

600
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:54,660
don't have the same taste as Zhou Xiandi.

601
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:01,660
You...

602
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:06,660
Zhang Hao,

603
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:08,660
I've robbed a merchant team today.

604
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:10,660
There's a beautiful girl

605
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:12,660
who's as beautiful as a flower.

606
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:13,660
I'll let her come up here

607
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:15,660
and give her a big hand.

608
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:33,660
Are you Zhou Qixiong?

609
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:37,660
Yes.

610
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:00,660
Zhou Qixiong.

611
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:01,660
Zhou Qixiong.

612
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:29,660
You're Zhou Qixiong?

613
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:32,660
Are you

614
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:34,660
a fairy?

615
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:36,660
What fairy?

616
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:37,660
A fairy?

617
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:38,660
I can't hear you.

618
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:39,660
Master,

619
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:41,660
is the dragon's family okay?

620
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:44,660
The news is good.

621
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:48,660
Are we going to kill him now?

622
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:49,660
Please spare my life.

623
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:52,660
I'm not going to kill you.

624
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,660
I'll send you to meet someone.

625
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:55,660
Have a good trip.

626
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:01,660
Sorry.

627
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:14,660
Mr. Song,

628
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:15,660
I didn't see it, did I?

629
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:16,660
Did he put chicken meat

630
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:17,660
in your箱?

631
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:18,660
And mushrooms

632
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:20,660
and various spices.

633
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:21,660
Don't...

634
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:22,660
Don't bother.

635
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:23,660
Keep watching.

636
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:31,660
Never ahí.

637
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:32,180
Mom.

638
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:58,340
Dandan!

639
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:03,660
This is so good.

640
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:07,660
This is what I call the true essence of my cooking.

641
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:09,660
I call it...

642
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:10,660
Chicken essence.

643
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:12,660
Chicken essence?

644
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:14,660
It's delicious.

645
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,660
Noodles.

646
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:26,660
Mix it.

647
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:28,660
Try it.

648
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:33,660
It's so delicious.

649
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:36,660
Yeah, this is just so good.

650
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:39,660
No pouvez không class danhLO.

651
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:41,660
Indef credible, clear.

652
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:44,660
It doesn't matter which class.

653
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:49,660
Fine.

654
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:50,660
I'm full.

655
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:53,660
Have a blank sheet of rare meat.

656
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:56,660
It's good for your health.

657
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:58,660
I have my Gardening Book Skin for free.

658
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:00,660
And I'll buy mushroom insurance for free.

659
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:03,240
Zitong, you need to get ready to splatter on three pillars.

660
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:04,960
Ten on one.

661
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,160
Huh?

662
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:16,360
Take left, take right, and we're moving forward...

663
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,100
inside.

664
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:27,700
And if Little King's spirit or C pré답 is your opponent,

665
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:32,700
I was too young to live in such a poor family.

666
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:37,700
Can you pass the law to my Si Tianjian?

667
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:38,700
Of course.

668
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:45,700
I have many more cases like this.

669
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:48,700
If you want to take it, just take it.

670
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:49,700
But...

671
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:50,700
I understand.

672
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:52,700
Leave all the things to me.

673
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:53,700
Cang Wei, let's go.

674
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:54,700
Cang Wei.

675
00:34:58,700 --> 00:34:59,700
Cheers.

676
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:09,700
You are here.

677
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:11,700
I'm here.

678
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:16,700
You still like to be treated like this for a few days.

679
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:18,700
But even if I was like this,

680
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:20,700
you also attracted me.

681
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:25,700
I only know that you are going to do something big today.

682
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:28,700
I already asked for your permission today.

683
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:29,700
Go.

684
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:33,700
And Miss Cai Wei.

685
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:34,700
Go.

686
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:43,700
Now, I'm the only one left.

687
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:52,700
You are here.

688
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:55,700
No. 3, I'll send you back.

689
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:57,700
If I have something to ask,

690
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:59,700
please forgive me.

691
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:02,700
Thank you, brother.

692
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:13,700
Who am I?

693
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:15,700
Where am I?

694
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:25,700
I think the way to play the bird is good.

695
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:28,700
Xu Qian, do you also think

696
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:31,700
I missed such a skill?

697
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:33,700
Brother Liang, with your temperament,

698
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:34,700
birds are not suitable.

699
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:37,700
What is suitable?

700
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:40,700
You will become stronger directly by playing the dragon.

701
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:43,700
I call it the strong dragon.

702
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:49,700
But where should I go to get the dragon?

703
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:52,700
I'm going to the palace.

704
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:54,700
You can ask the emperor about it.

705
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:56,700
Don't move.

706
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:57,700
Go.

707
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:00,700
It's a deal.

708
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:07,700
Okay, I'll send you back.

709
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:15,700
Ning Yan,

710
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:18,700
I got your news here.

711
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:19,700
I've been waiting for a long time.

712
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:21,700
How did you come here?

713
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:22,700
Thank you, teacher.

714
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:24,700
I'm sorry to bother you again.

715
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:26,700
It's okay.

716
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:28,700
I didn't help you last time.

717
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:31,700
I hope you can help me this time.

718
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:34,700
Do you still remember

719
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:37,700
the magic book I wrote last time?

720
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:39,700
Don't worry.

721
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:42,700
I'll do it.

722
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:46,700
Thank you, teacher.

723
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:50,700
I'm a little late.

724
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:52,700
I'll be back.

725
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:56,700
I'm sorry.

726
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:03,700
I understand.

727
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:06,700
There are still new books in the family.

728
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:09,700
Next time, you should comment on them.

729
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:13,700
Good.

730
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:15,700
Thank you, teacher.

731
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:19,540
At the same time,

732
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:20,740
just think of it as a model.

733
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:22,580
Use the air-conditioning to ignite.

734
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:24,500
But you have to remember,

735
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:27,020
you are not a student's student.

736
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:28,980
You can't use it frequently.

737
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:31,180
Otherwise, the air-conditioning will be unstable,

738
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:33,060
physical strength, and headache.

739
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:35,620
I understand. Thank you, teacher.

740
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:36,900
Hurry up and take it.

741
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:41,380
What's wrong with you?

742
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:44,900
He's not here either.

743
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:47,940
Why are you here?

744
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:48,860
Where's Yang?

745
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:49,940
Yang said...

746
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:51,340
He said if he were to be killed

747
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:52,340
in the main hall,

748
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:53,540
he would kill us.

749
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:55,740
He also said

750
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:57,220
he sent us here.

751
00:38:57,620 --> 00:38:59,620
It's a good time to settle the case.

752
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:00,980
I really don't understand him.

753
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:02,300
He's always being against this person.

754
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:03,500
He's not good at talking.

755
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:04,580
He's so annoying.

756
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:05,100
Right?

757
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:06,060
Especially recently,

758
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:07,260
I don't know which one is a genius.

759
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:08,260
I taught him a poem.

760
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:09,740
I read it every day.

761
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:11,660
I can't help but want to be in trouble.

762
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:19,380
So did he.

763
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:21,860
He didn't kill Xiuming.

764
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:23,060
Yes.

765
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:35,540
Might be not!

766
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:37,780
Come on.

767
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:39,100
Let's see how far things will go for him.

768
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:42,740
Your Majesty.

769
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:44,460
The podcasts are now planted,

770
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:45,660
while the novel Wei Yan

771
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:47,540
slandered us.

772
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:49,740
I will take the position of the emperor

773
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:51,020
and take Wei Yun

774
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:53,020
to give me and the innocent Meng Yuan

775
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:53,980
a justice.

776
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:58,260
Wei Yun.

777
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:01,340
Did you find out

778
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:03,220
the truth?

779
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:06,700
Your Majesty.

780
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:10,460
Xu Qian has taken the case of Zhou Chixiong

781
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:13,700
and is waiting outside the palace.

782
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:15,460
Xu Qian.

783
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:16,500
Xu Qian.

784
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:20,380
Xu Qian has entered the palace.

785
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:26,140
Greetings, Your Majesty.

786
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:27,980
Where is Zhou Chixiong?

787
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:31,700
Bring him up.

788
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:44,620
Your Majesty.

789
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:46,420
This is the drug of the court.

790
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:47,740
The source is unknown.

791
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:49,100
Zhou Chixiong.

792
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:54,660
The Spring Festival will be over.

793
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,740
Are you ready?

794
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:57,420
No.

795
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:58,420
I'll take it.

796
00:40:58,420 --> 00:40:59,540
Don't show it to others.

797
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:02,380
This is the most beautiful and beautiful

798
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:03,740
and beautiful wedding of the heaven.

799
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:04,460
I'll take it back.

800
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:05,100
You have to take it back.

801
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:06,580
You can't miss the special tea.

802
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:07,580
It's too far.

803
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:08,540
I'll take it back.

804
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:09,220
I'll take it back.

805
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:10,060
I'll take it back.

806
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:10,940
I'll take it back.

807
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:11,660
I'll take it back.

808
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:12,500
I'll take it back.

809
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:13,300
I'll take it back.

810
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:14,620
What about the garden?

811
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:16,100
It's the first time I've seen it.

812
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:17,220
It's too late.

813
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:18,220
The garden.

814
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:19,420
Everyone, be careful.

815
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:20,460
Don't worry.

816
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:22,100
You can buy the goods and go to the heaven.

817
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:23,660
There are thousands of peach trees.

818
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:25,060
All the workers are skilled.

819
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:26,140
They are so kind.

820
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:27,260
They are so good at keeping things.

821
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:28,660
The garden.

822
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:30,100
The garden.

823
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:31,060
The Spring Festival will be over.

824
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:31,940
The fire is on.

825
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:33,580
Hurry up and tell the peach trees to search for

826
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:35,060
Da Feng Da Gan Ren.

827
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:35,780
The music will be on the 10th of January.

828
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:37,460
There will be a big surprise

829
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:39,380
in the Spring Festival.

830
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:40,540
Tell you what.

831
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:43,260
My brother is the main streamer of the day.

832
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:44,580
I'm the main streamer.

833
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:45,580
I'm worth it.

834
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:16,700
The two hands can't hold the glass.

835
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:17,500
Look at the heart.

836
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:20,100
Look at the heart of the young man.

837
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:21,260
Look back at the heart.

838
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:23,580
Look back at the heart.

839
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:24,900
I'm afraid I'll be lost.

840
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:28,100
I want to change my mind.

841
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:31,420
Look at the world.

842
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:34,780
Look at the world.

843
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:38,100
Look back at the end.

844
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:40,260
I'll take it back.

845
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:42,740
I'll take it back.

846
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:44,620
I want to break the front line.

847
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:46,300
I want to take the lead.

848
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:47,980
I'll take the slow and easy.

849
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:49,700
I'll take care of the good.

850
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:51,340
I'll take the good.

851
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:53,100
I'll take the good.

852
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:54,540
I'll take the bad.

853
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:56,380
I'll take the good.

854
00:42:56,380 --> 00:42:58,100
I'm curious what I'm talking about.

855
00:42:58,100 --> 00:42:59,740
I don't want to think about the show.

856
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:00,660
Let the whole world know.

857
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:01,700
Let the whole world know.

858
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:03,100
He's not very stubborn.

859
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:04,340
When you're here,

860
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:05,300
you have to follow the rules.

861
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:06,460
Don't let me eat you.

862
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:07,700
I'll sleep with you.

863
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:08,660
I'll sleep with you.

864
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:09,860
He's not stubborn.

865
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:13,180
We're suddenly like a step by step.

866
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:16,540
We're suddenly like a step by step.

867
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:19,100
We're suddenly like a step by step.

868
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:20,940
From now on, we'll be lonely.

869
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:23,900
It's my fault. I'm not lonely.

870
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:27,260
I'm afraid the world is a red-banded house.

871
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:30,660
We're suddenly like a plan.

872
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:34,820
Someone will take my heart.

873
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:37,220
This hand can't hold the wave.

874
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:40,660
Look at the heart of the big brother.

875
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:44,100
Back to the past, there is a world full of tears.

876
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:47,540
Time has changed my mind.

877
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:51,500
This is a trip, but there is a隨意.

878
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:53,180
My chessboard, this building,

879
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:54,860
when I'm not afraid, I'll lose it.

880
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:56,500
But you regret it, what's the point?

881
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:57,940
Many lies, many lies,

882
00:43:57,940 --> 00:43:59,900
I can't bear to see the end.

883
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:01,860
The more I die, the more I'll be in pain.

884
00:44:01,860 --> 00:44:03,660
I won't give up.

885
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:07,140
From now on, we'll be alone.

886
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:10,380
I'm afraid the world is a red-banded house.

887
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:13,740
We're suddenly like a step by step.

888
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:17,140
From now on, we'll be lonely.

889
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:20,500
It's my fault. I'm not lonely.

890
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:23,820
I'm afraid the world is a red-banded house.

891
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:27,180
We're suddenly like a step by step.

892
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:31,820
From now on, we'll be lonely.

893
00:44:31,820 --> 00:44:34,300
This hand can't hold the wave.

894
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:37,740
I want to see the heart of the world full of tears.

895
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:41,180
Back to the past, there is a world full of tears.

896
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:44,620
Time has changed my mind.
