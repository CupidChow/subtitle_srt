40
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:06,470
You're just 4th Rank Fighters.

41
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:09,030
How dare you only stand with me here?

42
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:29,390
Rou!

43
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,280
After taking three of my strikes,

44
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,910
he won't die,
but he can only struggle to survive.

45
00:02:58,230 --> 00:02:59,230
However,

46
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,120
who exactly is this guy?

47
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,560
I'm talking about that arm.

48
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:05,680
Arm?

49
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:06,560
From my observation,

50
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,270
that arm doesn't belong to him.

51
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,150
The strength of its demonic power

52
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:12,200
is the most powerful I've ever seen.

53
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,480
Yang Qianhuan,

54
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,080
are your eyes on your back?

55
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,120
Before he left,

56
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,790
I secretly glanced at him.

57
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:21,470
Could you turn around and speak?

58
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:26,520
You weren't like this before.

59
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:27,670
I can't.

60
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:29,270
Please allow me to refuse.

61
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:31,080
I do things according to my own will.

62
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,680
I don't care about anyone's opinion.

63
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:35,830
I've carefully observed Wei Yuan
and the Supervisor.

64
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:36,960
Didn't you all

65
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,640
notice this?

66
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,520
What do you mean?

67
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:43,910
One stands on the Watchtower,
with his back to you;

68
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:46,790
the other sits on the Bagua Platform,
with his back to us.

69
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:48,120
We all think

70
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,200
Wei Yuan and the Supervisor

71
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,560
have the demeanor of great masters.

72
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,790
Alright, let's get to the point.

73
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:57,680
Based on the current intel we have,

74
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,830
that hand must be the sealed object
from the Sangbo lakebed.

75
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:01,670
That's right.

76
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:04,230
That man in gray is Heng Hui.

77
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:05,440
As long as we can catch him,

78
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:07,560
we'll find out
where Princess Pingyang is.

79
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,910
The Sangbo Case happened
only a few days ago,

80
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:12,320
and you Guardians

81
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,710
have got so many details?

82
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:15,920
Wait.

83
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,590
Why have I never heard

84
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:20,120
my juniors from the Astronomical Bureau
mention this case to me?

85
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,320
Didn't you ask them for assistance?

86
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,000
You Guardians

87
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:27,080
don't have such great abilities.

88
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:29,760
We Guardians didn't even
deploy the Gold Gongs.

89
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:31,470
The one handling the case

90
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:34,080
was just an ordinary Copper Gong.

91
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,680
A Copper Gong?

92
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:37,880
Which one?

93
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,470
You should have heard of him.

94
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,910
He's quite famous in the Bureau.

95
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:43,270
His name is Xu Qi'an.

96
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:46,520
Xu

97
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:47,680
Qi

98
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:48,870
An?

99
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,830
I heard of him
when I first returned to the Bureau.

100
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,350
He's an alchemy genius.

101
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,640
But I didn't expect

102
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,830
that he would also handle
the Sangbo Case.

103
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:03,000
Doesn't this make him
stand out even more?

104
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:07,120
What a strong rival.

105
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:11,470
What's the deal with that demonic hand?

106
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:12,870
I don't know.

107
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:15,120
I'm not interested
in these strange powers

108
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,830
and have no desire to be interested.

109
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:19,790
Listen carefully.

110
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:20,640
In today's battle,

111
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,520
I, Yang Qianhuan,

112
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,960
will take the lead in merit.

113
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,590
He's been away from the capital
for months,

114
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:32,960
and his condition is worsening.

115
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,880
Should we get him another physician?

116
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:38,230
Forget it.

117
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,350
Let him die from the illness.

118
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,360
Senior,

119
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,760
I've suffered serious injuries.

120
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,920
The severed arm has backfired.

121
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,400
Heng Hui,

122
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:59,510
stop this while you still can.

123
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,590
Senior,

124
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:00,040
I entered the Azure Hall when I was six

125
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,830
and have been by your side ever since.

126
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:08,750
You taught me to chant scriptures,

127
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:10,830
taught me to meditate,

128
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:13,630
took care of my clothes, food

129
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,320
and daily needs,

130
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,200
and treated me like a brother,

131
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,320
like a father.

132
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:39,990
Now,

133
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,400
there's something

134
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,750
I want to ask of you.

135
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:55,440
I want...

136
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,830
I want

137
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,870
to eat you, Senior.

138
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:09,320
I want to eat you, Senior.

139
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:21,820
(Guardians)

140
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:26,670
Lord Wei.

141
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:56,340
(Like a Dragon Entering the Thunder)

142
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:03,980
- Why the laugh?
- Why the laugh?

143
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:07,550
Nothing.

144
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:08,920
I didn't laugh.

145
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:09,950
I didn't laugh.

146
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:12,440
We fought fiercely last night.

147
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,590
Where were you?

148
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:18,230
You Gold Gongs

149
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:19,830
are best

150
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:21,160
at fighting.

151
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,110
I'm a mere Copper Gong.

152
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,990
I'd only hold you back

153
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:26,200
if I went.

154
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,630
You're just afraid of death.

155
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:29,320
- Absolutely not.
- Enough.

156
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:37,040
Last night, Heng Hui appeared
at the Minister of War's Mansion.

157
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,680
These Gold Gongs...

158
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,400
They were injured by Heng Hui.

159
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:45,830
Last night, the yamen set up a trap
at the Minister of War's Mansion.

160
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:47,920
Three Gold Gongs

161
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,710
and one 4th Rank disciple
of the Supervisor.

162
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,230
Four 4th Rank experts
didn't capture Heng Hui.

163
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,710
Did you see where he came from?

164
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:57,990
A severed hand.

165
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:00,710
As expected.

166
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,400
Lord Wei,

167
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,710
what rank is the owner
of this severed hand?

168
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,710
At least 2nd Rank.

169
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:09,040
Most likely, 1st Rank.

170
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,710
What's the origin of this severed hand?

171
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:18,200
Is it related to the Tianyu?

172
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:22,990
This matter

173
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,920
involves a very secret affair.

174
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:27,470
I do not know

175
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,320
the specific details.

176
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:32,990
What we know now is

177
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,230
Heng Hui has been seriously injured.

178
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:36,990
He is still in the city.

179
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,110
I have reported the situation
to His Majesty.

180
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:40,710
The city search continues.

181
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:42,350
You

182
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:44,710
continue your investigation.

183
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,120
Yes.

184
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,560
Where is the Minister of War now?

185
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,360
He is under house arrest in his mansion

186
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,870
in the name of protection.

187
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,470
I'll investigate it now.

188
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:54,880
Wait.

189
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:58,110
Mr. Zhang is a 2nd Rank official.

190
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,510
Be cautious.

191
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,590
Officials of the 4th Rank or above

192
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:03,280
should not be subjected to Gazing Spell.

193
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,400
This is the rule.

194
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,640
Yes.

195
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,800
However,

196
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,990
you can still bring a sorcerer.

197
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:16,680
Understood.

198
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,990
Then I'll have Caiwei accompany me.

199
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:21,630
No need.

200
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,200
A stronger sorcerer

201
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,680
has been waiting for you at the yamen
for the whole night.

202
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:29,280
Waiting for me?

203
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:55,110
You must be the alchemy genius Xu Qi'an.

204
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,800
It's just a few tricks.

205
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:01,630
As for alchemy,

206
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:04,040
the Bureau is the best of the time.

207
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,200
Quite perceptive.

208
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:10,200
May I ask who you are?

209
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:13,470
The best sorcerer of the Bureau,

210
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,740
Yang Qianhuan.

211
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:19,680
I assume

212
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:21,680
you must know me.

213
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,400
Huan

214
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,040
Qian

215
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:28,100
Yang.

216
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:29,960
It's Yang Qianhuan.

217
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:31,190
My senior.

218
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,510
The only formationist

219
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:34,080
in the Dafeng.

220
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:39,830
A 4th Rank formationist.

221
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,590
Senior Yang.

222
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:43,110
I've long admired your name.

223
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,830
I've long admired you.

224
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:54,710
Senior Yang,

225
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,680
why are you facing away from me?

226
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,710
Only by facing away from the crowd

227
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,110
can one show

228
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,870
the demeanor of a great master.

229
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:04,350
What do you think?

230
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:06,200
(So,)

231
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,590
(he's a Chunibyo boy.)

232
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,640
Senior Yang,

233
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:48,960
you're right.

234
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,080
What do you need from me?

235
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,440
Take it.

236
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:00,560
What's this?

237
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,020
My Merit Records.

238
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:03,500
(Merit Records)
Yesterday,

239
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:05,200
I assisted the Guardians

240
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,110
in taking down a madman.

241
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:09,200
This madman has a bronze body
and iron arms.

242
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:10,630
His demonic energy is terrifying.

243
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:13,160
The three Gold Gongs
were no match for him.

244
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,440
Luckily, in the end,

245
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:17,560
I used the Killing Intent

246
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:18,680
of Heaven, Earth, and Men

247
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:19,990
to turn the tide

248
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,560
and secure the victory,

249
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,750
defeating the madman.

250
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:24,470
Based on this,

251
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,160
I, Yang Qianhuan,

252
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,600
will take the lead in merit.

253
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:31,360
I've written all the details
of this battle thoroughly.

254
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,650
Take your time to read it.

255
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:36,920
Just announce it to the world as it is.

256
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:46,510
Just announce it to the world

257
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:47,760
as it is.

258
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:49,310
That's all?

259
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,280
Senior Yang,

260
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:54,600
why not go directly to Lord Wei?

261
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,550
I'm just a small Copper Gong.

262
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:58,070
I've asked,

263
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,710
but I don't know
what Wei Yuan was thinking.

264
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,030
He said you're in charge
of the Sangbo Case,

265
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:05,550
and that everything
must be reviewed by you

266
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:06,910
before it can be disclosed.

267
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:11,840
(Lord Wei sure knows
how to shift blame.)

268
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:16,130
Rest assured, Senior Yang.

269
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,550
Once I finish handling this case,

270
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:19,960
I'll certainly announce it
to the world as it is.

271
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,360
That's good.

272
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:25,120
It's not in vain that I've waited
for you all night.

273
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,160
You go back to work.

274
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,130
I'm going to sleep now.

275
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:30,500
Senior Yang, don't rush off.

276
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:31,960
Anything else?

277
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,790
It's nothing serious.

278
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:36,230
I just suddenly remembered a line

279
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:38,550
that suits your temperament.

280
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:46,750
Holding the sun and moon,
I pluck the stars.

281
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:52,270
There is no one like me in this world.

282
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,200
It's wild,

283
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:01,760
solitary,

284
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:03,520
and invincible.

285
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,120
What a good line.

286
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,640
What a good line.

287
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:12,120
I stumbled upon this line
some time ago

288
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:14,510
but had never met anyone
who could match it

289
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:16,400
until today when I saw you.

290
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,040
How about this?

291
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:19,030
If you don't mind,

292
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:21,470
I'll give you this line as a gift

293
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:22,550
for our first meeting.

294
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,850
You really know how to flatter me.

295
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,710
Since you're offering it so sincerely,

296
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,750
I won't

297
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,400
stand on ceremony.

298
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:32,880
Let me take a moment to appreciate it.

299
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:34,930
Holding the sun and moon,
I pluck the stars.

300
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,720
There is no one like me in this world.

301
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,460
Holding the sun and moon,
I pluck the stars.

302
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:40,060
There is no one like me in this world.

303
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,920
Holding the sun and moon,
I pluck the stars.

304
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:43,550
There is no one like me in this world.

305
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,670
Holding the sun and moon,
I pluck the stars.

306
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,270
There is no one like me in this world.

307
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:51,230
It's a good line,

308
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,920
but it still feels

309
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,230
like something is missing.

310
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,230
It's missing your handsome face.

311
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:04,200
By the way, Senior Yang,

312
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,070
you've accumulated so many merits.

313
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:09,270
Do you mind adding one more?

314
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,270
Do you know how?

315
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:13,470
Tell me quickly.

316
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,440
Here's the thing.

317
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:17,920
I need to go
to the Minister of War's Mansion

318
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,030
to interrogate Zhang Feng.

319
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,200
I need a powerful sorcerer like you

320
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,600
to help me discern the truth.

321
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:27,880
You Guardians just can't do your job

322
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,750
without our Bureau.

323
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:32,230
Fine. I'm in a good mood today.

324
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,920
I'll go with you.

325
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,600
Alright, I'll prepare the horse now.

326
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,680
Please wait a moment.

327
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:39,110
No need.

328
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,470
Close your eyes lightly,

329
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:43,440
and bow your head for two breaths.

330
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:59,310
Holding the sun and moon,
I pluck the stars.

331
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:03,200
There is no one like me in this world.

332
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:07,440
I found it.

333
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,070
It feels just right now.

334
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:12,310
Senior Yang,

335
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,640
where is this?

336
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,960
Who are these rogues

337
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,990
to dare to trespass
the Minister of War's Mansion?

338
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:21,600
I'm the Lead Investigator
of the Sangbo Case.

339
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,440
Vanish.

340
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:24,960
Vanish again.

341
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:26,680
Vanish again.

342
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,520
Keep vanishing.

343
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,750
Senior Yang, what are you doing?

344
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,720
Don't worry.

345
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,030
I'm just setting up a formation

346
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:40,200
to move them to a quieter place.

347
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:47,800
How bold!

348
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:49,920
Who's making the noise here?

349
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:50,920
Who are you

350
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,640
to dare trespass
the Minister of War's Mansion?

351
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,710
I'm the Lead Investigator
of the Sangbo Case.

352
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:56,550
Vanish.

353
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,120
This one can't vanish.

354
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:01,990
Vanish? Vanish what?

355
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:04,310
Let's go

356
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:05,680
inside to talk.

357
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,070
I apologize for the disturbance.

358
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:11,360
Please forgive me, Mr. Zhang.

359
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,640
Mr. Xu is young and talented.

360
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,880
I heard that not only
has the Sangbo Case progressed rapidly,

361
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,880
but you also uncovered the culprit

362
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,880
behind Earl Pingyuan's case.

363
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:23,960
Mr. Zhang,

364
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:24,800
you flatter me.

365
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:28,990
No need for pleasantries.

366
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,070
Ask what you need to ask.

367
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:36,840
I'm here to understand the case

368
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,440
and speed up the investigation.

369
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:40,310
Mr. Xu, you're joking.

370
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,310
You Guardians are handling the case,

371
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,440
so you must be

372
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:46,200
more familiar with the details.

373
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,990
What clues could there be here?

374
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:01,340
Senior Yang,

375
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,710
during the questioning just now,

376
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:03,640
which things were true

377
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,750
and which were false?

378
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,440
None of it was true.

379
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,400
This old fox.

380
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:11,550
If there's nothing else,
I'll return to the Bureau.

381
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:13,440
Alright, thank you, Senior Yang.

382
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,280
Okay.

383
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:15,310
Goodbye...

384
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,270
Senior Yang,

385
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:21,110
are you alright?

386
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,440
It's nothing.

387
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:24,830
It happens.

388
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:32,440
We've found Heng Yuan.

389
00:21:58,750 --> 00:21:59,600
What happened?

390
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,960
You're too late.

391
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,750
He's already gone to paradise.

392
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,880
He's dead?

393
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:11,920
Between me and death,

394
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,030
he chose the latter.

395
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,710
His life

396
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:17,400
was taken by the demonic hand.

397
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,470
I want to eat you, Senior.

398
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,270
No.

399
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:35,200
I can't kill him.

400
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,310
Heng Yuan is a Martial Monk.

401
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:47,600
His blood and qi were strong,

402
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,470
just enough to heal your injuries.

403
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,310
What?

404
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,360
You no longer want revenge?

405
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:01,550
No.

406
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,200
He is my senior.

407
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:08,830
No.

408
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:10,470
I can't kill him.

409
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,230
You once told me

410
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,070
that everyone can be killed

411
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:21,710
for your revenge.

412
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,640
Why is he

413
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:29,200
an exception?

414
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:31,920
He is my senior.

415
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,680
I respect him most in this world.

416
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,640
So,

417
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:48,310
what about Pingyang?

418
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:55,840
Pingyang...

419
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:01,070
Pingyang...

420
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,310
Heng Hui.

421
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:12,110
Heng Hui.

422
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,600
Everyone in this world can be killed,

423
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:24,200
but not my senior.

424
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,070
Heng Hui!

425
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:48,920
Senior,

426
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,070
didn't you always want to know

427
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:55,750
what happened

428
00:24:57,550 --> 00:24:59,600
a year ago?

429
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,030
Afterward,

430
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:05,030
the evil object disappeared.

431
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,750
Only I stayed behind,

432
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:08,550
waiting for all of you.

433
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,680
Is it because you have something to say?

434
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:15,270
He's gone,

435
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:18,440
but he didn't give up on revenge.

436
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:21,230
He handed the burden to me.

437
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,310
Now,

438
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:26,230
I want to tell you all a story.

439
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:31,030
A story from a year ago.

440
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:34,790
Is it the story of Heng Hui
and Princess Pingyang?

441
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:42,750
One year ago,

442
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:44,960
in the Azure Hall,

443
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:47,270
Heng Hui first met Princess Pingyang.

444
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:49,510
In Heng Hui,

445
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:50,960
Pingyang saw

446
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,640
the freedom she had long yearned for.

447
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,990
To escape her arranged marriage,

448
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:57,840
they decided

449
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:00,400
to leave the capital asap.

450
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:05,620
(Duke Yu's Mansion)

451
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,840
In order to leave the capital,

452
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:15,230
they needed a weapon
that could conceal their aura

453
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:17,960
to hide from the Bureau sorcerers.

454
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:20,910
Additionally,

455
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,070
they needed someone

456
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:25,510
who could help them forge new identities

457
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:26,590
and find a way

458
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,710
to leave the capital.

459
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,720
For this,

460
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,070
Princess Pingyang

461
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:34,600
found a trustworthy friend,

462
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:37,160
the lineal son of Earl Pingyuan.

463
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,750
At that time, Earl Pingyuan
and the noble factions

464
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:49,230
were already drifting apart.

465
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,960
After learning of the plan from his son,

466
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:54,920
he colluded
with the then-Vice Minister of War

467
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,030
and devised a plan

468
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:58,790
to send Princess Pingyang
out of the capital,

469
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:00,400
in order to strike

470
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:02,750
at Prince Yu's faction.

471
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,750
Where is Princess Pingyang now?

472
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,750
Has Earl Pingyuan provided her
with a new identity?

473
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:11,130
(Wang Heng from Jianzhou)
The naive Princess Pingyang

474
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:13,960
was unaware
of the complex court politics

475
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,600
and the malice of people's hearts.

476
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,380
A naive and unworldly girl

477
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:22,380
and a Wanderer
who'd been away from the world.

478
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:25,360
The moment they decided
to leave together,

479
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:27,150
the tragedy

480
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:28,910
was already sealed.

481
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:32,360
Human hearts can be venomous.

482
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:34,880
Once they left the capital,

483
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,280
they revealed

484
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:37,880
their true intentions,

485
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:40,470
planning to assault Princess Pingyang.

486
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:42,550
Pingyang and Heng Hui
fought to the death.

487
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:43,390
In the end,

488
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,120
one was killed,

489
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,040
and the other

490
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:49,030
committed suicide with a hairpin.

491
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,470
Princess Pingyang died?

492
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:54,230
You said "they".

493
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,400
Who else was involved,

494
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,240
besides Earl Pingyuan's lineal son?

495
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,840
Another villain

496
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,120
was Zhang Feng's son,

497
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:05,990
Zhang Yi.

498
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,000
No!

499
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:14,830
No!

500
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,070
Stop!

501
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,270
Heng Hui!

502
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:26,440
Heng Hui!

503
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,640
Since Heng Hui died a year ago,

504
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:13,510
why is he here now?

505
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,400
After someone dies,

506
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:23,500
they cannot come back to life.

507
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:28,510
Someone used secret magic to seal
Heng Hui's primordial spirit in his body

508
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,440
and turned him
into an unconscious walking corpse.

509
00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:32,990
In this year,

510
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:35,840
what sustained him was revenge.

511
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:39,510
It's the blood feud
of Princess Pingyang.

512
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:43,600
Who saved him?

513
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:45,990
What is their true purpose?

514
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:48,960
This

515
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:50,680
is still unknown.

516
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,710
In Heng Hui's memory,

517
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,470
this part is very vague.

518
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,270
He only knows
that the person used his body

519
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:03,270
to refine the demonic energy
for the demonic hand.

520
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,470
A corpse puppet.

521
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:09,110
A secret method of the Witcher's Sect.

522
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:26,310
It seems Heng Hui was merely a vessel.

523
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:28,270
The mastermind behind this

524
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:30,510
used the corpse puppet
to weaken the demonic energy,

525
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:33,070
so they could use the demonic hand.

526
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:36,990
The witness has died.

527
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:39,510
Do you have any proof
of what you just said?

528
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:45,470
If you don't believe it,

529
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,230
take the body back

530
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:50,120
and have the coroner examine it.

531
00:30:58,880 --> 00:30:59,920
Be gentle.

532
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,040
Here it is.

533
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:27,180
(Heng Hui was defeated and fled.)

534
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:29,660
(The Witcher's Sect's secret method.)

535
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,680
Lord Wei, Princess Lin'an is here.

536
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,270
Xu Qi'an,

537
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,840
accompany Princess Lin'an

538
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:53,600
to the morgue.

539
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:54,830
Yes.

540
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:02,980
(The Witcher's Sect)

541
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:11,580
(Peace)

542
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,480
Your Highness.

543
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:44,390
Your Highness.

544
00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:48,360
We haven't confirmed the identity
of this corpse.

545
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:51,240
Perhaps it isn't Princess Pingyang.

Once I reach the South,

563
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,320
I'll write to you.

564
00:34:52,450 --> 00:34:55,640
♪Though this world is bitterly cold♪

565
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:57,670
♪I only wish for Xu's safety♪

566
00:34:57,670 --> 00:35:01,930
♪Neither joy nor sorrow lingers♪

567
00:35:01,930 --> 00:35:05,020
♪Flowers fall; their fragrance fades♪

568
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:05,880
Wait for me.

569
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,510
I'll definitely come back to see you.

570
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:17,130
♪To bloom brightly♪

571
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,160
Cover it.

572
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,540
Cover it.

573
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,280
Your Highness.

574
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:36,440
Princess Lin'an was heartbroken,

575
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:38,110
but she still identified that corpse.

576
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:39,280
It's Princess Pingyang.

577
00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:40,140
Also,

578
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:42,670
Duchess Yu is on the way to the morgue.

579
00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:46,830
Understood.

580
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:48,360
Leave.

581
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:50,440
Your Highness, this is serious.

582
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,150
It may cause a change in the court.

583
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,390
- Should we prepare...
- Leave!

584
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,120
Yes.

585
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:38,030
Don't you love to play?

586
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:40,360
Don't you love to joke?

587
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,320
What are you doing now?

588
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,360
Get up!

589
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:50,960
Why are you so obedient now?

590
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:55,150
I almost forgot

591
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,880
the fresh pomegranates from this year.

592
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:01,110
Aren't pomegranates your favorite?

593
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:04,960
Let me peel one for you.

594
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,240
It's so sweet.

595
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:09,030
It's really sweet.

596
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:10,510
Pingyang, try it.

597
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:13,150
This is the pomegranate from this year.

598
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:17,760
Go on, eat it.

599
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:21,470
Aren't they your favorite?

600
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:24,280
Why aren't you eating?

601
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,880
It's really sweet.

602
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:30,720
Pingyang,

603
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,880
from now on, I'll always be with you.

604
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:39,320
I'll take you home.

605
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:43,400
Shall we go home?

606
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:48,800
Pingyang, let's go home.

607
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:58,110
Who did this?

608
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:03,960
Who did this?

609
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:11,630
Earl Pingyuan's lineal son

610
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,510
and the Minister of War's son,

611
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,160
Zhang Yi.

612
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,400
Was she insulted?

613
00:38:21,990 --> 00:38:23,110
She used a golden hairpin

614
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,200
to commit suicide.

615
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:31,680
Thank you.

616
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:59,300
(The heaven and earth bear witness.)

617
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,080
Good.

618
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:19,150
We will handle this as you suggested.

619
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:20,090
Go and take care of it.

620
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:20,990
Yes.

621
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:25,070
How's the Sangbo Case going?

622
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,190
Why didn't Wei Yuan come today?

623
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:37,920
Your Majesty,

624
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:39,630
Princess Lin'an seeks an audience.

625
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:41,360
Lin'an?

626
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,320
What does she want?

627
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:44,920
Tell her to go back.

628
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:45,910
Yes.

629
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,150
What brings you here?

630
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,670
I'm Lin'an.

631
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,670
I need to report.

632
00:39:56,190 --> 00:39:57,550
It's a grievous injustice.

633
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:00,920
I plead for imperial judgment.

634
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,240
Come in.

635
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,370
White bones are buried in yellow earth.

636
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,570
A year of suppressed injustice

637
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:43,510
makes the living mourn in agony

638
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:46,030
and the spirits weep blood.

639
00:40:52,470 --> 00:40:54,150
The heaven and earth

640
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,550
bear witness.

641
00:40:57,630 --> 00:40:59,030
This blood letter is for justice,

642
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,630
waiting for an execution.
