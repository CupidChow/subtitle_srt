3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000

Your Majesty,

119
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,400
there must be a party behind this.

120
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,840

on others,

134
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,640
it will be a waste of time.

135
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,240
Wait.

00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,280
I want to advise you again.

139
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,680
If the king is making a step forward,

140
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,520
the next time you make a step forward,

141
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,200

I don't know if you have any talents.

146
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:11,120
I want to send you a poem.

147
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,760

I'm innocent

165
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,880
I'm not going to tell you the truth

166
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:15,880
Liu Fang, even if you want to protect him today

167
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,880
You can't protect him

168
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:23,880
It's a serious crime to destroy the superior

169
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:26,880
But

170
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,880
If it's true

171
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,880
It's not a crime

172
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,880
Gu Yuen

173
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,880

00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,880
Mr. Sun

184
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,880
Liu Fang

185
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:15,880
Sir, I don't understand

186
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:21,880
Why did you give this case to the Ministry of Justice?

187
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:26,880
Do you know Li Yulang is the king's member?

188
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:30,880
If you give this case to the officials

189
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,880
They will be a big part of the king's member

190
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,880
I understand

191
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,880
By then, the court will be in a mess

192
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,880
The two leaders of the family

193
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,880
Are not what you want to see

194
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:59,880
You are so fast

195
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,880
Wei Gong, what's wrong?

196
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,880
I have nothing to do with you

197
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,880
Mr. Sun has told me

198
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,880
Your Majesty didn't mention your case

199
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:12,880
It means that this case has been taken over

200
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,880
You can leave

201
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,880
Yes

202
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:26,880
Uncle

203
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,880
I'm afraid that you are not well

204
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,880
Shall we let go of someone?

205
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,880
No need

206
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,880
Yes

207
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,880
Mr. Xu, why are you here?

208
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,880
I saw you were in a bad mood last time

209
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:53,880
I wanted to see you

210
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,880
You are in the court

211
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,880
Why don't you talk to him?

212
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,880
Okay

213
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,880
I'll go

214
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,880
I'll go

215
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,880
Princess, it's me

216
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:22,880
Come in

217
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,880
Xu Xian, look

218
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,880
The wind is blowing in the capital

219
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,880
Even the sun is being counted

220
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,880
Remember that Sister Pingyang said

221
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,880
The western Yang of the south

222
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,880
Can be used to cover the whole sky

223
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,880
The desert of the desert

224
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:54,880
Can be cleared

225
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:00,880
The south

226
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,880
Is it the destination of Princess Pingyang?

227
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:06,880
Yes

228
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,880
I've been thinking about it all the time

229
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,880
Pingyang is in a hurry to be free

230
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,880
Is it worth it to get the name?

231
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,880
Princess, what's the answer?

232
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,880
No investment

233
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,880
I'm a little bit annoyed

234
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:29,880
Sit down

235
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:31,880
I want to hear your opinion

236
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,880
I dare not forget the time of Princess

237
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,880
But if you go out

238
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:52,880
With the situation at that time

239
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,880
It's the only choice of Princess Pingyang

240
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,880
I have no choice

241
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,880
Princess and I are not together

242
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,880
But from the princess's description

243
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,880
I know she is a coward

244
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,880
People who don't want to be called by the law

245
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:08,880
For her

246
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,880
Marrying into the royal family may be more terrifying than death

247
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,880
Is the king not good?

248
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,880
The reputation is above 100,000

249
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,880
How many noble women are this?

250
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,880
Let them be

251
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,880
I don't want to

252
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:28,880
You say

253
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,880
Rather than giving a person who loves you

254
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,880
In the cabinet

255
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,880
To be a doctor

256
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,880
It's better to go to death

257
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:38,880
I'll help you

258
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,880
Run to success

259
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,880
No more

260
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:45,880
I'm going to die

261
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:54,880
I'm going to die

262
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,880
Princess, I'm sorry

263
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,880
You are right

264
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,880
You are the only choice of Pingyang

265
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,880
And I'm not the only choice

266
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:16,880
Mother said

267
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,880
Yu Meifeng is a good girl

268
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,880
I'm not a good girl

269
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:23,880
The law is the curse

270
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,880
I'm a good girl

271
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,880
I'm a good girl

272
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,880
I'm a good girl

273
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,880
I'm not far from this day

274
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:34,880
Princess

275
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,880
You are here

276
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,880
Drink with me

277
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:39,880
Congratulations

278
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:40,880
You are not as good as before

279
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,880
There will be fireworks in a while

280
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:54,880
Princess

281
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,880
The fireworks here are different from what I see

282
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,880
They are pretty

283
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:24,880
Xu Xuan

284
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:28,880
You said

285
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,880
Pingyang sister didn't die

286
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,880
But went to another world

287
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,880
We are talking about fireworks together

288
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:37,880
Yes

289
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,880
In that world

290
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,880
No so-called military city

291
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:42,880
Gui Jian

292
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,880
People come and go

293
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,880
There is no mother's order

294
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,880
No contract

295
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:50,880
In the crowd

296
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,880
Two people meet in the crowd

297
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,880
And they are clear

298
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,880
And they can take a rest

299
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,880
Even if you don't meet a good cause

300
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,880
You don't have to be forced to save

301
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,880
You are a good person

302
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:22,880
You can go to any place you want

303
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,880
Do anything you want

304
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,880
Is there such a world?

305
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:28,880
Of course

306
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,880
Not only can a girl not marry

307
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32,880
In that world

308
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,880
A girl is like a man

309
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,880
Exit the bottle exhibition

310
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:37,880
Realize self-esteem

311
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:38,880
When old

312
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,880
Just buy a house with my sister

313
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,880
Live a happy and happy little life

314
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:52,880
I really have such a world

315
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,880
I really want to go to see

316
00:15:58,880 --> 00:15:59,880
But

317
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:02,880
What is this

318
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,880
But I don't have Pingyang sister

319
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,880
So beautiful

320
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,880
I don't have her so

321
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:09,880
Smart

322
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,880
I don't have her

323
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:12,880
So beautiful

324
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:14,880
I don't have her

325
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:15,880
So beautiful

326
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,880
I don't have her so

327
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:19,880
Smart

328
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,880
I don't have her so brave

329
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,880
I don't know anything

330
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,880
In contrast

331
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,880
Princess has many strengths

332
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:42,880
Follow the heart

333
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,880
Be true

334
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,880
Be sincere

335
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,880
Even so

336
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,880
I can't bear to be this world

337
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,880
I can't bear to be mother

338
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:58,880
Although she is always idle

339
00:16:58,880 --> 00:16:59,880
And my brother

340
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,880
Every time I am responsible for my mother

341
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:04,880
She always runs out to protect me

342
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,880
And father

343
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,880
Even if I am a grasshopper

344
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,880
He still treats me very sweetly

345
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,880
And little Gang

346
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,880
And you

347
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,880
And my thing

348
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,880
Although we know each other

349
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,880
Not noisy

350
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,880
But I appreciate your reminder

351
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,880
Although I am so timid

352
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,880
Said he would take me to heaven

353
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,880
And write poems

354
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,880
Write a short story

355
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,880
It's a lot of interesting things

356
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:46,880
You know

357
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,880
I like Xun Wei

358
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:49,880
This is a egg yolk

359
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,880
So he doesn't let me eat

360
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,880
Every time I am myself

361
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,880
I go out to eat

362
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,880
How do I know

363
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,880
He will understand after he sees it

364
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,880
It's someone who is silently concerned about the princess

365
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:19,880
Tell me

366
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:20,880
It's possible

367
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,880
Yang Yiyang is dead

368
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,880
I don't have a friend

369
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,880
Princess, you drink too much

370
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,880
Princess, you don't have to worry

371
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:41,880
In the future

372
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,880
I can be your friend

373
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,880
I don't want to be your friend

374
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,880
I don't want to be your friend

375
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,880
The song is about the love between the two of us

376
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,880
The song is about the love between the two of us

377
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,880
The song is about the love between the two of us

378
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,880
The song is about the love between the two of us

379
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,880
The song is about the love between the two of us

380
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,880
The song is about the love between the two of us

381
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,880
The song is about the love between the two of us

382
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,880
The song is about the love between the two of us

383
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,880
The song is about the love between the two of us

384
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,880
The song is about the love between the two of us

385
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,880
The song is about the love between the two of us

386
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,880
The song is about the love between the two of us

387
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,880
The song is about the love between the two of us

388
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,880
The song is about the love between the two of us

389
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,880
The song is about the love between the two of us

390
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,880
Princess, you're awake

391
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:54,880
Slow down

392
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,880
Slow down

393
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,880
How do you feel

394
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,880
I'm here for a night

395
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:02,880
Yes

396
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:06,880
Where's Xu Qian?

397
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,880
Xu Qian left without telling me

398
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:10,880
He stayed up all night

399
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,880
and kept your hand on me

400
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:17,880
He...

401
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:18,880
He...

402
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:19,880
He...

403
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:20,880
He slept while I was sleeping

404
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,880
He...

405
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:22,880
He slept while I was sleeping

406
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:23,880
No, no

407
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,880
He was warming up for you

408
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:28,880
He was so nice to you

409
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,880
He was so nice to you

410
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:30,880
He was so nice to you

411
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:31,880
He was so nice to you

412
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,880
He drank the porridge when you woke up

413
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,880
He drank the porridge when you woke up

414
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:37,880
Have a taste

415
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,880
He said

416
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,880
He made it himself

417
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,880
He put some secret recipe

418
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:43,880
called...

419
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,880
Chicken essence

420
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,880
The water is delicious

421
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,880
You little brat

422
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,880
You're always on my mind

423
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:04,880
OK

424
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:36,360
Let's meet the sensation.

425
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,300
Brother Yang, these leaked on the news again.

426
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:43,880
They were trulyور believers.

427
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:55,340
The young scholar Yang Qian

428
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:58,080
sip popcorn in Dun Wein Village.

429
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:01,720
I guess that's right.

430
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,720
I'm not a master.

431
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,720
I'm not a master.

432
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:11,720
But I'll be more careful when I go out.

433
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,720
In case someone recognizes me.

434
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:16,720
That's why I don't need trouble.

435
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,720
Then he doesn't need this.

436
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:22,720
After all, there is no one to discuss this matter.

437
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,720
Why?

438
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,720
Brother Yang.

439
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,720
That's it.

440
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,720
Since the beginning of the Tang Dynasty.

441
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,720
In the State-owned Sword and Yunlu Academy.

442
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:43,720
The Xuanren River was divided into the first style.

443
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:46,720
Now it has spread all over the world.

444
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,720
Everyone calls for Lord Xu to be the leader.

445
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,720
The fate of the child is in the past.

446
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:58,720
I'm helpless and I'm not clear.

447
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,720
Why?

448
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,720
Why can Xu Niuyan do everything?

449
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,720
He's always been a man.

450
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,720
He's always been a man.

451
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:14,720
He's always been a man.

452
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:19,720
He's always been a man.

453
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,720
It's unfair.

454
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,720
It's unfair.

455
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,720
It's unfair.

456
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,720
Brother Yang.

457
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,720
Are you okay?

458
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,720
I...

459
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,720
I'm done.

460
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,720
I'm going to go to the Great Hall.

461
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,720
I'll be punished.

462
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,720
If Xu Niuyan is a great man.

463
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:48,720
I'll be the great leader of the Great Hall.

464
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,720
Brother Yang, you can't.

465
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:54,720
The day of the hand-to-hand.

466
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,720
The star of the moon.

467
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,720
The world is without me.

468
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,720
Who sent me here?

469
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,720
Teacher, you want to stop me?

470
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:06,720
You're too anxious.

471
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,720
It's obviously Teacher.

472
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,720
You said I could drive the world back.

473
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,720
Why do you want to be the leader?

474
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,720
Qingcheng, Wuhu, Canglong.

475
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,720
One mountain is higher than another.

476
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,720
Teacher.

477
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:18,720
Tell me clearly.

478
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,720
I'm just saying that you know how to hide.

479
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,720
I misunderstood.

480
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:26,720
What did you misunderstand again?

481
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,720
Teacher, you didn't let me fly the world.

482
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,720
You're afraid that my reputation will be worse than yours.

483
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,720
Teacher, you...

484
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,720
Let me out.

485
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,720
Teacher, you...

486
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,720
You're here.

487
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,720
I'm here.

488
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,720
I went out for a little business.

489
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:02,720
Don't be so weird.

490
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,720
The miracle of Lord Jianzhen.

491
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,720
It's better to start from the beginning.

492
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:14,720
But your eyes are still like wine and spicy.

493
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,720
Xu Qian indeed broke the case.

494
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,720
She didn't treat her family well.

495
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:22,720
Now I'll introduce her to the court.

496
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,720
I'll lead the way in the battle between the three tribes.

497
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,720
But...

498
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,720
Is that too early?

499
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,720
Don't be so ridiculous.

500
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,720
It's just that the law is like snow.

501
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:41,720
Only then can she fight with the law.

502
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,720
Just like Lord Jianzhen.

503
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,720
There's one thing.

504
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,720
If you don't need it in the future,

505
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,720
don't drag Ling'an in.

506
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:58,720
I don't remember what you said.

507
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,720
So anxious.

508
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,720
So anxious.

509
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,720
So anxious.

510
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,720
I wonder if we can help the new family.

511
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:28,720
Don't worry.

512
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,720
Ling'an is a good man.

513
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,720
She must have written a letter to the Academy.

514
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,720
I'll come.

515
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,720
Congratulations.

516
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:36,720
Congratulations.

517
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,720
You're here.

518
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:38,720
Congratulations.

519
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,720
You Xu family are in a different world.

520
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,720
From now on,

521
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:44,720
Ronghua family will be in trouble.

522
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,720
This is the best for you.

523
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,720
Try this.

524
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,720
It's good for your health.

525
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,720
It's good for your skin and your skin.

526
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,720
Thank you.

527
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,720
This is a good thing.

528
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,720
Ronghua family will be in trouble.

529
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:56,720
Come on.

530
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,720
Come on.

531
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,720
You're so smart.

532
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,720
Look at the house.

533
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,720
It's so quiet.

534
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,720
It's so quiet.

535
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,720
It must be a house of the master.

536
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,720
It's quiet.

537
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,720
From the east to the west,

538
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,720
the uncle was in trouble for half an hour.

539
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,720
He was in trouble.

540
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,720
His head was in trouble.

541
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,720
If you feel uncomfortable,

542
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,720
go and take a rest.

543
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,720
Forget it.

544
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,720
I don't have appetite.

545
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:26,720
I haven't digested the smoke and blood in the morning.

546
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,720
Don't be angry with him.

547
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,720
His father was not appointed in the Ministry of Rites.

548
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,720
He was affected by the Sangbo case.

549
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,720
Now he's still in the Ministry of Rites.

550
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,720
What's the mood for him to be in trouble?

551
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:40,720
My master is just a regular patrol.

552
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,720
He'll be back in a few days.

553
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,720
You told me that

554
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,720
your master is in trouble.

555
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:48,720
Do you want to ask him to beg you?

556
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,720
You're kidding me.

557
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:54,720
His master is just a little fellow.

558
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,720
I'm afraid he can't talk.

559
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:00,720
The master is here.

560
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:36,720
Mr. Yang,

561
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,720
the Palace is in trouble.

562
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,720
Mr. Xu,

563
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:44,720
I'm here to congratulate you on your marriage.

564
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,720
Thank you.

565
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,720
You're welcome.

566
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:53,720
We're in a very busy place.

567
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,720
Why is Mr. Wei not here?

568
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,720
He's here.

569
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,720
He has something to do with the Palace.

570
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,720
He's here to congratulate you.

571
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,720
I understand.

572
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,720
Please come in.

573
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,720
I'll be in trouble if I have the key.

574
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,720
Mr. Ma,

575
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:24,720
Mr. Xu,

576
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,720
thank you.

577
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,720
Thank you.

578
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,720
Come on.

579
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,720
There are so many things.

580
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,720
I'm so sorry.

581
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,720
I'll take my leave.

582
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,720
Mr. Sun,

583
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,720
please take your leave.

584
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:36,720
I'm ready.

585
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,720
Please take your leave.

586
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,720
Please take your leave.

587
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,720
Thank you.

588
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,720
Take care.

589
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:46,720
Sister.

590
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,720
Sister.

591
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,720
Take care.

592
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,720
Come to play if you have time.

593
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,720
I didn't expect your daughter

594
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,720
to be so generous.

595
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,720
How about

596
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,720
I ask her to help me

597
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,720
to clear up my business?

598
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,720
I'm not lying.

599
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,720
I came here for this.

600
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:10,720
I can't count on you.

601
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:14,720
Remember it clearly.

602
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,720
Don't get it wrong.

603
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:16,720
Yes.

604
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,720
Remember it clearly.

605
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:19,720
Write down Mr. Wei's name.

606
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,720
Let me show you.

607
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,720
Sister.

608
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,720
Let's have a talk with my sister.

609
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,720
Please tell her.

610
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,720
Sister.

611
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,720
Don't be so sad.

612
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:31,720
What?

613
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,720
You went far away?

614
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:34,720
Yes.

615
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,720
It's been a while.

616
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,720
Did you agree?

617
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:39,720
No.

618
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,720
You sneaked away at night.

619
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:42,720
You only left a letter.

620
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:45,720
Now there's a group in the palace.

621
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,720
You said

622
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,720
if you find the princess

623
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:52,720
you can't let her go.

624
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,720
Gangzi, remember this.

625
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,720
If anyone asks me about that night

626
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,720
I'm here with the princess.

627
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,720
I'm just talking about my master.

628
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:08,720
I understand.

629
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,720
You asked me when you left.

630
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,720
I understand.

631
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:17,720
What did you leave before you left?

632
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,720
You said thank you.

633
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,720
Thanks to your encouragement

634
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:24,720
she decided to find the new one.

635
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:32,720
Shiqian.

636
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,720
You're right.

637
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,720
It's better to act.

638
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,720
Instead of being alone

639
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,720
in front of the palace

640
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:42,720
with your own eyes.

641
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,720
I want to take Sister Pingyang

642
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,720
to see the world of your debt

643
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,720
and fulfill her life wish.

644
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,720
I also want to

645
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,720
find a free world for myself.

646
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:01,720
You completed my task.

647
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,720
I will feed her.

648
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,720
No matter too much

649
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,720
it's better when she leaves.

650
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,720
I don't want to be late,

651
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:15,720
but I'll be eating and drinking.

652
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:19,720
Thank you, master Yue.

653
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,720
Thank you, master Yue.

654
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:24,720
Thank you, master Yue.

655
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,720
Come again?

656
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,720
That would be a literally heavy thought.

657
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:30,160
He didn't even go to the court recently.

658
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:33,640
He was actually sent to Jinluo

659
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,640
to search for the Emperor.

660
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,960
My kuizu's many assistants

661
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,960
were attacked by the traitors.

662
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,840
They were badly injured.

663
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,640
You're right.

664
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,080
To deal with Da Feng,

665
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,880
we must get rid of Wei Yuan first.

666
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:50,640
Otherwise, my kuizu will never be able to get out of the palace.

667
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,040
As for the Sword Formation,

668
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:55,080
the people of the county are not sick.

669
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:57,440
He was a strong man at that time.

670
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:01,760
This is just to be a good example of the world.

671
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,400
My master is right.

672
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:07,560
The Sword Formation must have already seen our plan.

673
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:11,160
But it's hard to find the right one for the demon.

674
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:13,320
It's like waiting for something.

675
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:16,520
As for the demon who controlled the demon,

676
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,480
as my master told me,

677
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:20,960
he and he have reached the same goal.

678
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:24,440
The demon has been taken away by him

679
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:27,320
and went to Yunzhou with Shuiying.

680
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:30,000
He didn't want to attack the capital.

681
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:32,160
He was waiting for something.

682
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,440
By the way,

683
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:37,840
Xu Qian has already set out to fight with someone.

684
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:40,840
The court sent him to go to Yunzhou to chase Shuiying.

685
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,760
It's not a coincidence.

686
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,920
As my master said,

687
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:48,520
Xu Qian is the key to that person's plan.

688
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:52,040
I will continue to investigate Xu Qian.

689
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:53,920
Three months later,

690
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:57,200
everything will be settled.

691
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,560
Once I stay quiet for two months

692
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,360
and recover every night,

693
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,160
call me back in time then.

694
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,560
You have to give a sign.

695
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:35,880
Okay.

696
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,720
This is your rent.

697
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:40,600
Zhaoge-shi.

698
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,640
Your rent.

699
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,960
How many people you...

700
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:50,880
How many houses do I need?!

701
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:53,120
That's three fortunate people.

702
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,160
Why?

703
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,360
Good.

704
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,000
I let them呆

705
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,120
you have to stop the fire.

706
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:21,960
cią們,

707
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,120
take them out!

708
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,120
You must get them out!

709
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,200
You must get them away!

710
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,900
Yue, give up!

711
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,100
If a soldier wins, I'll grey up

712
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:44,400
Who shouldcel?

713
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:45,900
Kill him!

714
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,900
Who are you?

715
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:19,900
Who are you?

716
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:21,900
Who are you?

717
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:23,900
Who are you?

718
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:25,900
Who are you?

719
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:27,900
Who are you?

720
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:43,900
Don't move. Do you hear me?

721
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:45,900
I'll help you. Do you hear me?

722
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:47,900
Yes.

723
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:53,900
Sir, the rebel army has taken a loan.

724
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:55,900
The other rebels have taken the loan.

725
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:57,900
Sir,

726
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,900
13,000 and 4,000 yuan.

727
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:01,900
The rebels' soldiers,

728
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:03,900
and the losses are all here.

729
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:05,900
Please come in.

730
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:15,900
This is the tax money for the account.

731
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,900
Please leave.

732
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:19,900
The tax money will be transferred to the bank.

733
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:21,900
The rebel army will be in jail.

734
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:23,900
Don't be mistaken.

735
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:25,900
Yes.

736
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:27,900
The rebel army will be in jail.

737
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:29,900
Don't be mistaken.

738
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:31,900
Yes.

739
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:33,900
Hurry up.

740
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:37,900
The rope is tied.

741
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,900
Let's go.

742
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,900
Hurry up.

743
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:45,900
Hurry up.

744
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:57,900
What's going on?

745
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:59,900
Sir, we must have a drink tonight.

746
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:01,900
Sir,

747
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:03,900
to help you,

748
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:05,900
we have to go to the police station.

749
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:07,900
I have no choice.

750
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:09,900
I have no choice.

751
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:11,900
I'll go.

752
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:13,900
I'll treat you to a drink.

753
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:15,900
I won't.

754
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:17,900
Go and get the rope.

755
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:19,900
Okay.

756
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:43,900
Go.

757
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:13,900
Go.

758
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:43,900
Go.

759
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:13,900
The talisman is a joke.

760
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:15,900
It's like being attacked.

761
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:25,900
Xu Qian.

762
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:35,900
Xu Qian.

763
