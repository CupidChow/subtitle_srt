40
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:38,040
I told you

41
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,640
to practice hard.

42
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:47,710
Sorry, sir. My bad!

43
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:50,080
Sorry, I lost control in excitement.

44
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:51,960
I didn't mean to hit you.

45
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:53,550
My apologies.

46
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:55,870
Xu Qi'an?

47
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:57,670
Mr. Yang.

48
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:01,920
He's your direct supervisor,

49
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:02,920
Li Yuchun,

50
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:04,040
Silver Gong Li.

51
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,670
Greetings,

52
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,830
Silver Gong Li.

53
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,080
Dafeng Special Unit.

54
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,430
What unit?

55
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:15,510
Good job.

56
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:16,800
Don't do it again.

57
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:46,200
We met once earlier.

58
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,430
Do you remember?

59
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,830
You know each other?

60
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,640
Great.

61
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:52,870
Silver Gong Li,

62
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:53,950
he's

63
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,590
all yours.

64
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,870
Take good care of him.

65
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:01,830
Good day, Mr. Yang.

66
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,320
Mr. Li,

67
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,800
you were on duty that day.

68
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,480
I was conquered

69
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,640
by your charisma

70
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,830
at first sight.

71
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,240
Being able to serve under you

72
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,520
is sheer bliss.

73
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,360
I don't remember seeing you.

74
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,240
Great wits have short memories.

75
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,430
It's understandable.

76
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,560
But back then, I did...

77
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,120
Enough of your flattery!

78
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,350
My people must have

79
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:44,960
a clear conscience.

80
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,560
If I find out

81
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,960
you crossed the line,

82
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,000
whoever you are,

83
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:51,390
whoever you know,

84
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:54,350
I'll deal with you lawfully

85
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:55,470
with no mercy!

86
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:56,960
Yes.

87
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:01,070
Chief.

88
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,600
Yes!

89
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:20,640
(Haoqi Tower)
I'm officially a Guardian!

90
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,020
(Moon Palace)
Your Highness.

91
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:39,680
Here's Xu Qi'an's aptitude test result
from Lord Wei.

92
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,830
Please take a look.

93
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:42,960
You're paid as a court official.

94
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:44,760
You live off the people's resources.

95
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,700
You can easily oppress
the common people,

96
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:48,560
but you can't fool the heavens.

97
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:52,470
(A+)
There hasn't been an A+ for years.

98
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,760
It's sharp of you

99
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:56,230
to select such a talent, Your Highness.

100
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,230
Princess has arrived!

101
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:00,630
Huaiqing,

102
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,830
did you recommend men to the Guardians?

103
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:07,110
Yes.

104
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:09,560
They're the emperor's eyes and ears.

105
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:11,560
I recommend people to them

106
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,760
to expand their talent pool

107
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:16,880
for the sake of the Dafeng.

108
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,830
Same here.

109
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,200
To make our state better,

110
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,880
I'm doing my utmost

111
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,080
and working day and night.

112
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,030
I have work to do.

113
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:28,080
Suit yourself.

114
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:29,760
Hold on.

115
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:31,390
I'm not done yet.

116
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:32,550
Gang,

117
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,680
show Grand Princess

118
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:37,120
the level of the man we recommended.

119
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:40,980
Zhao Jia,

120
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,390
B+!

121
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:46,030
B+?

122
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,000
What does it mean?

123
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:50,520
The Guardians have strict entry standards.

124
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:53,200
Getting a B+ means Zhao Jia is

125
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:54,520
one of the best.

126
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:56,120
As his name suggests,

127
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:59,270
he'll rise to the "Jia" Level

128
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:00,560
or A Level.

129
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,880
A Level?

130
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:06,230
What does that mean?

131
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:07,470
A Level is

132
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:09,030
awarded to Gold Gongs.

133
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:12,560
They're said to be rising stars
in the Guardians.

134
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,230
It seems that the best ones recommended

135
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:20,230
by Grand Princess

136
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,830
only got Bs.

137
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:28,960
I see.

138
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:31,080
Who knows

139
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,200
a random one I chose

140
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:36,790
would be a perfect Guardian?

141
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,710
Did anyone get a B

142
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:42,830
among the ones you recommended?

143
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,060
(For Grand Princess)
Let me see!

144
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Can't I?

145
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:49,960
I want to know.

146
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,040
You're scared?

147
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:53,880
I have work

148
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:54,720
to do.

149
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,790
So do I.

150
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:57,350
Let me see. I'll be quick.

151
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:59,230
- Hey...
- You...

152
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:01,120
Crown Prince has arrived!

153
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:02,590
Brother!

154
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,000
(Crown Prince)
Why were you so loud?

155
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,200
Go back to your palace.

156
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,790
Huaiqing

157
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:13,230
recommended someone to the Guardians.

158
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:14,710
I want to see

159
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:16,710
what kind of talent he is.

160
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:18,430
Huaiqing,

161
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,910
how good is he?

162
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:21,120
May I take a look?

163
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:25,910
If there's nothing else,

164
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,320
I'll take my leave.

165
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,120
Open it!

166
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,780
(New Copper Gong, Xu Qi'an's Result, A+)

167
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:43,320
She's indeed sharp.

168
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,560
She chose

169
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,640
a rare talent.

170
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,960
Xu Qi'an?

171
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,020
(A+)

172
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:54,830
A+...

173
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,750
- Lin'an! Are you ill?
- Unfair!

174
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:58,920
6 Bamboos.

175
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,160
Play it.

176
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,160
Not that one.

177
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,800
Gentlemen should be quiet.

178
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,230
Mahjong is a game of tactics.

179
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:08,200
Every tile has its...

180
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,110
Go back to study.

181
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:11,680
You'll lose, Mrs. Ma.

182
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:15,590
Ningyan?

183
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:17,200
Why are you back?

184
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,630
I miss you.

185
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,960
But I haven't achieved anything.

186
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:22,760
Don't worry. I'll help you.

187
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:24,470
The capital is too dangerous.

188
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:25,870
All the more reason

189
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,350
for us to stick together as a family

190
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:29,350
(Xu)
to forge ahead

191
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:30,510
and help each other.

192
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,470
Take my bag.

193
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:33,320
Here.

194
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:37,280
Some attitude!

195
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,680
Hey, I have a gift for you.

196
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:44,190
Second...

197
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,470
Sage's Knife!

198
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:54,310
Ningyan,

199
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:55,990
how dare you steal it?

200
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:57,800
If others find out,

201
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,320
our whole clan will be killed!

202
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:01,870
I didn't touch it.

203
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,120
It's fake.

204
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:04,400
It's to encourage you

205
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,560
to study hard.

206
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:07,870
I almost died of fright!

207
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:08,750
Let me see.

208
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,470
It looks so real.

209
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:12,960
Where are your parents?

210
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:13,800
Are they home?

211
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:15,750
I miss them, too, after so long.

212
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,470
They're back.

213
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:20,500
Knowing that you had left,

214
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,520
they...

215
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:22,830
Did they go to find me?

216
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:24,710
You shouldn't have told them.

217
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:26,800
What if they left unprepared in a rush?

218
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,590
You're right about that.

219
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:32,510
They are in a rush.

220
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:34,510
Silly boy.

221
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:35,920
100 liang, furniture included?

222
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,510
I can help you move right now!

223
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:38,590
We'll turn the soil here.

224
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:40,200
You can grow plants.

225
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,080
Yes. Although this is the wing,

226
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,440
it's in the city center.

227
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,140
(Peace and Prosperity)
Near the East Market

228
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:46,560
and the Moon Resto!

229
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,160
You'll have everything you need.

230
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,400
The school is on the left.

231
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:52,400
I know the teacher there well.

232
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,350
I can talk to him

233
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,710
to look after your children.

234
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:56,590
That's right.

235
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:58,800
80 liang?

236
00:08:58,870 --> 00:08:59,800
How about 50?

237
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:00,990
Name your price.

238
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,040
- This dump isn't worth that much.
- Free.

239
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:04,110
- We'll pay you.
- Enough.

240
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:05,470
- A waste of time!
- Come back.

241
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:06,630
No one's interested. Now what?

242
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:08,160
All for nothing.

243
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:09,920
Alright. Keep trying tomorrow.

244
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,320
Fine. That boy won't be back anyway.

245
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,630
We have plenty of time.

246
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,470
Not anymore.

247
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:23,110
It's not what it looks like.

248
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,200
We aren't selling your house.

249
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:32,200
It's for rent.

250
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:33,630
When you're away,

251
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,350
it's a waste to leave it empty, right?

252
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:37,710
We can get some rent money.

253
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:41,710
No, wait!

254
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:42,830
Uncle, Aunt,

255
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:44,960
you two are

256
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:46,470
so

257
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:47,990
clever

258
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:49,800
money-wise!

259
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:55,160
Don't mistake it.

260
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,640
- Let's talk it out.
- Yes, right.

261
00:09:56,650 --> 00:09:58,470
Stop! Calm down!

262
00:09:58,470 --> 00:09:59,400
Family, huh?

263
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,320
My house was up for sale as soon as I left.

264
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,230
- No.
- Am I not your family?

265
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:04,320
- You are.
- Of course!

266
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,750
- Will you sell it again?
- No, no!

267
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,400
It's not for sale but for rent.

268
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:08,710
Rent...

269
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:10,350
Alright.

270
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,110
You know what? I'm hungry.

271
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:15,760
You are?

272
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:17,920
I'll go to the kitchen to cook a meal

273
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:19,200
to welcome you back!

274
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:20,560
Yes, I'll go get you drinks.

275
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,440
Good ones!

276
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:24,560
Is that it?

277
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:25,760
What?

278
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,160
Stay out of it. Let's go!

279
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:28,630
- Help me cook!
- I...

280
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:29,630
I can't cook.

281
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:30,710
Let go of me!

282
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:41,990
You've seen enough.

283
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:43,110
Mind your own business.

284
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,510
Go play mahjong.

285
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:49,430
What?

286
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,830
You've reached the Qi Stage?

287
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,470
Did someone of the Spirit Stage help you?

288
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:58,310
No.

289
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,830
I did marrow cleansing

290
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:01,510
with the liquid in my office.

291
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:03,110
- Then I had an herbal bath.
- Liquid?

292
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:04,350
It took a long while.

293
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,400
When I finished,

294
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,430
the Inner City had closed.

295
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:07,710
I couldn't come back.

296
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,040
And, Uncle,

297
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,750
I've been enlightened.

298
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:13,040
That liquid?

299
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,120
Let me smell it.

300
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:19,350
What are you doing?

301
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:21,230
That's not cheap.

302
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,280
Did your office give it to you for free?

303
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:25,430
No.

304
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,630
"Guardian"?

305
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,990
You're a Guardian now?

306
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:39,990
What happened?

307
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,040
Well,

308
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,510
thanks to Grand Princess.

309
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,280
Grand Princess?

310
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,230
I was as clueless as you.

311
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,920
We had met once at the Bureau.

312
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,440
Was it because I let her go first,

313
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:56,200
or because

314
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,960
I'm charming,

315
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,040
irresistible,

316
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,630
and lovable?

317
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:06,080
When you wrote poems at the Academy,

318
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,280
she was also there.

319
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:09,160
She was impressed

320
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:10,960
by them.

321
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,560
You made her remember you

322
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,470
and want to recruit you.

323
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:18,310
What a shame.

324
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,350
She only likes my poems.

325
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:23,710
But be careful.

326
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,000
Ningyan,

327
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,400
be cautious.

328
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,990
Grand Princess is deep.

329
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,200
She studied at the Academy for years.

330
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:33,560
Wei Yuan is

331
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,200
sort of her master.

332
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,590
She's a top Go player.

333
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,160
She recommended you

334
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:41,630
to the Guardians for a reason.

335
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:47,920
Cijiu,

336
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:51,750
you seem to know the powerful well.

337
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,400
All students

338
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:58,080
see Lord Wei and her as role models.

339
00:12:58,470 --> 00:12:59,510
It's natural

340
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:00,710
that I know them.

341
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:03,680
Tell me

342
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,280
what Lord Wei is like.

343
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,440
What are his hobbies?

344
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,470
What food does he like?

345
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,320
When is his birthday?

346
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,230
Does he have any quirks?

347
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,280
Ningyan,

348
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:17,350
don't try to take a shortcut.

349
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:19,830
What's that supposed to mean?

350
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:21,350
I'm catering to his pleasure.

351
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:22,190
Think about it.

352
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,830
If I make Lord Wei happy,

353
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:27,080
the Xu Clan will rise to the top, right?

354
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,750
Or you'll be digging your own grave.

355
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,830
Father, knock some sense into him.

356
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:32,800
Where did he learn to play tricks?

357
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:34,350
Cijiu,

358
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:37,040
he's being thorough.

359
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,280
Tell him everything you know.

360
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:43,350
But, Ningyan,

361
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,560
the Guardian Yamen

362
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,350
isn't like your office.

363
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,640
You must

364
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:51,630
tread carefully there.

365
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,320
Do not annoy the Grand Princess.

366
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,160
I know.

367
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:56,990
How about

368
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:00,440
you recommend me to them, too?

369
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,870
Once I join the Guardians,

370
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:04,230
I'll be able to help you,

371
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:05,070
right?

372
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,280
You also

373
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:08,870
want to be a Guardian?

374
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,630
We can have each other's backs.

375
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:17,080
You'll have to

376
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,560
pass the intelligence test.

377
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:21,350
That's right up my alley!

378
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,280
Uncle,

379
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,160
listen,

380
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,470
there's something

381
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:30,560
in one of my hands.

382
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,750
You may ask us questions.

383
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:34,510
One of us will tell the truth.

384
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:35,920
The other will lie.

385
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:36,760
Begin.

386
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:37,870
What lie?

387
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,110
He's speaking metaphorically.

388
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:41,950
Yes.

389
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:43,470
What metaphor?

390
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:48,920
Let's go back to talk about Lord Wei.

391
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:49,950
Let's go.

392
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:52,920
It hasn't begun!

393
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,160
Where are you going?

394
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:10,540
(Copper Gong Xu Qi'an's Result)

395
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:11,550
Lin'an.

396
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,280
Brother,

397
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:14,710
Huaiqing

398
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,470
walked all over me!

399
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,750
You provoked her first,

400
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:20,800
while she remained lenient.

401
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:21,990
Whatever.

402
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:25,400
Please enjoy.

403
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:27,640
Forget it.

404
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,070
I'm mad. Take them away.

405
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,240
Princess,

406
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:33,710
Crown Prince brought them for you.

407
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,200
Hold on!

408
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,200
It's good.

409
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,400
Better than Imperial Chefs'.

410
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,990
Eat with me, Brother.

411
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,710
Look at you!

412
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,920
You're more like

413
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:07,920
a child than a princess.

414
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:10,760
You know,

415
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,310
Grandmother will turn 80 next year.

416
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:15,510
Father has always been filial.

417
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:16,790
Her birthday is important.

418
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,960
There'll be a general amnesty

419
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,510
and a Poetry Contest at the Taixing Palace

420
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:22,750
to celebrate it.

421
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:24,840
Don't you worry.

422
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:26,960
I've gathered tons of talents

423
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:29,070
for the Poetry Contest.

424
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:31,160
I...

425
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,070
I don't want you to join it.

426
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:38,310
Mother is strict.

427
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,440
She doesn't accept failure.

428
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:41,960
As a princess,

429
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:43,880
you'll be compared

430
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:45,960
with Huaiqing in everything

431
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:49,030
by Mother

432
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:52,440
and everyone else.

433
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:01,070
Your Highness,

434
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,230
did it go well?

435
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,840
Lin'an is spoiled

436
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,310
and acts on impulse.

437
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:10,920
If she insists on joining the Contest,

438
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,070
who knows what trouble she'll cause?

439
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,990
If you talk to her nicely,

440
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:18,680
she'll change her mind.

441
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:22,230
What she did at the Bureau is terrible.

442
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:24,550
One more accident

443
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,440
and we'll be a laughingstock.

444
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:33,590
Gang,

445
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,710
pack things up.

446
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:37,760
Starting tomorrow,

447
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:40,070
we'll be living outside the Palace.

448
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,550
We're living comfortably here.

449
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:45,750
Why move out?

450
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,270
It's for the Poetry Contest.

451
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:50,350
It's easier

452
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,030
to recruit talents outside.

453
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,790
No, Princess.

454
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:57,600
Noble Consort scolded you not long ago.

455
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,920
She won't let you go.

456
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:01,070
Relax.

457
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:02,640
As long as I can help Brother,

458
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,230
she won't blame me.

459
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,750
But

460
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,640
didn't Crown Prince

461
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:10,070
tell you to stay out of the Contest?

462
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,310
He lied.

463
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,030
He only

464
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:20,310
said so to comfort me.

465
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,470
The truth is

466
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:26,030
he hopes I can help him as his sister.

467
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,880
Are you sure?

468
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,710
Of course. We're siblings.

469
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:32,440
I know what's on his mind.

470
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:33,960
Besides,

471
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:35,600
he's done so much for me.

472
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,680
Can't I do something in return?

473
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:39,990
It's settled.

474
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:41,120
Starting tomorrow,

475
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:44,070
we'll recruit as many talents as possible

476
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,990
for the Contest.

477
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:47,630
But

478
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,920
your other siblings

479
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,920
have started since the New Year.

480
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:53,400
At this point,

481
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:56,600
all the good ones must've been taken.

482
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:58,440
Don't worry.

483
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:00,030
We'll see.

484
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,520
Oh,

485
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,160
give out

486
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,400
the Milk Cakes.

487
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:14,060
(Copper Gong Xu Qi'an's Result)

488
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:23,380
(Imperial Pet, Loong)

489
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,040
How long has he

490
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,400
been like that?

491
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:54,590
Don't know.

492
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,070
When I started cooking at dawn,

493
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:57,470
he was already there.

494
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:05,680
Xu Ningyan.

495
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,030
Look. Does this suit fit me?

496
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:13,270
Why do I feel the cuffs are tight?

497
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,510
What are you doing?

498
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:15,920
Aren't you going to eat breakfast?

499
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:17,110
I know it.

500
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,840
Due to my martial arts training lately,

501
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,070
I've become

502
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:21,440
more muscular.

503
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,160
No wonder the pants are tight, too.

504
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:25,990
I was too excited

505
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:27,070
to measure myself yesterday.

506
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,990
I'll go get a new suit.

507
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:31,070
A brand-new suit!

508
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:35,120
Is he insane?

509
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,160
He doesn't look like himself.

510
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,360
A few days ago,

511
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,200
he refused to go to work.

512
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:41,710
Now, he's all worked up.

513
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:42,990
Things have changed.

514
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,200
He's become a Guardian.

515
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,440
Even constables are afraid of him.

516
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,270
They might bribe him in the future.

517
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:50,920
Don't say that.

518
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,470
He'd never take bribes.

519
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:56,030
I think he really wants to help the people.

520
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:58,790
That's why he cherishes this job.

521
00:20:58,790 --> 00:20:59,710
He's back!

522
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:06,920
Take a look.

523
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,120
I think this saber

524
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,070
and my suit

525
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:10,120
don't match.

526
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:12,070
They do.

527
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:14,310
Good.

528
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:17,230
Guardian, Copper Gong Xu Qi'an,

529
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:18,720
is going to work.

530
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,070
Show-off!

531
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,880
I wasn't like him, right?

532
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,160
You were hotter.

533
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:41,830
Let's go!

534
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:50,400
Guardians' Routine: One,

535
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,790
confiscate.

536
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,550
In the Dafeng,

537
00:21:58,550 --> 00:21:59,790
Guardians can arrest

538
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:00,750
any law-breakers

539
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,160
no matter who they are

540
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,070
without a warrant.

541
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,710
Hence the saying,

542
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:06,270
"Do no wrong,

543
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:07,640
and fear no Guardians."

544
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:11,600
Guardians' Routine: Two,

545
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:12,680
interrogate.

546
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,510
Guardians use tactics

547
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:15,710
to investigate cases,

548
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:16,920
gather evidence,

549
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,120
and make arrests.

550
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:19,120
We have the right

551
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,400
to interrogate arrested officials.

552
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:23,510
Others can't interfere.

553
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,510
One more rule.

554
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:32,200
No one can visit prisoners

555
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,400
without Mr. Nangong's permission.

556
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,360
One more pot.

557
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,440
Guardians' Routine: Three,

558
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:39,750
watch officials

559
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:40,840
and gather intel.

560
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,440
In the Dafeng,

561
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,310
anyone can be

562
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:45,070
the Guardians' eyes and ears

563
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:46,680
and help.

564
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,790
(Virtue)
Tianji Tower is off-limits.

565
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,600
It gathers intel from everywhere.

566
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,790
No one can go near it

567
00:22:57,790 --> 00:22:59,120
except the Guardians.

568
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:02,750
We can investigate

569
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:04,440
every ministry in the state.

570
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:07,260
(Rites, Gui Zi)

571
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:12,310
The best intel network is here!

572
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:14,440
It's constantly collecting, analyzing,

573
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,990
and summarizing intel.

574
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:23,270
All those,

575
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,550
plus handling cases

576
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,160
and patrols,

577
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,600
are the Guardian's Routine.

578
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:28,590
Xu Qi'an,

579
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:30,030
are you ready?

580
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:30,990
Yes, sir.

581
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,470
I'm born ready!

582
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:33,550
So,

583
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,990
are we going to confiscate,

584
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:35,960
interrogate,

585
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,680
or deliver intel?

586
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:56,630
Song...

587
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,510
You're new here.

588
00:23:58,510 --> 00:24:00,750
Sort all these old files.

589
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,520
But

590
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,470
what about the Routine?

591
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,120
This is part of it.

592
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:08,960
Guardians' Routine: Four,

593
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:10,920
sort files.

594
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:17,540
(Sort Files)

595
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:20,110
Song,

596
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,680
I'm not done yet!

597
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,550
It's locked!

598
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,200
Song!

599
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:27,840
Guys! Wait!

600
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,750
Come on. Let's talk.

601
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:31,310
I just came. Don't lock me here.

602
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:32,510
Don't do this to me.

603
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:33,640
No negotiation.

604
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:34,840
It's Chief's order.

605
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,230
Let him sort files.

606
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:37,470
He can't go anywhere.

607
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:39,360
Chief, I think

608
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,470
it's a bit mean.

609
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:44,270
What's wrong?

610
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,960
He doesn't belong to us!

611
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:47,640
He can quit anytime.

612
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,120
I understand.

613
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:51,920
I get it.

614
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,200
Chief mistook it.

615
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:55,600
Wait. Let me out. I'll explain it to him.

616
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,990
You mistook it, not him.

617
00:24:57,990 --> 00:24:58,840
He doesn't like you.

618
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:01,710
Trust me. I can explain...

619
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:02,880
Watch your fingers,

620
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,200
arms, and elbows.

621
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:07,990
Guards!

622
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:10,160
Seal all the windows!

623
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:17,680
So not worth it.

624
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:32,940
(Three Days Later)

625
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:38,150
Father,

626
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,550
it's late. Why hasn't Ningyan come back?

627
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:43,200
I'll go to his office to check later.

628
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,920
They can't wear him out like this.

629
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:46,510
He's not a child.

630
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:49,070
He has to be toughened.

631
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,400
Don't worry too much.

632
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,270
He's fine.

633
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,680
Your words sound familiar.

634
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,120
Did you say them earlier?

635
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,070
He's back!

636
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:05,510
What did I tell you?

637
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:07,570
Ningyan.

638
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:09,070
Does

639
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:10,440
Xu Qi'an live here?

640
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,840
Yes, that's right.

641
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:13,160
By Chief's order,

642
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,070
send Xu Qi'an and...

643
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:15,070
Files, right?

644
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:16,550
That way.

645
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:20,470
- Come in.
- Come on in.

646
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,600
Go, go, go.

647
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,960
It's already late.

648
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:25,230
- Here.
- Turn over there.

649
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:26,880
- Hurry up!
- Have some water.

650
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:29,030
- Thanks.
- This way.

651
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:30,360
I'll serve you tea.

652
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,880
- It's late.
- There's something else.

653
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:34,550
Close it!

654
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:35,600
Careful.

655
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:37,600
Almost forgot this.

656
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:40,200
Our doors and windows have been nailed.

657
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,120
But lately,

658
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:42,550
he's become more skilled.

659
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,440
Take a look.

660
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:45,230
Feel free to nail any of them again.

661
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:46,510
Go ahead.

662
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,120
Are you really his uncle?

663
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,310
Yes, by blood!

664
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:52,600
Of course.

665
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,750
You should do it. It's your house after all.

666
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:55,590
Fine.

667
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,520
I'll go.

668
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,230
You can do it if you want.

669
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:03,590
No, thanks.

670
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:04,800
Fine.

671
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,440
I'll do it.

672
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:14,800
Xu Qi'an,

673
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:16,550
your family is...

674
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:18,400
- great!
- Great!

675
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:24,510
So not worth it.

676
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:26,860
(Lake Villa)

677
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,720
What?

678
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:30,840
The 10th Prince is gathering talents, too?

679
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:35,200
He's only nine.

680
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:40,070
What about the...

681
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:41,120
Directorate of Education?

682
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,400
Too late.

683
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,070
The 7th Prince has

684
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:46,600
recruited their talents.

685
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,160
Those of the Zhiya School

686
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,550
have gone to the 4th Prince.

687
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:52,120
On my way to the Mingde School,

688
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:54,070
I saw the 8th Prince's eunuch

689
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,710
recruiting talents, too.

690
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,230
What to do?

691
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:02,720
Yunlu Academy!

692
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,710
Steal their students from Huaiqing!

693
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:07,550
I've tried.

694
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,790
They rejected you?

695
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,600
They said yes.

696
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,640
Where are they?

697
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:14,750
I didn't bring them over

698
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,120
after reading their poems.

699
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:23,840
Right.

700
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,270
They're good at

701
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:27,840
military tactics,

702
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,750
not poems.

703
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:31,510
I know, right?

704
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:32,880
They have so many students,

705
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,600
but none of them can write poems.

706
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,550
The one about seeing a friend off

707
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:39,440
at the Mianyang Pavilion

708
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,160
was taken from a constable.

709
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,880
Really?

710
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,750
Take a look.

711
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:54,680
(Yang Ling)
"Shadows slant across shallow water.

712
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,120
Faint scent floats

713
00:28:57,470 --> 00:28:59,160
in dim moonlight."

714
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:01,640
What do you think?

715
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:06,550
It...

716
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,600
It seems...

717
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:14,030
It came

718
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:16,880
from the Imperial Office of Music.

719
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:18,270
This unfinished masterpiece

720
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,440
has shaken the poetry circles.

721
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:22,200
Really?

722
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:23,750
I also heard

723
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:26,600
the 4th, 7th, 8th, and 10th Princes' men

724
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,030
waited for days

725
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:29,200
outside that place

726
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,600
to look for that poet

727
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,440
in order to

728
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:33,440
recruit him.

729
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,640
What a poem!

730
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:36,390
I want him.

731
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:37,880
Find that poet

732
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,600
at all costs.

733
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:41,870
Yes.

734
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,120
Go now.

735
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:43,960
Sure.

736
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,550
"Yang Ling"?

737
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:51,180
(Unreasonable)

738
00:29:56,990 --> 00:29:57,880
All done?

739
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,510
What are these?

740
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:05,470
They're

741
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:06,680
stickers.

742
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:08,920
I've put everything suspicious

743
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,120
and my thoughts of the cases

744
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,750
all on the stickers.

745
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:12,870
(Guardian)
That way,

746
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:16,200
(Zhaoyan)
the files remain clean,

747
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:18,550
and it's easier for you

748
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:19,710
to look for information.

749
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,230
Clever.

750
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,520
Song,

751
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,680
I've sorted all the files

752
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:29,310
and read the rules over and over.

753
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:30,640
Can we

754
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,510
start doing some real work?

755
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,240
Sure, sure.

756
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:38,350
Guangxiao,

757
00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:39,990
is there work to do?

758
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,310
Yes.

759
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,510
- Of course.
- My man!

760
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:46,800
My man!

761
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:53,630
You tricked me!

762
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:55,550
Don't put it like that.

763
00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:56,880
My man.

764
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:00,840
What are those?

765
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,520
Serve them.

766
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:11,790
Round 2.

767
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:12,880
Round 3.

768
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:13,920
Round 4.

769
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:15,590
One after another.

770
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,200
Watch your step, guys.

771
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,440
Guys,

772
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,480
thanks.

773
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:26,920
Close the door

774
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,550
tightly.

775
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:29,880
Leave no cracks.

776
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,310
Got it.

777
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:33,310
Look,

778
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,360
these files might not

779
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,680
be confidential,

780
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,120
but keep them safe.

781
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,710
If they're leaked or damaged,

782
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,030
you'll be held accountable.

783
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:42,800
I...

784
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,040
Song!

785
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,040
Song!

786
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:49,070
Song!

787
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,790
Please talk to Chief for me.

788
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:58,120
Or at least ask him

789
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:00,880
when I can stop sorting those files.

790
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:03,790
I can't help you with that.

791
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:04,840
Let go of my leg.

792
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,990
No, unless you help me!

793
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:09,310
I'm getting depressed in this locked room!

794
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,640
Do you know this serious disease,

795
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:12,710
myopic eye?

796
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:14,470
I've become nearsighted.

797
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:16,920
So will I if you don't let me go!

798
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,270
- Let go!
- Help me, please!

799
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:19,380
Song!

800
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:21,270
Aren't we good, Song?

801
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,400
Please. Do me a favor.

802
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,510
Have some mercy.

803
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:25,360
I won't let you go!

804
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,470
I want real work!

805
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:28,030
- Xu Qi'an!
- Take me to work with you!

806
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:28,920
I'll fight back!

807
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:29,960
I want to work!

808
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,030
Watch your behind!

809
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:32,190
Stairs!

810
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:33,030
Copper Gong Song.

811
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:35,550
Silver Gong Li asked for you.

812
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:38,760
See? Chief asked for me!

813
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:40,470
Go back.

814
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:42,070
Go on sorting the files.

815
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:43,110
Chief asked to

816
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:44,190
see him, too.

817
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:49,510
A demon has been spotted in Mount Dahuang.

818
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:50,720
Many have been eaten.

819
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:52,880
Go to Taikang County to check.

820
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:55,320
If it's low-ranking,

821
00:32:55,670 --> 00:32:57,030
kill it there.

822
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,400
The Municipal Office will join you.

823
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,510
Their people are right outside.

824
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:03,600
Yes, sir.

825
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:06,880
Xu Qi'an.

826
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:08,880
Go with them.

827
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:14,310
Yes, sir!

828
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,760
That mountain is steep.

829
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:19,470
You must work as a team.

830
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:20,310
Yes.

831
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:22,640
Also...

832
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:39,760
Saber, up by two inches.

833
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,150
Gong, one inch to the left.

834
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:45,950
Go now.

835
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,760
They asked for him by name.

836
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:58,470
What exactly is his background?

837
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:01,470
Xu Qi'an,

838
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:03,150
what's your background?

839
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:04,840
Why did Chief change his attitude to you?

840
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:05,910
Not sure.

841
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,240
Was it because I worked hard

842
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:09,360
on those files?

843
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:10,390
No way.

844
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:12,070
Everyone knows he's stubborn.

845
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:13,240
He'd never

846
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:14,280
change his mind easily.

847
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:15,550
I know it.

848
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:17,670
He's putting you in harm's way.

849
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:19,590
Right!

850
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,670
Last year, that guy, what was his name again?

851
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:22,760
He died in a task.

852
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,550
(Guardian)
You're so mean.

853
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:26,880
Say something, Guangxiao!

854
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,150
Help me finish my story.

855
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:29,630
Greetings, Guardians.

856
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:34,440
Guardians always travel by horse.

857
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,720
A carriage is unnecessary.

858
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:36,590
To catch the demon,

859
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:38,630
Mr. Chen asked the Astronomical Bureau

860
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:39,720
to assist us

861
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:40,720
with this case.

862
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,150
The Bureau?

863
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,240
Yes.

864
00:34:46,990 --> 00:34:49,320
Guardian, Copper Gong Song Tingfeng,

865
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:52,110
greets those of the Bureau!

866
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:54,110
I've long heard

867
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:56,240
of your ethereal bearing.

868
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:58,960
Working with you is...

869
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,550
Stop dragging your feet.

870
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:02,030
Let's go!

871
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:05,030
Xu Qi'an,

872
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:06,470
stop dragging your feet! Let's go!

873
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:09,030
Yes.

874
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,190
Xu Qi'an.

875
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,070
Caiwei?

876
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,360
It really is you!

877
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:21,350
Forget that.

878
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,360
Take the carriage.

879
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:23,390
Sure.

880
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:26,350
Eat this.

881
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,120
Thanks.

882
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:30,510
- He's in!
- I know!

883
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,960
What's going on?

884
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:46,400
So Chief chose me

885
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,400
for this task because of you.

886
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,400
Not exactly.

887
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:52,320
Yang Yan told me

888
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,030
you joined the Guardians.

889
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:55,920
It's better to bring you along

890
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:57,280
to work with them.

891
00:35:57,590 --> 00:35:58,840
Gold Gong Yang?

892
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:01,280
I'm curious.

893
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:03,280
Why did you join the Guardians?

894
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:06,880
How did he know those of the Bureau?

895
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,200
Are you scared?

896
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,800
What? No.

897
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:11,880
He's well-connected.

898
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:14,510
You made him suffer. Aren't you afraid?

899
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:15,590
Not just me.

900
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:16,590
Weren't you there, too?

901
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:17,590
I treated him to dinner.

902
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:20,470
Let's talk about you.

903
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,400
The Tax Silver Case is over.

904
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,240
Why are you still with the Municipal Office?

905
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,240
Don't get me started!

906
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,360
Chen Hanguang

907
00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:31,920
let me take all the credit for that case,

908
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:34,280
saying I found Zhou's embezzlement.

909
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,240
Wasn't it good?

910
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:36,280
Not at all!

911
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:37,800
His Majesty said

912
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,150
I was born to solve cases

913
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:41,550
and had me follow up on the Tax Silver Case

914
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:42,670
until the silver

915
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,320
was fully recovered.

916
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,150
I'm mad!

917
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:50,110
Who asked you to stop?

918
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:51,390
Go!

919
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,470
What's their relationship?

920
00:36:55,990 --> 00:36:58,110
They share a carriage. You tell me.

921
00:36:58,110 --> 00:37:01,510
So have we with Gold Gongs Yang and Nangong.

922
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,920
You're good, Xu Qi'an!

923
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,200
You're doomed.

924
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,280
Xu Qi'an,

925
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:09,360
you are good.

926
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:20,550
This is beneath you, Mr. Xu!

927
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:21,390
I'll do it.

928
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:24,110
Sorry, I'm late.

929
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,240
So,

930
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:28,030
you must be hungry.

931
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:28,990
No, I'm not.

932
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,550
Yes, you are.

933
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,280
Take this.

934
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:33,310
Take it.

935
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,240
Song,

936
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:37,510
what's...?

937
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:40,670
I borrowed some money from you earlier.

938
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:41,960
Now, I'm no longer strapped.

939
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,400
I should pay you back.

940
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,400
When did I lend you money?

941
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:46,840
Think about it.

942
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,320
Oh, that day!

943
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:53,920
You remember it.

944
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,070
I sort files indoors.

945
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:57,440
There's nowhere I can spend it.

946
00:37:57,670 --> 00:37:59,280
Feel free to go shopping.

947
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,120
I'll do your work.

948
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,280
It's a lot.

949
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:03,800
Can you handle the files?

950
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,990
Of course. I'll tell Chief myself.

951
00:38:05,990 --> 00:38:06,830
Alright?

952
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:08,030
You'll help me?

953
00:38:08,110 --> 00:38:10,400
Yes. Your business is also mine.

954
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,400
Consider it done.

955
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:15,840
Where are you?

956
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,110
Answer me.

957
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:18,280
What's up?

958
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:19,870
Nothing.

959
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:22,760
Use this to buy drinks for the guys.

960
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:23,990
Thanks.

961
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,150
Mount Dahuang in northern Taikang

962
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:27,610
is over 1,000m high at the main peak.

963
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,400
It spreads over 10 kilometers.

964
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:31,150
It's rich in limestone,

965
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:33,280
supporting hundreds of families of miners.

966
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,760
Since the New Year,

967
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:37,190
a demon has been spotted in the waters there.

968
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:39,360
It goes ashore to eat humans.

969
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,550
Many miners have been killed.

970
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:42,630
The County Governor

971
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:43,800
kept that demon secret,

972
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,590
while they worked in the mountain as usual,

973
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:46,880
causing their tragic deaths.

974
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,670
Later, some merchants reported it

975
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:50,510
when they passed by this area.

976
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:54,240
Was this where miners dug limestone?

977
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,200
Yes.

978
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,150
Mount Dahuang owns fine limestone

979
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:58,320
and plenty of iron ore

980
00:38:58,550 --> 00:39:00,400
to forge mining tools.

981
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:01,670
It's easier for miners

982
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:02,630
to build kilns here.

983
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,760
Digging limestone is low-cost

984
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,670
and highly profitable.

985
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:07,720
That's why the tax

986
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:08,840
is set a bit higher.

987
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:09,990
The ban on mining

988
00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:11,400
left the locals no hope.

989
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:13,070
(High taxes make)

990
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,670
(people homeless.)

991
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,110
(Flesh and blood)

992
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:17,550
(of the people are exploited.)

993
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:22,070
It's odd.

994
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:26,030
What have you found?

995
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,880
Nothing. That's why it's odd.

996
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:30,880
I looked around on the way up here.

997
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:32,760
At first, I thought the layers of peaks

998
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:33,880
blocked my view.

999
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:36,190
But look at this place.

1000
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:37,840
Traces of fights are everywhere,

1001
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,400
but I sense no energy of the demon.

1002
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,240
Sir,

1003
00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:43,670
there's more in the cave.

1004
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:44,630
Let's go inside to look.

1005
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:46,310
Come on.

1006
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,590
He's bold.

1007
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:04,600
Be careful.

1008
00:40:29,370 --> 00:40:30,210
Be careful.

1009
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:33,030
Why dig such a deep cave?

1010
00:40:33,570 --> 00:40:35,030
We've been going for minutes

1011
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,120
but haven't reached the end.

1012
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:40,670
Maybe this is part of something.

1013
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:42,950
Be careful.

1014
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:51,360
