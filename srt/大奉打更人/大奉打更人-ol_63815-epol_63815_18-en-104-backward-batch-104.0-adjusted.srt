00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:03,200
Unlock it.

42
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:19,950
He's dead.

43
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:26,640
What?

44
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:27,870
He died?

45
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:31,360
The Governor of Taikang was
involved in the Sangbo Case.

46
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:32,710
I was one step too late when I

47
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,150
went to question him earlier.

48
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:34,990
He had been killed.

49
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:38,550
Lord Wei said he was important.

50
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:40,850
What's the cause of death?

51
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,040
It's unknown yet.

52
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:43,800
The coroner is doing an autopsy.

53
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:50,390
The prime suspect in the case
died in our prison,

54
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:52,800
but I have nothing to do with his death.

55
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:54,430
Sir,

56
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,960
our office will assist you with the case.

57
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,360
You can command

58
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,920
the Three Branches and Six Boards.

59
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,760
The Governor of Taikang's death in jail

60
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,600
is an accident.

61
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:05,800
It's not your fault.

62
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,320
Thank you, sir.

63
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:11,240
You're welcome.

64
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:13,110
Caiwei said yesterday,

65
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:14,240
you also did me a huge favor

66
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,960
in the Ministry of Justice.

67
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,150
That was nothing.

68
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:22,550
So is this now.

69
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:26,270
Alright then.

70
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:27,670
I shall

71
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,870
take my leave.

72
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:31,240
Thank you for coming.

73
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,480
Sorry for troubling you.

74
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,320
I'll walk you out.

75
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:40,860
(Noble Character)

76
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:45,080
Thanks for coming all the way here.

77
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,360
No need.

78
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:48,040
I barely did anything.

79
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,550
So, the poems...

80
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:58,430
You'll receive them as promised.

81
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,110
When you cast the Heart Spell,

82
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:02,360
I saw you burn a page.

83
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,320
Forgive my ignorance.

84
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,240
I've never seen such a divine spell before.

85
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,430
How does it work?

86
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:12,150
Our academy made this spell book.

87
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:16,080
It records the spells unique to the Academy.

88
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:17,710
It's a rarity.

89
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:19,480
Burn it

90
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,670
and you can use

91
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:24,830
the spell on each page.

92
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,430
I see.

93
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,270
I didn't know there was such a thing.

94
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:30,880
I'm sorry,

95
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:34,200
but I can't give you the poems anytime soon.

96
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,320
I have a case to solve,

97
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,710
and my rank is low.

98
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,270
I'm afraid I can't write poems

99
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:41,910
for a long while.

100
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,910
How about I make you a spell book

101
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:51,750
to help you

102
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,320
improve your skills?

103
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,680
That'd be perfect.

104
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,160
And

105
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,470
the poems?

106
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:02,960
No problem.

107
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:03,990
Of course.

108
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:10,830
Take care, Master.

109
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:18,870
Chief.

110
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,030
I heard the Governor of Taikang died in jail.

111
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,230
What did Chen Hanguang say?

112
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,090
Read the autopsy report.

113
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,440
No trauma or poison.

114
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,270
He died quietly and mysteriously.

115
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:32,150
Caiwei questioned those
guarding the jail at night.

116
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:33,270
All of them are clean.

117
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:34,710
It further confirmed

118
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,230
that the Governor did die

119
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,440
in his sleep that night.

120
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,680
He was killed in sleep.

121
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,720
What's on your mind?

122
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,390
I heard the Yin Spirit

123
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:44,350
of the Three Sects could do that.

124
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:45,750
The Three Sects?

125
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:47,560
(If they did it,)

126
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,760
(Mr. Jinlian would've been tipped off.)

127
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,520
Or

128
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:56,030
only that race could do so.

129
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,830
Wizards.

130
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:08,270
Wizards?

131
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:09,310
Follow me.

132
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:15,000
Do you know The Witcher's Sect?

133
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:16,560
Uncle Pingzhi told me about it,

134
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,710
saying The Witcher was beyond all ranks.

135
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:20,030
Did he

136
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:21,440
build this sect?

137
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:24,960
The Witcher is worshiped
by all the northern states.

138
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,470
His sect holds supreme power in the North,

139
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:30,390
just like the Tianyu Sect in the West.

140
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,120
15 years ago,

141
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:37,000
scuffles broke out
between General Zhenxi and that sect.

142
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,910
2,000 elite troops

143
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,910
died quietly in the barracks overnight.

144
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:45,390
No wounds were found on them.

145
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:48,000
They all died in their sleep,

146
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,270
including General Zhenxi.

147
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:53,470
Since then,

148
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:56,590
Yunzhou has become no-man's land.

149
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,590
Bandits are everywhere.

150
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,270
Disasters never end.

151
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:04,390
According to the information from our scouts,

152
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:07,120
it's likely to have become

153
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,120
that sect's stronghold in the Dafeng.

154
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,910
If Yunzhou is also involved in this case,

155
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:21,830
the situation will be more complicated.

156
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:26,440
I have a feeling.

157
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,120
The end of the Gengzi Year

158
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:31,080
will be the start of chaos!

159
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,270
Alright. That's enough.

160
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:34,450
You're making me confused.

161
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:35,470
Our job is to solve cases.

162
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:36,590
Don't be so dramatic.

163
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:44,520
Where are you going, Ningyan?

164
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:45,710
Seize Zhou Chixiong.

165
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:55,220
(Yunzhou, Command Office)

166
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,230
Yang Gong is in town.

167
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:06,270
I see.

168
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:07,910
What to do?

169
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:09,910
(Yang Chuannan, Commander of Yunzhou)

170
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:11,440
What do you mean?

171
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:13,260
(Li Miaozhen)
You know that.

172
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:14,260
(No. 2 of Realm Sect)

173
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:16,230
(4th Rank of Heaven)
He'll take away your power.

174
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,760
The rule is the rule.

175
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:24,030
I'll follow it.

176
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:27,390
Can't you see

177
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:31,200
the Emperor appointed him
Commissioner of Qingzhou

178
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:33,960
in case you take all power into your hands?

179
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:35,750
Qingzhou and Yunzhou are governed together.

180
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,590
The Commissioner of Qingzhou
manages Yunzhou, too.

181
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:40,440
Yang Gong,

182
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:41,440
well, I heard he was

183
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:43,590
from the Yunlu Academy.

184
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:46,120
He took his student's poem before leaving.

185
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,470
I bet he's also of the greedy sort,

186
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:49,920
coming here for merits and power.

187
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,800
The Dafeng is

188
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:56,830
full of such pests.

189
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:00,320
What's your plan then?

190
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,870
Just say the word.

191
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:06,320
I'll finish him.

192
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,080
We can't act rashly.

193
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:17,560
I'm sick of your cowardice!

194
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,920
Emperor Yuanjing should die!

195
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:20,960
Miaozhen!

196
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:22,430
What's wrong?

197
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:23,990
I'm not his official.

198
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:30,870
Miss Winged Woman,

199
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:34,880
your actions

200
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,280
of suppressing bandits

201
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:40,440
and exterminating evil

202
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,080
have made Yunzhou safe.

203
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:46,630
I thank you on behalf of the locals.

204
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:49,590
However,

205
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,750
rules are rules.

206
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,470
I'm a court official after all.

207
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:57,070
I shall

208
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:58,990
abide by them.

209
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:02,960
Where are you going?

210
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,040
This room reeks of bureaucracy.

211
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,200
I need fresh air.

212
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:14,420
(Just and Stern)

213
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,400
- General Li.
- Yes?

214
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:20,920
Another chief is rising

215
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,990
in the 80-li Bandits' Lair.

216
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,470
They're looting and robbing

217
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:24,440
even more rampantly.

218
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,870
Keep gathering information.

219
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:26,800
Once the time's ripe,

220
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,040
gather our troops to wipe them out.

221
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:29,880
Yes!

222
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:30,730
- Go.
- Let's go.

223
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:34,710
You're out so soon, Master.

224
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:40,700
(Su Su, Heaven Sect)

225
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:45,190
I'm mad.

226
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,400
Look at you

227
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,680
coughing again.

228
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,280
This is a mountainous area.

229
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,200
Don't catch a cold.

230
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:59,340
(Cold Medicine)

231
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:01,470
I know.

232
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,400
Are you mad at Yang Chuannan again?

233
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:07,800
Court officials are too cautious.

234
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,830
You only serve under him as a Calvary General

235
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,440
for your friendship.

236
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,590
If he makes you mad,

237
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:15,160
just quit.

238
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,320
But in all of Yunzhou,

239
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:19,560
he's the only official who supports us

240
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,590
to exterminate bandits.

241
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,350
It's all that stupid emperor's fault.

242
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:29,310
Guys,

243
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:31,110
more bad news from the capital.

244
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,960
(No. 2)
What happened?

245
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,040
Did Emperor Yuanjing die?

246
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,870
When the Inner and Outer Cities

247
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,200
were put on lockdown,

248
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,040
I knew something bad happened.

249
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,120
No. 1,

250
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:43,680
did you hear anything?

251
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:45,590
(Interesting.)

252
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,630
(Mr. Jinlian)

253
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,990
(isn't asking me, a Guardian,)

254
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,960
(but asking No. 1 instead.)

255
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:53,590
The explosion at Sangbo

256
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:55,830
destroyed the Ancestral Temple.

257
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:58,200
The thing sealed in the lake

258
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,740
(No. 1)
is missing.

259
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:00,590
No. 3,

260
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:01,960
do you know anything?

261
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:02,920
I do.

262
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,440
The Academy got some leads

263
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,200
via their private channels,

264
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,560
enough to put together the situation.

265
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,700
(No. 7, No. 8, No. 9, No. 1, No. 3)

266
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:14,620
(No. 6, No. 7, No. 8, No. 1)

267
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:17,660
(No. 1, No. 2, No. 3, No. 5)

268
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:18,710
Kui did it?

269
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:20,040
No way.

270
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:23,230
How did they blow up that place?

271
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:24,750
Investigation shows

272
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,510
Kui got Yanxiao from Mount Dahuang,

273
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:29,920
turned it into gunpowder,

274
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,280
and smuggled it into the Inner City
with Zhou Chixiong's help

275
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:34,630
to explode Sangbo.

276
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:35,920
After the explosion,

277
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:37,870
Zhou fled with his family.

278
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:39,830
(No. 1)
So that's a dead end.

279
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:40,920
Not exactly.

280
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,110
I believe

281
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:44,350
the court will make him a wanted man soon.

282
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,040
Either he'll leave the Dafeng,

283
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,800
or he'll hide in a safe place.

284
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:51,230
Where do you think he'll go?

285
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:52,400
Obviously,

286
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,830
he'll go to Yunzhou.

287
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,000
No. 2,

288
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,040
(No. 1)
you're well-connected there.

289
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,160
Can you help me find Zhou Chixiong?

290
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,630
(Nice!)

291
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:02,830
(Looks like No. 1 trusts No. 2)

292
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:05,990
(more than the government.)

293
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,280
I won't.

294
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:08,750
I'll pay you.

295
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:09,830
No.

296
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,350
You serve the court.

297
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:14,510
I will not help you.

298
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:17,140
(No. 1)

299
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:20,400
(This is bad.)

300
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,920
(Without No. 2's help)

301
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:24,400
(how can we)

302
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,680
(find Zhou Chixiong in the vast Yunzhou?)

303
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:30,190
No. 2,

304
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,630
you owe me for helping No. 6 out.

305
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:33,590
Does your promise stand?

306
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:34,680
Of course.

307
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,400
I, Li Miaozhen, is a woman of my word.

308
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,240
Fine.

309
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,280
Keep an eye on Zhou if he's in Yunzhou.

310
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:41,040
Then we're even.

311
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:42,280
As for No. 1,

312
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,160
(No. 1)
you owe me now.

313
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,510
What do you say?

314
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:47,470
Deal.

315
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:48,430
(No. 1)
Deal.

316
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:52,460
(Haoqi Tower)

317
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:56,540
(Rule With Virtue)

318
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:59,500
(The Witcher's Sect...)

319
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:04,620
(General Zhenxi died in his sleep, too.)

320
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,920
Lord Wei, Xu Qi'an is here.

321
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,560
Greetings, Lord Wei.

322
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:26,350
Yesterday morning, in court,

323
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,630
I caught sight of the progress you made.

324
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:33,960
You're doing well in the case.

325
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,750
You're too busy to be disturbed.

326
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,200
I didn't want to trouble you.

327
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,820
Zhou Chixiong is wanted by the court now.

328
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:48,990
(Insignia Guard, Baihu)

329
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:49,830
(Zhou Chixiong)
But

330
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,470
it's hard to find him in 15 days.

331
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,400
Do you have other ideas?

332
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,750
I believe

333
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,560
he's likely to flee to Yunzhou,

334
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,400
so

335
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:06,080
I've asked No. 2 there to seize him.

336
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:07,510
Yunzhou?

337
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,470
It's worth trying.

338
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,440
But the water there is deeper than you think.

339
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,630
It takes time to find him.

340
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,510
You have a point, sir.

341
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:24,080
Have you considered tracking down

342
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:27,230
his weapon?

343
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:28,710
His weapon?

344
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:32,320
His energy was concealed.

345
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,800
Even those of the Bureau didn't sense it.

346
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,160
That means two things.

347
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:38,710
First,

348
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:41,470
the one who cast the spell is high-ranking.

349
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,040
Second,

350
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:45,080
Zhou must have

351
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:47,470
an energy-concealing weapon.

352
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:58,400
Check his household registration.

353
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:01,040
He's merely 8th Rank.

354
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:09,830

♪Neither joy nor sorrow lingers♪

376
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:16,700
♪Flowers fall; their fragrance fades♪

377
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:22,190
♪I pledge my life to you♪

378
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,120
Father, the carriage is outside.

379
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:26,990
I'm going to the Palace.

380
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,240
Xu Qi'an,

381
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:32,440
come along?

382
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,270
Leave the court

383
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:00,600
for the outside world?

384
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:01,760
Yes.

385
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,160
You don't belong to the court

386
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,470
but to the outside world.

387
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,360
Hadn't it been for the Sangbo Case,

388
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:13,960
you would've

389
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:16,680
left the capital by now as I planned.

390
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,030
If you fail to solve this case,

391
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:21,720
you

392
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,400
can be the Guardians' informer

393
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:27,400
and my weapon

394
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:30,600
in the shadow.

395
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:32,310
How about that?

396
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,990
Do you find it unfair?

397
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,030
As long as I can live on,

398
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:40,440
I'll be a slave,

399
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:41,960
not to mention a weapon.

400
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:46,400
Being in the shadow is tough.

401
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:50,840
Informers have to hide their identities

402
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:53,030
and leave their families.

403
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:55,680
Even if

404
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:57,990
they die,

405
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,680
no one will know.

406
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:08,440
I don't want to leave yet.

407
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:10,640
I'll do my utmost

408
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:11,840
to find out the truth.

409
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:18,470
You're

410
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:20,990
sophisticated yet upright.

411
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,640
You can be stubborn sometimes.

412
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:27,990
I like and dislike

413
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:30,070
all those sides of yours.

414
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,400
I know

415
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:39,510
the Guardian Yamen has

416
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,600
long-standing issues.

417
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,710
I'm well aware of that.

418
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:46,440
But this is human nature,

419
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,880
partly bright, partly dark.

420
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:52,750
How many people are like Li Yuchun?

421
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,880
Were all the Guardians

422
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,440
like him,

423
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,790
how could we hold court officials down?

424
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:03,750
I understand that.

425
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:05,880
But when I see

426
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,160
what's unjust,

427
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:08,710
I can't turn a blind eye to it.

428
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,640
Long-standing issues

429
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:14,640
can't be solved overnight.

430
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:18,680
In the world of politics,

431
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,960
you must tread carefully.

432
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:23,160
Remember,

433
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:26,920
clear water has few fish.

434
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,600
Haste makes waste.

435
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,470
It's better

436
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,960
to take one step at a time

437
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,030
to divide

438
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:37,400
and conquer.

439
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,600
I understand.

440
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:48,060
(Palace of the Dafeng)

441
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,840
Greetings, Lord Wei.

442
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,120
Greetings.

443
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,880
This is

444
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,400
the handler of the Sangbo Case, Xu Qi'an.

445
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:58,790
I have to trouble you

446
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:01,070
to take him to greet the Grand Princess.

447
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:02,790
No trouble at all.

448
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:05,200
Grand Princess?

449
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:09,200
The Imperial Library in the Palace

450
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:11,640
keeps records of various weapons.

451
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,360
Grand Princess can

452
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,120
grant you access to them.

453
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:16,590
Yes.

454
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:20,680
The contest is today.

455
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,270
Did you sleep well last night, Princess?

456
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:23,310
I slept soundly.

457
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:26,230
When we came to the lake before,

458
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:28,440
the Loong would surface to play with us.

459
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,640
Where is it now?

460
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,360
I've been watching the lake for a while.

461
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,440
It's been utterly quiet.

462
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,680
You probably don't know.

463
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,160
Since the Sangbo Ceremony,

464
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:38,030
the Loong has been uneasy.

465
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:38,990
That day,

466
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:40,600
it surfaced and roared

467
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,200
and then dived into the water.

468
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,880
However hard Father tried,

469
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:44,840
it refused to resurface

470
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,550
or go anywhere near royalty again.

471
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:48,120
Without the Loong,

472
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:50,790
why hold the contest here?

473
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:52,200
It's far from my place.

474
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,360
What a bummer!

475
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:54,960
Have you memorized them all?

476
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:56,110
Don't worry.

477
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,200
I've memorized the poems

478
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,710
and the stories behind them.

479
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:02,990
I can't wait to shine at the contest

480
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,400
and bring Huaiqing down...

481
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:19,550
Greetings, Princes.

482
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,240
Your Highness.

483
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,640
The Poetry Contest is coming.

484
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,880
We're having a rehearsal today.

485
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,310
Thanks for coming from the Directorate
of Education to host it.

486
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,280
It's my honor.

487
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,440
My pleasure.

488
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:37,230
I'm eager to see the elegant Dafeng royalty.

489
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,360
So

490
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:43,310
you're Princess Huaiqing's private eunuch.

491
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:44,750
Why have I never seen you before?

492
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,510
I've always been in the Palace,

493
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:49,120
and I seldom go out.

494
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:50,150
Well,

495
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,510
I manage the affairs for Her Highness

496
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:54,710
in the Palace.

497
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:55,550
Forgive me

498
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:57,600
if I overstep the line

499
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,960
by asking you this.

500
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:02,960
Aren't you Princess Lin'an's kept...?

501
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,520
What?

502
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,200
I mean

503
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,750
as Princess Lin'an's trusted man,

504
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:16,640
you remain

505
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,270
close to Princess Huaiqing.

506
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,240
What if

507
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:23,070
Princess Lin'an finds out?

508
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:24,840
So what if she knows?

509
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:28,710
Ningyan,

510
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,120
you really are bold.

511
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:35,600
But how are you going to explain to her?

512
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:36,790
Explain what?

513
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:38,160
Come on!

514
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:39,790
Why should I explain to her?

515
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,270
I knew she meant to recruit me,

516
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:45,200
but I'm a man of loyalty.

517
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,960
I only serve Princess Huaiqing.

518
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:48,070
Lin'an

519
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:50,030
should know that.

520
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,480
Please.

521
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,990
You really are extraordinary.

522
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,310
Thanks. I'm flattered.

523
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,440
"Moon".

524
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:03,830
Round one,

525
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:05,440
a relay.

526
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,510
Say lines with the word "moon"

527
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:09,510
in turn.

528
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:10,960
Whoever fails

529
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,710
has to drink one cup.

530
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:14,400
Who'd like

531
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:16,880
to go first?

532
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,550
I'll start

533
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:21,200
with my humble lines.

534
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,600
"The moon sets, rooks caw,

535
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:25,710
frost fills the sky.

536
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,550
Maples and fishing boat lights

537
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:31,920
make me too sad to sleep."

538
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,040
Good!

539
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,240
Nice!

540
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,770
- Beautiful!
- Good!

541
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:49,270
Spot on!

542
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:54,310
Excellent indeed!

543
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:56,030
Princess Lin'an,

544
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:57,710
long time no see.

545
00:22:58,070 --> 00:22:59,270
I should

546
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:01,960
look at you with new eyes.

547
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:04,720
May I ask

548
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:06,550
what they're...?

549
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,640
You probably don't know.

550
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,160
The Princes and Princesses

551
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,990
are discussing poems

552
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:17,030
to prepare for the upcoming Poetry Contest.

553
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:19,510
Grand Princess has been working hard for it.

554
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:21,160
If all that I've done

555
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,440
can be of some help,

556
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,990
I'll be content.

557
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:26,470
Is he that kept man?

558
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:30,120
Please hold on, sir.

559
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:35,920
Do you want to die?

560
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,230
Don't you know the rules?

561
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:39,030
We're really sorry.

562
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,160
This is the first time we've seen Mr. Xu.

563
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:42,920
We can't help but look at him.

564
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:46,990
(Even those in the Palace know me.)

565
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,160
What's there to look at?

566
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:51,400
Have you never seen a man?

567
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,470
We've seen men,

568
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:53,310
but not

569
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:54,480
a kept man.

570
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:55,360
Yes.

571
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,200
He's Princess Lin'an's kept man, no less.

572
00:23:57,510 --> 00:24:00,230
(Lin'an's telling everyone I'm her kept man.)

573
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,160
(Is that to sow discord
between me and Grand Princess?)

574
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:06,790
(Grand Princess must've
heard such rumors, too.)

575
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:07,850
(It's bad.)

576
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:10,430
(I must make her give up today.)

577
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:16,510
The shore is shrouded in mist in spring.

578
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:19,790
The cloudy sky is reflected in waves.

579
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:21,750
Gang.

580
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,640
Good work.

581
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,440
It sounds

582
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,120
great and majestic.

583
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:45,840
Agreed.

584
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:46,880
- Good.
- Great.

585
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:47,840
Well done.

586
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:49,150
Carry on.

587
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:52,600
The long march of time never ends.

588
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:55,030
The clear flow of water runs ceaselessly.

589
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:55,870
What's going on?

590
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,230
Shall I kneel to you, too?

591
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:58,310
No.

592
00:24:58,470 --> 00:24:59,310
Copper Gong Xu,

593
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:00,270
what brings you here?

594
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:01,510
I came with Lord Wei

595
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:02,720
to see Grand Princess for work.

596
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:05,360
Is that so?

597
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:06,750
Never mind.

598
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:08,070
How's Her Highness doing?

599
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:11,030
So far, so good.

600
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:12,600
All thanks to your poems.

601
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,310
I'm not asking about the contest.

602
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:15,200
Do you not know

603
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,240
right now,

604
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,750
rumors are spreading in the Palace

605
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:21,310
that I'm Princess Lin'an's...

606
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:25,360
I'm Princess Lin'an's kept man?

607
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:27,920
But that's a sheer lie.

608
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,580
I'd never go so low.

609
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:30,440
It must be Princess...

610
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,880
It must be Princess Lin'an's trick

611
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:34,230
to sow discord.

612
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,920
Grand Princess wouldn't believe it.

613
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:38,070
I'm relieved.

614
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:39,360
I thought...

615
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,400
Don't worry.

616
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:42,270
Her Highness didn't blame you.

617
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:44,200
She felt bad for you, actually.

618
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,750
She knows you're faithful

619
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,120
and trustworthy.

620
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:51,360
It's so wise of her!

621
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,480
Your Highness!

622
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:56,960
Your turn.

623
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,400
I'll give it a try.

624
00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:01,450
Your Highness, I...

625
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:04,600
Passing crows wade into the water to drink.

626
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:07,840
Returned swallows find wrong families.

627
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:10,230
What's that attitude?

628
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:11,360
Is she avoiding me?

629
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,600
She's far away from you.

630
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,680
She can't see you.

631
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,640
She did see me.

632
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,960
- She didn't.
- Our eyes met.

633
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,160
I said she didn't!

634
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,470
Gang, explain it for me.

635
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:19,840
Get him out of here. Go!

636
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,300
- Wait. I just came...
- Go!

637
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,880
Did she believe the rumors?

638
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,840
- Gang!
- She'll summon you another day!

639
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:27,310
Explain it for me!

640
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:36,960
Why did he come?

641
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,880
He said it was for some work.

642
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:40,160
Don't worry.

643
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,510
I've let him go.

644
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:43,470
Luckily, you acted in time.

645
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:48,200
Xu Qi'an is a strong rival.

646
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:50,920
Don't you think

647
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,510
Father favors him too much?

648
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,900
How long did it take you
to get in his carriage?

649
00:26:57,270 --> 00:26:58,120
Three years.

650
00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:00,880
Even I had to wait one year and four months.

651
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,160
But it's only been three months

652
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,400
since he joined us.

653
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:09,270
He's to Lord Wei's taste.

654
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:10,440
I'm not surprised.

655
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:12,310
So is Li Yuchun.

656
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:13,760
No.

657
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:15,790
There must be other reasons.

658
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:19,470
Where's Xu Qi'an from?

659
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,520
Why ask?

660
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:29,310
Do you still want to be Lord Wei's relative?

661
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:31,600
Tell me now.

662
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:33,230
Say it.

663
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:35,710
Xu's from the capital,

664
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:37,120
far away from Lord Wei's hometown.

665
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:39,230
They aren't fellow townsmen.

666
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:41,030
Are you sure they aren't?

667
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,750
Yes, I'm sure.

668
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:46,120
Are you tired?

669
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,200
Here comes the golden boy.

670
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,200
Yan?

671
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:49,960
Guys, my friend is here.

672
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:50,880
Let me down, please.

673
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:52,070
Come on.

674
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:55,200
Thank you.

675
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:56,310
Thanks a lot.

676
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:57,840
You may leave.

677
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,960
Go back. It's fine.

678
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,070
Xu Qi'an,

679
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,550
you're from the capital, right?

680
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:05,790
Yes or no?

681
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:09,120
Yes, I guess.

682
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:15,810
Did you go to the Imperial Library?

683
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,200
Not yet.

684
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:18,640
Did you see the Grand Princess?

685
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:23,160
Yes, sort of.

686
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:27,840
You saw her but didn't go to the Library.

687
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,470
Why did you come out?

688
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:33,070
I have no idea either.

689
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,920
As soon as I saw her

690
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:36,710
and said a few words,

691
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:38,120
they carried me out

692
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,030
as you saw.

693
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,920
I'll tell you what's this.

694
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,990
It's called karma.

695
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,400
Don't think you're a golden boy

696
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,840
that everyone likes.

697
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:54,150
Hey,

698
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,840
why the sarcasm?

699
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,210
Ningyan!

700
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,480
Greetings.

701
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:02,830
Ningyan,

702
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:05,360
Grand Princess asked to see you.

703
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:19,870
Lead the way.

704
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,040
Your Highness,

705
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:33,200
it's your turn.

706
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,600
The last word of the line should

707
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,070
be "water".

708
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,020
It can be a bit tricky.

709
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,500
What's wrong, Your Highness?

710
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,270
None of the lines from Xu Qi'an

711
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,750
end with the word "water".

712
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:47,390
Then

713
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,280
what to do?

714
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:49,630
Brother,

715
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,230
I think she'll

716
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:52,510
have to drink up.

717
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,880
Among all of us,

718
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:56,270
only Huaiqing hasn't had to drink.

719
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,750
No wonder she's the wisest lady in our state.

720
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:00,160
Fill her cup!

721
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,130
- Drink.
- Fill it.

722
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:02,360
Lin'an is still waiting.

723
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,200
Right, Brother?

724
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:04,160
Drink. Drink up!

725
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,000
Drink.

726
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:06,210
Yes, she has to drink.

727
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:10,160
"Drunk, I can't see the sky in the water.

728
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:13,470
Sweet dreams weigh down the Milky Way."

729
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:14,680
You...

730
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:20,310
"Drunk, I can't see the sky in the water.

731
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:22,200
Sweet dreams weigh down

732
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,750
the Milky Way."

733
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,280
Brilliant!

734
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:28,070
The lines are ethereal and vivid

735
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:30,990
with perfectly matching words.

736
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,360
May I ask you're...?

737
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:35,790
I'm Xu Qi'an,

738
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:37,440
Princess Huaiqing's guest advisor.

739
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,440
Xu Qi'an? That name sounds familiar.

740
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,070
Isn't he Lin'an's kept man?

741
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:46,790
I came to see you, Your Highness.

742
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,790
I'm confused.

743
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:51,030
Which princess

744
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,790
do you serve as a guest advisor?

745
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:55,160
Sir, sir.

746
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:56,880
Over here.

747
00:30:57,550 --> 00:30:59,840
A bosom friend is rare to find in life.

748
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:02,270
A confidant is hard to meet in all times.

749
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:04,440
I don't deserve

750
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:07,270
two princesses' appreciation.

751
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:08,640
I'm feeling both scared

752
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,750
and more than grateful.

753
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:10,910
However,

754
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:12,680
a horse doesn't carry two saddles.

755
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:14,440
The loyal don't serve two masters.

756
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:16,120
As humble as I am,

757
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:18,030
I have my own principles.

758
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:20,710
Princess Huaiqing,

759
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:22,510
you appreciate my ability.

760
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:23,510
Without your help,

761
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:25,880
who knows where I'd end up?

762
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:27,400
I could be the meat

763
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,750
on others' chopping block.

764
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,880
Princess Lin'an,

765
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:35,680
as a princess of our state,

766
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,790
you should be able to understand

767
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:40,400
my eagerness to repay others' kindness.

768
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:43,030
I'm extremely flattered and grateful

769
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:44,470
for your offer,

770
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:46,750
but I have to turn it down.

771
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:48,310
Please let me go

772
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:49,550
and respect my decision.

773
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,040
Princess Huaiqing,

774
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,790
I'm not a kept man.

775
00:31:57,030 --> 00:31:58,840
Could you let go of the rumors

776
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,680
and trust me again?

777
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:02,160
I...

778
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:03,720
I...

779
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,400
Are you still doubting me?

780
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:10,070
I, Xu Qi'an, swear solemnly

781
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,100
that I'll devote my life to you

782
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:13,310
and spare no effort in my duty.

783
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:14,270
I'll only

784
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,440
serve Princess Huaiqing to the end!

785
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,750
H-H-He...

786
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,270
Did he make a mistake?

787
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:24,840
You made a mistake.

788
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,360
- There...
- That's enough.

789
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:28,630
Princess Huaiqing is over there.

790
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:29,470
Princess Lin'an,

791
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:31,550
can you stop playing such silly games?

792
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,670
- Princess!
- Lin'an!

793
00:32:54,670 --> 00:32:56,440
- Call imperial physicians!
- Are you dizzy?

794
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,400
Princess!

795
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,030
Go get imperial physicians! Hurry!

796
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,510
No need.

797
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,150
Go to the Bureau.

798
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:06,800
Lin'an once fainted there.

799
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,680
They have the right medicine.

800
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:09,800
Yes. Right.

801
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,590
Go to the Bureau.

802
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:12,920
She'll be fine.

803
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:14,730
Let's go to the Bureau.

804
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:15,820
Sure.

805
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:22,070
Call imperial physicians!

806
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:22,910
Don't worry.

807
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:24,470
He'll wake up in a minute.

808
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:26,800
Let's go.

809
00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:28,590
- Go to my place.
- Join us, Master.

810
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:30,150
- Let's go.
- Sure, let's go.

811
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:49,760
Why are they talking so happily?

812
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,110
Are they talking?

813
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,990
I didn't know the truth until just now.

814
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,030
That's about the whole thing.

815
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,920
Sorry, I offended you repeatedly.

816
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,190
Please forgive me.

817
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:13,760
It's a clear day today.

818
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,030
Let's take a walk.

819
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:16,390
Yes.

820
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,630
- Are they leaving?
- Don't know.

821
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:27,070
- Where to?
- Don't know.

822
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:30,580
(Cultivate the Mind)

823
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:47,070
Yesterday,

824
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:49,400
the Treasure Sect made new Golden Pills.

825
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,150
I'll

826
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:53,190
have them send one to you.

827
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:55,720
Thank you, Your Majesty.

828
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:17,280
One Golden Pill

829
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,440
for one of your pawns.

830
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:20,800
Fair enough, huh?

831
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:21,800
Of course.

832
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:27,360
Your side seems a bit messy.

833
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,190
I'll clean house

834
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,150
for you.

835
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,360
How clever.

836
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:40,550
Over the years,

837
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:42,550
you've become

838
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:44,590
my most trusted aide.

839
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,720
I keep thinking

840
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:48,110
hadn't you

841
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:50,440
entered the Palace

842
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:52,800
but taken the Imperial Examination,

843
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:56,920
wouldn't our state have one more fixer,

844
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,840
and I

845
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:02,440
wouldn't be troubled by those trifles?

846
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:12,760
Your Majesty,

847
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:15,240
I'm still

848
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:18,550
serving you, right?

849
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,680
Wrong!

850
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:29,720
Can't you see

851
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,440
that's a trap?

852
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,280
Sorry, Father.

853
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:38,030
My skills are poor.

854
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:41,190
If it stays,

855
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:43,550
crisis will arise.

856
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:52,320
Where are we on the Sangbo Case?

857
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:56,550
Files from the Municipal Office
and Justice are a mess.

858
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,360
As I recall,

859
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:01,990
the handler of the case is a criminal,

860
00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:05,150
a Copper Gong Guardian named Xu.

861
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,200
Yes.

862
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,920
It's Xu Qi'an.

863
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:10,110
He's quite skilled.

864
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,880
He solved the Flag Officer's case

865
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,510
and Zhou Chixiong's case.

866
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:16,550
He also found

867
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:18,720
where the gunpowder came from.

868
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:24,320
I heard of it.

869
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:26,670
He has a clear mind

870
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,470
and a great gift for investigation.

871
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:32,840
Found anything so far?

872
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,960
As a matter of fact, yes.

873
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:38,360
Governor Zhao of Taikang

874
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,960
was found dead in jail

875
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:42,320
before dawn yesterday.

876
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:47,920
Magistrate Chen has reported it to me.

877
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,320
The cause of death

878
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,510
isn't trauma,

879
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:52,880
poison,

880
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:56,800
suffocation, or other human causes.

881
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,120
Either

882
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,990
the Yin Spirit of the Three Sects

883
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,800
or

884
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,150
the northern wizards did it.

885
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:20,670
So

886
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:21,760
what's the status now?

887
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,120
Your Highness,

888
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:27,190
Zhou Chixiong fooled the Gazing Spell

889
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:28,280
and fled out of the capital.

890
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:30,320
He must've used some kind of weapon.

891
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:32,440
That's why I'm thinking

892
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:34,070
by tracking down his weapon...

893
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:36,030
I know all that.

894
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:38,600
What else?

895
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:40,240
Is that all you've found?

896
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:44,320
What would you like to know?

897
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,280
I checked your investigation records.

898
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:51,030
You found the Bureau's seal in Sangbo.

899
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,880
Tianyu Language was carved
on the pillar in it.

900
00:38:54,110 --> 00:38:56,400
Have you pursued that lead?

901
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:57,550
Your Highness,

902
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,440
Lord Wei told me specifically

903
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,320
not to dig into whatever that was in Sangbo.

904
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,510
I wouldn't dare defy him.

905
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:04,030
Also,

906
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:06,630
why Kui blew up the Ancestral Temple

907
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:07,800
remains unknown.

908
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,630
Their motive might lead to the truth, too.

909
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:11,960
Someone or something powerful

910
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:14,990
was sealed under the Ancestral Temple.

911
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:16,630
However,

912
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:18,240
only Father knows that secret.

913
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:19,880
Lord Wei told you not to dig into it

914
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:21,190
to protect you.

915
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,470
(She knows that, too.)

916
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:28,840
Go on

917
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:29,960
with your theory.

918
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:33,800
A mere 8th-Rank Fighter like Zhou

919
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,990
pulled off such a shocking scheme

920
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:37,720
and ran away with his weapon.

921
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:39,380
I believe

922
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:42,150
someone in the court is covering for him.

923
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:43,110
That person is

924
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:45,030
likely to be involved in the Yanxiao Case

925
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:47,510
and the Missing Tax Silver Case, too.

926
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:49,590
Or a huge organization is behind Zhou.

927
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:51,400
As for their goal...

928
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:52,920
Do you mean...?

929
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:54,670
I dare not make assumptions,

930
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:57,110
but as Kui is involved,

931
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:59,110
and they meant to lift the seal in the lake,

932
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:02,360
the mastermind wants more than power.

933
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:06,920
Among the powerful officials,

934
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:11,190
those who could secretly collude with Kui...
