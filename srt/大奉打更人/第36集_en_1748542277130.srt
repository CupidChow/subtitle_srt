1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Why do I have the feeling of being a mountain king?

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Time has taken me to a different place

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I'm curious what I'm going to do next

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I don't want to think about the future

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
The whole book in my mouth

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Let this bowl of soup and tea

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
It's not very solid

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
When you're here

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I'll give you the rules

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I'll keep you under control

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'll keep this big piece of bowl

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
We're suddenly more like a step by step

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
We're suddenly more like a step by step

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
We're suddenly more like a step by step

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
We're suddenly more like a step by step

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
We're suddenly more like a step by step

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
We're suddenly more like a step by step

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
This pair of hands can't hold a break

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Look at the heart of the sea

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
The future is a kind of golden chain

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Time has taken me to a different place

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Oh, I'm curious what I'm going to do next

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I don't want to think about the future

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The whole book in my mouth

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'll keep it a secret

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'll keep this big piece of bowl

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
We're suddenly more like a step by step

28
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
We're suddenly more like a step by step

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
We're suddenly more like a step by step

30
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
We're suddenly more like a step by step

31
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,440
to kill the people.

32
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,720
These people

33
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,880
might have been modified.

34
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,320
They might

35
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,720
have never done anything

36
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,720
they did before.

37
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,760
But no matter what,

38
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,800
it's not a thing

39
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,920
that a father can do.

40
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:09,840
So,

41
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,720
Prince Zhenbei has a helper.

42
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,760
There's a top-level

43
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,920
helper in the other system.

44
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,280
The Immortal Sect?

45
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:17,920
Yes.

46
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,640
In the capital,

47
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:23,600
the Immortal Sect

48
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,880
has a cooperation with the Kuizu.

49
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,040
I don't know

50
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,160
what happened.

51
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,360
But their cooperation

52
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,240
should be over.

53
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,240
After all,

54
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,360
the Kuizu might

55
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:31,920
have made Prince Zhenbei

56
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,760
break through the barrier.

57
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,040
This point

58
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,680
can be interpreted

59
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,720
by the Kuizu to kill the princess.

60
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,160
So, you mean...

61
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,440
Miao Zhe,

62
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:40,880
I need you to help me

63
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:41,680
to release the news.

64
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,040
Release the Kuizu.

65
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,160
No problem.

66
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,240
My brothers

67
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:45,840
are all in the hands of

68
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,640
the news.

69
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:48,840
I'll stay here

70
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,840
to protect the man of Zhen.

71
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,320
I'll come back

72
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,000
and go to Chuzhou together.

73
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:53,560
Okay.

74
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:56,800
Don't worry.

75
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,480
Don't worry.

76
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,440
Lady.

77
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,320
Could you please

78
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,640
go to the Tartar

79
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,120
to Roger the Zither for us?

80
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,240
I'm worried about

81
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,320
the securitycultural.

82
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,600
The war will start soon.

83
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,480
Prince Zhenbei

84
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,480
has gathered

85
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,400
ch converses

86
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,840
to kowtow on the borderIDEA.

87
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:26,760
Your Majesty!

88
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,840
The Emperor of the Empire, Chu Zongzhang!

89
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,720
The Emperor of the Empire, Chu Zongzhang!

90
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,720
The Emperor of the Empire, Chu Zongzhang!

91
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,760
They still found out.

92
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,840
This is one of the things in the medical treatment.

93
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,440
We've been hiding the secret of Chu Zongzhang

94
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,760
for a few months.

95
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,320
It's a very successful plan.

96
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,640
How long will it take for the workers to get there?

97
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,360
Three hours.

98
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,080
You lost Mu Nanzhi.

99
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,160
Even if you use the gold pill,

100
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,120
you can't get two more.

101
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,880
We've thought about the test, right?

102
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:09,960
Don't worry.

103
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:14,040
I won't let you down.

104
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,600
What's the point of two?

105
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,640
Your Highness!

106
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,320
The Guards of the Great General

107
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,680
dissuade Chu Zoucheng to visit the court.

108
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:28,840
However,

109
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,040
we still don't know how to be honest.

110
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,600
If you Women of Ciyu

111
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,680
are dead

112
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,880
two days after theunte Cle vulgia,

113
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,160
what if the Duke Valhalla

114
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,160
bleeds and falls into waters?

115
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,840
Do you

116
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,400
have any plan still for the fight your best for?

117
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,640
if I die with your father,

118
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,920
how shall we be cured?

119
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,160
Wenicha.

120
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,200
I have heard the king muchas

121
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,000
has wanted to serve you.

122
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,920
You are quite necessary.

123
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:09,920
Your Majesty.

124
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,280
It's a high regard of yours.

125
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,480
Please wait a moment.

126
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,560
Please wait a moment.

127
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,520
Are you alright?

128
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:20,880
Please wait a minute.

129
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,640
I'm OK.

130
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:59,300
In your family,

131
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:04,700
ioè,

132
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,380
however,

133
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:12,380
it can't be left to the body.

134
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,620
It has to come toNY over the last three days.

135
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,580
It can't be left to the body.

136
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:20,920
It has to be

137
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,080
I'll buy you a few.

138
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,280
Eight times.

139
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,120
Eight times.

140
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,680
All of them are eight times.

141
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,280
Three guests,

142
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,480
do you want to come to the front?

143
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,080
You...

144
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,080
You're also eight times.

145
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,240
How many times did I say,

146
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,280
six times?

147
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,200
She said ап Поэтому,

148
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,160
four more times.

149
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,640
You areะ

150
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,880
creating a fam Я

151
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,380
FIRST WHAT SHOULD GO

152
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,400
500 Years

153
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,400
Fire

154
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,880
I will kill you!

155
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,880
I will kill you!

156
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:27,880
I will kill you!

157
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:31,880
I will kill you!

158
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,880
God of War!

159
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,880
If you are a God of War,

160
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:41,880
I will be a God today!

161
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,880
You are ridiculous!

162
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:57,880
God of War!

163
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,880
What's going on?

164
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,880
The Kui Clan has reached the city of Chuzhou?

165
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,880
How dare they come here?

166
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,880
Are they trying to fight with Da Feng?

167
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:25,880
This is the Chuzhou?

168
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,880
The blood is 3000 miles!

169
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:45,880
The blood is 3000 miles!

170
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:53,880
Chuzhou!

171
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:57,880
Chuzhou has 38 million people!

172
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:01,880
38 million people are willing to get married!

173
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,880
For Da Feng's 600 years,

174
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,880
why did they do this to the world?

175
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,880
They want to return to the capital and return to the king!

176
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:15,880
They want to be free!

177
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:19,880
They want to be free!

178
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,880
For Da Feng's king,

179
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,880
how could he kill the innocent people?

180
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:30,880
The king is so selfish!

181
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,880
So selfish!

182
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,880
The blood is 3000 miles!

183
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,880
The end!

184
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,880
The wind is blowing!

185
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:18,880
The end!

186
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,880
The end!

187
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:04,880
The power of the Buddha is already in the capital,

188
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,880
and the world is already in the capital!

189
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:11,880
Chuzhou will be the king of the world!

190
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,880
The end!

191
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,880
Who?

192
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,880
Impossible!

193
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:05,880
This is the golden bullet used by the people of Chuzhou.

194
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,880
The end!

195
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,880
Very good.

196
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,880
I also know this sword.

197
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,880
How is that possible?

198
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,880
No matter who you are,

199
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,880
you will be the king of Da Feng's king

200
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:06,880
when you get the sword.

201
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,880
The north wind is so strong,

202
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,880
it's hard to let me go.

203
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,880
It's a war.

204
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,880
It's a war.

205
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,880
Now, it's a chance to be the king of the south wind.

206
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,880
So, you have been the king of Chuzhou.

207
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:28,880
But the city is in a hurry.

208
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,880
The great city is in a hurry.

209
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,880
You are not as good as me.

210
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,880
You are so unlucky.

211
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,880
Chuzhou will forever love you.

212
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,880
Forget it.

213
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,880
I'm here to kill you.

214
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,880
Go!

215
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,880
Who is that?

216
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,880
Who?

217
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,880
Who is that?

218
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,880
Prince of Zhenbei, you deserve to die.

219
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:54,880
Prince of Zhenbei, you are second in the world.

220
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,880
The population of Chuzhou is 38 million.

221
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:01,880
You are dead because of your life.

222
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,880
The people of Chuzhou are in danger.

223
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,880
You are the hero who protects the border.

224
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,880
But you let them suffer a bloody battle.

225
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,880
You colluded with the God of Wusheng Sect.

226
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,880
You are the secret of the God of Wusheng Sect.

227
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,880
You have been trained to be a hero.

228
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,880
You are a murderer.

229
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,880
You are the most ungrateful person in the world.

230
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:26,880
Prince of Zhenbei, you are right to protect your soldiers.

231
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,880
You are right to kill 38 million souls.

232
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,880
Shut up!

233
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,880
You are so impudent.

234
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,880
Go!

235
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,880
Who are you?

236
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,880
You killed my king by eating blood.

237
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,880
Is he telling the truth?

238
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,880
Who are you?

239
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,880
That's the master of the monster family.

240
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,880
They are in the capital of Zhenbei.

241
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,880
I haven't seen the world for years.

242
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,880
He is a hero of the Great Fang.

243
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,880
I can't die.

244
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,880
I'm a military soul of the Great Fang.

245
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,880
I need him.

246
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,880
I need the Great Fang's people.

247
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:20,880
The King of War is dead.

248
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,880
The King of War is dead.

249
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,880
The King of War is dead.

250
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,880
The King of War is dead.

251
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,880
The King of War is dead.

252
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,880
The King of War is dead.

253
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,880
The Sword of the State is spiritual.

254
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,880
It can change the middle.

255
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:36,880
It's a human heart.

256
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:38,880
If you are a heartless person,

257
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,880
ask him yourself.

258
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,880
Choose not to choose.

259
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,880
The King of War is dead.

260
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:36,880
No.

261
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,880
I'm in the middle of the world.

262
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,880
I'm the King of War.

263
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:41,880
The King of War is dead.

264
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,880
The King of War is really dead.

265
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,880
He's really dead.

266
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:46,880
I'm not a man of choice.

267
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:47,880
Let him go.

268
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,880
Human is a weapon of heaven.

269
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,880
Lord Zhe.

270
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,880
You have been in the whole city,

271
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,880
Have you ever thought about breaking the rules?

272
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:07,880
Stop talking!

273
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,880
My power is going to be the best!

274
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,880
Then die!

275
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,880
No!

276
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,880
I'm your beloved!

277
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,880
Our power is our...

278
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,880
our Chuchuang!

279
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,880
Our...

280
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,880
Our...

281
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,880
I'm your beloved!

282
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,880
I'm your beloved!

283
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,880
Kill the King of Zhen!

284
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,880
Kill the King of Zhen!

285
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,880
Kill the King of Zhen!

286
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,880
Kill the King of Zhen!

287
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,880
Kill the King of Zhen!

288
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,880
Kill the King of Zhen!

289
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,880
Kill the King of Zhen!

290
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,880
What a joke!

291
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,880
I've been fighting for my life

292
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,880
for a bunch of dragons.

293
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:12,880
Is it funny?

294
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,880
Is it funny for a mortal?

295
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,880
Without people,

296
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,880
what are you doing?

297
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,880
Who are you?

298
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,880
Kill me.

299
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,880
Chuchuang will be dead.

300
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,880
Who are you?

301
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,880
I'm going to teach you a lesson

302
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,880
for Chuchuang.

303
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,880
You...

304
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,880
are not easy.

305
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,880
Kill the King of Zhen!

306
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,880
So sleepy.

307
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:34,880
I have a way.

308
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,880
A shell-cooked coffee egg.

309
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,880
Replace it immediately.

310
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,880
Oh, sugar.

311
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:40,880
It's sugar.

312
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,880
Now it's time to wake up.

313
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:44,880
Wake up!

314
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,880
A shell-cooked coffee egg.

315
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,880
Replace it immediately.

316
00:22:58,880 --> 00:22:59,880
Kill!

317
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,880
Kill!

318
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:03,880
Kill!

319
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,880
Kill!

320
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,880
The King of Zhen was abandoned.

321
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,880
Let's talk in the city.

322
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,880
What happened in Chuchuang?

323
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:29,880
Go.

324
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:32,880
Go.

325
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:33,880
Go.

326
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:34,880
Go.

327
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,880
Go.

328
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:36,880
Go.

329
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:37,880
Go.

330
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:58,880
No.

331
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,880
You can't train the weak.

332
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,880
Otherwise, you will be punished.

333
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:05,880
No.

334
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:36,880
Go.

335
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,880
Go.

336
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:50,880
Wait for me here.

337
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:51,880
Go.

338
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:02,880
Go.

339
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:05,880
Go.

340
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:11,880
Go.

341
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,880
In the hands of the Cui family.

342
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,260
Who?

343
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,820
Xu Jia?

344
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,940
Lord Reng,

345
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:46,960
thank you for your effort to make this.

346
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:56,140
Ziqian!

347
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,880

Best worthy masters!

setting Jins don't want to have bad hands

351
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:19,000
to haunt a charitable person,

352
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,640
then Guatemala will think he is Wallen of Records!

353
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,220
Ok?

354
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:24,360
Doctor,

355
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,800
breakerav while the knife齣 is sharp.

356
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,880
Who dare you squandered high?

357
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:31,180
Good interview!

358
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:31,740

Where are you going?

Go back to the city with me.

371
00:27:58,460 --> 00:27:59,060
My lord.

372
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:08,820
I want to be alone in the city.

373
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:28,300
Yes.

374
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:35,740
Go back to the city with me.

Go, come.

382
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:51,900
Zuo Arma.

383
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:54,500
Cracking mom.

384
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:55,500
Keep them 문ovated.

385
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:56,780
He should be frozen.

386
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:58,300
He can keep his life.

387
00:30:58,420 --> 00:30:59,900
Sihaoье, you two girls have lived

388
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:02,460
your jealous life every day and night.

389
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:04,140
I wonder what happen to him.

390
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:05,620
Two quatre tutors?

391
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:06,660
Who are they?

392
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:09,100
That's right.

393
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:15,180
Look, look.

394
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:16,660
Stop.

395
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:23,380
Stop.

396
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:25,380
I'm so tired.

397
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:32,380
Thank you.

398
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:41,380
Thank you for your hard work today.

399
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:43,380
I hope you can take a rest tomorrow

400
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:44,380
and cheer up the people.

401
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:45,380
No problem.

402
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:47,380
It's a pleasure to be able to meet Chu Zhoucheng again.

403
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:48,380
It's my honor.

404
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:49,380
My honor.

405
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:51,380
I'll be your wife for the rest of my life.

406
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:54,380
Master.

407
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:03,380
I told you not to come.

408
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:05,380
You want to take a rest.

409
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:08,380
Look.

410
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:14,380
What's wrong?

411
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:16,380
Did that copper demon kick you again?

412
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:19,380
Xu Guan is awake.

413
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:22,380
Nanjing?

414
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:25,380
Yes.

415
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:28,380
So this golden silk...

416
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:29,380
Gold drum.

417
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:31,380
Gold drum?

418
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:33,380
No.

419
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:35,380
Didn't you go to Yunzhou to get the magic ring?

420
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:36,380
Why did you go to Nanjing again?

421
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:37,380
It's a gold drum.

422
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:41,380
It's a long story.

423
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:44,380
You were so sad that day.

424
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:46,380
I don't know who proposed it.

425
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:48,380
I don't know who was in charge.

426
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:49,380
You're so stubborn.

427
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:52,380
You're so stubborn.

428
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:54,380
You're not going back to your original state.

429
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:14,380
I'm going to avenge you.

430
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:15,380
I'm willing to.

431
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:18,380
I'm going to Yunzhou to get the magic ring.

432
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:19,380
But who is it?

433
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:21,380
You're so stubborn.

434
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:23,380
I don't want to.

435
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:27,380
Shen Hai and Chui Xian are our bodies.

436
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,380
They're attacking us.

437
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:30,380
The three of us are the dead treasure.

438
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:31,380
Master Hu Yang.

439
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:32,380
You're so stubborn.

440
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:36,380
Thank you for taking the chance to kill us.

441
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:40,380
Then we voted for a day.

442
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:43,380
Two days.

443
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:45,380
Three days.

444
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:47,380
We voted for a crazy person.

445
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:50,380
Although we're close to the end,

446
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:52,380
we're optimistic.

447
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:55,380
We've tried so many ways to win.

448
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:56,380
The wolf eyes.

449
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:58,380
The dragon head.

450
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:01,380
The flying pigeon.

451
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:04,380
For a bite,

452
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:06,380
we have both the nature and the fighting spirit.

453
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:10,380
The ancient god is really hard to win.

454
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:14,380
Finally, we waited for half a day.

455
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:16,380
We waited for a fish boat.

456
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:19,380
Then we went to Yunzhou.

457
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:26,380
But who knows?

458
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:27,380
After a bite,

459
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:29,380
I realized it wasn't Yunzhou.

460
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:30,380
It was Nanjing.

461
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:34,380
And I was in the ancient city of the local.

462
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:35,380
I was in the city.

463
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:38,380
I was in the city.

464
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:41,380
Two days.

465
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:43,380
Two days.

466
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:46,380
I didn't expect that the ancient city

467
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:48,380
brought us back to the city.

468
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:51,380
Then we just arrived in the city.

469
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:52,380
And we were told.

470
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:54,380
Since you're back,

471
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:56,380
don't rest.

472
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:58,380
Go to the north and go to Chuzhou.

473
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:01,380
Qiqi'an is waiting for you.

474
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:05,380
You're going to die.

475
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:06,380
Good brother.

476
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:07,380
For a lifetime.

477
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:09,380
Go.

478
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:19,380
Good brother.

479
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:24,380
For a lifetime.

480
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:39,380
My lord.

481
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:47,380
Chuzhou is the land of the Kuhan.

482
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:50,380
There are also the Kui tribe's relatives.

483
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:53,380
The people are pure and bright.

484
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:57,380
I also want to ask you

485
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:00,380
why you're here.

486
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:02,380
Why are you here?

487
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:04,380
Why are you here?

488
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:07,380
I've been living here for a long time.

489
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:10,380
I've been in Chuzhou for a long time.

490
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:13,380
Now,

491
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:35,380
I'm here to honor the land.

492
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:37,380
I'm here to honor the land.

493
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:41,380
I'm here to honor the land.

494
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:47,380
I will remember this matter.

495
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:50,380
At the same time,

496
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:53,380
I will also record the crime of Prince of Zhenbei.

497
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:56,380
Let him take revenge.

498
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:00,380
Will the court

499
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:03,380
make Prince of Zhenbei's crime?

500
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:05,380
Prince of Zhenbei

501
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:06,380
is a royal official.

502
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:08,380
He has a good job.

503
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:09,380
But...

504
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:14,380
The court is on the basis of the truth.

505
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:18,380
My lord.

506
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:28,380
It's not a good idea

507
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:30,380
to make Prince of Zhenbei's crime.

508
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:32,380
What's the problem?

509
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:33,380
Go back to the capital immediately.

510
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:35,380
Take the war and take the first step.

511
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:36,380
Take the big deal.

512
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:38,380
And close the case for the case.

513
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:40,380
But Chuzhou is a great country.

514
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:42,380
It's not appropriate to go back to the capital

515
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:44,380
in order to restore the past ten days.

516
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:45,380
Prince of Zhenbei has been serving the capital.

517
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:47,380
But his crime hasn't been reported to the world.

518
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:48,380
I heard that

519
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:50,380
Yongxiu has been in charge of the crime.

520
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:51,380
He is the father of the king of Huai.

521
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:54,380
He is also one of the most vulnerable hunters in Chuzhou.

522
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:56,380
If he goes back to the capital first,

523
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:58,380
he will be in a deep doubt.

524
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:01,380
As for the details of the plan,

525
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:03,380
we can't go back to the capital.

526
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:04,380
We can't go back to the capital.

527
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:06,380
The main witness of the political affairs

528
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:07,380
is the main witness.

529
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:08,380
We must go back to the capital.

530
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:10,380
But there is a need for someone

531
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:12,380
to stay in Chuzhou.

532
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:13,380
It's a big deal.

533
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:15,380
I have a choice.

534
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:18,380
Li Renhua.

535
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:20,380
She is the new emperor of Zhenbei.

536
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:22,380
She has been involved in the bloodthirsty 3000-year-old.

537
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:24,380
She is just a sorcerer called by the God of Wusheng.

538
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:25,380
She is not capable.

539
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:26,380
As far as I know,

540
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:28,380
she is a justice and a cook.

541
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:30,380
The most important thing is

542
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:32,380
she has been in Chuzhou for many years.

543
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:34,380
She has been in the army for many years.

544
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:35,380
After the incident,

545
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:36,380
the whole army was in pain.

546
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:37,380
The army was in a critical state.

547
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:38,380
She stood up

548
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:39,380
and comforted the people.

549
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:40,380
She was in a lot of trouble.

550
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:41,380
She is now

551
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:43,380
leading a army

552
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:45,380
to cultivate the city and make the army.

553
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:47,380
I have not been in contact with General Li.

554
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:48,380
But I know that

555
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:50,380
people's hearts and people's words

556
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:52,380
are well-behaved.

557
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:54,380
She is a suitable person.

558
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:55,380
Guards.

559
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:58,380
Go to General Li.

560
00:38:58,380 --> 00:38:59,380
Yes.

561
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:02,380
You should take care of

562
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:04,380
the village head office.

563
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:06,380
Yes.

564
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:08,380
How is the business going?

565
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:09,380
It's good.

566
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:10,380
I will take care of it.

567
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:11,380
If you are in the city,

568
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:13,380
you should try to make it as good as possible.

569
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:15,380
The attack

570
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:16,380
sent us here

571
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:19,380
to protect the city secretly.

572
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:21,380
The Duke of Yingnan said

573
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:22,380
the attack was done

574
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:23,380
by the command of the army

575
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:25,380
to kill the leader of the Kui tribe.

576
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:26,380
The death of the leader

577
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:28,380
is between the three tribes.

578
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:29,380
The magic of the three tribes

579
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:31,380
is in my body.

580
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:35,380
Don't worry, Brother Cheng.

581
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:37,380
The magic has been done.

582
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:39,380
And it is not related to the nature.

583
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:40,380
It will never let me down.

584
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:41,380
Then,

585
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:43,380
do you know me?

586
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:45,380
I know you.

587
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:46,380
Good.

588
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:52,380
Brother Yan.

589
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:55,380
After I return to the capital,

590
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:57,380
I will ask for justice for you.

591
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:01,380
You must be cautious in the future.

592
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:02,380
Remember,

593
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:05,380
don't hide anything.

594
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:06,380
There is a problem.

595
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:08,380
You should ask for justice first.

596
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:12,380
Yes.

597
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:13,380
My Lord.

598
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:14,380
It's not good.

599
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:15,380
My Lord.

600
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:17,380
My Lord, it's not good.

601
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:19,380
Why are you here?

602
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:21,380
General Li.

603
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:22,380
He wants to kill me.

604
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:24,380
He wants to kill me.

605
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:26,380
I will stay here.

606
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:32,380
I will be back.

607
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:54,380
A little fox.

608
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:57,380
Sitting on the mountain.

609
00:40:57,380 --> 00:41:00,380
The autumn is coming.

610
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:04,380
The mountain flower is blooming.

611
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:08,380
The four moon is like a rose.

612
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:12,380
It can break the grass.

613
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:15,380
The mountain is full of flowers.

614
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:17,380
Come out after you finish.

615
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:19,380
Good night.

616
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:22,380
The water is so clear.

617
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:24,380
Good night.

618
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:26,380
Good night.

619
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:27,380
Good night.

620
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:29,380
Although it's a clear and fast-paced,

621
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:31,380
the court can tell us

622
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:32,380
when we return.

623
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:34,380
But it's not like that.

624
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:36,380
My Lord, go to the case.

625
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:44,380
My Lord.

626
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:47,380
Be careful.

627
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:56,380
Go to the case.

628
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:57,380

630
00:41:58,380 --> 00:41:59,380
My Lord.

631
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:00,380
Go to the case.

632
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:01,380

00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:17,380
My Lord.

641
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:19,380
What are you doing?

642
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:20,380
You are still playing the piano.

643
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:22,380
What's going on?

644
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:53,960
Who cares.

645
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:02,240
I'll report to His Majesty

646
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:03,540
