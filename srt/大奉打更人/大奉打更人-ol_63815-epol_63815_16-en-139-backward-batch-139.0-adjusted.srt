How can outlaws

Li Yuchun, have had enough.

00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,150
I quit.

00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,040

- Chief!
- Chief!

51
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,760
We're told by the high-ups

52
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:37,520
to let you visit the prisoner.

53
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:39,270
You only have a few minutes.

54
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:41,270
That should be enough.

55
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:42,320
Yes.

56
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,080
But

57
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:45,390
first,

58
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:46,710
you have to wake him up.

59
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:47,960
Wake him up?

60
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:50,110
He's been

61
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,320
sleeping like that for days.

62
00:00:58,150 --> 00:00:58,990
It's normal.

63
00:00:58,990 --> 00:00:59,990
Fighters sleep a lot.

64
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:01,430
It's my father's dream life.

65
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:02,550
Thank you.

66
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:09,110
Ningyan.

67
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,920
Wake up! This isn't the time

68
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:18,990
to practice!

69
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:28,320
(Unite the heart and the mind.)

70
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,590
(Let the energy run.)

71
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,960
(The Spirit Stage!)

72
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:34,980
(7th Rank Fighter, Spirit Stage)

73
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,640
It stinks!

74
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,920
I stayed up for several nights

75
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,430
to reach the Spirit Stage.

76
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:49,550
Hey, what brings you here?

77
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,960
Yesterday, your colleagues

78
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:52,360
sent a message to our house,

79
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:53,920
saying you were in jail.

80
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,800
Lingyue rushed to the Academy
to tell me overnight.

81
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,350
Hearing that you were imprisoned,

82
00:01:58,350 --> 00:01:59,520
I rushed back instantly

83
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:00,880
and waited until dawn

84
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:02,830
to get in when the Inner City opened.

85
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,590
How are the others

86
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:06,590
at home?

87
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,910
Mother went to seek help

88
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,150
from her townspeople all night.

89
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,150
Father rushed to the Bureau

90
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:14,270
and the Imperial Guards.

91
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:15,830
Lingyue

92
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:17,880
almost cried her eyes out.

93
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:19,200
When she found me,

94
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,000
she spoke in a trembling voice.

95
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,910
Lingyin was worried sick, too.

96
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:26,230
She only had a bowl of congee for breakfast.

97
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:29,270
I made them suffer.

98
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:32,470
I've talked to my masters,

99
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,160
but

100
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:37,120
they and Wei Yuan aren't exactly friends.

101
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,560
The Dean said

102
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,030
Grand Princess is your reference.

103
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:41,560
Only she can help you out.

104
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:44,640
Too bad,

105
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:46,790
she's in the Palace.

106
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:47,960
It's fine.

107
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,440
Just now, your two colleagues said

108
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,790
they could get me a permit.

109
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:53,910
I'll visit her in the Palace.

110
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:58,310
Cijiu,

111
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,320
are you mad at me?

112
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,400
I am.

113
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,590
I'm mad that you failed to kill that scum!

114
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,390
You're a scholar indeed!

115
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,560
I'm sorry.

116
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,030
I'll get you out.

117
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,270
Don't worry.

118
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:28,440
I'm blessed by the heavens.

119
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,960
I've been in jail three times

120
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:33,200
and got out twice.

121
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,520
Plus, Grand Princess's behind me.

122
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,720
I'll be fine.

123
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:39,230
I surely hope so.

124
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:45,270
Do you have money?

125
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,360
Yes.

126
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,470
Pay that jailer and tell him

127
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:50,710
you need one of my belongings back.

128
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:52,830
It's the Jade Mirror you saw.

129
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:54,120
If it's still there,

130
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,270
bring it to the Anji House on the east side

131
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:58,030
and show it to a man, Heng Yuan.

132
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:59,520
Tell him to inform No. 1

133
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:02,270
that No. 3 is in the Guardians' dungeon.

134
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:03,270
He needs help.

135
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,000
What if the mirror is gone?

136
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,470
Then forget it.

137
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,470
No need to bother

138
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,270
Grand Princess either.

139
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:21,680
His Copper Gong, badge,

140
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,830
weapon, and uniform

141
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:23,790
can't be taken away.

142
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:24,760
The rest is all yours.

143
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,710
Please send in a word.

144
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:40,860
(Shiqian Gate)

145
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:41,740
(Entry Permit)

146
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,500
(Xu Xinnian requests
to see Grand Princess.)

147
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:48,760
I'm from the Yunlu Academy.

148
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:50,320
I'd like to see the Grand Princess.

149
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,560
Please tell her I'm here.

150
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,200
Wait a minute.

151
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,640
This is as far as we can go.

152
00:04:58,960 --> 00:04:59,960
The rest is

153
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:00,960
on your own.

154
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:01,960
Thank you,

155
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:03,520
Mr. Song and Mr. Zhu.

156
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,680
We'll do anything

157
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:05,710
to get Ningyan out.

158
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:09,830
You have a visitor, Your Highness.

159
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,200
Xu Xinnian of the Yunlu Academy

160
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,250
greets the Grand Princess.

161
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:15,830
What brings you here?

162
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:18,390
My cousin, Xu Qi'an, is in great peril.

163
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,270
Please help him, Your Highness.

164
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,440
Xu Qi'an?

165
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:23,030
What happened?

166
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,680
A Copper Gong badly injured a Silver Gong.

167
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:30,590
Clearly, the attacker meant to kill.

168
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:31,960
To put it seriously,

169
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,710
that's attempted murder.

170
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,880
My cousin might've acted rashly,

171
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:38,030
but had he done nothing,

172
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:39,470
that poor girl would've been

173
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:41,000
assaulted by Silver Gong Zhu.

174
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:42,350
Justice must be upheld

175
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:44,590
against power and interest.

176
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:46,470
He might not be a scholar,

177
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,320
but he'd sacrifice himself for righteousness.

178
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,400
How

179
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:53,590
did Lord Wei punish them?

180
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:55,830
Silver Gong Zhu is discharged

181
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,120
from office forever.

182
00:05:58,230 --> 00:05:59,120
My cousin will

183
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,520
be cut in half in seven days.

184
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:16,750
My teachers,

185
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,160
Master Mubai

186
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,680
and Master Youping, wrote this

187
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,680
(To Huaiqing)
to seek your help.

188
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:26,080
(Xu Qi'an is a rare genius
with half-written poems alone.)

189
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,920
I see.

190
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:30,590
The thing is

191
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,160
the Guardians are an imperial force.

192
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,990
They only listen to my father.

193
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,470
I'll see what I can do.

194
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,870
Thank you, Your Highness.

195
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:50,110
(We can't pin all our hope on her alone.)

196
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,080
(She's agreed to help,)

197
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:55,510
(but who knows how much she'll do?)

198
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,110
(Xu Cijiu,)

199
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:02,230
(what exactly)

200
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:03,960
(have you done these years?)

201
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:07,040
(In the Spring Exam next year,)

202
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,800
(I must come on top!)

203
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,160
Your Highness,

204
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,440
it's been confirmed.

205
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:25,630
What Xu Xinnian said

206
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:26,710
is all true.

207
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:31,350
Were Xu Qi'an and Silver Gong Zhu
hostile against each other?

208
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,080
They had barely crossed paths.

209
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,710
Although Zhu did say

210
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:37,630
in private that he was jealous of Xu,

211
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:38,560
and he hated him.

212
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:42,320
Was the Governor of Taikang's family sent

213
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,590
to the Imperial Office of Music?

214
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:44,800
No.

215
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:46,320
Over the years,

216
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:49,560
Zhu repeatedly assaulted
convicted officials' families,

217
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:50,470
but

218
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:53,080
no one stood up to protect them.

219
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:55,110
I also found out

220
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,560
that Zhu

221
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,080
did provoke Xu Qi'an to attack

222
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,590
- but...
- But

223
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,230
he didn't think a mere Copper Gong

224
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:05,990
could unleash such great power.

225
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,320
I see what happened.

226
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:09,590
You may leave.

227
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:10,830
Yes.

228
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:22,100
(Forever Peace)

229
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:59,380
(Emperor's Chamber)

230
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:10,670
Your Majesty,

231
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,560
you're awake.

232
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,040
What time is it?

233
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,510
Your Majesty,

234
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,920
it's a quarter past the Yin hour.

235
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:26,710
It's the coldest at night.

236
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:29,350
Practicing too hard

237
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,090
might impair your health.

238
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:10,470
Any word from the Treasure Sect?

239
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:14,160
I've passed your order

240
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:17,230
to send in words immediately

241
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:19,440
once the State Preceptor comes out.

242
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:50,080
Your Majesty,
there was a sudden explosion at Sangbo.

243
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,800
The Ancestral Temple was destroyed.

244
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,870
The Ancestral Temple

245
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,240
has been destroyed.

246
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:00,900
(Forever Peace)

247
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:02,590
Wei Yuan.

248
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,110
Greetings, Your Majesty.

249
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,320
The ceremony just ended.

250
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,160
How did this happen?

251
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,800
I am still investigating.

252
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:18,470
What about the sword?

253
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:20,200
It fell into the Sangbo Lake.

254
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:21,600
We're trying to retrieve it.

255
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:50,400
Where is the Supervisor?

256
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:51,830
Your Majesty,

257
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:53,800
the Astronomical Bureau sent in words,

258
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:54,800
saying

259
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:57,110
the Supervisor was unwell

260
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,510
and is unable to see you.

261
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,560
The other corpses are like these ones.

262
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:12,110
Your Majesty,
we've found no signs of enemy invasion.

263
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:30,800
Wei Yuan.

264
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:27,340
(Cultivate the Mind)

265
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:32,240
By His Majesty's order,

266
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:33,230
no entry is allowed.

267
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,040
Huaiqing.

268
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,000
What now?

269
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,110
The situation remains unknown.

270
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,240
Lord Wei.

271
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,040
Lord Wei.

272
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:55,440
What's the status?

273
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:59,840
The Ancestral Temple was destroyed,

274
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,200
but

275
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:03,120
the culprit is long gone.

276
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:05,160
Was it to do with the worshiping ceremony?

277
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:16,360
His Majesty gave me 15 days to solve the case

278
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:18,310
and find the culprit.

279
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:21,200
I told him

280
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,160
it wouldn't

281
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:25,200
be easy to solve.

282
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:39,360
I'm still feeling anxious.

283
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:41,360
Your anxiety comes from within.

284
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:42,880
It needs to

285
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,990
be addressed from within, too.

286
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:51,790
You're right.

287
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:13,400
Can the State Preceptor come out early?

288
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:15,510
I'll issue an edit to confer the title

289
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:17,070
of the Supreme Consort on her.

290
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:18,990
(Chu Yuanzhen)
I understand.

291
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:20,540
(No. 4 of Realm Sect, 4th Rank of Men Sect)

292
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:21,840
I'll relay it to my master.

293
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:39,310
Alright, everyone.

294
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:40,790
Stop worrying.

295
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:42,230
All will be well.

296
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:44,110
Father,

297
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:47,160
was it linked to the incident
at the ceremony?

298
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,480
Father,

299
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:52,400
when I saw Lord Wei just now,

300
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:55,120
he said it'd be hard to solve this case.

301
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:56,710
I believe

302
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:58,200
he wanted me

303
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,550
to put in a good word for him

304
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:02,120
and ask for more time.

305
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:06,030
I happen to know a skilled investigator.

306
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:07,920
With his help,

307
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,070
this case will

308
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:10,880
be solved in 15 days.

309
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:14,270
Who is that?

310
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:17,200
It's none other than a Guardian, Xu...

311
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,640
Objection!

312
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:21,510
Is Princess Huaiqing
promoting her people again?

313
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:22,880
Father!

314
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:26,720
Father,

315
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,840
Brother hasn't said anything.

316
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,640
Huaiqing is trying to steal the thunder.

317
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,120
Please say something.

318
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,470
What do you suggest then?

319
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,510
I don't know.

320
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,360
What I do know is

321
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,790
your health

322
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:43,230
matters more than anything in the world.

323
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,440
Father,

324
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:49,550
Sangbo is an imperial sanctuary.

325
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:50,960
I wonder

326
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,640
what kind of treasure is kept there.

327
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:56,840
If someone can go in and out of there,

328
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:59,710
they can break into my mansion, too!

329
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:01,880
Relax.

330
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:04,120
With me here,

331
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:06,750
I dare them to lay a finger on my princess.

332
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,880
The explosion at Sangbo is serious,

333
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,880
causing a panic among court officials.

334
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,440
Father,

335
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:17,030
I might not excel in investigation,

336
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,440
but the Imperial Guards
and those of the Ministries

337
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,070
can solve this case together.

338
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,680
If Brother takes on this job,

339
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,920
I won't object to it.

340
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,600
The Crown Prince

341
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:40,790
will handle this case.

342
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,470
Yes, Father.

343
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:49,350
Do you mean

344
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:51,750
Lord Wei hinted that you should step in,

345
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:53,310
but Princess Lin'an interfered

346
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,600
to stop you?

347
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:57,470
Clearly,

348
00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:00,270
she didn't know Xu Qi'an was in trouble.

349
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,750
Why not tell her about it just now?

350
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,120
Had she known,

351
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,030
she would've let you handle it.

352
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:10,400
It wasn't the right time.

353
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,470
Tell her now.

354
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:18,840
Father's paranoid.

355
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,230
The Sangbo Explosion

356
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:22,440
poses a huge threat to royalty.

357
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,230
Promoting her guest advisor now

358
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,310
would raise Father's suspicion.

359
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,070
What's even more suspicious is

360
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,160
she did so at the risk of annoying Father

361
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:34,160
but backed down when you interfered.

362
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,280
Wait.

363
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,990
That wasn't her style.

364
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,440
Your Highness!

365
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:41,230
Your Highness!

366
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,640
Bad news!

367
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:43,920
Why the rush?

368
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:45,840
I heard from those in the Palace

369
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:48,920
that... Copper Gong Xu was imprisoned!

370
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,480
What?

371
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:52,030
When I asked them,

372
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,360
they said he overreached himself,

373
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,600
trying to kill a Silver Gong.

374
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,640
That was a capital offense!

375
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:56,600
Lord Wei was outraged

376
00:19:56,610 --> 00:19:58,330
and sentenced him to be
cut in half in public!

377
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,280
I'm afraid

378
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,400
he won't survive this time.

379
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:02,960
Xu Qi'an...

380
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:05,360
It's Xu Qi'an.

381
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,400
No...

382
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,200
Help him, Brother!

383
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,200
Please help Xu Qi'an!

384
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,050
- Please!
- Hold on.

385
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:12,070
Who's Xu Qi'an?

386
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:13,110
Xu Qi'an...

387
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,270
He's my guest advisor.

388
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:16,070
Your guest advisor is a Guardian?

389
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:17,760
No, no...

390
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,720
I'm going to see Father!

391
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:21,070
- Lin'an!
- Your Highness!

392
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:22,230
Slow down. Lin'an!

393
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,380
(The virtuous...)

394
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,920
As you expected,

395
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,960
Princess Lin'an went to the Imperial Study.

396
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:35,400
Xu Qi'an broke the law,

397
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,790
and he's Lord Wei's man.

398
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:39,030
Father wouldn't meddle in it.

399
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:40,360
However,

400
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,510
she begged His Majesty for mercy.

401
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:43,630
In the end,

402
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:46,200
she said Xu Qi'an was her kept man.

403
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:49,710
Her kept man, she said?

404
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,510
How ridiculous!

405
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:52,680
But

406
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:54,550
that did sound like her.

407
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:55,920
His Majesty summoned Crown Prince

408
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,550
and Noble Consort Chen in a rage.

409
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,510
Father would calm down soon.

410
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:02,990
Everyone knows

411
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,230
Lin'an would never fool around with men.

412
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:08,030
Does she even know what a kept man is?

413
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:13,310
(Erudite and Upright)
I really didn't know what that was,

414
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:14,270
Father.

415
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:19,440
My servants and maids told me to say that,

416
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,750
Brother!

417
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,880
They said a kept man is

418
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,120
a man I keep

419
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,310
as a guest advisor.

420
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:28,960
You have to trust me, Mother!

421
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:30,200
Enough!

422
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:31,600
Kneel!

423
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,310
Your Majesty,

424
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:46,270
as spoiled as she is,

425
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:49,550
she'd never do such unspeakable things.

426
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:52,230
Please trust her, Your Majesty.

427
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,280
Father,

428
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,880
she was eager to help that man.

429
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:01,750
This is all but a misunderstanding.

430
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,030
Please trust her, Father!

431
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:07,270
Your Majesty.

432
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,600
Do you want me to die early?

433
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,310
I'm really sorry.

434
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:24,200
I'd never have a kept man.

435
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:25,880
He's merely a Copper Gong.

436
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,880
Why are you so eager to help him?

437
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:31,360
I can't lose him.

438
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,280
He...

439
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:33,960
He can write poems

440
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,120
and solve cases.

441
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,470
He can solve cases, too?

442
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:47,790
He can solve any case.

443
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,750
I saw the case files he processed
as a Guardian.

444
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:53,910
How good was he?

445
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,200
He solved almost all the cases

446
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,040
with speed.

447
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:00,120
Father, I beg you to allow him

448
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,200
to investigate the explosion

449
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,230
and redeem himself.

450
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:06,110
Fine.

451
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:09,120
If you also value his ability,

452
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,030
I'll give him a chance

453
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:11,870
to let him

454
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,470
make amends for his faults

455
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,230
by assisting you with this case.

456
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,840
Thank you, Father!

457
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,990
If he can't solve it within 15 days,

458
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,470
I'll have him executed.

459
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,750
Are you Xu?

460
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:52,750
You're...?

461
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,160
Some Imperial Guards have a message for you.

462
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:58,030
They're caught up with something,

463
00:23:58,030 --> 00:23:59,070
so they can't come.

464
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:10,960
Those traitors!

465
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:14,360
They agreed to come when we drank yesterday

466
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,550
now they stood me up.

467
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:18,840
A bunch of pigs!

468
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:28,400
Ningyan,

469
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,960
I promised your father

470
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:34,600
to keep you safe.

471
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:37,840
I might not be a skilled fighter,

472
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:40,440
but I am

473
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,160
a man of my word.

474
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:00,440
Your noodles.

475
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:07,120
Didn't I tell you specifically no coriander?

476
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,890
Why did you add it?

477
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:09,920
Where's garlic? I want it.

478
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:10,920
Yes, sure.

479
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:14,470
Without garlic,

480
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:15,880
noodles taste less good.

481
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:21,990
Fill myself up

482
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:24,360
and then I can work.

483
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:27,070
Ningyan,

484
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,790
give me a minute.

485
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,440
I'll eat up soon.

486
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:37,630
It this fresh garlic?

487
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:43,150
It's good!

488
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:53,120
Here's an edict!

489
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:04,200
Guardian, Copper Gong Xu Qi'an,

490
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:07,230
is skilled at solving cases.

491
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:09,990
He shall redeem himself

492
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:13,360
by solving the Sangbo Explosion in 15 days.

493
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,310
If he succeeds,

494
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:16,230
he'll be reinstated.

495
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:17,440
Otherwise,

496
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,270
he'll receive his punishment.

497
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:23,070
Also, the Guardians
shall provide full support.

498
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,880
The end.

499
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,160
Yes, Your Majesty.

500
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:36,230
Lord Wei,

501
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:39,710
His Majesty made an exception and gave

502
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:41,840
the Guardians another chance.

503
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:43,880
That little Copper Gong

504
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:45,920
is so fortunate.

505
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:54,960
It's all

506
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:57,440
thanks to you, too.

507
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:58,960
Lord Wei,

508
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:00,470
thanks.

509
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:02,920
Let's go.

510
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:12,710
Fortune does favor fools like Xu Qi'an.

511
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:14,750
How silly.

512
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:16,990
How am I silly?

513
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:20,120
Do you know why Father
talked to the Grand Princess?

514
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:23,640
He dropped a hint on her outside the study.

515
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:26,230
Then she advised His Majesty to give Xu

516
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,960
a chance to redeem himself.

517
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:29,990
I don't need you tell me.

518
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:31,710
I knew, of course.

519
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:32,880
I just didn't say it.

520
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,310
With a blockhead like yours?

521
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:35,720
Enough.

522
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:37,550
Stop arguing.

523
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:39,960
Release him from the prison.

524
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,040
Yes.

525
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,400
Send a word to Li Yuchun

526
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,990
that His Majesty released Xu Qi'an

527
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:51,990
to let him redeem himself.

528
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,550
And he, Silver Gong Li,

529
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,120
is also reinstated.

530
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:57,760
Remember,

531
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:01,200
make it grand.

532
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,480
Ningyan,

533
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,270
I promised your father

534
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,070
to keep you safe.

535
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,070
I might not be a skilled fighter,

536
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,230
but I am

537
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,680
a man of my word.

538
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:51,990
Where's the outhouse?

539
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,440
Ningyan,

540
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,640
you won't die,

541
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,550
Ningyan!

542
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:09,470
His Majesty is giving you a chance
to redeem yourself.

543
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,600
Hurry!

544
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:11,990
My man!

545
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:13,690
My man!

546
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:14,990
I miss you so much!

547
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:16,880
You're killing me!

548
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:19,830
I... I'm going to die because of you!

549
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,290
- Ningyan!
- Get off me!

550
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:22,310
Go away!

551
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:37,870
Ningyan,

552
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,440
I had the runs just now

553
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,030
and wasted a bit more time.

554
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:48,360
No more accidents will happen now.

555
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:28,630
Ningyan,

556
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:31,400
here I come!

557
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:32,960
Who are you

558
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,160
to break into the Haoqi Tower at night?

559
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:44,790
Why are you here?

560
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,230
Uh, sir,

561
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:54,360
I passed by.

562
00:30:58,270 --> 00:30:59,270
If there's nothing else,

563
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,710
I... I'll be off.

564
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:02,870
Stop!

565
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:06,640
Why bring a saber with you?

566
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,310
Too tight.

567
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,360
I can't untie it in a rush.

568
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:28,400
Please give me a hand.

569
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,400
Ningyan...!

570
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,990
The Sangbo Explosion.

571
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,920
His Majesty ordered me to solve it

572
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:39,880
to redeem myself.

573
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,790
You really got lucky this time

574
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:44,030
and had a narrow escape.

575
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:47,840
How did His Majesty know?

576
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:50,760
We only know Lord Wei
went to see him at Sangbo.

577
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:53,070
Then the edict to release you
came this morning.

578
00:31:55,630 --> 00:31:56,470
Lord Wei?

579
00:31:57,590 --> 00:31:58,960
Let's get out of here.

580
00:31:58,960 --> 00:31:59,920
It's filthy.

581
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:01,310
Let's go.

582
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:02,310
Come on.

583
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,150
You're out.

584
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:20,350
Mr. Jiang.

585
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,440
They told me everything.

586
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:27,760
Thank you for putting in

587
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:28,990
good words for me.

588
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,800
Don't mention it.

589
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,800
You did nothing wrong anyway.

590
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:36,360
We Gold Gongs are on your side.

591
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:40,680
Good boy.

592
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:41,720
Well done.

593
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:45,280
I'll fight Yang Yan over you again later.

594
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:47,110
You should join me!

595
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:50,840
Thanks for your appreciation.

596
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,320
Who's this?

597
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:56,150
That petty thief was out of his mind.

598
00:32:56,150 --> 00:32:58,240
Just now, he made a fuss

599
00:32:58,470 --> 00:33:01,510
with his rusty saber outside,

600
00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:02,880
so I seized him.

601
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:05,800
Is he crazy?

602
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:06,800
I guess.

603
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:11,590
But then again, Mr. Jiang,

604
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,760
if he dared to break into our office,

605
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,470
someone might be behind him.

606
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:17,990
We should

607
00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:19,030
throw him in jail

608
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:20,880
and torture him. He'll confess.

609
00:33:21,150 --> 00:33:22,070
You're right.

610
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:23,640
Guards.

611
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:26,800
Don't bother to question him. Lock him up

612
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:28,720
and torture him.

613
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:29,640
Sure.

614
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,190
I'm going to work, Mr. Jiang.

615
00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:33,030
See you.

616
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,590
- Mr. Jiang.
- Goodbye.

617
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:36,430
Mr. Jiang.

618
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:37,960
Let's drink someday.

619
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:38,800
No problem!

620
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,280
Go.

621
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,070
Ningyan...

622
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:45,470
Ningyan...

623
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:50,440
Ningyan...!

624
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,320
What's wrong, Ningyan?

625
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:56,070
I hear someone calling my name.

626
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,720
Are you hearing voices?

627
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:58,720
You're free.

628
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,190
You won't be in jail ever again.

629
00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:01,800
Rest assured.

630
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:04,320
The two of us will help you solve the case

631
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,440
and keep you safe.

632
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,120
My man.

633
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,200
My man.

634
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:18,420
(Xu Residence)

635
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,200
Cijiu,

636
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:26,400
the Grand Princess...

637
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:28,150
Her Highness is upright.

638
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,670
Let's hope she'll lend a hand.

639
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,960
Mother, Xinnian,

640
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,590
eat something.

641
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:41,070
You can't think on an empty stomach.

642
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,400
I wonder if Ningyan has anything

643
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,440
to eat in jail.

644
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,120
Mother,

645
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:54,990
Lingyue is right.

646
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:57,400
We need to eat in order to help Ningyan.

647
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:01,910
Lingyue,

648
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:04,190
you've barely eaten anything lately as well.

649
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:05,630
Eat something.

650
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,760
I regret

651
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,880
taking him in back then.

652
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:31,470
I thought you never wanted him here?

653
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:34,510
Don't you know I'm all bark and no bite?

654
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,920
Hadn't Ningyan's father

655
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,590
saved your father,

656
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:44,190
we wouldn't have become a family,

657
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:47,030
and you wouldn't have been born.

658
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,840
Are you alright, mother?

659
00:35:55,990 --> 00:35:56,830
I'm fine.

660
00:35:57,670 --> 00:35:58,800
I'm just a bit

661
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:00,470
disturbed.

662
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,550
Eat up

663
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:04,990
for your energy to recover.

664
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:07,070
What goodies are you eating without me?

665
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:10,760
You're back, Ningyan!

666
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:12,670
Let me hold you, little one!

667
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:14,030
Do you miss me?

668
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:16,760
I've been missing you so much!

669
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,990
Let's eat. What do we have?

670
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:20,320
I'm starving!

671
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,440
Is there anything good?

672
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,070
You're so annoying!

673
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:24,440
The food isn't for you.

674
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:27,880
What's wrong?

675
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,360
I heard from Cijiu

676
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:31,670
that while I was away,

677
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:33,030
you were too worried to eat.

678
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,190
I... I was fine.

679
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:36,110
I had a good appetite.

680
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:37,760
I ate a lot every day.

681
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:42,430
Where's my Sis?

682
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,560
Ningyan.

683
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:50,870
Ningyan,

684
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:52,280
I thought...

685
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:53,470
I'm fine.

686
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,150
I heard you barely ate anything lately.

687
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:56,800
Yes.

688
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:00,840
I even gave her my favorite drumsticks.

689
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,840
Good girl.

690
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:09,470
I'm back safe and sound. Let's eat.

691
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:10,510
I'll make another dish.

692
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,110
No need, Sis.

693
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,360
I'll go get you a cup.

694
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,640
Dig in.

695
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:17,360
Leave Ningyan alone.

696
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,920
