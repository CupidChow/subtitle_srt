Long time no see, Congkai.

00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,910
You haven't come for a long time.

45
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:49,360
I went on a trip earlier.

46
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,550
I came here

47
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,470
to see you as soon as I returned.

48
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,640
Let's get hammered tonight.

49
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:04,320
It's you.

50
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:06,920
- Hello.
- Hello.

51
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,080
You know each other?

52
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:11,520
Not just that.

53
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,040
He's also my buddy.

54
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:15,430
Li, right?

55
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,360
I'm Yang.

56
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,360
We met

57
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:20,200
at the Academy.

58
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,800
Yang...

59
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:25,870
Ling.

60
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,800
Yes, Ling!

61
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:32,590
(Weren't those two brats busy?)

62
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:34,920
(I know Cijiu.)

63
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,760
(He seldom says what he means.)

64
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:40,520
(But Ningyan never goes to brothels.)

65
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:44,150
(Last night, Uncle said he was loyal.)

66
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,110
(I'll tell Aunt.)

67
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:48,920
(Maybe I can get hush money.)

68
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:51,710
(Ningyan said he never went to brothels.)

69
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:54,590
(Shameless!)

70
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,270
(So is Father.)

71
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,990
(No wonder my school robe is gone.)

72
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,830
So, Mr. Xu,

73
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,080
Mr. Li,

74
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,960
you could've told me

75
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,870
you wanted to come here.

76
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,550
We could've come together.

77
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:10,670
We're close,

78
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:13,110
so close as family.

79
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,430
And a family

80
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:17,430
should be together,

81
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,080
right?

82
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,640
- My bad.
- My bad.

83
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:26,660
(Graceful)

84
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:50,660

85
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:52,480

86

Beautiful!

87
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,590
Amazing!

88
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,640

89
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,710

91

92
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:19,670
Where's she?

93
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:22,680
It's magical!

94
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:30,200
Control yourself.

95
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,800
Miss.

96
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:44,030
Here's the line.

97
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:45,190
Yes.

98
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:48,520
Here's Miss Fuxiang's first line.

(Pine leaves)
You have an incense stick of time

100
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,790
(and bamboo leaves are green.)
to write.

101
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:53,830
Begin.

102
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:57,080
"Pine leaves and bamboo leaves are green."

103
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,030
Two "leaves".

104
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,390
How smart.

105
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,040
Nice!

106
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:06,190
Mr. Yang,

107
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,560
you first?

108
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,830
I didn't know it'd be couplets.

109
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:14,830
Not my strong suit.

110
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:16,000
I need more time to think.

111
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:18,150
You first, Mr. Li.

112
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:21,710
Let Mr. Xu do it.

113
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:23,350
Yes, you first, Mr. Xu.

114
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:25,470
The ink isn't well ground.

115
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:26,790
It needs more work.

116
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,680
I'll write later.

117
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,200
Don't be shy.

118
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:31,680
I'll go first.

119
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:32,680
No!

120
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:41,830
Come on! Think!

121
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:43,000
Use your brain!

122
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:47,080
Autumn sounds and goose sounds are cold.

123
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,590
This one it is.

124
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:52,590
It's not perfect,

125
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,440
but its format is fine.

126
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,320
Miss Fuxiang invites Mr. Zhao in for tea.

127
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:03,760
Good job!

128
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,830
Congratulations!

129
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,520
Well,

130
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:11,440
thank you.

131
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,680
Yunlu Academy?

132
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,270
Do something, son!

133
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:28,230
Ningyan is a poet.

134
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:29,320
Please do something!

135
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:30,790
I told you my poems

136
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:33,200
were from an old book.

137
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,200
I didn't write them.

138
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,470
Why don't you believe me?

139
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:37,070
Father,

140
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:39,710
you can't even read.
Why play an old scholar?

141
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:40,550
Yes!

142
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,880
You shouldn't be here.

143
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:44,680
This isn't the time to judge me.

144
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,080
He's going to her room.

145
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:53,010
(So not worth it.)

146
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,270
(I've paid so much)

147
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,470
(but found nothing useful.)

148
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:05,350
(She's the fairest here,)

149
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:08,030
(excelled in poetry and music.)

150
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,800
Cijiu,

151
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:12,830
write this down.

152
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:19,270
"Shadows slant across shallow water.

153
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,320
Faint scent floats in dim moonlight."

154
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,630
It has my name.

155
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,830
Come in.

156
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,230
Who wrote this poem?

157
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:31,230
Who was it?

158
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:32,590
Where's he now?

159
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,080
Sorry, Mr. Zhao.

160
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,280
Miss Fuxiang

161
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,680
has chosen someone else.

162
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,560
What?

163
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:39,710
Mr. Yang,

164
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:40,960
she wants to see you.

165
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,590
Please follow me.

166
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:51,830
He's going in, too?

167
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:53,200
That's against the rule!

168
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,800
Mr. Zhao.

169
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,280
Greetings, Mr. Yang.

170
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:16,710
Please have a seat.

171
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:26,560
I appreciate your talent.

172
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:27,960
It's unmatched.

173
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,320
It takes years of hard work

174
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,990
to come this far, right?

175
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,830
Not exactly.

176
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,920
Thanks to the wisdom of the old,

177
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:37,400
I can...

178
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:40,470
use their masterpieces.

179
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,200
Why hasn't he come out?

180
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,240
Well,

181
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:47,800
I need fresh air.

182
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:51,350
We've paid for this.

183
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:53,310
Father...

184
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:54,430
Miss,

185
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:56,200
with all due respect,

186
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,800
you're a rare beauty.

187
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,040
Did no one offer to free you from here?

188
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:03,510
Those in charge of here

189
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,320
won't let go of girls

190
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,710
like me easily.

191
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,280
Wait.

192
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:11,710
You have tons of wooers,

193
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:13,920
including the rich and powerful,

194
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:15,400
such as

195
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,280
Vice Minister of Revenue's son,

196
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,120
Zhou Li.

197
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,510
He's obsessed with you.

198
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:24,440
He's wild, lascivious,

199
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,630
and ignorant.

200
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,870
I dislike him.

201
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,830
Whether he comes to play games

202
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:31,080
or offers me gifts,

203
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:33,200
I always ignore him.

204
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,800
We're under the Ministry of Rites.

205
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,040
He's Vice Minister of Revenue's son.

206
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:40,590
Although I'm not his match,

207
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,280
I'm not afraid of him.

208
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:44,160
How's he wild

209
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,320
and lascivious?

210
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,110
It's common

211
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:49,510
for rich men like him to cat around.

212
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:53,040
This is

213
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:55,960
sensitive in the official circles.

214
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:57,920
I'm simply curious.

215
00:11:58,230 --> 00:11:59,230
I won't tell others.

216
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:03,960
It goes back to the last Lantern Festival.

217
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,510
Zhou Li is ridiculous.

218
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:09,510
At the Festival,

219
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:11,040
he was attracted to a girl

220
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,160
and harassed her

221
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,800
in the crowd.

222
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,320
Zhang Yunying,

223
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,470
Weiwu Marquis's concubine's son,

224
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:20,230
was there, too.

225
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:22,350
He also

226
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:24,280
laid eyes on that girl.

227
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,280
The two of them

228
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,750
became so jealous

229
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,280
that they fought

230
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,920
over her.

231
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,280
(Plum House)
Students don't

232
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,280
have fighters' full beards like you.

233
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,510
Your disguise is terrible.

234
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:36,560
What do you know?

235
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,160
I think I fit in perfectly.

236
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:40,440
Yes, Mr. Li.

237
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,630
No wonder Mother never

238
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:42,990
gets your full salary.

239
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:44,040
You used it here, huh?

240
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,750
I borrowed it.

241
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,680
I came to gather information

242
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,320
against our enemy.

243
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,230
Liar.

244
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:51,680
You can't fool me.

245
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:55,750
You're good.

246
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:58,230
Who keeps saying to study sages' sayings,

247
00:12:58,230 --> 00:12:59,400
be a gentleman,

248
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,800
and never come to such places?

249
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,470
I play by ear.

250
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:04,920
It depends.

251
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:06,990
Liar!

252
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:10,830
- What did she say?
- Yes.

253
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:11,870
Let's go home first.

254
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:12,710
Wait!

255
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:14,080
Go back like this?

256
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,160
Or?

257
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,080
So naive.

258
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:20,430
Zhang.

259
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,350
Three Plan As.

260
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:23,550
Got it.

261
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:26,550
Take it.

262
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:28,550
On my tab.

263
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,520
Sure.

264
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:42,710
Did you not send the girls away?

265
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:43,680
We did.

266
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:44,990
Then what's this for?

267
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,400
Your aunt's sharp-nosed.

268
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,960
Better safe than sorry.

269
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,470
What if she suddenly returns?

270
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,800
The old are indeed wise.

271
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,470
No wonder you always smell like citrus.

272
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:57,710
Zip it.

273
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:58,590
Rub it on me.

274
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,830
Alright. Enough.

275
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:01,230
- Here.
- Shoes...

276
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,440
Armpit.

277
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:08,920
His concubine's son,

278
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,320
Zhang Yunying?

279
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:11,350
Yes.

280
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,630
That man

281
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:14,200
hates Zhou Li's guts.

282
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,830
Hot-headed brats like him

283
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,630
can be our pawns.

284
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:18,990
What's your plan?

285
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,230
Watch him

286
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,110
and act at the right time.

287
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,440
A setup?

288
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,510
Given his status,

289
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:29,400
he goes out with attendants,

290
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,560
but not too many.

291
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,830
He isn't the heir after all.

292
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,160
We can make a mess

293
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,710
and then

294
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,440
abduct him.

295
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:39,920
If we do it in the day,

296
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,680
how can we kidnap someone in public?

297
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:44,590
Our plan is likely to backfire.

298
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:46,630
If we do it at night,

299
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,590
how can the three of us

300
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,440
break into his mansion?

301
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,400
What if

302
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,350
I've figured that out?

303
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,320
Uncle!

304
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,320
Uncle!

305
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:06,400
Father.

306
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:08,230
- Why are you sleeping here?
- Father.

307
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:09,400
Wake up.

308
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:11,160
- Are you alright?
- Wake up.

309
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:15,960
Where am I?

310
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,680
How did I get here?

311
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:19,230
How would

312
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:20,590
I know?

313
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,080
Just now, I meant to bathe.

314
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,710
Didn't you go get me hot water?

315
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:30,800
And?

316
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:43,310
Ningyan,

317
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,630
is there hot water?

318
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:52,310
Uncle,

319
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,800
I'm sorry.

320
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,440
- A mirror?
- I'm not sure.

321
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,320
It reflected light.

322
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,350
You've reached the Qi Stage.

323
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:04,680
How did someone bring you here

324
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,040
without alerting anyone?

325
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,590
You'll know tomorrow.

326
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:09,670
Ningyan,

327
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,590
did you bring me here?

328
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:12,960
Forget it.

329
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,990
It's cold. Go freshen up and sleep.

330
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,110
Let's discuss some details

331
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:19,950
in your room.

332
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,200
Like what?

333
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,630
May I join you?

334
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,990
I said forget it.

335
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:27,830
Just abduct Weiwu Marquis's son.

336
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:31,040
The Marquis's son?

337
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,280
What are you up to?

338
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,080
Don't make a fuss.

339
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:35,680
Abduct him!

340
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:44,400
- Stop.
- Whitening cream.

341
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,780
(Whitening Cream)
You'll be fair.

342
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:46,640
Take a look.

343
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:47,750
- Smells nice.
- Yes.

344
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,120
That girl.

345
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,210
(Zhang Yunying)
Yes.

346
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:51,510
It'll brighten your skin.

347
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,350
What are you doing?

348
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,160
- Let go!
- Who are you?

349
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,320
- Help!
- Help me!

350
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,230
What's going on?

351
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:57,730
- Help!
- Let go!

352
00:16:57,730 --> 00:16:58,700
Let go!

353
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:00,990
Let go of me!

354
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:02,990
Move! Move!

355
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:08,920
Go help them.

356
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,760
Yes.

357
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:24,750
Move!

358
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:25,960
Go away!

359
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,680
I stepped on you!

360
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:32,470
Who are you?

361
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:33,510
What do you want?

362
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,860
(Autumn)

363
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,360
He's filthy rich.

364
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:02,600
He wears a white jade thumb ring.

365
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,310
Cut off that thumb!

366
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:07,360
You can't.

367
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:13,900
(Autumn)

368
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:18,920
He's Weiwu Marquis's son.

369
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,750
Who are you

370
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:23,400
to touch him, rascal?

371
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,470
(They know who I am.)

372
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:27,200
(How dare they kidnap me!)

373
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,680
How's Master

374
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,400
going to deal with him?

375
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:35,550
Put him in the yard.

376
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:37,680
Torture him.

377
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,990
Give him no food.

378
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:41,360
Break his ankles.

379
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,200
Hang him upside down.

380
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,200
Whip him

381
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:45,710
hundreds of times a day.

382
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,230
His father is a marquis.

383
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:50,310
Is Master not afraid of him?

384
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,270
A marquis is nothing.

385
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:54,360
Master's father is

386
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:56,270
the Vice Minister of Revenue!

387
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:57,920
Fear not.

388
00:18:58,030 --> 00:18:59,470
(Vice Minister Zhou's son?)

389
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:00,920
(Zhou Li?)

390
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:04,790
Fine. Master is on his way.

391
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:07,440
Let's pick up drinks for him to enjoy.

392
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:08,870
No.

393
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:12,030
We're ordered to watch him.

394
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:14,680
We'll be back soon.

395
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,520
Let's go.

396
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:32,680
Did you use this mirror

397
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,840
to seize Zhang Yunying?

398
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:36,070
Not just him.

399
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:39,310
The maids, the doorman,

400
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:41,070
and Zhou Li's mistress,

401
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:41,920
all four of them

402
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,310
are in it now.

403
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:44,270
In here?

404
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:47,880
Don't touch it,

405
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,120
or you'll be sucked in.

406
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,000
Here you go.

407
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,310
What if he can't get out?

408
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:01,550
Why lock the door?

409
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:05,550
It has to look convincing.

410
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,310
The strong urge to live

411
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:09,510
will bring out one's potential.

412
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:10,830
Trust me, he'll get out.

413
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,160
Jump over the wall.

414
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,600
He's out.

415
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,440
Help!

416
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:22,160
Help!

417
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,710
Help me! I was kidnapped!

418
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,510
I'm Weiwu Marquis's son.

419
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:26,710
They... they abducted me!

420
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,520
Yunying!

421
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:29,750
Are you hurt, son?

422
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:31,350
Mother, Father!

423
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:33,590
Son,

424
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,710
what happened?

425
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:36,310
It was... Zhou Li.

426
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:37,680
He kidnapped me!

427
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:40,400
He... meant to torture me

428
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,080
before killing me!

429
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:46,710
What took you so long?

430
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:47,710
How's he now?

431
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,270
Goodness.

432
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,230
I'm exhausted.

433
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:01,440
I tailed Zhou Li all day.

434
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:02,710
First,

435
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:04,750
he was taken to the Censorate.

436
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,200
When I meant to ask around
about the situation,

437
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:10,990
someone else came

438
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:13,270
from the Ministry of Justice.

439
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:15,200
Then I followed them there.

440
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:16,640
Not even

441
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,310
an hour later,

442
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,310
he was moved to

443
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,750
the Court of Judicial Review.

444
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:24,230
There

445
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:26,270
those of the Censorate

446
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:29,920
were waiting for him as I expected.

447
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,160
They took him away.

448
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,200
I followed them to the Censorate.

449
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,750
I went here and there.

450
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,200
So

451
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,790
what's the status now?

452
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:40,640
How would I know?

453
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,840
I ran after him all day.

454
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,440
I didn't get to ask around.

455
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,990
He's the son of Vice Minister of Revenue.

456
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,120
It's hard to ruin him.

457
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:49,680
I know.

458
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,750
Armored in court?

459
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:52,600
Yes.

460
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,550
Besides,

461
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,640
Weiwu Marquis stated his ancestors' merits.

462
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:56,790
He accused Mr. Zhou

463
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:58,510
in tears of conniving in the kidnapping

464
00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:00,160
of his son by Zhou Li

465
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,680
in front of His Majesty

466
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,310
and demanded justice

467
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,310
to not disappoint all the soldiers.

468
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:09,230
What was that to do with them?

469
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:11,310
He simply needed a pretext.

470
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,030
What did Father say?

471
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:14,600
His Majesty fumed.

472
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:16,200
He ordered Judicial Review,

473
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,880
Justice, and Censorate

474
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:19,920
to solve the case in two days.

475
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:22,510
Be gentle,

476
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:23,350
old fart!

477
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,470
Get out!

478
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:26,310
Go away!

479
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,310
When will Father come?

480
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,200
Well,

481
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:32,200
he's still at the Judicial Review.

482
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,790
He'll go to the Censorate later,

483
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,470
so he can't come today.

484
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,840
How dare the Judicial Review

485
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,440
and the Censorate

486
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,550
torture me!

487
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,920
Once I'm out,

488
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,510
I'll impeach them!

489
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:49,310
Don't worry.

490
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,600
His Majesty gave them two days.

491
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:52,920
If your statement

492
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,640
matches our ministry's

493
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,640
and you deny it,

494
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:57,160
when the time is up,

495
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,440
we'll turn things around.

496
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,230
The other two departments

497
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,360
can't do anything else.

498
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:05,350
Then

499
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,270
all we need is a scapegoat

500
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,200
to end everything.

501
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:12,070
I did not do it!

502
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:13,150
That's it!

503
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:14,070
Yes. Right.

504
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,750
Scapegoat?

505
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:22,800
Yes.

506
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,200
I know a person.

507
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:28,960
Xu Qi'an.

508
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:34,230
We had a fight earlier.

509
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,750
It makes sense if we say

510
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:39,510
he did it.

511
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:47,590
Senior Song!

512
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:49,680
What's the rush?

513
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,550
That genius,

514
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:51,550
Xu Qi'an, is here

515
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:52,640
to see you!

516
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,750
(Man-Horse Graft)
Check out my latest work.

517
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:01,960
You said

518
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:04,270
plants and animals can't be grafted.

519
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,750
It made me think

520
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,990
about animals and animals.

521
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,040
Look,

522
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:11,640
this is my theory.

523
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:14,400
It's been put into practice.

524
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,120
Look.

525
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:22,230
See?

526
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:25,160
Grafting soldiers onto horses

527
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,550
can solve the shortage of war-horses.

528
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,480
Then

529
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:29,750
a soldier is

530
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:30,880
also a horse,

531
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:32,160
able to go far and fast

532
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,470
and fight bravely.

533
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:37,710
Our combat ability will grow significantly!

534
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:39,160
What do you think?

535
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:40,230
Have a try.

536
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:43,830
Come on.

537
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:44,760
Hop on.

538
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:45,840
- I...
- Try it.

539
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,310
- Come on.
- Wait...

540
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:48,200
- Try it.
- I...

541
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,600
Don't be shy.

542
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,550
See? Isn't it great?

543
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:56,150
Have a ride.

544
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:57,470
No, thanks.

545
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:58,680
Look,

546
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:01,200
I came for a favor.

547
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:09,800
Go back.

548
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:24,310
What is it?

549
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:26,400
Senior Song,

550
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,840
here's the thing.

551
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,160
I annoyed Mr. Zhou.

552
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,510
You know that.

553
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,960
Yes. Caiwei told me.

554
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,310
I'm sorry.

555
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:37,030
We don't interfere in court affairs.

556
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,040
Besides,

557
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,790
Vice Minister Zhou of Revenue

558
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:41,750
is way beyond a humble alchemist like me.

559
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:43,160
Hear me out.

560
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:45,550
What you need to do is simple.

561
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,360
Gazing Spell?

562
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,270
No way.

563
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:56,990
I'm upright and honest.

564
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:59,310
I'd never do such things.

565
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,030
Sorry, I'm abrupt.

566
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,400
Well then,

567
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:04,960
let's go back

568
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,990
to talk about your graft.

569
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:10,070
(Fish-Beast Graft)
Honestly,

570
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,840
(Man-Fish Graft)
these theories

571
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:14,400
won't work.

572
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,120
Why is that?

573
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,070
Did my teacher tell you the same thing?

574
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:20,230
You still don't know

575
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:22,470
why he disapproved of you

576
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:25,440
or the real reason behind it.

577
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:26,680
Do you?

578
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,710
I've never done any research,

579
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:30,710
but I can tell you

580
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:32,640
the rationale.

581
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,880
Do you know

582
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,360
reproductive isolation?

583
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,880
Reproduction, yes.

584
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:42,920
Isolation...?

585
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,440
What about it?

586
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,600
What's it to do with my work?

587
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,440
They...

588
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:47,920
Do you still remember

589
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:50,790
the principle of alchemy is...?

590
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:54,400
Equivalent exchange!

591
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,040
Right.

592
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:14,680
Don't let them in.

593
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,200
Go. Stop them.

594
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,120
Don't let them in!

595
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,160
What are you doing?

596
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,710
Isn't the questioning tomorrow?

597
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:23,270
His Majesty ordered me

598
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:24,680
to join the questioning.

599
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:26,630
Let go of me!

600
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:27,710
Hands off!

601
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:29,390
Zhou Li,

602
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:32,270
did you kidnap Weiwu Marquis's son?

603
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,280
No, sir.

604
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:34,990
I'm innocent.

605
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,360
I didn't do it.

606
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,920
It wasn't me. Let me go!

607
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:39,880
(Notice)

608
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,680
In the 36th year of Yuanjing,

609
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:43,510
Vice Minister Zhou of Revenue

610
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:45,470
is sent into exile

611
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:46,640
for corruption

612
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,270
and connivance.

613
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:50,160
So is his son

614
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:53,030
Zhou Li, for kidnapping the son

615
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,120
of Weiwu Marquis.

616
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,440
So you

617
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,510
bribed an alchemist of the Bureau?

618
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,680
How rude.

619
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:05,840
Alchemists

620
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,310
can't be bribed.

621
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:08,350
It's an

622
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:10,550
equivalent exchange.

623
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:12,360
Wait.

624
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:16,160
Did we cross the line?

625
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:18,400
Cijiu,

626
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,840
you're such a nerd.

627
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:23,470
Don't you know

628
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:26,120
the weak will be bullied?

629
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:28,440
Where are you going?

630
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:31,160
Backwardness

631
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:32,510
leaves us vulnerable.

632
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:35,360
With our backs to the wall,

633
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,270
we don't have a choice.

634
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:40,030
We fighting Zhou Li

635
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:41,680
is like an ant

636
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,990
shaking a tree.

637
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:45,640
But he's an ant

638
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:47,510
in front of the Bureau.

639
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:48,440
I didn't do it!

640
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:49,710
I didn't do it!

641
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:51,880
Hands off!

642
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,230
I swear, sir!

643
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:54,310
I'm innocent.

644
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:55,310
Really!

645
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:56,840
You aren't.

646
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,510
You're lying.

647
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:01,030
Are you also wondering why

648
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:02,270
the Marquis

649
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,070
and other officials

650
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,790
didn't see through

651
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:08,640
such a lame setup?

652
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:11,920
I've figured out part of it.

653
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,440
For Mr. Zhou's rivals,

654
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,600
it doesn't matter if Zhou Li

655
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:17,710
was wronged.

656
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,960
They just wanted to use him

657
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,030
to destroy his father.

658
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,840
As for the Marquis,

659
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,960
he could take revenge.

660
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,640
He had lost to Mr. Zhou

661
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:28,030
for the lack of help.

662
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:30,120
But this was a heaven-sent chance.

663
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,270
So that day, he showed up, armored,

664
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:33,790
provoking discussion in court.

665
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:36,440
He wasn't sure if his son

666
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:38,680
was taken by Zhou Li,

667
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:40,400
but before gathering evidence,

668
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:42,440
bringing down his rival was

669
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,960
his top priority.

670
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:48,200
You're a Prime Minister material.

671
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:52,030
We got lucky this time.

672
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,750
Next time,

673
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,680
anything can happen.

674
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,710
Cheer up.

675
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:07,760
Look,

676
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:10,470
as a student at the Yunlu Academy,

677
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,640
you have a bright future.

678
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,550
With your talent,

679
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:16,360
you might climb up the ladder

680
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,200
in a few years.

681
00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:19,110
Then

682
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,310
no one can harm the Xu Clan again.

683
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:24,710
And you?

684
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,070
What are you going to do?

685
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,480
I...

686
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:29,350
I...

687
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:30,790
I'm leaving.

688
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:32,270
(Xu Residence)
Where to?

689
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:33,710
No idea.

690
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:36,070
I can't stay here any longer.

691
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,880
I've been in jail twice

692
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,360
over the last few months.

693
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,440
The future of the Xu Clan

694
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,440
depends on you.

695
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,040
Cijiu,

696
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,070
how about I go to the south?

697
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,030
"Green tiles cover red buildings.

698
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,990
Green grass fills riverbanks."

699
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:54,310
Nice. It's settled.

700
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,230
Wait until my parents come back.

701
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,200
I hate to say goodbye.

702
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:02,720
Look,

703
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,510
give them these letters.

704
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,990
(To Uncle)
I wrote everything.

705
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,310
It's time to leave.

706
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:14,360
When I settle down,

707
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:15,710
I'll write to you.

708
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:19,070
Cousin,

709
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:20,590
take care.

710
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,990
When will you come back?

711
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:34,030
When you become powerful,

712
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,640
I'll return in glory.

713
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:39,990
(After I leave,)

714
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:42,270
(the Xu Clan will be safe.)

715
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:45,630
Ningyan,

716
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:46,960
play with me.

717
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:48,680
I'm trying to be sad.

718
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:49,790
Drop the act...

719
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:50,750
Leave me alone!

720
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,440
Wash the bottles

721
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,790
and jars again.

722
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:09,310
Senior Song,

723
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:10,640
thanks for your help.

724
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:12,110
You're welcome.

725
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:14,120
What's up?

726
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:16,230
Grand Princess wants to learn alchemy.

727
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:18,120
We're ordered to get prepared.

728
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:19,680
Grand Princess?

729
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:22,750
Is she also interested in alchemy?

730
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:25,470
She learns widely from others.

731
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:26,320
She comes to

732
00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:28,710
talk with us every month on the 15th.

733
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:31,160
But it's two days early this time.

734
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,990
So we're in a rush.

735
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:35,790
I won't hold you back.

736
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:37,360
I'm here to say goodbye

737
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,880
to you and Caiwei.

738
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:40,870
What?

739
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,070
Are you leaving?

740
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,000
Yes.

741
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:49,680
You know

742
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:52,120
the Xu Clan has been through a lot.

743
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:53,230
I'm a bit

744
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,240
tired.

745
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:57,360
"People part.

746
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,270
People reunite."

747
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:00,400
Senior Song,

748
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:01,590
thanks.

749
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,520
Take care.

750
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:04,760
And

751
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:06,600
here's something for you.

752
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:09,530
♪Time goes by♪

753
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,550
I promised you this.

754
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:14,160
(Codex)
It has what you need.

755
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:15,880
Alchemy takes

756
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:16,990
time and effort.

757
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:18,790
Only talents like you

758
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:20,360
can carry forward

759
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:21,750
what's in this book.

760
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,510
You're flattering me!

761
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:24,510
Trust me.

762
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,680
I'll read it carefully

763
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:29,510
and won't let you down.

764
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:30,400
It's 10 liang.

765
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:35,960
You want me to pay?

766
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:38,310
Yes.

767
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:42,710
Dear friends of the Bureau,

768
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:43,750
welcome to

769
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:46,790
the launch of the alchemy book.

770
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:47,760
Yes!

771
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,360
So, Senior Caiwei,

772
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,710
studying alchemy is hard,

773
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:53,680
isn't it?

774
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:54,680
Yes.

775
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,990
You're always worried

776
00:33:57,310 --> 00:33:58,360
about the effects.

777
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:01,160
You lose a lot of hair every day.

778
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:03,310
Stress eating makes you fat.

779
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:05,880
If there's a book

780
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,310
that can take your skills

781
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:09,070
to the next level at least,

782
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:10,840
- do you want it?
- Yes!

783
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,750
The one Senior Caiwei holds is called

784
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:16,360
How to Better Fake Tax Silver.

785
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:18,510
What's the market price?

786
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:20,710
It's in high demand.

787
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:22,070
The current market price is

788
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:23,600
25 liang each.

789
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,470
What?

790
00:34:24,470 --> 00:34:25,440
25 liang!

791
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,990
No, that's a lot.

792
00:34:26,990 --> 00:34:28,470
That's too much

793
00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:29,710
for our dear friends.

794
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:32,160
I have to give them a discount.

795
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,990
I'll sell directly to them.

796
00:34:33,990 --> 00:34:36,120
Cut out the middleman.

797
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,470
I'll bring down

798
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:38,590
the price!

799
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,880
Hadn't it been for the snacks,

800
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:47,160
I wouldn't have turned my elbow out.

801
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:49,880
It can only be turned out.

802
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:50,720
Here.

803
00:34:56,990 --> 00:34:57,960
Thanks, partner.

804
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,670
Knowledge is wealth.

805
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:19,450
Princess has arrived!

806
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:27,860
(Lin'an, Second Princess)

807
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,550
Who is this?

808
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:51,440
(Gang, Maid)
How dare you stare at her! Bow!

809
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:54,070
I apologize.

810
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:55,870
Gang,

811
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:56,800
be nice.

812
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:01,400
Please.

813
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,080
No.

814
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:04,960
After you.

815
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,800
(She)

816
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:14,400
(must be Princess Huaiqing,)

817
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:16,280
(the wisest lady in the Dafeng.)

818
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:19,400
(She's as perfect as they say,)

819
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:21,150
(so elegant)

820
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,070
(and graceful.)

821
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,400
I didn't know you'd come.

822
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,070
Hold on. I'll report to Supervisor.

823
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:35,070
No need.

824
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:36,280
We've been here before.

825
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,120
Gang,

826
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:38,400
how many times have I told you?

827
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:39,670
This is the Bureau.

828
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:40,760
We're here for business.

829
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,400
Be polite and smile, yes?

830
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:43,920
Princess Lin'an.

831
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:47,070
What... what brings you here?

832
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:48,720
Nothing. I came myself.

833
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,760
I learned a lot

834
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:51,880
from our last discussion

835
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,280
about alchemy.

836
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,190
I'm here to learn more.

837
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:56,680
Wait!

838
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,110
Let me report to my teacher.

839
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,200
No need.

840
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,550
Don't bother Supervisor.

841
00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:05,630
I know this place well.

842
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:07,510
Let's head to the Pill Room.

843
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:10,510
Sure.

844
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,320
Empty the Pill Room.

845
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:16,880
Careful, Your Highness.

846
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,440
Watch your step.

847
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,320
Careful.

848
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:29,400
It's empty?

849
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:34,590
How come?

850
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,720
I almost forgot.

851
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:40,760
Yesterday, a thief broke in

852
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,670
and took away everything.

853
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:43,960
Don't worry.

854
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,110
We're investigating it.

855
00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:46,510
No clues have been found yet.

856
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:47,990
You can come

857
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:48,990
another day.

858
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:49,920
No need.

859
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:53,400
Come in.

860
00:37:58,110 --> 00:37:59,280
Just now, I bought these

861
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,510
from the merchants

862
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:01,960
in the East Market.

863
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:04,350
Well,

864
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,150
you bought everything.

865
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,070
Fine. I'll show you

866
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:12,070
how to forge

867
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:13,170
a mirror.

868
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:15,360
Don't brush me off.

869
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:16,960
They say you've

870
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:20,070
figured out how to fake tax silver.

871
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,110
Huaiqing came to learn, too.

872
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:26,880
Yes. Right.

873
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:28,720
Even a talent

874
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:29,800
like her

875
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,630
can't make it easily,

876
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:33,240
let alone you.

877
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,960
Oh, Your Highness, I...

878
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,150
I didn't mean that.

879
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:43,960
I'm saying

880
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,240
you're

881
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:47,190
even more talented.

882
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:49,840
Doing such an easy experiment

883
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:51,510
is beneath you, right?

884
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,360
That's nice of you.

885
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:55,960
I want to have a try

886
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:58,590
and see if I'm

887
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,240
as skilled as Huaiqing.

888
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,470
Begin.

889
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:08,760
Step one,

890
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,400
melt the salt.

891
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:20,280
And filter it.

892
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,400
What's next?

893
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,320
Senior Song,

894
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:34,070
come here.

895
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:35,720
I forgot the next step.

896
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,190
Just...

897
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:40,590
put it on that stove.

898
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:42,400
The heat will

899
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,670
crystallize it.

900
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,800
I know step three.

901
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:51,800
Melt the crystals.

902
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:53,990
I brought a weapon with me.

903
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:54,990
Weapon?

904
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:57,280
Your bureau made it.

905
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,760
I've never seen it before.

906
00:39:58,760 --> 00:39:59,760
Calm down.

907
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,920
I know the spell.

908
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,800
H, He, Li, Be, B,

909
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,320
C, N, O, F, Ne,

910
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,070
Na, Mg, Al, Si, P, right?

911
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:09,030
Wait!

912
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:16,760
Senior Song!

913
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,090
- Are you hurt?
- Are you hurt?

914
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:25,960
Your Highness,

915
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:29,720
faking tax silver is dangerous.

916
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:32,070
One lapse ruins everything.

917
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:33,720
That weapon of yours

918
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:35,920
wasn't made by us!

919
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:39,470
How about this?

920
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:41,840
When the tools arrive,

921
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,280
we can continue.

922
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:47,070
I know what I did wrong.

923
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:50,840
Let's try again!

924
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:53,400
Help!

925
00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:55,280
Help!

926
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,400
It worked.

927
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,320
Crystals melted.

928
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:01,550
Watch the voltage.

929
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:04,050
- What's that?
- The force of thunder.

930
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:05,570
Watch out!

931
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,240
Princess!

932
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:10,470
Again!

933
00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:26,470
Do no wrong.

934
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:29,110
And fear no Guardians.

935
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,470
Guardians?

936
00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:33,510
Hand off.

937
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:34,350
Be serious.

938
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:38,280
Are you Xu Qi'an?

939
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:42,760
Speak.

940
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,720
Yes, I am.

941
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:46,760
Good.

942
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:47,630
Come with us.

943
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,120
Wait...

944
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:50,080
Sirs,

945
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:51,550
I'm innocent.

946
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:53,110
Do no wrong,

947
00:41:53,110 --> 00:41:54,670
and fear no Guardians.
