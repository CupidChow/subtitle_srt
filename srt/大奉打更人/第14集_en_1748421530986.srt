1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,040
Let you watch Da Feng fighting with people.

2
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:27,520
No. 1.

3
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:28,600
No. 3.

4
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:30,920
Did you find me in the hiding place?

5
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:34,360
Anyone?

6
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:36,600
I didn't sleep for the night.

7
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,720
Why are you fighting?

8
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,520
What happened?

9
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:44,600
Chief.

10
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,360
The security guard was found.

11
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,120
What?

12
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,600
What's the situation?

13
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:51,880
Do you need help?

14
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:52,600
No.

15
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,280
I haven't exposed myself.

16
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:56,960
What are you talking about?

17
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,280
What's the security guard?

18
00:00:58,680 --> 00:00:59,440
The security guard

19
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:02,200
was a waste of his life in the capital.

20
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,640
The children I saved

21
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,160
were all delivered there.

22
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:07,400
These years,

23
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,280
he has been a mischievous man.

24
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,640
He was a child who didn't have a place to live in.

25
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,000
And he had a bunch of ungrateful children.

26
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,080
He was a carefree man.

27
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:17,800
But today,

28
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,920
the court suddenly remembered that place.

29
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,240
I'll kill you.

30
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,080
Take the two families away.

31
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,040
You guys.

32
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:29,520
Chief.

33
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:31,760
Chief.

34
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,840
We're at the storage room.

35
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:33,840
Please come closer.

36
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,760
I'm here to help.

37
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,200
Okay.

38
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,200
Clean it up.

39
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,840
You clean the upstairs.

40
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,480
I thought they were going to rush me.

41
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,400
They wanted to take the security guard and interrogate me.

42
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,200
But...

43
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,400
But they've been disfigured.

44
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,920
They even made up for the money they had

45
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,680
to withdraw.

46
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,480
The security guard

47
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,320
has been there several times.

48
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,600
But they were all kicked out.

49
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,240
I know.

50
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,240
If there's no special reason,

51
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,200
it's impossible for money to be sent down.

52
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,560
I see.

53
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:19,520
No.

54
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,680
You made it in the capital?

55
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,200
It wasn't me.

56
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,800
It wasn't you?

57
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,200
This kind of good news

58
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,880
can't be No. 4, right?

59
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,040
It's not No. 4.

60
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,760
It's neither No. 1 nor No. 4.

61
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,920
It's only in the capital.

62
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,720
No. 3.

63
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,040
You can't stand me anymore.

64
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,480
I'm not the one who likes to be criticized by the court.

65
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,840
Don't worry about this.

66
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,160
I'll send others to investigate.

67
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,920
It'll kill me for what I've done.

68
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,160
Are you talking to me?

69
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,280
It's Mr. Wei.

70
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:16,800
Uncle,

71
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,880
Anji restaurant is a little折 red.

72
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,360
The guard couldn't come out.

73
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,320
They took our squad and group for us.

74
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:24,720
Great.

75
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,000
It's just a place where the Wu family can stay.

76
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,280
There's one more thing, Yang Yan.

77
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,160
Yes.

78
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,920
Leave it to Li Yuchun.

79
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,440
Do you know my intention?

80
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,520
Yes.

81
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,800
Why don't you go ask former Aimong Wu to be back?

82
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,960
Shoot Star Alabama.

83
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,720
I perform surgery on you,

84
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:23,280
as well as taking pills for you.

85
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:23,980
Go!

86
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,340
You people do have theater knife skills.

87
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,660
They think you suck!

88
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,120
Thief!

89
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,560
You are disguised if you don't know how to distinguish.

90
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,880
Tell you,

91
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:47,300
send Liu Xianling back.

92
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:49,600
Yes.

93
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:52,680
Get out!

94
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,880
I'm here to find out the reason.

95
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,200
We're going to take the high-ranking official

96
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,360
and take him to the room.

97
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:08,880
Come and catch me.

98
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:09,720
Come on.

99
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,400
Catch him.

100
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,480
Come and catch me.

101
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,600
Catch me.

102
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,800
Catch him.

103
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:15,760
Catch him.

104
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,760
Catch him.

105
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,720
Catch him.

106
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,520
Catch him.

107
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,240
Catch him.

108
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,320
Catch him.

109
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,320
Catch him.

110
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,320
Catch him.

111
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,160
Catch him.

112
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,200
Catch him.

113
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,040
Catch him.

114
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,120
Catch him.

115
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,040
volnaise him to the Sir knocking for money.

116
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:27,760
Go, go.

117
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:28,840
Catch him, go.

118
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:29,920
Catch him, go.

119
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,760
You're cheating.

120
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,480
Catch him.

121
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,600
Catch him.

122
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,440
Catch him.

123
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,640
Catch him.

124
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,040
Come, come on.

125
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:40,640
Ca minuscule.

126
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,280
It's getting late.

127
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,040
This is not my first time.

128
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:47,960
Is it $9?

129
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,160
What's wrong?

130
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,160
What's wrong?

131
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,360
What's wrong?

132
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,360
What's wrong?

133
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,360
What's wrong?

134
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,360
What's wrong?

135
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,360
Get out.

136
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,360
Auntie.

137
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,360
The Taikang County is being taken to prison.

138
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,360
I thought the Wei Palace would be opened.

139
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,760
It's because of you.

140
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:08,360
You reminded me that the Great Wall was heavily damaged.

141
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,360
Once the mountains are covered, the people's lives will be in danger.

142
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,360
You asked me to plead for the Taikang County.

143
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,360
You...

144
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,760
What did the Wei Palace say?

145
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:19,960
I don't know.

146
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,160
The Great Wall is in a small place.

147
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,560
How did the Kuizu know about it?

148
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,360
This is under the skin of the Great Wall.

149
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:32,360
You mean, someone is colluding with the Kuizu?

150
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:37,960
The Great Wall is the foundation of the Taikang County.

151
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:42,360
The county magistrate didn't report it to the Kuizu's family.

152
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,760
The county magistrate is the foundation of the Kuizu's family.

153
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,760
He has already handed it to the county magistrate.

154
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,160
He's in the interrogation.

155
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:54,360
But he's already forgotten about the Kuizu's family.

156
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,760
Thanks to the Wei Palace.

157
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,560
Interesting.

158
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,760
What do you mean?

159
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,960
The Wei Palace is a place of people.

160
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,560
But it's a place of people.

161
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,760
It's a place of people.

162
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,760
The investigation and the study are all over.

163
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:12,360
There's no one to blame.

164
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,960
But there's a new idea.

165
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,560
The investigation is good.

166
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,960
I heard he won't be in the Palace.

167
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,760
A person like him can go to the same place.

168
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,360
And the Du Chanyuan.

169
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,160
It's really a great place.

170
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,760
You're so beautiful.

171
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,760
In my eyes.

172
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,760
You're different.

173
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,760
You're different.

174
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,160
You're different.

175
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,560
Kill!

176
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,960
In the past.

177
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,360
The power of the power of the country.

178
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,760
The power of the power of the country.

179
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,960
The power of the power.

180
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,960
No one knows his quality.

181
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,160
Follow me.

182
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,960
The Linyuan Pass in the past.

183
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,560
The Wei Palace is a three-man army.

184
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,760
It only took a few months.

185
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:52,160
No one is able to beat attention.

186
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:42,320
Nai

187
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,320
The Great Phoenix is not just a sign of the Great Phoenix.

188
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,320
It's also called the Great Phoenix God.

189
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,320
Most of the high-ranking scholars of the Great Phoenix

190
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,320
are starting to follow the Great Phoenix at that time.

191
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,320
The ancient Taoism was established

192
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:00,320
and it has grown into a unique face.

193
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,320
So...

194
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,320
You understand, right?

195
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:08,320
I'm not a great fan of the Great Phoenix.

196
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,320
I'm just a fan of the Great Phoenix.

197
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:14,320
This is a下去 Xbox.

198
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,320
It's easier for you to say it.

199
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,040
Great!

200
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,320
Great!

201
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,080
I heard that the execution period of The King of Zhenbei used to be

202
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,080
in the past.

203
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,520
Now it seems that the highlighting history of Wei…!

204
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,320
What?

205
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,320
Yet Wei Gong died.

206
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,520
But what are the reasons that he died?

207
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:37,320
Wei Gong didn't start fighting with anyone since he was rzevent.

208
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,480
He died as he paid theuguese taxes.

209
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,080
Why?

210
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,480
No one knows about the disaster.

211
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,080
You don't know how to talk.

212
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,680
I have no chance to ask this question.

213
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,080
So you must forget about it.

214
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:58,880
Come.

215
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,880
Didn't you go to the Great Wall with us?

216
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,880
Did you get rid of the security guard?

217
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:02,880
What's the name of it?

218
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,880
Master Xu, we finally found you.

219
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:05,880
Please come in.

220
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:06,880
Chu Caiwei.

221
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:07,680
Yes.

222
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:15,680
Did you kill him?

223
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,680
No.

224
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,280
Go down.

225
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:24,680
Next.

226
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,480
Did you kill him?

227
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:36,680
No.

228
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,080
What?

229
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,080
No.

230
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,280
Go down.

231
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,280
Miss Chu, Master Xu is here.

232
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:54,280
Xu Xi, you're so poor.

233
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,880
What's going on?

234
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,280
It's all your fault.

235
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:02,080
It's all your fault.

236
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,480
Your fault?

237
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,280
About your fault?

238
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,880
I used your magic.

239
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:11,280
I was so ill that I wanted to take care of it.

240
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,480
But Cheng Hanguang agreed.

241
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:15,880
Isn't it good?

242
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,280
What's good?

243
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,680
Cheng Hanguang, that bastard.

244
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,080
He said I don't need to go to the gate.

245
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,080
I'm responsible for the foreign affairs.

246
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,080
The so-called foreign affairs?

247
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,280
He said that

248
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,280
he wanted me to use the forgotten numbers

249
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,880
to look at all of them.

250
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,880
I was responsible for three or five of them.

251
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,480
Look at his head.

252
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,880
He has hundreds of people.

253
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,480
I forgot about it

254
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,680
for days.

255
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,280
I forgot my eyes,

256
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,480
my head and my head.

257
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,480
That's right.

258
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,880
I can use the forgotten numbers.

259
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,680
I didn't think of it before.

260
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,280
I don't care.

261
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,480
I can't forget it now.

262
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,680
Since you're here,

263
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,080
I'll leave the case to you.

264
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,880
I'll leave it to you.

265
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,080
I'll leave it to you.

266
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,080
I'll leave it to you.

267
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:11,480
Take a look.

268
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,680
The deceased is called Liu Han.

269
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:18,280
He's a minor officer of the Imperial Guard.

270
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,680
He was killed last night.

271
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,080
He was killed on the spot.

272
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,080
He was nowhere to be found.

273
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,880
He lost his money.

274
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,480
He didn't break the door windows.

275
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,280
Probably the first person to be killed.

276
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,080
The deceased was a minor officer.

277
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,080
From the perspective of his head,

278
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,480
he died instantly.

279
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,480
He didn't have a real life.

280
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:44,280
It seems that the deceased is not only known to the killer,

281
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,280
but also a person who is very close

282
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,680
or afraid of him.

283
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,680
How did you find out?

284
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,480
The normal person is in his study.

285
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:00,680
The job should be relaxed and easy.

286
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,480
It's not a serious matter.

287
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,880
Unless he's in front of him,

288
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,880
he has to be respectful.

289
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,280
That makes sense.

290
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,080
Mr. Xuan also said that

291
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,680
no one visited him last night.

292
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:16,480
He was also worried about others recently.

293
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,080
Maybe

294
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,880
we should ask Liu Han's nephew.

295
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:25,480
Liu Han's nephew is a minor officer of the Imperial Guard.

296
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,880
What should we do now?

297
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,080
Ask him to come in.

298
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,080
Yes.

299
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,680
This is the last one.

300
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,280
Zhou Bai Hu,

301
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,280
I ask you,

302
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,880
is Liu Han your nephew?

303
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,080
Yes.

304
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,480
Did he have any abnormalities recently?

305
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,280
No.

306
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,480
During his reign,

307
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,480
did he have any suspicious or unfairness in the imperial city?

308
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,080
No.

309
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:57,480
No?

310
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,880
Did he not find out?

311
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:04,080
He was a loyal man of the imperial city.

312
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,480
He was a single-minded person.

313
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,080
It's useless.

314
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:09,680
Unless

315
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,880
he took all the blame.

316
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,880
Or

317
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,080
you were the one who took the blame.

318
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,880
What do you mean?

319
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,080
Zhou Bai Hu,

320
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,480
I'm just doing my job.

321
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,880
Please cooperate.

322
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,280
I didn't take the blame.

323
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,280
Didn't you work for someone?

324
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,680
You can check my letter.

325
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,880
I, Zhou Chixiong,

326
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,880
didn't do anything bad.

327
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,680
Do you have anything else to ask?

328
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,680
I have something to do.

329
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,680
I'll leave first.

330
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,480
I'll leave first.

331
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:57,880
Thank you for your cooperation.

332
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,280
He didn't lie.

333
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,280
He's so naive.

334
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,880
I shouldn't have.

335
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,680
I thought I was too much.

336
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,280
Miss Chu,

337
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,880
there are 181 people outside the door.

338
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,080
Do you want to continue?

339
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,480
What?

340
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,280
I have something to do.

341
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,480
I won't delay your case.

342
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:35,880
What do you mean?

343
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,480
You're so naive.

344
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,480
You taught me to be the best.

345
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:47,080
You really don't care about me.

346
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,880
I'm going to tear my eyes off.

347
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,280
Help me.

348
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,480
Have you ever heard

349
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,480
the sword of the sword of the sword?

350
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,480
Six, two, three,

351
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,480
four, five,

352
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,480
six, seven,

353
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,480
eight,

354
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,480
seven,

355
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,480
two,

356
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,480
close your eyes.

357
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,080
Five, four, five,

358
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,080
six, seven,

359
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:10,080
eight.

360
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,480
I knew it.

361
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,480
You're so naive.

362
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,480
You're so naive.

363
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,480
You're so naive.

364
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,480
You're so naive.

365
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,480
You're so naive.

366
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,640
You will be persistent.

367
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,240
You will be late every day.

368
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,760
You will be able to

369
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,000
get up in the morning.

370
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,280
That's great.

371
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:29,880
Do you have any more?

372
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:30,680
Keep teaching.

373
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,320
I'll go back

374
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,360
and recommend you to the people in the private room.

375
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,680
And the last episode.

376
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,680
It's called

377
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:38,840
the eye-catching of the round-trip in the sun.

378
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,960
Put the thumb on the sun.

379
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,400
Use your fingers

380
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,600
to control your eye-catching.

381
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,480
Next time,

382
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,560
you should teach him.

383
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,840
Brother, you will die soon.

384
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:49,280
Be gentle.

385
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,720
The sun can be light.

386
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,560
One, two, three, four, five,

387
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,320
six, seven, eight.

388
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:58,160
Two, two, three, four, five,

389
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,880
six, seven, eight.

390
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:02,800
Three, two, three, four, five,

391
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,400
six, seven, eight.

392
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:48,560
Read the letter

393
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,580
and officials� ahh

394
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:51,720
sent us

395
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:06,000
That's all

396
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,620
Why did the people

397
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,040
let the secret 110

398
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,160
protect Huangshan security

399
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,720
hold on to the limited

400
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,560
The grudges left

401
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,560
I'll give you a hand if you get more than four bottles.

402
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,560
Bi!

403
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,560
Don't be a nuisance.

404
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,560
Why are you so shy?

405
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,560
What's wrong with you?

406
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,560
You always sleep in a daze.

407
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,560
We went to the cellar to study behind you.

408
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,560
No.

409
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,560
Wei said that I was in a calm state during the training period.

410
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,560
I only need to be stable during the day

411
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,560
before I sleep.

412
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,560
You're in a state of mental state?

413
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,560
What?

414
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,560
You're in a state of mental state?

415
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,560
I don't know why.

416
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,560
I feel very strong now.

417
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,560
I can't believe it.

418
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,560
No, you talk too much.

419
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,560
Say a few more words.

420
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,560
Let's talk.

421
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,560
Well, I...

422
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,560
I...

423
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,560
I'm Feng Jingxiu.

424
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,560
I'm Zhang Bohunian.

425
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,560
I'm a water figure.

426
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,560
I'm a fish.

427
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,560
What am I saying?

428
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,560
Say a few more words.

429
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,560
Ningning.

430
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,560
I'm a water figure.

431
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,560
I'm a water figure.

432
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,560
I'm a water figure.

433
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,560
I'm a water figure.

434
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,560
I'm a water figure.

435
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,560
I'm a water figure.

436
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,560
I'm a water figure.

437
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,560
I'm a water figure.

438
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,560
I'm a water figure.

439
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,560
I'm a water figure.

440
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,560
I'm a water figure.

441
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,560
I'm a water figure.

442
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,560
I'm a water figure.

443
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,560
I'm a water figure.

444
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:47,560
I'm a water figure.

445
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,560
I'm a water figure.

446
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,560
I'm a water figure.

447
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:13,560
Your汉 herder president only had work to do.

448
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,160
So they met a long time ago.

449
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,840
They had gone to visit me once,

450
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,520
so they don't feel guilty about it anymore.

451
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:19,800
However,

452
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,860
Chief Master will Americans

453
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,960
decide to give me at my side this time.

454
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:24,920
So, I'm willing to.

455
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,600
I'm getting tired

456
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,400
so I can leave here immediately.

457
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,100
I can't command the Am free army with her,

458
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,480
yet she can't think very well of anyone.

459
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,360
Marsh.

460
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,620
What are you holding?

461
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,640
совсем at last?

462
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,660
Could it have been Ling'an?

463
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,680
If I hadn't magallynned with Stark,

464
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,320
I thought I would beCKed

465
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,980
so I really want to die.

466
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,360
Ling'er.

467
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,160
Uncle Wang.

468
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,960
You don't come to visit Uncle Wang.

469
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,360
The 16th Prince's family has lost their way.

470
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,560
They can't go on a trip.

471
00:24:56,360 --> 00:25:00,560
Have you received any news from Pingyang recently?

472
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:05,960
Recently,

473
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:09,760
Pingyang sister has brought news.

474
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:13,160
She said she was fine.

475
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,560
I hope you don't need to worry.

476
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,360
That's good.

477
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:22,560
That's good.

478
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,360
Uncle Wang,

479
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,960
the blessing is coming.

480
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,360
Ling'er,

481
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:31,360
don't worry.

482
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,960
Go to the house and sit down.

483
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,360
ō

484
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,160
you are so unavoidable.

485
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,760
I have to inform my mother.

486
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:42,960
Stop writing,

487
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:43,860
keep a clean phone.

488
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:58,860
Take a look-

489
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,460
when I meet Uncle Wang.

490
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:02,020
Since your time,

491
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:03,960
let me examine your new method

492
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:04,920
in order to show you

493
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,000
that it is very powerful.

494
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,000
Your de Janeiro and you

495
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,040
please take care of it

496
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,240
until you get better.

497
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,260
If you accept it,

498
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,000
alright.

499
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:12,820
Thanks.

500
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:13,420
Gonghuang.

501
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:19,340
valid作风之气

502
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:22,500
浩荡无今日

503
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:27,060
为我结成

504
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:30,340
拜 sigma

505
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:35,940
Jianghe's water will break

506
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:37,300
users

507
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:41,220
Gonghuang is heinous

508
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:45,220
I've never seen this kind of symptoms before.

509
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:47,220
But it's too far away.

510
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:48,220
I can't see the details.

511
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:50,220
That's right.

512
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:03,220
I remember today is the day of the royal family of the royal family.

513
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:05,220
No. 1, No. 3, is it true?

514
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:09,220
The time of the death is indeed the day of the family of the family.

515
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:12,220
No. 1 is not in the line.

516
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:15,220
No. 3 is not in the line either.

517
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:18,220
Interesting.

518
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:23,220
No. 2 is testing my identity.

519
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:26,220
But No. 1 is not in the line either.

520
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:28,220
He's also in the line.

521
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:31,220
Who is it?

522
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:35,220
Help me!

523
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:38,220
Help me!

524
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:43,220
Did you hear any strange sound?

525
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:46,220
You mean the music of the quarter?

526
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:49,220
I heard that it's a bit...

527
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:50,220
It's a bit expensive.

528
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:52,220
Help me!

529
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:55,220
Help me!

530
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:06,220
Don't, don't, don't.

531
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:08,220
You can see them. Don't.

532
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:12,220
Hurry up, hurry up.

533
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:14,220
They'll be here soon.

534
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:17,220
Uncle, there's a situation over there.

535
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:20,220
No, did you really not hear it?

536
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:22,220
No.

537
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:24,220
You must have been taught by us to be a fan.

538
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:27,220
You're already a fan of the show.

539
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:29,220
Help me!

540
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:32,220
No, it's true. Listen to me.

541
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:34,220
Don't look at me.

542
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:39,220
No. 1 is in the line either.

543
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:08,220
Protect His Majesty!

544
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:11,220
Protect His Majesty!

545
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:14,220
Protect His Majesty!

546
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:16,220
Wait.

547
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:19,220
Protect the Empress.

548
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:21,220
No.

549
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:26,220
Hurry up, protect His Majesty!

550
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:37,220
Protect His Majesty!

551
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:50,220
I can't!

552
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:53,220
Be careful!

553
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:06,220
Help!

554
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:10,220
Protect His Majesty!

555
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:33,220
Princess.

556
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:35,220
Princess, are you okay?

557
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:37,220
Are you okay?

558
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:42,220
Princess.

559
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:52,220
I'm Xu Qian, a special guest.

560
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:54,220
I'm the Princess.

561
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:58,220
Princess, why are you here?

562
00:30:58,220 --> 00:30:59,220
Hurry up.

563
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:01,220
Hurry up.

564
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:03,220
Yes.

565
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:06,220
You're Xu Qian?

566
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:12,220
Yes, I'm Xia Bin.

567
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:17,220
Father!

568
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:27,220
Your Majesty, I'm here.

569
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:30,220
No one has to come in.

570
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:32,220
Yes.

571
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:35,220
Your Majesty.

572
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:05,220
Your Majesty.

573
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:35,220
Your Majesty.

574
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:07,220
What can I do with the first item?

575
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:10,220
I have a long-standing daughter.

576
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:14,220
She's not as strong as the ordinary.

577
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:19,220
She's a few years more alive than the ordinary.

578
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:24,220
I lost all my enemies when I was 20.

579
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:27,220
I was the one who lost.

580
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:31,220
No one can compare with me.

581
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:39,220
But I found out that the biggest enemy

582
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:42,220
was Xu Qian.

583
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:05,220
Your Majesty.

584
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:35,220
Your Majesty.

585
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:42,220
Go on.

586
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:44,220
Yes.

587
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:46,220
Go on.

588
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:48,220
Go on.

589
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:52,220
Go on!

590
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:54,220
Go on!

591
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:57,220
Go on.

592
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:59,220
Go on.

593
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:01,220
Go on.

594
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:03,220
Go on.

595
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:10,220
Your Highness, the ceremony is over.

596
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:12,220
Where are we going?

597
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:14,220
Don't worry. You'll know when we arrive.

598
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:25,220
This is...

599
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:27,220
You can go.

600
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:29,220
Your Highness, what's the meaning of this?

601
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:31,220
Did I do something wrong at home?

602
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:34,220
I should be in this forest.

603
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:35,220
Ling'an is loyal to you.

604
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:37,220
I don't want you to get in touch with him.

605
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:42,220
Don't go so far.

606
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:44,220
What if he follows you?

607
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:47,220
Zhihong, let's go.

608
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:49,220
This is the Moon-like incense.

609
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:51,220
It smells like the sword.

610
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:53,220
Moon-like...

611
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:55,220
like the Lord.

612
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:06,220
Shangguan Xixue.

613
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:08,220
You're the future Empress.

614
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:10,220
You can't be together with the temple.

615
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:12,220
Father, you're a father.

616
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:14,220
You're a father.

617
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:16,220
You're a father.

618
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:18,220
You can't be together with the temple.

619
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:41,080
I have

620
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:50,400
The

621
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:58,400
unfortunately

622
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:08,280
has been

623
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,400
Before the machine gun was blown away,

624
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,640
the channel saw a Entertainment L grytmer

625
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,400
in Sang De'll City.

626
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,360
I also found out

627
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,920
but I lost again.

628
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,440
So,

629
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,720
there have been many demon fort裝

630
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,880
or demons

631
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:24,760
coming near the capital with authoritarian mainstream.

632
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,600
Spusu, theiors,

633
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:27,900
eventually replaced the

634
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:29,040
member of guard in economical foundation.

635
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:31,280
But it is a upright business.

636
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:32,740
So, which值

637
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:34,420
dare get into formally how about them?

638
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:36,800
Maybe someone from the troops

639
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,800
But Sang Bo was secretly hiding it.

640
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,800
No. 3, why did you ask yourself that?

641
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:43,800
I have a friend.

642
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:46,800
He heard Sang Bo Hu asking for help.

643
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,800
Is Sang Bo Hu...
