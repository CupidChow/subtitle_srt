1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,560
Yes

2
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:02,560
Treat people.

3
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:03,640
And keep in touch.

4
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:05,200
Retreat in punishment,

5
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:12,520
willШ

6
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,160
You'll die if you live up to my informant.

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:17,760
Thank you, Your Majesty.

8
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:22,800
That's perfect.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,900
身上ジャケ

10
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:33,360
危险

11
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:59,240
Lemon

12
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,200
I'm asking RICHEN

13
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:02,720
why he made a suddenIf

14
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:03,720
!!!!

15
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:04,040
Chop!

16
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,120
add fire?

17
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,640
Maybe he is out from theft

18
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:12,800
Or the hisf

19
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,560
I'm curious

20
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:24,120
whether you get

21
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,440
the companion of Xu

22
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,480
for a moment

23
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:29,880
in Binyutu

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,120
and can do something for the court.

25
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:45,880
Form perimeter of the Imperial City

26
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,080
is more powerful.

27
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:50,320
However,

28
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,720
no one

29
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,720
will step out of the Imperial City randomly.

30
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:56,340
Yes.

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You just said that Prince of Zhenbei

32
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
hasn't returned to the capital for some years.

33
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Yes.

34
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Come back tomorrow.

35
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I'll ask him to come back.

36
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Heng Yuan still doesn't want to be in the company.

37
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
He doesn't want to be in the company this year.

38
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Heng Yuan is in the company to find the fourth brother and assassinate Ping Yuanbo.

39
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
He's also missing from the Sangbo explosion.

40
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I think he has something to do with Sangbo case.

41
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I have a guess.

42
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Heng Yuan's junior brother Heng Hui

43
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
escaped from Pingyang.

44
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
He might have used a method that can be used to avoid the attack.

45
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
And this thing might have been originated from Qinglongtang.

46
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I want to go to Qinglongtang to ask for a ID.

47
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Qinglongtang is a place in the heaven and earth.

48
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
It's a long way.

49
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Xiaorou.

50
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Eunuch Wei.

51
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Go to Qinglongtang to check

52
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
if there are any illegal weapons that can be used to avoid the attack

53
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
and the person who is Heng Hui and Heng Yuan.

54
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Yes.

55
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Thank you, sir.

56
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Eunuch Wei.

57
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I've made an appointment with the manager.

58
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I hope I can find Heng Yuan as soon as possible.

59
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I didn't expect that

60
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Princess Huaiqing and Princess Lian'an

61
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
all treat you as their family.

62
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Princess Lian'an is more like a play.

63
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
She wants to take her position back.

64
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I didn't expect that.

65
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I really didn't expect that.

66
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Uncle, stop talking.

67
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Do you think it's a good thing?

68
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
It's a good thing.

69
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
There are three cases today.

70
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
It's a lot of risk.

71
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
If it wasn't for me, I would have been in trouble.

72
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I'll be in the prison in the capital.

73
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Brother, it's you.

74
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
You have a couple of daughters.

75
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Now you're the head of the family.

76
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Do you want to go back to the family?

77
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Princess Lian'an is a play.

78
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
She's lying.

79
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
But she saved me after all.

80
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
She doesn't want you to be her face.

81
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Then you must be a playboy.

82
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Do you think your face is a good official?

83
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
She's also a playboy.

84
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
But I've been with her for a long time.

85
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Although she's not a big deal,

86
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
she's also a little bit arrogant.

87
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
But she's kind, kind,

88
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
kind-hearted,

89
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
and independent.

90
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
She's good to me.

91
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Do you like her?

92
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Uncle.

93
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
If you're in the prison,

94
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
you should go to the library to write a book.

95
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
You should have been famous for a long time.

96
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Look.

97
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I thought you were old.

98
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Uncle, you care about me.

99
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Xu's family is just a flat family.

100
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
How can we be so proud of you?

101
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Then, Princess Huaiqing.

102
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Princess Huaiqing?

103
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Calm,

104
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
kind,

105
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
and kind.

106
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
If it's her,

107
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I'm afraid that Da Feng

108
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
will never dare to provoke me again.

109
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Our old Xu family's future is stable and stable.

110
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
But Huaiqing is good,

111
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Linan is good.

112
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
You still have to be a two-star servant.

113
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
That's called being able to bear a lot of labor.

114
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Big Lang.

115
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
You're a person who's serving two workers.

116
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
But you're so kind-hearted.

117
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
How about this?

118
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
You introduce me to Princess Huaiqing.

119
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I can buy for our old Xu family's future.

120
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Mom.

121
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I'm going to buy for Princess Huaiqing.

122
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
What's the matter with her?

123
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Shut up.

124
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Mom.

125
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Shut up.

126
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
You're here.

127
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I'm here.

128
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
How's your brother's injury?

129
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
You're the third.

130
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Good.

131
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I'm the third brother.

132
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Xu Qi'an, the eldest brother.

133
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
You're the fourth.

134
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I'm the fourth master of Tianning Hui.

135
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
The third brother.

136
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
The third brother?

137
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Why?

138
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
The third brother is not willing to face me.

139
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Good.

140
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
You know that

141
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
my second brother is a student of Yunlu Academy.

142
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
He's been in a hurry recently.

143
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
He's in the academy and can't get a share.

144
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
But don't worry.

145
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
My second brother has already told me everything about this.

146
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Right, brother?

147
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Fourth brother.

148
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Ask the sixth if he's here.

149
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Sixth.

150
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
No.

151
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
What's this operation?

152
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
A transmission.

153
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Isn't it a transmission

154
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
to go to the Yushu little mirror to pass?

155
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
How do you know?

156
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
My second brother told me.

157
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Brother Liao.

158
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
When did you get the new function?

159
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Why didn't you tell me your second brother?

160
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
The Yushu little mirror

161
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
can be used to heal.

162
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
But at that time,

163
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I was seriously injured and had a serious injury.

164
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
So I temporarily closed the function.

165
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Only recently, I opened it again.

166
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Open?

167
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Close.

168
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Healing?

169
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
That's right.

170
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Look.

171
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
My second brother is still alive.

172
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
He's dead in my hand.

173
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Wait.

174
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Don't you know the truth?

175
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Okay.

176
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Let's talk about the truth.

177
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I've been searching for Heng Yuan's whereabouts with Fourth.

178
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
But until now,

179
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I only know where he's in the city

180
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
but I don't know where he's at.

181
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
You can't use the Yushu little mirror to locate him?

182
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I can.

183
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
But Heng Yuan,

184
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
that is, the Yushu little mirror on the sixth,

185
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
seems to be closed.

186
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
And closed?

187
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Third brother,

188
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
you came to us for a reason.

189
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Do you remember

190
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Heng Yuan said he was the one who killed his junior brother?

191
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
So what?

192
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I also know that

193
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Heng Yuan's junior brother Heng Hui

194
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
was the one who helped

195
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
some of the illegal weapons that could be used to hide from Princess Pingyang.

196
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
And this weapon could be used to hide from the illegal weapons

197
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
that could possibly have appeared on Zhou Zhixiong.

198
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
So that's the case.

199
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
So to speak,

200
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Heng Yuan's disappearance

201
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
has something to do with Sang Bo'an?

202
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
It's not clear.

203
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
The only way to find Heng Yuan is to find Heng Yuan as soon as possible.

204
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Then we can ask for the clue.

205
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Tell me.

206
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
What can I do?

207
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I have no choice.

208
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
But there is a place

209
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
that can run.

210
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Heng Yuan's boss?

211
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Yes.

212
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Heng Yuan used to come here to find Heng Hui's weapon.

213
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
He will come again if he can't keep up.

214
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
We can investigate it.

215
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Maybe...

216
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Maybe we can find Heng Yuan's clue.

217
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Let's go.

218
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Heng Yuan.

219
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Heng Yuan.

220
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Heng Yuan.

221
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Heng Yuan.

222
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Heng Yuan.

223
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Sir.

224
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Sir.

225
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
All the explosives in the city

226
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
will be kept in the garden

227
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
by those women and kids who came here.

228
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I think

229
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
they will be safe until the storm.

230
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I will send them off.

231
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
The case is not moving.

232
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
It's causing the people to be killed.

233
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
How about the central city?

234
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Anything?

235
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Not yet.

236
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Let's go.

237
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Have some heart.

238
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Yes.

239
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Hurry up.

240
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
The garden is not just a dead end.

241
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
The inside of the house is full of life.

242
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
The light is high.

243
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
It seems that the foundation of the garden

244
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
has been built.

245
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I am working on this.

246
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I should be working on this.

247
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Thank you for your contribution.

248
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I...

249
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
We can do something small.

250
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Small things?

251
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
What are you doing?

252
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
No.

253
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
No.

254
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
You are a spy.

255
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Pay attention.

256
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
How did he find you?

257
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
He is very good.

258
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I am asking you.

259
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
How about this?

260
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
We are on the battlefield.

261
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Your spy is too big.

262
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
It's easy to protect.

263
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Let me help you.

264
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Brother, let's go.

265
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
No.

266
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Okay.

267
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Be quiet.

268
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
He has been a spy for ten years.

269
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
He wants to take it from him.

270
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
He is so blind.

271
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Ten years?

272
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Yes.

273
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I have never seen a spy

274
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
who is so blind.

275
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I have never seen a spy

276
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
who is so blind.

277
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Don't be silly.

278
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I understand.

279
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Ten years.

280
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
A spy.

281
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
A spy for ten years.

282
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Xiaoliao.

283
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Ten years.

284
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
A spy for ten years.

285
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Ten years.

286
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
A spy for ten years.

287
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
So blind.

288
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
This is so blind.

289
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
It's so blind.

290
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
What is the next sentence?

291
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Xu...

292
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Qi An.

293
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Xu Qi An.

294
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Brother Xu.

295
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
What is the next sentence?

296
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Can you tell me?

297
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
The next sentence.

298
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
The next sentence is easy to say.

299
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I don't remember.

300
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Think about it.

301
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
No, I really don't remember.

302
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I don't remember.

303
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I can't tell you.

304
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Something is coming.

305
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
split.

306
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Who's there?

307
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Follow you.

308
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Who are you?

309
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
The one who died

310
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
is you.

311
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Impossible.

312
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
You're dead by your own eyes.

313
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
To revenge for you,

314
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I've been digging in.

315
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I'll find you one by one.

316
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Okay.

317
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I'll find you one by one.

318
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
But

319
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
this is the death of Cang Bo Lake.

320
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Cang Bo Lake

321
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Cang Bo Lake

322
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Cang Bo Lake

323
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Heaven, earth, earth, and sky.

324
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Cang Bo Lake

325
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
You'll be able to fight.

326
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Take it.

327
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Okay.

328
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Cang Bo Lake

329
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
How's it going? Did you run out?

330
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Cang Bo Lake

331
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
It's on you.

332
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Where's the old man?

333
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I'm down there.

334
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
What kind of people are they?

335
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
The dead are too big.

336
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
The dead are too small.

337
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I'll find you one by one.

338
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
No.

339
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
You'll meet the dead.

340
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
You'll have a chance to meet Xiao Jing.

341
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Damn it.

342
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
It's so chaotic.

343
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Give it to me.

344
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
My second brother is in a hurry.

345
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I'm not going to break up.

346
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Xiao Jing will be here soon.

347
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Stop.

348
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Who's that?

349
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
It's me.

350
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Who else?

351
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
It's me.

352
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
The Black-Haired Uncle was attacked by the assassin.

353
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
He was expelled.

354
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I'll send a police officer to investigate.

355
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I'll take a detour with the assassin.

356
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Don't act rashly.

357
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Hurry up.

358
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Yes.

359
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Yes.

360
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Feng'er,

361
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
we've found the dead.

362
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
We didn't find the dead.

363
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
No need to find it.

364
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I think

365
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
there are other people

366
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
besides the murderer.

367
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Who discovered

368
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
the manor of the Pinyin?

369
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
It's them.

370
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
General.

371
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
General.

372
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
When you found the dead,

373
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
did you find any suspicious people nearby?

374
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
No.

375
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I don't know.

376
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I don't know.

377
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I don't know.

378
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Did you find any suspicious people?

379
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I didn't find any suspicious people.

380
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
We didn't find the case.

381
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
It's not you.

382
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Who is it?

383
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
It's Xu Qian.

384
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Xu Qian?

385
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Where is he?

386
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
The suspect is not guilty.

387
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
The Pinyin Manor was killed.

388
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
The family members and the family members

389
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
were killed by the assassin.

390
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
When did it happen?

391
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
When did it happen?

392
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Just now.

393
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I went to the Pinyin Manor

394
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
to see the murderer.

395
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
The murderer is a man of the Pinyin.

396
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
He is more powerful than the assassin.

397
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
He is not my manor.

398
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I suspect he has

399
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Sang Bo's seal.

400
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I can see it.

401
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
The death of the Pinyin Manor

402
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
and the death of the dead

403
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
of the Prince of Zheng.

404
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Take a look.

405
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
But this man...

406
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
This is...

407
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
This is...

408
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
What is it?

409
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
The Pinyin Manor

410
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
can be used to avoid the murder.

411
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
But it disappeared a year ago.

412
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Tianyu's record of the murder

413
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
didn't tell anyone

414
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
to hide his body.

415
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
It was almost

416
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
the same time

417
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
that Heng Hui left the Pinyin Manor.

418
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
So,

419
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Zhou Chixiong

420
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
used the Pinyin Manor

421
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
to avoid the murder.

422
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Why did Heng Hui

423
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
go to Zhou Chixiong?

424
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Now Heng Hui

425
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
is back to the Pinyin Manor.

426
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I will find you one by one.

427
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Shan Hao.

428
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Heng Hui is here to revenge.

429
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
He will have another goal.

430
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Revenge?

431
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Sir.

432
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
The Pinyin Manor

433
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
is not only simple

434
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
but also simple.

435
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Mr. Jian.

436
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I know that

437
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
a year ago,

438
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
His Majesty intended

439
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
to take Prince Yu

440
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
to the Inner Council.

441
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
At the same time,

442
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
His Majesty was furious

443
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
and the whole city was in a hurry.

444
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Prince Yu was in a hurry.

445
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
And Heng Hui

446
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
came back

447
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
after a year.

448
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
He killed

449
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
the enemy of the Pinyin Manor.

450
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
The Pinyin Manor

451
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
originally had a tooth.

452
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
It could send

453
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
the secret of the people

454
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
to the Inner Council.

455
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
You mean

456
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
this is a fight

457
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
between the Wenguan Group

458
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
and the power of the new cabinet?

459
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Do you know

460
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
who the biggest

461
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
winner

462
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
is

463
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
when the princess leaves the city?

464
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Yes.

465
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
This is the fall

466
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
of many officials.

467
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
The Wei Palace

468
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
is in the Pinyin Manor.

469
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Jiang Lizhong.

470
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Come in.

471
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Do you have any progress

472
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
in the teeth

473
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
of the investigation?

474
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
I've been investigating in the case.

475
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
I didn't move

476
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
any power and teeth.

477
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Since the death of the Pinyin Manor,

478
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
they started to torture

479
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
and since they didn't

480
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
get suppressed by everyone,

481
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
they've been staying in the capital.

482
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Good.

483
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
It seems that

484
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
the disciple of the Pinyin Manor

485
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
has indeed inherited the teeth organization.

486
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
You can take it.

487
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Yes.

488
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
I have something else to do

489
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
for you.

490
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Send me a message.

491
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
You've made me

492
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
work hard.

493
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Jiang Jingruo, don't be proud.

494
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
I know that you're investigating

495
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
the case of the Pinyin Manor.

496
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
The case is

497
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
closely related to the Pinyin Manor.

498
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
As long as Jiang Jingruo and I

499
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
work together,

500
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
the case will be found

501
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
and it will be Jiang Jingruo's contribution.

502
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Brother,

503
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
you're bold enough to let go of your hand.

504
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
If you need any help,

505
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
please let me know.

506
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Thank you, Brother Jiang.

507
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
You're welcome.

508
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
You're welcome.

509
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
It's hurt.

510
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
I'll be fine.

511
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Thank you.

512
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Thank you.

513
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
The Pinyin Manor

514
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
The Pinyin Manor is closely related to the Pinyin Manor.

515
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
But it's just a guess.

516
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
I'm sorry.

517
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
I'm sorry.

518
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
I'm sorry.

519
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
I'm sorry.

520
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Ling'an,

521
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Since the third harvest,

522
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
I've been thinking about you all the time,

523
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,080
Yang Tie-yang is once again a digital serial killer.

524
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,200
You are dead again,

525
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,160
huh?

526
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,360
There must be something wrong.

527
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:47,200
The record...

528
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,960
who will take the lead for Jahren...

529
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:55,640
at the High Flang gereki kelp?

530
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,480
We must find it altogether.

531
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:58,840
Without us,

532
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,320
no 얘는 is dares to letあっ染 spring restud More.

533
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,120
You have reached the высimounts,

534
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,960
Turned out to be both him and Laoshan's sixth son,

535
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,880
but after bölized and his whole life,

536
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:08,680
we can't forgive each other.

537
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,680
Since the beginning of our age,

538
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,800
we've been so careless and暙她.

539
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,680
When I found her thanks to Father.

540
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,160
Dاء Shuis馬

541
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,320
Who would send her to the Lecture houses?

542
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,360
How could it?

543
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,120
What's this?

544
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,080
It's boring to be left and right.

545
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,480
When I was idle,

546
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:41,960
I was so lucky

547
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,480
to pray for her.

548
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,040
Your Highness hasn't been here for a long time.

549
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,320
Princess Consort

550
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,720
misses you and the princess every day.

551
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,120
Come on.

552
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,400
Have a try of the new one.

553
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:03,840
That's sweet.

554
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,080
Thisek Peinyang,

555
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,720
she was 10 years old.

556
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:13,000
she shone at Hubei

557
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,200
and came here in the forklift area.

558
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:22,440
She knew the contribute

559
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:22,800
when she was dancing.

560
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:24,640
Her eight-point rose

561
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:27,800
連握過苛鱼也滿有叵品

562
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,480
They play the~~

563
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:30,840
好的就是

564
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:36,840
Do you think Nanjing's food is really that sweet?

565
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:44,840
I think it's not because she's the one who planted it herself.

566
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,840
She only likes it.

567
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:55,840
She never came back to see it.

568
00:28:55,840 --> 00:29:06,840
Nanjing, is she still hating us?

569
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:12,840
Uncle, how can we have a grudge between our parents?

570
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:15,840
I've already left you two alone.

571
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:25,840
When you have news of her next time, tell her that this season's food is sweet and juicy.

572
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:34,840
You also have to tell her that I don't blame her.

573
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:39,840
Her father is in heaven and she won't blame her either.

574
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:46,840
I'm afraid that she'll come back and see it.

575
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:05,840
Actually, I received a letter from Sister a few days ago.

576
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:13,840
She said she went to Zhongzhou to meet with the police.

577
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:21,840
She was so worried that she'd be blamed by His Majesty.

578
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,840
It's not good to go back to the capital.

579
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:28,840
If it's because of this, I can go to see her.

580
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,840
I'm all suspicious anyway.

581
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,840
You're out of your mind.

582
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:39,840
Zhongzhou is far away.

583
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:44,840
You must have been far away from here.

584
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:47,840
You should have left.

585
00:30:47,840 --> 00:31:02,840
How about we meet next time?

586
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:06,840
I'll write to Sister.

587
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:11,840
Okay.

588
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:12,840
Okay.

589
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:21,840
How about I ask the police to prepare some new clothes and jewelry to see if she'll come back?

590
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,840
I don't need to go.

591
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,840
I have something to do in the palace.

592
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,840
You go back first.

593
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,840
Ling'an.

594
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:38,840
I'm begging you, please.

595
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:58,840
Within three days, we can't find out the facts.

596
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,840
I'm disobeyed.

597
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,080
Don't be angry with me.

598
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,360
Don't hesitate anymore.

599
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,280
Don't worry.

600
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,320
Your Majesty.

601
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:17,680
There are Festival Farm Immemorial Pavilion

602
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,960
in the Grand Soul internationally.

603
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,160
I suspect

604
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:23,440
it's time that

605
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:25,800
thesmith

606
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:29,320
stopped you

607
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,040
Yes.

608
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,540
I am suspecting

609
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:33,480
their collusion

610
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,760
with foreign piers in Wei Yuan

611
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,040
I am speaking now.

612
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:54,040
Mr. Chun.

613
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,400
What's your view?

614
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:58,480
It's not over yet.

615
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:02,160
a secret case of Pingyuan's mansion.

616
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,600
Don't be angry, Your Majesty.

617
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,920
You need to be patient.

618
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,280
I think

619
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,480
you should listen to what

620
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,120
Eunuch Wei said first.

621
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,240
Your Majesty.

622
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:23,840
I think

623
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,720
the case of Pingyuan's mansion

624
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:26,920
and Sang's mansion

625
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,720
are the same case.

626
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,640
And I've found out

627
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:34,280
who killed Pingyuan's murderer.

628
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:41,680
Who?

629
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,000
The case is still under investigation

630
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,400
of the missing Princess Pingyang

631
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,400
a year ago.

632
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,320
The suspect has been reported to the county.

633
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,400
The missing Princess Pingyang

634
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:56,240
may be the commander of some ministers

635
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:00,120
and is in the palace.

636
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,320
What's going on?

637
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,400
Your Majesty.

638
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,080
Please

639
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,600
step back.

640
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:27,680
What a surprise.

641
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,000
Who could fare the crime

642
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:47,520
not to you

643
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,280
and��

644
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:54,760
Maybe

645
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:57,900
And morgen he clearly told us

646
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:01,120
his whereabouts Ar belong to you

647
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,640
Chamberlain Wei Make way

648
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:12,440
Chamberlain Wei

649
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:19,860
Chamberlain Wei

650
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:20,620
I am wondering

651
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:24,560
where the само-murder has επiphoemiksi

652
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:25,480
However.

653
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,120
We do have to decide

654
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:30,920
according to the conditions.

655
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:33,720
But

656
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:35,880
Mogokun

657
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,000
has been change.

658
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:39,800
The truth and evidence

659
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,160
will remain unfit for long now.

660
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,760
conveying my opinion

661
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:45,120
around these days.

662
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:46,960
Okay.

663
00:35:54,760 --> 00:36:00,920
and above all,

664
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,360
Old Master Yang,

665
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,760
what did thatater and His Majesty

666
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,480
discuss just now?

667
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,080
This case

668
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,360
is made by Xu Qi'an,

669
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,440
of the Chief Minister and his concubines

670
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:14,160
and neither has Imperial Guard

671
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:16,400
made it public.

672
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,520
Xu Qi'an?

673
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,560
Why are you still packing up?

674
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,160
Can you hurry up?

675
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,880
Hurry up.

676
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:30,440
Hurry up.

677
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,520
Master.

678
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,320
You're so angry.

679
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:35,160
We're already very fast.

680
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,160
Son.

681
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,160
It's been a long time.

682
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:38,600
Why can't he come out?

683
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,960
He's been called out a few times.

684
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,160
He should be fast.

685
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:42,360
Don't rush.

686
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,560
Hurry up.

687
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:46,360
Son.

688
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,360
You're good.

689
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,560
Hurry up and pack up.

690
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,360
I'll leave the capital right away.

691
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:53,160
Hurry up.

692
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,760
Hurry up.

693
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:55,760
Hurry up.

694
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,760
Okay.

695
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,360
Stop.

696
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,760
The court is in charge of the investigation.

697
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,160
Please come in.

698
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:16,760
Master, we're in the capital.

699
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:17,760
We need to be more alert.

700
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,960
We just need to be kind.

701
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,560
The criminal is escaping.

702
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:21,960
No one should come out.

703
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,560
I'm the Minister of War.

704
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,160
I have something important to do.

705
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,360
I can't delay it.

706
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:31,360
I'll be out of here as soon as possible.

707
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,360
You're not allowed to do it.

708
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,160
Please think twice before you do it.

709
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,160
Have some tea.

710
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,560
Thank you, Master Wei.

711
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:54,760
Your Majesty.

712
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,160
The military department is on the way.

713
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,160
The Xu family wants to leave the city.

714
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:58,160
We're in the way.

715
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,160
Got it.

716
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,160
Yu Shanggou?

717
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,160
I still have a way.

718
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,160
I'll take the lead.

719
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,160
I'll take the lead.

720
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:13,160
The world will be in danger.

721
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:15,160
If you didn't

722
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,160
ask the head of the investigation

723
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,160
to design the court for the war,

724
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,160
the head of the investigation

725
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,160
will be in danger.

726
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,160
The court will be in danger.

727
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,160
Zhang Feng is not a good person.

728
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,160
He's a good person.

729
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,160
Yes.

730
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:34,160
But the main building behind us

731
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,160
is in a big trouble.

732
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:37,160
The seal of the lake

733
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:39,160
is only to help the Henghui

734
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,160
complete the revenge.

735
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:43,160
The power and the accuracy of the Henghui

736
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,160
are not enough to take part in the funeral.

737
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,160
I thought

738
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,160
the Sangbo case

739
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:53,160
has the power of the court.

740
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,160
The release of the seal

741
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,160
is also to make up for it.

742
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,160
Even the main building

743
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,160
is the lake.

744
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,160
What is it?

745
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,160
Tell me.

746
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:08,160
The money is in the gold.

747
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,160
Now?

748
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:14,160
The Henghui's appearance

749
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,160
proves that my direction is wrong.

750
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,160
But I really don't understand.

751
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:21,160
If there are other forces behind the Henghui,

752
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:24,160
what is the purpose of the release of the seal?

753
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:26,160
There is no meaning.

754
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:29,160
After we catch the Henghui,

755
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,160
we'll see what we can do.

756
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,160
The Henghui's

757
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,160
The Henghui's

758
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,160
The Henghui's

759
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,160
The Henghui's

760
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,160
The Henghui's

761
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,160
The Henghui's

762
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,160
