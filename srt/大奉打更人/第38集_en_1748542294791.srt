1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm afraid I'll be a little bit too wild

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm curious what I'm going to do

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I don't want to think about the future

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
The whole world in my mouth

5
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Let me go to the police station

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
He's not very strict

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
When you're here

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'll tell you the rules

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'll give you the address

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Keep on being sick

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'll take this big piece of cake

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
We're suddenly like a step by step

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
We suddenly become a part of the town

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
We suddenly become a part of the town

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
We suddenly become a part of the town

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
We once had a marriage

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm not afraid of the story

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'm afraid of the future

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
The whole world in my mouth

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Let me go to the police station

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
He's not very strict

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
When you're here

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'll tell you the rules

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm afraid I'll be a little bit too wild

25
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'm not afraid of the story

26
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I'm afraid I'll be a little bit too wild

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm afraid I'll be a little bit too wild

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm afraid I'll be a little bit too wild

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I'm afraid I'll be a little bit too wild

30
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm afraid I'll be a little bit too wild

31
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
The news is coming

32
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
The court is on the way

33
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Discuss the case of King Huai

34
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Yes

35
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Li Yan

36
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Why are you in such a hurry?

37
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Father

38
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Father, he won't admit it

39
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
He won't admit it

40
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Uncle Huang is the real son of the people of Chuzhou, right?

41
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Brother

42
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
First daughter

43
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Don't do this

44
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Don't you worry about the environment

45
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
He won't admit it

46
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Why?

47
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Isn't Uncle Huang's story

48
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
the truth of the world?

49
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Father

50
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Li Yan

51
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I don't want to like you

52
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It's because you are a coward

53
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It's because you don't ask the court

54
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Now

55
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Now how do you change?

56
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
You are in charge of this

57
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Is it because of that Xu Qi'ai?

58
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Is he the one who used you, right?

59
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
It's really not him

60
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I haven't seen him in a few days

61
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I don't dare to see him

62
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I don't have the face to see him

63
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
But I, Uncle Qin

64
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
He was in the court and was so violent

65
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
He was the emperor

66
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
How could I be so partial?

67
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I don't dare to see him

68
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
So

69
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
You asked me to come here today

70
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
You want me to see you like father

71
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I don't even dare to see you

72
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
How could you see me?

73
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Die'an

74
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
There is no right and wrong in the court

75
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Only benefit and loss

76
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
It's not my fault

77
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I am the crown prince

78
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I have to be with the noble and loyal

79
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
You are a princess

80
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
No one cares about what you did

81
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
If you are the prince

82
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Just like what you said

83
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
You will be innocent

84
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
But he killed so many people

85
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
So many people

86
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Shouldn't you take him away?

87
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Otherwise, who will respect our grand emperor?

88
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Who will respect the grand emperor's law?

89
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
There are many things like this

90
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Now and in the future

91
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
It will continue

92
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I doubt that if I have my own way

93
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
No one can change it

94
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
My sister

95
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
The royal family of father

96
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Is the blood of the mountain

97
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
If we don't come here

98
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
The famous emperor of the emperor

99
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
For 600 years

100
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I am afraid

101
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I will destroy you

102
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Lord

103
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I have to go to Chu city

104
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Chu city has 38,000 souls

105
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I need an answer

106
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I need an answer from the people

107
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
After the battle

108
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Prince of Zhenbei is ordered to go north

109
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
To defend the border for the court

110
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
But he has been punished

111
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Don't you even have his name on it?

112
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
It's not the same

113
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Your majesty

114
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Before the king of Huai was killed

115
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Yes

116
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
He committed a crime of evil and evil

117
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
It's also a matter of reason and sincerity

118
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Your majesty

119
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Lord Zhenbei

120
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
It's a crime to destroy the king of Qin

121
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
It's a crime

122
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I hope you can think of a way

123
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
It's a matter of reason and sincerity

124
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
If not for the emperor's hui Yan

125
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
How can you talk today?

126
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I am grateful for your kindness

127
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
But if it's for the emperor's reputation

128
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Lord Zhu shouldn't say this

129
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Yesterday

130
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
The three ministers of the Yunlu Academy

131
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I am sorry for your majesty

132
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I stop it

133
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
They said

134
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Today

135
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Lord Huai killed the people of Chu city

136
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
The day after that

137
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Yunlu Academy will

138
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Send this matter to the capital

139
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
And the rest

140
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Including the king of Zhu

141
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
The play of zhebi

142
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Will be engraved on the stone

143
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Lord Li

144
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
The life is full of danger

145
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
The blood is full of blood

146
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
It's the kai mo of the royal family

147
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
It's the rice of the world's readers

148
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Is it really

149
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
To play the role

150
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Let the Yunlu Academy

151
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
A little bit

152
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
A little bit

153
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
You dare threaten me

154
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Do you want to rebel

155
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
When did Jian Yan become a threat

156
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
you

157
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
You guys

158
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Your majesty

159
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I have a word

160
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
According to the minister

161
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
His majesty is on the court today

162
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
To discuss the case of the king of Huai

163
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
How about it

164
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
What's the result

165
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
The people of the palace have eaten the skin

166
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
But his majesty didn't get the benefits

167
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I thought it would be a long-term garbage exhibition

168
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
But who would have thought

169
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
The Duke of Cao's palace is actually out of the chain

170
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Really high-ranking

171
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Your majesty

172
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
These years

173
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
The court has a good internal and external exchange

174
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
People are difficult

175
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
The rich are sorry every year

176
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Although his majesty does not listen to the reduction of the rich

177
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
And the people are resting

178
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
But the people are still alive

179
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
If this period

180
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
If it is to spread the word

181
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
The king of Zhengbei is in trouble

182
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
How will the people in the world treat the court

183
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
How should the two sides treat the court

184
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Then will they think

185
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
The court has been awakened

186
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
So it's more convenient

187
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
The rank of the famous

188
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
More like a big mess

189
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Bastard

190
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
You are saying that I am a married

191
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
The whole Tang State

192
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Is a man of marriage

193
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I dare not

194
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
But now

195
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
What the officials did

196
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Isn't it just a matter of marriage?

197
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
The official is making a lot of noise

198
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
A commoner can be punished

199
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
But someone once thought of the big situation

200
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
The official is in the court

201
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Don't you know

202
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
The court's face

203
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Is also the face of the son

204
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
But the king of Zhengbei

205
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
He is indeed wrong

206
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Your Majesty

207
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
The king of Zhengbei is dead

208
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Can you erase everything if you are dead

209
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Can

210
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
The state of Chuzhou has been in chaos for a long time

211
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Now it has been destroyed

212
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
The royal family of Chuzhou is in the process of death

213
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
The king of Zhengbei is fighting against it

214
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
The king of Chuzhou is fighting against it

215
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
The king of Chuzhou is fighting against it

216
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
And killed the ancient people

217
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
To guard the country for the last time

218
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
The king of Zhengbei is in the process of destruction

219
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
After this war

220
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Chuzhou will come for more than ten years

221
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
What a dozen years

222
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Your Majesty

223
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
The king of Zhengbei is dead

224
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
He is the hero of the big wind

225
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Your Majesty

226
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Cao Kongpu

227
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Did you forget

228
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Everything is in the official's hands

229
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
And

230
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
And the ten people

231
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
And the two thousand soldiers of Chuzhou

232
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
You must know this

233
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
The people of Jingchun

234
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
You

235
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
You

236
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
You are all in this

237
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Is it important

238
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Ah

239
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Using the eyes of the court and the royal family

240
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
To act on the case

241
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
To use the ending of killing the kui's family to be a little polite

242
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Although Chuzhou is gone

243
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
But all of this is done by the kui's family

244
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
It's really a good deal

245
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
In this way

246
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Chuzhou's punishment

247
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Is not something that can't be accepted

248
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Everything is in the war

249
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
And the kui's family

250
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
King Huai also became a hero

251
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Became the hero of the big wind

252
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Even killed the kui's family

253
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
And destroyed the palace

254
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
No

255
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Brother, you first

256
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Although this is useful

257
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
But most of it is to make the kui's family remember

258
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
The people of Mingyuan will know

259
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
His Majesty is in the role

260
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Good

261
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
The last sentence that the minister said is important

262
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
The people of Chuzhou are a thousand thousand people

263
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Just say it yourself

264
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
As a first act

265
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Can block the world's attention

266
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
And he will be in danger for a long time

267
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
He doesn't know this

268
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Is it just a coincidence

269
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
His Majesty

270
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Still killing

271
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
After King Huai fell

272
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Beijing lost the assistance of Qingtian

273
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
The kui's family is not as strong as the wind

274
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
But this Godless Sect

275
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
If you go around

276
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
After Chuzhou's death

277
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
It's not easy to kill the people of Chuzhou

278
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
But the people of Chuzhou

279
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
The people of Chuzhou

280
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
The people of Chuzhou

281
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
The people of Chuzhou

282
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
The people of Chuzhou

283
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
After the government of Chuzhou

284
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
That is the capital city

285
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
The dragon is here

286
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
The assistance of Qingtian is too high and too big

287
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Hard to control

288
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
It's a little greedy

289
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
It's a shame to hurt people

290
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Is it

291
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Your Majesty

292
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Everyone is here

293
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
No one is in the palace

294
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
No item missing

295
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Did you find the assassin

296
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Your Majesty

297
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Still not from

298
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Then hurry up and find it

299
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Yes

300
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
The assassin came to the palace

301
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Why didn't I know

302
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I did this

303
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Let them not be injured

304
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Just happened suddenly

305
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Everyone in the palace is self-righteous

306
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Even the empress

307
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
It's all under the influence of this

308
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Or to catch this assassin as soon as possible

309
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Let this matter calm down earlier

310
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
The empress

311
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Don't worry about it

312
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
The emperor's intention

313
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Is really more advanced

314
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
This is recognized

315
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Come again

316
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Your Majesty

317
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Retreat

318
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Your Majesty

319
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Your Majesty

320
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I'm tired

321
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
You are tired too

322
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Your Majesty

323
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Your Majesty

324
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I'm going to the palace

325
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Your Majesty

326
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Your Majesty

327
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Your Majesty

328
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Your Majesty, please wait

329
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Your Majesty

330
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
You left Chu and came to the capital

331
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
You came here for a big event

332
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
You may have thought that it would be today

333
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Why don't I give you a guide

334
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
This is great

335
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Now Chu is in the capital

336
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
You should stay in Chu

337
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Re-enact Chu

338
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Don't get involved in the capital

339
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
This is also the emperor's intention

340
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I have no words

341
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I have no patience

342
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Old man

343
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Not a imperial doctor

344
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
The investigation ended

345
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Mr. Zheng returned to the capital

346
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I have seen Mr. Zheng before

347
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Remember that time

348
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Although you have a good reputation

349
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Although you have a good reputation

350
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
The spirit of the spirit is good

351
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Have you also given up the palace?

352
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Xu Qian, I appreciate it

353
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I think he is a born martial art

354
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Just temper and temper

355
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
It really hurts

356
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I told him

357
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
If you are afraid of rolling on the battlefield

358
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
You should have three thoughts

359
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Thought of danger, thought of retreat, thought of change

360
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Before doing things

361
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
You should understand the consequences of it

362
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
The principle of Xiao De

363
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
After the whole process is closed

364
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Decide to do it or not

365
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
If the rolling event cannot be stopped

366
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
You should retreat and close the door

367
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
But Xu Qian told me

368
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I know the principles of Wei Gong's divorce

369
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
But I don't care

370
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
The ungrateful

371
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Wei Gong said the ungrateful word

372
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:48,000
This means Wei Gong is not good for him

373
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Only when you retreat

374
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
It's safe

375
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Safe

376
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
So you can think about how to change the situation

377
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
The big thing is still in the past

378
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Mr. Zheng

379
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Why not be busy

380
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Project

381
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,480
【In each season】

382
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:46,180
【T Harborgy diversity with deep-seized

383
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:48,600

Master of the Manor of the Manor,

396
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,900
I'm meeting a guest.

397
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,300
I've been working for a while.

398
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,700
I can't get out of here.

399
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:40,900
I'm not in a hurry.

400
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,300
Please go back.

401
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:56,500
Master.

402
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,700
It's been a few hours since the military service.

403
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:03,500
Yes.

404
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:21,900
Master.

405
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:34,300
Master.

406
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:51,700
Master.

407
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:52,700
It's dark.

408
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,300
Let's go.

409
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:04,100
Master.

410
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:21,900
Master Xu.

411
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:31,700
Master Zhen.

412
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:34,300
Master.

413
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:36,700
Sorry.

414
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:39,500
I didn't want to disappoint you.

415
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,700
What are you doing here today?

416
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,700
I'm working on a new project.

417
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:00,100
I went to find Wei Gong today.

418
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,900
I went to find Wei Gong today.

419
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:11,900
Master Xu.

420
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:16,300
Why don't I treat you to a bowl of Yang Chun Mian?

421
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:20,700
Master Zhen.

422
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:22,300
I'm not hungry.

423
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,500
I'm hungry.

424
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:31,700
Here.

425
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:35,300
Yang Chun Mian is a special dish in Jiangnan.

426
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,700
I like it when it's small.

427
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:37,900
You should try it.

428
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:49,700
I've visited six guests today.

429
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,300
I've met Wei Gong.

430
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:55,700
Otherwise, I wouldn't know where I'm going.

431
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,300
I'm not hungry.

432
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,300
Master Xu is looking for me.

433
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:03,900
I understand.

434
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,100
Master Zhen.

435
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:10,300
What are you going to do?

436
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,300
What do you think?

437
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,300
There's a story in my hometown.

438
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:19,700
The legendary holy hall is called Gui Tu Saipao.

439
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,500
I want to tell you something.

440
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:22,700
Please.

441
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,700
The rabbit and the turtle are running.

442
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,300
The rabbit is running fast.

443
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,500
The turtle is far behind.

444
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:32,700
But the rabbit is running fast.

445
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:34,100
It's a slow game.

446
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,700
He'll sleep for a while and run.

447
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:38,700
But the turtle...

448
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:40,900
He's running.

449
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:42,300
Running.

450
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:43,100
Running.

451
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:44,100
Running.

452
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,100
Running.

453
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,300
He's never heard of it.

454
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:50,300
When the rabbit wakes up,

455
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,300
the turtle is in the middle.

456
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:53,700
It's a slow game.

457
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,100
The turtle is running slow.

458
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,500
But the turtle is in the middle.

459
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:01,860
What Wei Gong said is

460
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,100
reasonable.

461
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,300
It's a crazy game.

462
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:07,900
It's a good game.

463
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:12,300
Master Zhen.

464
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:15,500
I have a story to tell you.

465
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:17,300
Please.

466
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,900
There's a scholar in the west.

467
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:22,500
He was a young man.

468
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:24,700
He was a man of great power.

469
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,700
He was full of blood.

470
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:30,700
He was a man of great power.

471
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:36,500
People thought he was a man of the people.

472
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,500
But he was wrong.

473
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:44,700
He was punished for being a man of the people.

474
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:48,100
He didn't like it.

475
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:51,500
He was so cruel.

476
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:54,100
He wanted to prove it.

477
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:56,900
He could reflect it one day.

478
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:59,500
Why didn't he reflect it?

479
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:09,300
At first, he just wanted to prove it.

480
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:11,700
But then,

481
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:15,300
he saw the people's faces.

482
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:17,900
And there,

483
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:23,900
he saw the people's pure and pure faces.

484
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:27,900
The street he went to

485
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:32,100
was only because of the Wan Yang Village noodles.

486
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,100
But then,

487
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:39,700
he found the street food and the street food.

488
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:41,500
He was free.

489
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:46,500
He saw the dead husband's widow

490
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:48,700
and married the new wolf king.

491
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:52,100
He saw the street food

492
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:54,700
and the street food.

493
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,300
He was the head of the street food.

494
00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:00,100
He helped me eat lamb soup.

495
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:05,300
More than twenty years,

496
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,700
he met many people there.

497
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:09,700
Many people

498
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:13,500
walked along every street.

499
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,900
There was no money in Jiangnan,

500
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,300
no gold and silver.

501
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,700
But many people

502
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,700
became his hometown.

503
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:28,300
He decided to leave.

504
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,300
Is the story about the dead man

505
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:36,100
yours?

506
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:41,300
I've been living in the 50s.

507
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:43,700
I've been living in the 50s.

508
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:45,900
I've been living in the 50s.

509
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,900
I've been living in the 50s.

510
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:52,300
I just want to raise my parents

511
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:56,500
and have them live in peace.

512
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:03,500
But before the first month,

513
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:07,100
I've been living in peace.

514
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:09,700
All those people

515
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:12,900
are dead.

516
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:31,100
I also want to draw a long picture.

517
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:34,300
I also want to wash the dishes.

518
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,900
But every day,

519
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:42,100
all those dead people come to me.

520
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,500
I'm a demon.

521
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:48,500
I can't die.

522
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,900
I can't go to Xinnan.

523
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:53,700
I can't go to Yilan.

524
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,700
I can't go to Yilan.

525
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:58,900
I can't go to Yilan.

526
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,300
I can't go to Yilan.

527
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,800
I still have the hands.

528
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:16,780
I may need to send end to theTake-Aأ

529
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:18,900
but I won't...

530
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:23,100
I won't take a chance.

531
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:35,900
Did you see my face?

532
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:41,580
It must be hard to sedu Performance

533
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:50,340
Don't buy new monitors

534
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:54,680
Put on the snow

535
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:57,680
Canthinking the paradise

536
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:06,900
Here you are.

537
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:14,900
Here you are.

538
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:16,900
Thank you, sir.

539
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:37,900
Take it.

540
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:45,900
The heart is like a poem.

541
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:52,900
The heart is like a poem.

542
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:02,900
What's the situation in the cabinet?

543
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:03,900
Your Majesty,

544
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:06,900
I didn't see any guests in the mansion.

545
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:10,900
Where's Wei Yuan?

546
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:12,900
After the court was settled,

547
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:16,900
the government went to a house to build a house.

548
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:18,900
The Wei Palace was built.

549
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:20,900
After that,

550
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:22,900
the two of them were not in a hurry.

551
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:25,900
They are all smart people.

552
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:27,900
I don't see Zheng Xinghuai.

553
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,900
I just want to give him a way out.

554
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:34,900
But Wei Yuan

555
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:36,900
doesn't keep me in his eyes.

556
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:39,900
Where's Zheng Xinghuai?

557
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:41,900
Your Majesty,

558
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,900
Mr. Zheng didn't listen to the advice.

559
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:45,900
Recently,

560
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:47,900
he has been trying to get the reputation

561
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:50,900
and the wealth of the country.

562
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:53,900
But no one else saw him.

563
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:56,900
The people of the palace know him very well.

564
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:03,900
He's a man of his word.

565
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:11,900
Who are you?

566
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:14,900
Your Majesty.

567
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:23,900
I

568
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:26,900
should be punished for not knowing the truth.

569
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:28,900
I should be punished for not knowing the truth.

570
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:30,900
The country is in a bad mood.

571
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:32,900
Today,

572
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:34,900
I want to report to Zheng Xinghuai

573
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:37,900
that I'm not in a good mood.

574
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:39,900
He killed Prince Zheng.

575
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:45,900
He killed 38,000 people in Chuzhou.

576
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,900
He killed me

577
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:51,900
in the death group.

578
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:54,900
His purpose is to cover up

579
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:57,900
the fact that he colluded with the imperial family.

580
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:59,900
He framed Prince Zheng

581
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:01,900
and killed Prince Zheng.

582
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:04,900
It's a terrible thing.

583
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,900
Your Majesty.

584
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:10,900
Zheng Xinghuai colluded with the death group

585
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:11,900
and killed me.

586
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:15,900
To cover up the fact that he colluded with the imperial family.

587
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:19,900
He killed Prince Zheng.

588
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,900
It's a terrible thing.

589
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:28,900
Your Majesty, you killed Prince Zheng.

590
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:32,900
You killed Prince Zheng.

591
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:36,900
You killed Prince Zheng in Chuzhou.

592
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:39,900
Your Majesty.

593
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:45,900
38,000 people died.

594
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,900
I didn't save you.

595
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:51,900
Your Majesty.

596
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:57,900
Your Majesty.

597
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:04,900
He's so insolent.

598
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:10,900
He killed 38,000 people in Chuzhou.

599
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:16,900
And my dead brother.

600
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:21,900
Your Majesty.

601
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:25,900
Let's have a look.

602
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:26,900
Yes.

603
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:32,900
He lied to me.

604
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:34,900
It's terrible.

605
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:37,900
Have a look.

606
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:38,900
Look.

607
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:40,900
The next one is the next one.

608
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:41,900
Your Majesty.

609
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:43,900
Zheng Xinghuai colluded with the death group.

610
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:45,900
He killed Prince Zheng.

611
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:49,900
He killed the most evil group in the Black and White Seven Realms.

612
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:51,900
He killed the most evil group in the Black and White Seven Realms.

613
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,900
I've told Zheng Xinghuai.

614
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:06,900
But he's a stubborn person.

615
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:09,900
If he's not stubborn,

616
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:12,900
he wouldn't have been released by the old man.

617
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:14,900
It's not right.

618
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:17,900
But now, the time is up.

619
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:20,900
Why can't we wait for him?

620
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:23,900
I sent people to search for him in Anzhong.

621
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:25,900
I couldn't find him.

622
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:28,900
Now he's in the palace.

623
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:30,900
He's in the palace.

624
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,900
He's in the palace.

625
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:35,900
Not at all.

626
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,900
The death group died

627
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:39,900
because of Prince Zheng.

628
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,900
And the death group died.

629
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:43,900
Now, the order is back.

630
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:45,900
The matter is reversed.

631
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:49,900
I've sent people to search for him.

632
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:51,900
As long as he's convicted,

633
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,900
he can be convicted by Prince Zheng.

634
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:55,900
This is our chance.

635
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:58,900
Brother Xinghuai came here.

636
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:01,900
Some people saw the hope of the rebellion.

637
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:04,900
Today, Zhang Hui and I,

638
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:08,900
to serve the Duke Cao,

639
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,900
we have to investigate this case.

640
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:14,900
Your Majesty,

641
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:16,900
we must investigate this case.

642
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:27,900
This case is a serious matter.

643
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:29,900
We must investigate it.

644
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:33,900
We'll investigate this case.

645
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,900
Duke Cao, you're the judge.

646
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:36,900
Yes.

647
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,900
I'll give you the gold medal.

648
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:39,900
Go to the inn now.

649
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:42,900
Take Zheng Xinghuai as the first judge.

650
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:47,900
Your Majesty, your majesty.

651
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:49,900
Your majesty, your majesty.

652
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:51,900
Your majesty, your majesty.

653
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:55,900
Your Majesty.

654
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:58,900
Let's listen to the order.

655
00:36:58,900 --> 00:36:59,900
Go.

656
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:03,900
Go and get me a gold medal.

657
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:04,900
Yes.

658
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:06,900
Your majesty, your majesty.

659
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:19,900
Eunuch.

660
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:21,900
Eunuch Wei,

661
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:22,900
Minister of Defense.

662
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:26,900
What's the situation in the inn?

663
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:30,900
We just had a meeting.

664
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,900
His majesty is a little punished.

665
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:35,900
Now he's still a little angry.

666
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:37,900
He said he won't see anyone today.

667
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:43,900
His majesty is determined.

668
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:45,900
He sent people to the inn

669
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:48,900
to get the right and wrong.

670
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:54,900
It's a serious matter.

671
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:56,900
But it's not a big deal.

672
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:58,900
Just take a few pills and rest for a few days.

673
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:01,900
It's a private matter, right?

674
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:04,900
I heard that the private matter is a big deal.

675
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:07,900
It's a good thing to have a good luck.

676
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:12,900
I know what you're thinking.

677
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:15,900
I know what Xu Qian'an told me to do.

678
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,900
But

679
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:20,900
if you want to see our teacher,

680
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:21,900
don't think about it.

681
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:24,900
Our private matter is not about the court.

682
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:25,900
It's a rule.

683
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:28,900
Who told you to come in?

684
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:31,900
Sir, I'm going out to see.

685
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:32,900
I'll go there myself.

686
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:34,900
Old man, don't move.

687
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:35,900
I'll go there.

688
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:37,900
Xu Qian'an doesn't want you to have any trouble.

689
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:40,900
Thank you, miss.

690
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:44,900
You should face it yourself.

691
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:54,900
Miss Laofan,

692
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:57,900
give this to Xu Yingluo.

693
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:02,900
minus basic caught movement.

694
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:12,900
If you use Zheng Xinghuai

695
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:14,900
to thank intoTHEog Cool culture.

696
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:23,900
Sir, what's wrong with you?

697
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:24,900
When Chu Buti volt him

698
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:27,900
he sure has gone astray.

699
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:29,860
쪽是 郑兴怀

700
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:31,860
当不郑尸司

701
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:35,020
picks and kills Prince Zhan,

702
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:38,300
killing 38 она of Peking and Chuzhou.

703
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:39,260
No way.

704
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:40,260
You're.

705
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:40,920
Today

706
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,220
no one can bear a type these years.

707
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:44,320
No leek?

708
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:45,980
Not two.

709
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:47,740
Take it.

710
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:58,780
I'll kill you.

711
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:06,020
Silver Luo Li Yuchuan.

712
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:07,060
Tong Luo Song Tingfeng.

713
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:08,580
Tong Luo Zhu Guangxiao.

714
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:10,660
Lord Zheng of the Four Seasons.

715
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:14,580
Tong Luo?

716
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:16,540
Seven-span Five-Spirit.

717
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:18,460
You want to stop me, too?

718
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:21,620
And Qu Xun's Silver Luo?

719
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:23,620
Kill them.

720
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:27,020
What about Jin Luo?

721
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:29,460
Go.

722
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:36,740
Jin Luo, stay away.

723
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:38,100
Jin Luo, no smoke.

724
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:40,060
Jin Luo, kill Ma Qing.

725
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:43,140
Jin Luo, no tears.

726
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:44,340
Jin Luo, smoke.

727
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:48,180
Jin Luo, get the army.

728
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:53,300
Jin Luo, take the army.

729
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:57,860
Jin Luo, the male bow is weak.

730
00:40:58,180 --> 00:40:59,460
Jin Luo, the male bow is weak.

731
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:02,780
Jin Luo, the male bow is weak.

732
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:10,060
You are all the court's leaders.

733
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:11,540
You are all the leaders.

734
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:13,340
I want to fight against the superior.

735
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:15,060
I want to think it over.

736
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:18,140
What's the point of fighting against the superior?

737
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:20,660
Whoever dares to step forward,

738
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:22,780
I'll let him know

739
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:24,860
what kind of defeat he will have.

740
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:30,220
He'll be defeated.

741
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:33,820
Zeng!

742
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:41,460
Theутств pouvoir

743
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:45,260
You win.

744
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:47,700
I drew the stud.

745
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:50,940
Zeng wants to win.

746
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:52,580
It's nice in that way.

747
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:54,900
But you're not using theれ

748
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:55,820
But...

749
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:57,300
Zeng, it's nice in that way.

750
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:58,500
I'm afraid I'll be late.

751
00:41:58,500 --> 00:41:59,500
I'll go to the hospital.

752
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:00,500
I'll go to the hospital.

753
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:01,500
I'll go to the hospital.

754
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:02,500
I'll go to the hospital.

755
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:03,500
I'll go to the hospital.

756
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:04,500
I'll go to the hospital.

757
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:05,500
I'll go to the hospital.

842
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:11,500

843
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:16,500
The cold come, the winter come.

844
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:18,500
The karting battle is over

845
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:21,060
The Sea- €Bee

846
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:24,100

847
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:27,300
