40
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:18,030
Your Majesty,

41
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,240
he is the wanted criminal
by the court.

42
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:21,980
The former Baihu of the Insignia Guards,

43
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:23,160
Zhou Chixiong.

44
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:26,880
You rogue.

45
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:29,320
You've returned in glory.

46
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:38,110
I'm guilty and deserve to die.

47
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,480
I'm guilty and deserve to die.

48
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,080
Zhou Chixiong,

49
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:44,390
who instructed you to collude

50
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,670
with the Kui to smuggle gunpowder?

51
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,360
I...

52
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:52,550
I...

53
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:53,760
I deserve to die.

54
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:54,880
I deserve to die.

55
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:55,990
I deserve to die.

56
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,680
I'll leave it to you, Master.

57
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:07,390
A gentleman must be sincere,

58
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:08,930
and so must an ordinary person.

59
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:16,920
Speak.

60
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,920
Who instructed you

61
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:20,390
to collude with the Kui

62
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:21,710
and smuggle gunpowder?

63
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,800
It was

64
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,800
the Minister...

65
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,270
The Minister of Rites,

66
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:32,710
Li Yulang.

67
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:36,710
It was Li Yulang.

68
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:38,670
It's him.

69
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:39,710
Execute him.

70
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:41,880
Your Majesty.

71
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:43,950
Your Majesty.

72
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:46,390
Your Majesty, this is absurd.

73
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,640
Zhou Chixiong

74
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:49,040
is slandering me.

75
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,640
Baihu Zhou

76
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,200
didn't lie.

77
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:55,920
He didn't lie.

78
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:58,320
Li Yulang,

79
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,080
what else do you have to say?

80
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:05,200
I am innocent.

81
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:11,550
Your Majesty.

82
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,550
This official must have

83
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,040
accomplices behind him.

84
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:17,520
Please let me interrogate him.

85
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,360
Your Majesty,

86
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:22,450
according to the law, this case should
be handled by the Ministry of Justice.

87
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:48,880
This case

88
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,400
will be investigated
by the Ministry of Justice.

89
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,560
Yes, Your Majesty.

90
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:18,870
Wei Yuan,

91
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:22,200
I will thoroughly investigate

92
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:23,710
Li Yulang's crimes,

93
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:27,520
but if you try to smear others,

94
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:30,640
that'll be a wild fantasy.

95
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,040
Hold on.

96
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:45,790
I've heard about the events

97
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,150
in the court recently.

98
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:50,000
I want to offer
a piece of advice to you:

99
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,390
if the Wang Faction continues
to push us,

100
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,200
next time you'll be

101
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,080
stepping on your own feet.

102
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,590
You little brat.

103
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,590
How dare you spout such nonsense!

104
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,320
I don't dare spout nonsense.

105
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:08,790
Perhaps you don't know
I'm quite skilled in poetry.

106
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:09,910
I'd like

107
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,080
to offer you a poem.

108
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:13,520
The title is

109
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:18,120
To Mr. Sun on the Sangbo Case.

110
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:19,080
A gift of poetry?

111
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,000
You don't know?

112
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,200
He is Yang Ling.

113
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,440
How rare to meet him.

114
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:24,630
Yes.

115
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,880
Everyone raises sons

116
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:34,960
and wants them to be wise.

117
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:40,880
I was ruined by my wisdom.

118
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:44,320
I only wish my child

119
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,030
to be foolish and simple,

120
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,710
without disaster or hardship,

121
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:52,000
to become a public official.

122
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:54,390
How can you say this?

123
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:55,760
How rude!

124
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,590
Take him down now!

125
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:00,680
Take him down!

126
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:02,830
Mr. Sun, please calm down.

127
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:08,310
Wei Yuan,

128
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,640
he slandered me.

129
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:13,500
According to the law, he should be
exiled for cursing a minister.

130
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:14,630
Today,

131
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:16,680
even if you want to protect him,

132
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,710
you can't.

133
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,230
Slandering a minister

134
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,960
is indeed a serious crime,

135
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:27,590
but

136
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:35,320
if what he said is true,

137
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,390
then it's not slander.

138
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:39,230
Wei Yuan.

139
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:40,550
You...

140
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,600
Let's go now.

141
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,160
Yes.

142
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:52,830
Mr. Sun, congrats on your fame

143
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:54,760
in the world of scholars.

144
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,030
This little brat.

145
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:57,270
You brat...

146
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,120
- Mr. Sun.
- Mr. Sun.

147
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:02,590
My Lord.

148
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:05,580
(Rule With Virtue)

149
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:06,430
Lord Wei.

150
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:13,630
Lord Wei,

151
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:16,440
there is something I don't understand.

152
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,880
Is it the reason
why His Majesty

153
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:22,080
assigned this case
to the Ministry of Justice

154
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:22,870
for trial?

155
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:24,590
Do you know

156
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:27,150
that Li Yulang is a Wang member?

157
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:31,320
If this case is handled by us,

158
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:34,790
it'll implicate many Wang members.

159
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:36,550
I understand.

160
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
At that time,
the court will be unbalanced.

161
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,640
Having one faction dominate
or two factions joining hands

162
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,440
isn't something
His Majesty wants to see.

163
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,230
They moved so soon?

164
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,400
Lord Wei,

165
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:03,710
has something happened?

166
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,170
It has nothing to do with you.

167
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,350
The Sangbo Case is over.

168
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,800
His Majesty didn't mention you,

169
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,590
which means it's been settled.

170
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,520
You may leave.

171
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,120
Yes.

172
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,120
Father,

173
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,470
Zhu Yang may have ill intentions
to meet His Majesty.

174
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,540
Should we be prepared
for possible trouble?

175
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:37,920
No need.

176
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,520
Yes.

177
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:43,900
(Lake Villa)

178
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,110
Mr. Xu,

179
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,230
what brings you here?

180
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:54,870
I saw the princess
was in low spirits last time,

181
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:55,970
so I thought I'd visit her.

182
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:58,230
The princess is in the pavilion.

183
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:00,590
Would you like to go and talk to her?

184
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:02,550
Alright.

185
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:05,220
(Lake Villa)

186
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:20,070
Your Highness,

187
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,160
it's me.

188
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:22,920
Come in.

189
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,200
Xu Qi'an, look.

190
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,320
In the capital of the Dafeng,

191
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:42,440
even the sun is restrained.

192
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,800
I remember Pingyang once said

193
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,320
in the South, the sunset

194
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,750
could turn the whole sky red.

195
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,750
In the boundless desert,

196
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:55,990
one could chase the sun freely.

197
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:01,550
The South was

198
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:04,830
Princess Pingyang's destination, right?

199
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,640
Yes.

200
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:11,920
These past few days,
I was wondering

201
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,830
whether it was worth it for Pingyang

202
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,110
to die for freedom.

203
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:20,960
Have you found an answer?

204
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:24,510
Not a clue.

205
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,630
It only adds to my worries.

206
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:31,470
Please sit.

207
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,280
I'd like to hear your opinion.

208
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:49,960
I dare not comment
on Princess Pingyang rashly,

209
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:52,350
but if I consider the situation
at that time,

210
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:53,830
perhaps leaving

211
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,110
was her only choice.

212
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:00,560
I never met her,

213
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,800
but from your description,

214
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:05,590
I know she was someone carefree,

215
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,870
not willing to be bound by etiquette.

216
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:09,230
For her,

217
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,960
marrying into the royal family
might be scarier than death.

218
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,380
What's wrong with marrying a prince?

219
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:20,680
You'll lead a wealthy,
luxurious, and noble life.

220
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,160
This is what many ladies dream of.

221
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,680
Then they can go and be one.

222
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,710
Anyway, I don't want to.

223
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:30,070
Listen.

224
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:32,080
Compared with marrying
a man without love

225
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,630
and being trapped in a life of pretense,

226
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,280
I'd rather die.

227
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,230
I'll help you escape the Palace.

228
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:43,750
You're flying!

229
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,470
- Higher!
- You're flying!

230
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:00,800
I misspoke.

231
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,750
Please forgive me.

232
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,440
You're right.

233
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:12,470
That was Pingyang's only choice.

234
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,590
It's also mine now.

235
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:22,710
My mother once told me

236
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,780
that to marry into the noble families,

237
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:25,920
to stabilize the court,

238
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,300
and to ease my father's worries,

239
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:29,800
is the destiny of a princess.

240
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:33,200
I'm not far from that day.

241
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:35,830
Your Highness.

242
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:37,280
Now that you're here,

243
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:38,630
have a drink with me.

244
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,110
Your wish is my command.

245
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,630
There will be fireworks later.

246
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,400
Your Highness,

247
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,080
your fireworks are different
from the ones I've seen.

248
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,400
They're quite beautiful.

249
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,710
Xu Qi'an,

250
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,750
do you think Princess Pingyang
might not have died,

251
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,920
but instead went to another world,

252
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,510
watching fireworks with us?

253
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:40,190
Yes.

254
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:42,310
In that world,

255
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:44,370
there is no concept of ruler and subject

256
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:45,590
and of high and low.

257
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:47,400
Everyone is born equal.

258
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:49,320
There's no such thing
as parental commands

259
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:50,960
or arranged marriages.

260
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:52,990
In the sea of people,

261
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,400
if two people meet

262
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:55,870
and fall in love,

263
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,030
they can walk hand in hand for life.

264
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:15,990
Even if they don't meet a good match,

265
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:18,540
there's no need to settle
due to outside pressure.

266
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,230
Living alone is just as good.

267
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:24,870
You can go anywhere you want

268
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:26,590
and do whatever you want to do.

269
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:28,750
Is there really such a world?

270
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,640
Of course.

271
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:32,750
Not only can women live
without marrying,

272
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:34,110
in that world,

273
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:35,800
women, like men,

274
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:37,750
can go out, struggle,
and pursue their dreams,

275
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,110
to realize their own worth.

276
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,630
When they grow old,
they can buy a house with friends

277
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:44,800
and live a simple, happy life.

278
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,110
If such a world exists,

279
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,750
I really want to see it.

280
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:10,080
But...

281
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:12,590
But what?

282
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,800
But I'm not as beautiful as Pingyang.

283
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,680
I'm not as smart

284
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:20,350
as she is.

285
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,280
I'm not as brave as she is.

286
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,110
I can't do anything.

287
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,110
On the contrary,

288
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:41,630
Your Highness have many advantages.

289
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:43,630
You're carefree,

290
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:45,110
genuine,

291
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,870
and sincere toward others.

292
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,160
Even so,

293
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,750
I wouldn't want to leave the people
in this world.

294
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:54,830
I can't leave my mother,

295
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:59,230
even though she always complains
that I'm useless.

296
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:00,710
And my brother.

297
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:02,990
Every time Mother scolds me,

298
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:05,320
he's always the first to protect me.

299
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:07,040
And Father.

300
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,710
Even though I'm a useless person,

301
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,710
he still favors me.

302
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:14,590
And Gang.

303
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:16,920
And you.

304
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,990
Me too?

305
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:27,960
Though we haven't known each other

306
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:29,160
for long,

307
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,230
I really admire your nature.

308
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,990
Sometimes you're as timid as a mouse,

309
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,440
but sometimes

310
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:38,130
you're bold enough to defy the heavens.

311
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:40,360
You can write poems

312
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:42,160
and solve cases,

313
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,960
and you know many interesting things.

314
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:48,790
You also know

315
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:51,200
that I love the egg-yolk puff
from Shop of Delicacies.

316
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,710
Mother says they're too greasy
and doesn't let me eat them.

317
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:57,790
I have to sneak out of the Palace

318
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,990
to buy them myself every time.

319
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,790
How do you know?

320
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,600
She'll understand after seeing it.

321
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,660
(Shop of Delicacies)

322
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:18,960
Someone who secretly cares about you

323
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,360
told me.

324
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,790
Impossible.

325
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,310
Pingyang is dead.

326
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:27,510
I have no friends left.

327
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:30,470
Your Highness, you're drunk.

328
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:42,840
Your Highness, if you don't mind,

329
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:45,160
from now on,

330
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,920
I can be your friend.

331
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,230
I don't want to be your friend.

Your Highness, you're awake.

359
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:55,310
Take it slow.

360
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,360
Take it slow. How do you feel?

361
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:02,400
I've been sleeping here all night?

362
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:03,680
Yes.

363
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:09,910
Where is Xu Qi'an?

364
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:12,550
Xu Qi'an left before dawn.

365
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:14,640
He stayed with you all night yesterday

366
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:15,720
and

367
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,640
held your hand the whole time.

368
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:20,720
He...

369
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:21,680
He...

370
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:23,680
Did he take advantage of me
while I was asleep?

371
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:24,640
No, no.

372
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,120
He was keeping you warm,

373
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,640
driving away the cold.

374
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,440
Before he left, he specifically told me

375
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,960
that once you woke up,
you should drink this congee.

376
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,010
It helps sober you up
and warm your stomach.

377
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:38,550
Try it.

378
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:40,310
He also said

379
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:41,960
that he made it himself

380
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,120
and added some special ingredients

381
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:45,350
called

382
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:47,230
something like chicken powder.

383
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:55,440
It's quite tasty.

384
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,240
This little brat.

385
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,750
He always has something new.

386
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:04,620
(Act if you want it.)

387
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:11,150
Senior Yang,

388
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:13,510
(Guardians' Notice)
these are copied from the city gates.

389
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:15,120
It indeed details

390
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,680
the heroic actions of Yang Qianhuan

391
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,640
from the Astronomical Bureau
in this case.

392
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,430
It says you made a great contribution.

393
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:28,840
I suppose my fame has spread
throughout the capital.

394
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,990
Thanks to the Supervisor
for calling me back

395
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:34,300
(Guardians' Notice)
to make contributions.

396
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:35,150
My Master

397
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,160
truly didn't deceive me.

398
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:39,990
But

399
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,030
I'll have to be more careful

400
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,750
when I go out

401
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:45,470
to avoid being recognized

402
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:48,200
and causing unnecessary trouble.

403
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,710
There's no need for that.

404
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:52,070
After all,

405
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:54,400
no one is talking about this.

406
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:57,070
Why?

407
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:00,120
Senior Yang,

408
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,070
this is the poem.

409
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:07,310
Since it was spread from the court,

410
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:10,060
it's caused a huge stir
in the Directorate of Education

411
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,920
and Yunlu Academy.

412
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:13,160
It's been hailed

413
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:16,200
as the greatest satire poem ever.

414
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:18,680
Now it's spread everywhere.

415
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:22,550
Everyone praises Mr. Xu
as the Dafeng's conscience.

416
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:25,600
I only wish my child
to be foolish and simple,

417
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,750
without disaster or hardship,

418
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,230
to become a public official.

419
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,120
Why?

420
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,790
Why is it that Xu Ningyan

421
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:38,600
can always do things

422
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:41,440
that everyone envies?

423
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:46,470
He single-handedly solved
the Sangbo Case

424
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,790
and scolded the powerful

425
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,920
when he was beneath everyone.

426
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,270
It's not fair.

427
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,440
It's not fair.

428
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,260
It's so unfair.

429
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,520
Senior Yang,

430
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:03,310
are you alright?

431
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:06,640
I have

432
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:09,960
realized it.

433
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:13,270
I'm going to stand before the court

434
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:14,600
and scold the officials.

435
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,790
If Xu Ningyan is
the Dafeng's conscience,

436
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,990
then I want to be the Dafeng's light,

437
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:20,200
shining before the court.

438
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,440
Senior Yang, don't.

439
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:27,840
Holding the sun and moon,
I pluck the stars.

440
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:30,920
There is no one like me in this world.

441
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,230
Who brought me here?

442
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:37,170
Master, are you going to stop me?

443
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:38,880
You're being too impatient.

444
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:41,790
You said I'd be famous once I go back.

445
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:43,770
Why are you stopping me now?

446
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:45,310
The capital is full of hidden talents.

447
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:47,120
There's always someone better.

448
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:48,390
Master,

449
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,310
explain clearly.

450
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:52,070
I mean

451
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:53,990
you should hide your weaknesses.

452
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:56,150
I have

453
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:57,200
realized it.

454
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,600
What have you realized?

455
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,990
Master, are you stopping me

456
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:03,310
because you're afraid I'll outshine you?

457
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,600
Old man,

458
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,470
let me out!

459
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,640
Old man!

460
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,160
It's my turn.

461
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:29,960
I've just finished

462
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,920
handling a small matter.

463
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,460
Your Highness, please forgive me.

464
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:36,790
Supervisor, your chess skills

465
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:38,120
aren't as good as before.

466
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,280
But

467
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,360
your ability to judge people

468
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,510
is still as sharp as ever.

469
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:46,990
Xu Qi'an

470
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,880
did solve the case.

471
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,790
He didn't fail you.

472
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,270
First, you let me introduce him
to the Guardians,

473
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:56,710
and you guided him step by step

474
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:57,710
to solve the Sangbo Case.

475
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,070
But

476
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:02,440
isn't that a bit too early?

477
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,790
I have no other choice.

478
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:08,120
The Nine Pass is full of villains.

479
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:09,960
Only in this way

480
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:11,680
can he fight

481
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,070
with them.

482
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,640
As you say, Supervisor.

483
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:19,600
But there is one thing.

484
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,070
Unless absolutely necessary,

485
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:24,510
don't involve Lin'an.

486
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:29,200
You're right, Your Highness.

487
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:30,600
I'll remember that.

488
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:43,830
Good move.

489
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:53,900
(Xu Mansion)

490
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:56,870
Honey,

491
00:26:57,270 --> 00:27:00,030
have you told Cijiu that we've moved?

492
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:00,870
Don't worry.

493
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:02,600
Ningyan is reliable.

494
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,920
He must've written to the Academy.

495
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:06,920
Welcome.

496
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,310
Congratulations.

497
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:09,310
You're here.

498
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,200
Yes, now your family

499
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,440
has two talents.

500
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,470
From now on,

501
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:15,880
you'll live a life
of endless wealth and honor.

502
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,540
- No.
- This is a perfect gift

503
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:18,710
(Nourishing Cream)
for you.

504
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,500
Try this cream.
It's perfect for your skin.

505
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,130
Your skin will be as smooth and bright

506
00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:22,870
as white jade.

507
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:25,270
Thanks. This is really good.

508
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:27,510
Wealth and honor are beyond our reach.

509
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,230
We're just getting by.

510
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:30,160
Getting by?

511
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:31,550
You call this getting by?

512
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:33,160
Look at the house you chose.

513
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,230
It's quiet yet convenient,

514
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:35,510
a perfect retreat.

515
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:37,230
Living here must be comfortable.

516
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:38,270
Come on.

517
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:39,840
It's quite secluded.

518
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,400
From East City to West City,

519
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:44,920
the coachman took an hour to find here.

520
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:45,790
I got dizzy

521
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:47,030
from all the turning.

522
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,600
If you don't feel well,

523
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,790
you should go rest

524
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:52,920
and eat something.

525
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:54,680
Never mind. I'm not hungry.

526
00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:57,120
I had a bird's nest and snow frog stew
for breakfast.

527
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,310
It hasn't been digested yet.

528
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:01,030
Don't let her get to you.

529
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,790
Her husband used to work
in the Ministry of Rites.

530
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:05,160
Because of the Sangbo Case,

531
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,330
he's still detained
in the Ministry of Justice.

532
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,310
How could she be in the mood
to eat anything?

533
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:12,120
It's just a routine inquiry.

534
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:13,880
He'll be back in a few days.

535
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,550
Didn't you just tell me

536
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:17,260
that this time he's in trouble,

537
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:18,790
and you were trying to ask Xu Ningyan

538
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:20,200
to intercede for him?

539
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:22,920
Ridiculous.

540
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:26,120
Xu Ningyan is just a Copper Gong.

541
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:27,680
He can't possibly

542
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,550
have a say in such a matter.

543
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:31,920
The Guardians are here.

544
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,820
(Xu Mansion)

545
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:08,750
Mr. Yang, Mr. Nangong.

546
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:10,990
Sorry for the improper welcome.

547
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,160
Mr. Xu,

548
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,610
on behalf of the Guardians,

549
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:16,880
we're here to congratulate you
on moving to a new house.

550
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,470
Thank you.

551
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,440
It's truly an honor

552
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,790
for our family to have you here.

553
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:25,470
We're truly honored.

554
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,840
Where is Lord Wei?

555
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:35,470
Lord Wei said he'd come.

556
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:37,710
Lord Wei is busy,

557
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,680
so he asked us to come

558
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,510
and congratulate you on his behalf.

559
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,750
We understand.

560
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:45,710
Everyone,

561
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:46,920
please, come inside.

562
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,400
We still have matters to attend to,

563
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,160
so we won't trouble you further.

564
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:55,440
- Goodbye.
- Safe travels.

565
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,160
- Congrats, Mr. Xu.
- Thank you.

566
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,160
Congratulations, Mrs. Xu.

567
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,030
Thank you.

568
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:00,510
You don't have

569
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:01,750
to bring so many things.

570
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:03,020
It's a bit embarrassing.

571
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:04,130
We've delivered the gifts,

572
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,880
so we'll take our leave now.

573
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,600
- Why not stay for a meal?
- No, no.

574
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,640
We've prepared everything.

575
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:09,940
Why not eat here?

576
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:10,840
You...

577
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:11,680
Let's go back.

578
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:12,800
Thank you.

579
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,240
Take care.

580
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,280
Ru.

581
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:18,910
Ru.

582
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:20,230
- Take care.
- You...

583
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:22,200
Come and visit often.

584
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:28,160
I didn't expect Ningyan to have
such great influence.

585
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,720
Why not

586
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:33,120
ask Ningyan to intercede for my husband?

587
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,070
To be honest,

588
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:39,070
that's the very reason I'm here today.

589
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,600
There are too many to count.

590
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,310
Note everything.

591
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:47,440
Don't make a mistake.

592
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:49,270
Yes. Note everything.

593
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,640
Write Lord Wei's name down.

594
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,960
I'll show you around.

595
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,040
Ru,

596
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:56,880
we're friends after all.

597
00:30:56,990 --> 00:30:59,880
Ru, can you talk to him for me?

598
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:00,840
Let me introduce you.

599
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:02,660
(Lake Villa)

600
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:03,540
Wait, what?

601
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:05,230
The princess went on a long journey?

602
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,120
It's been days now.

603
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,900
The Noble Consort approved it?

604
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:11,990
No.

605
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:13,840
The princess sneaked away at night,

606
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,160
only leaving a letter behind.

607
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:16,970
The Palace is in chaos right now.

608
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,710
Noble Consort Chen said

609
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:22,710
if they found out who instigated
the princess,

610
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:24,360
they wouldn't spare them.

611
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:31,920
Gang, remember this.

612
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:34,440
If anyone asks about that night,

613
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,840
tell them we were just
having a casual chat

614
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,880
about poetry.

615
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,470
- There was nothing else.
- Understood.

616
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:42,880
The princess's departure
has nothing to do with me.

617
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:44,270
Understood.

618
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:48,640
Did the princess leave any words behind?

619
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:51,200
The princess said thank you.

620
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,750
It was thanks to your encouragement

621
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:53,920
that she decided to go

622
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,880
in search of what her heart desires.

623
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:08,510
(Xu Qi'an,)

624
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,600
(you're right.)

625
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:12,790
(I should act if I want to.)

626
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,640
(Rather than pitying myself)

627
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,750
(and hesitating,)

628
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,460
(it's better to act with determination.)

629
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:20,030
(I will go in place of Pingyang)

630
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:21,710
(to see this vast world,)

631
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:24,160
(fulfill her long-cherished dream,)

632
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,120
(and also find)

633
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,640
(my freedom in this world.)

634
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:45,140
(Dear Master,)

635
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:47,310
(the Sangbo Case is settled,)

636
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:49,070
(causing a huge stir in the court.)

637
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,640
(The officials are in a state of panic.)

638
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:52,630
(Everything)

639
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:55,270
(has gone as our Kui hoped.)

640
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,880
(After this battle,)

641
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,840
(Wei Yuan has been staying indoors.)

642
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:00,230
(Recently,)

643
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:02,030
(he hasn't even attended
court meetings.)

644
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:03,120
(In reality,)

645
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:05,200
(he's been sending his Gold Gongs)

646
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:07,160
(to search along Mount Dahuang.)

647
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,510
(Several of our Kui's outposts)

648
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:11,340
(were raided by the Guardians,)

649
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:13,510
(and the damage was severe.)

650
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:15,070
(You were right.)

651
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,600
(To deal with the Dafeng,)

652
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:18,310
(we must first remove Wei Yuan.)

653
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:19,550
(Otherwise,)

654
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:22,070
(our Kui will never rise.)

655
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,400
(As for the Supervisor,)

656
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:26,600
(he still claims to be bedridden
and stays indoors.)

657
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,990
(He's a 1st Rank powerhouse
in the world.)

658
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:33,230
(He just wanted to sit on the fence
on the Sangbo matter.)

659
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,990
(You were right.)

660
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:39,270
(The Supervisor must've seen
through our plan long ago,)

661
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:41,160
(but he has kept silent
about the whereabouts)

662
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,780
(of the demonic hand)

663
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,850
(as if he's waiting for something.)

664
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:48,050
(As for the controller
of the demonic hand,)

665
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:50,000
(according to your orders,)

666
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:52,480
(we have temporarily formed
an alliance with him.)

667
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:53,750
(Now,)

668
00:33:53,770 --> 00:33:56,120
(the demonic hand has been
taken away as planned)

669
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:59,160
(and has gone along
with the tax silver to Yunzhou.)

670
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:01,390
(He insisted on not acting
in the capital,)

671
00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:03,580
(seemingly waiting
for something as well.)

672
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:05,960
(By the way, Master,)

673
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:08,960
(Xu Qi'an has now been promoted
to a Silver Gong of the Guardians.)

674
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:12,190
(The court sent him to Yunzhou
to trace the tax silver.)

675
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,990
(This is no coincidence.)

676
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:16,400
(Perhaps, as you predicted,)

677
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:19,840
(Xu Qi'an is the key
to that person's plan.)

678
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:23,270
(Settled)
(I'll continue investigating Xu Qi'an.)

679
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,240
(In three months,)

680
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:26,470
(everything)

681
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:28,590
(will be settled.)

682
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:39,180
(Three months later)

683
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:42,820
(Yunzhou)

684
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:17,630
Enemy attack!

685
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:51,920
Brothers,

686
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,110
let's kill our way out!

687
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:54,770
- Kill!
- Kill!

688
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:12,190
I'm Guardian Silver Gong Xu Qi'an,

689
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,960
ordered to investigate the tax silver.

690
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:16,110
Anyone who obstructs shall be killed.

691
00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:17,070
Kill them!

Remember, tie them up tightly.

714
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,840
- Do you hear me?
- Yes.

715
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:25,470
My Lord, the rebel leader
has been executed,

716
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:27,230
and the remaining rebels
have been captured.

717
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:29,390
My Lord,

718
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,280
we got 134,500 liang,

719
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,720
plus the rebels' ordnance and the loss.

720
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:34,840
They're all here

721
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:35,840
for you to review.

722
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:47,360
Here is the confiscated tax silver.

723
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:48,510
Please inspect it.

724
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,800
Warehouse the tax silver now,

725
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,800
and imprison the rebels.

726
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:54,760
Make sure it's done.

727
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:56,470
- Yes!
- Yes!

728
00:37:57,670 --> 00:37:58,880
Mr. Xu's orders:

729
00:37:58,990 --> 00:38:00,280
Warehouse the tax silver,

730
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,440
and imprison the rebels.

731
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,670
Make sure it's done.

732
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:03,650
- Yes!
- Yes!

733
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,320
Move faster.

734
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,760
Watch out. The ropes.

735
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,160
Move!

736
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:12,310
Hurry up!

737
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:28,670
I'm drenched in sweat.

738
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:29,960
Come on, bro.

739
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:31,920
We must have drinks tonight.

740
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:34,030
Bro, to help you
establish your prestige,

741
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:35,920
I haven't drunk for three months.

742
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:38,320
I couldn't help it. We were on duty.

743
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,320
I've been suffering too.

744
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,240
I understand.

745
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,920
I've booked a private room.

746
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:44,150
I'll treat you tonight.

747
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:45,960
We'll drink the best and enjoy tonight.

748
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,440
Guangxiao,
let's go check the tax silver.

749
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,280
Okay.

750
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:51,430
Let's go.

751
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:50,880
(The talisman isn't working.)

752
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:52,240
(It seems the Qi force...)

753
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:08,670
Xu Qi'an.

754
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,400
(Where am I?)

755
00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:25,360
Zhou Li?

756
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:26,990
Xu Qi'an.

757
00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:29,880
Do you admit your crimes?

758
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:33,990
Xu Qi'an.

759
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:45,720
Prepare to die.

760
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,960
Xu Qi'an.

761
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,760
Xu Qi'an,

762
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,960
