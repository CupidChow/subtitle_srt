I'm afraid I'll be a little bit late

I'm curious what I'll be like

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000

I'm afraid I'll be a little bit late

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
We're old and lazy

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
We're not even in the world

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000

Fragrance can be seen in bring such young people

Yes, sir

57
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:35,600
Yes, sir

58
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,900
I've waited for you

59
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,580
I'd like to ask you to cook for me

60
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:49,480
SongIFAju

61
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,280

63
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,180
sir

64
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:55,260
The news just now

65
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,900
said that Mr. Xu

66
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,860
and Mr. Zhang

67
00:03:58,860 --> 00:03:59,740
were taken away.

68
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:00,500
I knew it.

69
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:01,900
I didn't expect

70
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:03,900
you could really talk about Dong Da.

71
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,020
Master, you're not here.

72
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:08,740
Thanks to Xu Qi'an's secret investigation

73
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:11,340
and the company that killed Zhang Yang.

74
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:12,260
Good.

75
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:16,460
Xu Qi'an is a good person.

76
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:21,900
You said we didn't find it before.

77
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:22,740
Master,

78
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:25,180
now I find it's not too late.

79
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:26,420
Not too late.

80
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,580
If you don't do the job,

81
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:37,660
you'll be beaten to death.

82
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:43,940
If you don't do the job,

83
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,940
you'll be beaten to death.

84
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:46,380
Enough.

85
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:47,700
Enough.

86
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:48,380
Stop practicing.

87
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:49,300
If you keep practicing,

88
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:51,140
your family will be ruined.

89
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:53,660
But the result is not good.

90
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:54,100
Look,

91
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,220
I'm not

92
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:56,300
going to draw this now.

93
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,900
I can understand your intention.

94
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,380
Who doesn't want to go to the court?

95
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:07,900
Yes.

96
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,060
As a courtier,

97
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,380
it's your dream.

98
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:12,980
But you have to

99
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,180
get into the court.

100
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:16,740
You have to take the test.

101
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:17,620
I thought

102
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:20,540
you spent hundreds of taels of silver.

103
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:22,900
But the result is...

104
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:25,340
You got the result.

105
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:26,460
You got the result.

106
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,700
I told you,

107
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,980
you should be a good person

108
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:32,700
in the county.

109
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:42,660
Others are good people.

110
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:45,300
I'm a good person.

111
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,580
No, you have to think of a way.

112
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:49,380
Master.

113
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,260
You...

114
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:55,260
How did you guess?

115
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:56,700
Good news.

116
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:59,620
The county magistrate wants to reward you.

117
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,260
He's going to reward you.

118
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:15,620
Tao.

119
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:17,460
What do you mean?

120
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:18,580
Reward you?

121
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:20,260
Close the door.

122
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:22,660
You...

123
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,380
What's going on?

124
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,700
The county magistrate ordered

125
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,060
that you should

126
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,500
make the best

127
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,660
and most efficient environment for you.

128
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:34,900
From now on,

129
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:37,580
Ning Yan is the key

130
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:38,580
to our Yama's protection.

131
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,500
He won't disturb you

132
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,420
with anyone.

133
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:42,460
What's the need?

134
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:43,860
Tell me.

135
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,700
I'll make up for it.

136
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:48,020
You only care about your heart.

137
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:49,260
You should be safe.

138
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:49,940
Okay?

139
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,020
I'm sorry.

140
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:53,300
Leave me some firewood.

141
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:54,820
I'll leave some for Bao, okay?

142
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:58,540
Open it.

143
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:02,500
What are you doing?

144
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,780
You're looking for a lock.

145
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,420
All the doors and windows are closed.

146
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:05,900
Hurry up.

147
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:07,060
Bao.

148
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,140
It's not worth it.

149
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:17,820
Who's that?

150
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,260
It's been days.

151
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:20,540
Why is he still here?

152
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:22,020
I'll go to the county magistrate's office.

153
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:24,220
He's not a useful person.

154
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:25,780
He's too young.

155
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,540
He should be strong.

156
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,540
When he's done,

157
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:31,580
don't worry.

158
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:32,260
I'll be back.

159
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:43,620
What's wrong?

160
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:45,740
What's wrong, kid?

161
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:48,500
Who bullied our kid?

162
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,660
What's wrong?

163
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:55,060
I'm crying.

164
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:57,060
I can't stand it.

165
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:00,060
What's wrong?

166
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,100
Who bullied you?

167
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,020
Wake up!

168
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:23,500
What's the matter?

169
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:25,580
I don't want.

170
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,220
I'm so poor at this.

171
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:29,740
You should go and rest.

172
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:33,060
What's wrong?

173
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:34,300
foutie.

174
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,820
I'll call you when I go to the roof later.

175
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:38,900
Call me?

176
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:42,300
You'll never call me.

177
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,140
I'm this busy to head here.

178
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:46,580
You can't call me.

179
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,820
Where's Ning Yan?

180
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:54,460
Uncle Er!

181
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:55,420
Come here!

182
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:56,420
I'm so tired!

183
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:58,220
Brother Wang!

184
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,420
It's been a long time.

185
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:00,420
It's been a long time.

186
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:01,220
Don't bother.

187
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:01,820
Don't bother.

188
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,860
Ning Yan, how are you feeling?

189
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:05,340
How are you feeling?

190
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:06,420
I'm feeling...

191
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:08,580
I haven't even slept.

192
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:09,740
How can I rest?

193
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:11,340
Yes, you can get old.

194
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:12,580
You can get old.

195
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:14,220
Don't worry.

196
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,660
I told Mr. Xie Ling

197
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:16,980
that we're going to start today.

198
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:18,980
I'm going to Yama again.

199
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:20,820
Really?

200
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:21,820
Yes.

201
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:24,300
It's convenient to see you at home.

202
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:25,860
I've brought you here.

203
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:26,860
Come on.

204
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:29,060
Uncle Er!

205
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:30,700
Wait a minute.

206
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:33,100
Brother Wang, this is not right.

207
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,100
The public affairs

208
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,540
have a reason to be at home.

209
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:39,020
Brother Xu,

210
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:40,740
others don't know you.

211
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:42,140
It's a big deal

212
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:44,900
to be at home.

213
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:45,660
It's a big deal.

214
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:02,620
Not bad.

215
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,020
Bro,

216
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:06,660
OK.

217
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,500
Excited

218
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:29,140
I want to be Baoist

219
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:30,140
Come on.

220
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:31,140
Come on.

221
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:32,140
Come on.

222
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:33,140
Come on.

223
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,140
Come on.

224
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:36,140
It hurts.

225
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:37,140
It's here.

226
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:38,140
Hurry up.

227
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:39,140
Turn around.

228
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:40,140
Turn around.

229
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,140
Let's drink tea.

230
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:44,140
Lin Ye.

231
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:47,140
Your family

232
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,140
is so wonderful.

233
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,140
Da Feng.

234
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:56,140
I don't know.

235
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:01,140
Here you are.

236
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:03,140
You're so kind.

237
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:06,140
Brother Wang.

238
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:07,140
My nephew

239
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:09,140
has a great chance of breaking the law.

240
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:10,140
Of course.

241
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:12,140
Mr. Xie.

242
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:14,140
As long as Ning Ye

243
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,140
is in the military

244
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:16,140
and the police

245
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,140
is in charge of the county,

246
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:20,140
we'll give him a high-level credit.

247
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:22,140
From now on,

248
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,140
we'll give him a high-level credit.

249
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:31,140
That's great.

250
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:33,140
My nephew

251
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:35,140
is a good man.

252
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:37,140
What if you let him run away?

253
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:39,140
You're too careless.

254
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:40,140
Yes.

255
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:44,140
Is it too much?

256
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,140
What's the point?

257
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:47,140
He's young and strong.

258
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:49,140
What's wrong with eating bitter?

259
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:50,140
Besides,

260
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:51,140
he has such a good chance.

261
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:52,140
He won't be able to live.

262
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:54,140
He'll regret it in the future.

263
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:56,140
I admire you.

264
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,140
You're smiling.

265
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:00,140
I'm also

266
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:02,140
a future Prime Minister for my nephew.

267
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:03,140
Yes.

268
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,140
It has nothing to do with

269
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,140
what we just said.

270
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:07,140
Ning Ye.

271
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:08,140
You

272
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:09,140
just sit in the house

273
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:11,140
and watch the military service.

274
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:13,140
Don't waste your efforts.

275
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:14,140
Don't worry.

276
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:16,140
No one will disturb you.

277
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,140
If you need anything,

278
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:19,140
I'll come and help you.

279
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:21,140
You just sit in the house

280
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:24,140
and watch the military service.

281
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:28,140
Okay.

282
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:30,140
Sit.

283
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:44,140
Today is March 11th.

284
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:47,140
I've watched the military service again.

285
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:49,140
If you continue like this,

286
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:52,140
I'll have to be a new member.

287
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:53,140
No.

288
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:55,140
I can't be a soldier.

289
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:59,140
The first step is to be a soldier.

290
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:10,140
It's a bit dangerous.

291
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:12,140
I didn't expect

292
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:14,140
my uncle would be so hostile.

293
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:15,140
But it's okay.

294
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:16,140
He can't

295
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:18,140
watch me for 24 hours.

296
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:25,140
I'm too naive.

297
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:28,140
My uncle did everything

298
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,140
for money.

299
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:32,140
Wang Butou didn't come to the military service.

300
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:34,140
He didn't come to the military service.

301
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:36,140
Okay.

302
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:37,140
I know.

303
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:40,140
Wang Butou is the key.

304
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:42,140
Drink some.

305
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:43,140
Let's go.

306
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:59,140
Why are you sleeping here?

307
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:01,140
Don't catch a cold.

308
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,140
After I got

309
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:05,140
Wang Butou's letter,

310
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:07,140
I finally let him

311
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:09,140
let go of my sister.

312
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,140
Okay.

313
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:12,140
Now I'm going to

314
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:14,140
make my second plan.

315
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:17,140
I'm not alive.

316
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:20,140
You give me a happy time.

317
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:22,140
You killed me.

318
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:24,140
You let me die.

319
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:28,140
You let me die.

320
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:31,140
He is so cruel.

321
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:33,140
He said he would take me

322
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,140
to relax.

323
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:37,140
Go to Golan.

324
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,140
As a good listener,

325
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:42,140
how can you take me

326
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:43,140
to this kind of place?

327
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:46,140
Obviously, it's not good for my temper.

328
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:47,140
But it's okay.

329
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:51,140
Relax.

330
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,140
Bai Dongqing.

331
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:56,140
Bai Dongqing.

332
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:58,140
I'm here to drink.

333
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:59,140
Come on.

334
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:04,140
I'll keep my word.

335
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:06,140
On March 13,

336
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:08,140
Wang Butou took me to Golan.

337
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:10,140
He thought I would eat him.

338
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:11,140
He was so grateful to him.

339
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:13,140
Isn't it KTV?

340
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:15,140
I'm familiar with the script.

341
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:18,140
It's impossible to force me.

342
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:21,140
But it's a market.

343
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,140
It's okay.

344
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:30,140
I have to apologize again.

345
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:32,140
I have to apologize every day.

346
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,140
Is the rate too high?

347
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:37,140
I'll go.

348
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,140
I'll go.

349
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,140
And how can the money

350
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:41,140
be more and more expensive?

351
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,140
It's faster than the money

352
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:43,140
in Golan.

353
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:46,140
I'm sorry.

354
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:48,140
I'll take you out for a while.

355
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:50,140
Put the money on me.

356
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:54,140
Life has been a model of my ability.

357
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:56,140
I can't go on like this.

358
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:59,140
But being a playboy,

359
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:00,140
you have to be a partner

360
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:02,140
to succeed in the market.

361
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:18,140
Good job.

362
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:29,140
Please.

363
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:41,140
Three dollars and twenty thousand?

364
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:42,140
Dad,

365
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:44,140
why is it less than last month?

366
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:45,140
I just released it.

367
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:46,140
There are many people.

368
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:47,140
Next month.

369
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:49,140
I'll teach you more next month.

370
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,140
It's gone.

371
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:07,140
It's all here.

372
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:10,140
Okay.

373
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:11,140
Go in and sit down.

374
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:13,140
Thank you, ma'am.

375
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:14,140
Thank you, ma'am.

376
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:15,140
Three dollars and fifty thousand.

377
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:22,140
I sold it for four times.

378
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:25,140
Five dollars and twenty thousand?

379
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:27,140
Daughter.

380
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:29,140
You're so good.

381
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:31,140
Go in and sit down and eat.

382
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,140
Shi Tou.

383
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:00,140
Mother.

384
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:10,140

The summer college exams are about to begin,

396
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:40,780

I fighting to win.

402
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:46,860
No matter who comes to a brave man,

403
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:48,440
he will make contact with people.

404
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:56,140
Nian'er...

405
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,660

406
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:00,460
I'm giving Ian to you.

407
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,420
Nian'er.

408
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:05,300
What's wrong?

409
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:06,700
You have troubles.

410
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:09,860
Nian'er.

411
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:11,540
Why?

412
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:13,580
I wanted you to come here

413
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:14,740
to live in Qingzhou

414
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,740
and большеe all your students

415
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,100
to learn history is the death penalty.

416
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:19,580
I just

417
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:22,300
have not finished writing this death penalty.

418
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:23,940
Haven't open a letter at all?

419
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:26,380
That giddy andлишком powerful

420
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:28,140
of your great master's

421
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:29,780
reputation

422
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:31,260
is the best today.

423
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:32,780
If I would

424
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:35,260
be able tell the Earl

425
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:36,440
maybe I could

426
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:37,340
help you out

427
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:38,840
and

428
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,580
beg for help from his gloomy wateringiens,

429
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:44,140
It's a pity that my son doesn't have a teacher.

430
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:47,500
Your grandfather is also like that.

431
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,740
He only knows how to write articles.

432
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:50,660
He doesn't have a teacher at all.

433
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,260
What are you looking at?

434
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,740
Does my father have anything to do with it?

435
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:55,140
Is it my father's fault?

436
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,340
If you can get into the Qu Yuan,

437
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:59,060
that's all our family's credit.

438
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:00,340
Because he's with me.

439
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:02,340
Look at Lingying.

440
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:04,020
Even though your Xu family

441
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:06,060
has been together all the way,

442
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:09,300
you're the same as before.

443
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:12,740
Why are you blaming me

444
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:14,340
for your son's failure?

445
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:15,940
I can't do that.

446
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:17,860
Did I say something wrong?

447
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:19,340
If you can get into the Qu Yuan,

448
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:21,340
you can't even learn to dance.

449
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,740
But what about learning to dance?

450
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:24,340
You don't have to learn to dance.

451
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:25,140
If you don't learn to dance,

452
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,140
you can't be a dancer.

453
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:27,740
I don't know who can be a dancer.

454
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:28,740
I can't be a dancer.

455
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:29,940
I want to see you dance.

456
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:30,940
You can't be a dancer.

457
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:31,940
You can't be a dancer.

458
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:32,940
You can't be a dancer.

459
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:33,940
You can't be a dancer.

460
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:35,140
You can't be a dancer.

461
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:35,940
You can't be a dancer.

462
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:36,740
Yang Lang, let's go.

463
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:37,940
I'll give you 300 yuan.

464
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:38,340
Let's go.

465
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:38,940
Don't go.

466
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:39,540
Let's go.

467
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:41,140
Zuo Xia Cheng.

468
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:45,140
I'm not a teacher.

469
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:46,940
It's just a poem.

470
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:49,340
I'm the only one who's alone.

471
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:50,740
I'm the only one who's been bullied by the Feng family.

472
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:51,540
Am I right?

473
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:52,340
Yes.

474
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:53,740
Eat.

475
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:58,540
I'm the only one who's been bullied by the Feng family.

476
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:07,540
I'm the only one who's been bullied by the Feng family.

477
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:12,540
The Feng family is so selfish.

478
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:16,540
Good poem is just a poem.

479
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:21,140
When will you write poems?

480
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:23,940
When did I say I wouldn't write poems?

481
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:25,140
Writings?

482
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:26,740
Good poem?

483
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:27,940
You...

484
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:30,140
You've been making this for so long.

485
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:33,340
The seed of our family's reading book is Ning Yan.

486
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:35,340
I knew you would go to read books.

487
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:37,140
You asked uncle to wash the dishes.

488
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:37,940
Yes.

489
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:41,940
But the poem is from Ning Yan.

490
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,340
You can listen to it.

491
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:46,140
So you don't have to be a writer.

492
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:48,540
It's not the book of the reading, is it?

493
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:48,940
Yes.

494
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:50,540
You don't have to be a writer.

495
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:51,340
Of course.

496
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:52,940
Brother, this is a poem.

497
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:54,940
I'll tell you the author is you.

498
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:02,940
Brother, eat more.

499
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:04,340
Eat more meat.

500
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:06,140
People in the school have to eat more meat.

501
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:06,940
Here.

502
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:08,940
Let me feed you.

503
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:11,740
Okay.

504
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:14,340
Take the poem and put it on...

505
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:17,140
Take it to the front.

506
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:18,340
Okay.

507
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:21,940
I don't care about the future.

508
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:24,340
The only one who can

509
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:29,540
write poems in the Feng family.

510
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:31,940
Good poem.

511
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:35,340
Brother, what's the next one?

512
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:37,740
I'll go to the front.

513
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:38,740
Okay.

514
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:41,340
I haven't finished reading the poem.

515
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:42,340
I'll go back now.

516
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:47,540
I'll go with you.

517
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:53,740
Which student is willing to write poems?

518
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:56,740
Song Song, Ziyang, and Ju Shi.

519
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:59,540
Even Brother Que has been caught by you.

520
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:01,540
Let's not go to the front.

521
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:05,140
Sir.

522
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:07,140
I have a poem.

523
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:14,740
The only one who can write poems in the Feng family.

524
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:19,340
The path ahead is unknown.

525
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:21,540
Who is the world?

526
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:23,540
The army is not.

527
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:32,140
Good poem.

528
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:33,940
Good poem.

529
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:35,140
Good poem.

530
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:38,140
Good poem.

531
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:39,940
The path ahead is unknown.

532
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:42,140
Who is the world?

533
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:44,540
Brother,

534
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:46,740
there is only one who can write poems.

535
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:48,940
There is only one who can write poems.

536
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:50,140
Only one.

537
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:51,340
It's okay.

538
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:53,540
It's okay.

539
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:55,940
One can write poems.

540
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:57,940
You are a great person.

541
00:23:58,940 --> 00:23:59,740
Brother Qu,

542
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:01,540
is there a poem with a name?

543
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:03,140
No.

544
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:04,940
It's called

545
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:09,140
the Qing Zhou Song of the Yangtian Palace.

546
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:14,940
The path ahead is unknown.

547
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:17,540
Who is the world?

548
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:19,540
The army is not.

549
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:23,740
I actually tied the poem and the name together.

550
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:24,940
It's really cheaper.

551
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:29,140
The poem is really well-written.

552
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:32,140
It will definitely pass the past.

553
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:36,140
Xie Ziqiao, come here.

554
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:39,140
What's wrong, Chen?

555
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:41,140
Such a good poem.

556
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:43,540
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

557
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:46,340
Actually, I made the poem.

558
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:47,740
The author used someone else.

559
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:48,540
Who is it?

560
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:50,140
Is it the disciple of our school?

561
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:51,340
It's Brother Jia.

562
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:52,140
Brother Jia?

563
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:54,340
Why didn't you mention him before?

564
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:55,540
What's his name?

565
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:56,940
Who is the poem?

566
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:58,340
Brother Jia, Xu Ningyan.

567
00:24:58,340 --> 00:24:59,940
He has been studying hard at home.

568
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:00,940
He is not a poet yet.

569
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:04,140
Come on.

570
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:06,740
Come on.

571
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:08,140
Sit down.

572
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:09,140
Sit down.

573
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:10,740
He Chang.

574
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:11,940
You see,

575
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:15,140
I suddenly have a new star today.

576
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:17,740
Today, Wu Shi took me to your home

577
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:19,140
to meet your brother.

578
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:22,340
Xu Ziqiao, where is your brother?

579
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:24,140
I want to visit him personally

580
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:25,740
and talk to him in detail.

581
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:27,140
I want to talk to him in detail.

582
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:28,740
How is the main course of the main course?

583
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:30,940
Students need to learn economics first.

584
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:33,540
The theory of economics is a miracle.

585
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:34,540
Two teachers.

586
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:36,740
Brother Jia is not a scholar.

587
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:38,140
He is a martial arts teacher.

588
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:39,540
Martial arts teacher?

589
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:43,340
What are you laughing at?

590
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:44,740
You are so naughty.

591
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:45,740
You are in the wrong place.

592
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:47,340
You are never in the right place.

593
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:49,740
You shameless old thief.

594
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:50,740
Shut up.

595
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:52,340
You need to listen to the wrong place in front of me.

596
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:55,340
I have always been a loving person.

597
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:58,940
I have been chosen as the student.

598
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:00,340
You are the teacher of Chen.

599
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:01,940
You shameless old thief.

600
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:03,540
I am a good person.

601
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:04,540
I will kill you.

602
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:05,940
Who are you afraid of?

603
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:06,940
I am a hero.

604
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:07,940
I will burn you to death.

605
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:08,940
I will kill you.

606
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:09,940
I am afraid of you.

607
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:10,940
Run.

608
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:30,340
It's still hot.

609
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:36,140
Brother.

610
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:37,140
Are you okay, brother?

611
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:37,940
Yes.

612
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:39,140
Nothing.

613
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,540
Nothing.

614
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:46,940
Not bad.

615
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:47,940
You have improved.

616
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:52,340
But if you want to improve,

617
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:54,740
you need to achieve the training.

618
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:56,540
Training.

619
00:26:56,940 --> 00:27:00,140
Training and training are different.

620
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:02,340
If you want to achieve eight training,

621
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:04,940
you need to use the training of the master

622
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:08,740
or the master of seven training.

623
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:10,140
Open the door for you.

624
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:20,940
What is it?

625
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:28,340
I thought that

626
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:31,740
when I was in the camp of the Linyuan Pass,

627
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:33,540
I was born to die.

628
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:35,540
So I came to Xie Xu's army.

629
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:38,140
The master of the army opened the door for me.

630
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:41,340
But now, the Taiping city

631
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:42,940
is in the army.

632
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:44,940
How can you achieve the training?

633
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:45,940
Yes.

634
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:47,940
You can't achieve the training.

635
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:50,140
Can't you just leave?

636
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:53,940
I am old.

637
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:56,740
The only wish is to see you

638
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:58,340
marry your father and mother.

639
00:27:58,340 --> 00:27:59,740
That's what makes you

640
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:01,340
the dead father and mother.

641
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:02,140
Wait.

642
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:03,140
What does it have to do with

643
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:05,140
marrying your father and mother?

644
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:06,540
Of course it has to do with it.

645
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:08,940
If you marry your father and mother

646
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:10,140
when you are in the camp of the Linyuan Pass,

647
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:13,340
you can only stay in the camp of the Linyuan Pass

648
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:16,140
and have the same goal as the sky.

649
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:19,140
Is there any other way?

650
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,140
There is no other way.

651
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:25,540
It's not useless.

652
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:27,940
It's not good to make money.

653
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:28,940
Make money?

654
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:31,740
There are also masters in the washroom.

655
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:33,740
You can solve all the problems.

656
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:34,940
Master.

657
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:35,740
Give me the money.

658
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:36,740
I want to practice the qi and qi.

659
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:38,140
I want to marry my father.

660
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:40,940
When did I get your money?

661
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:42,540
You just said you would give me the money.

662
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:43,340
Now I want to marry you.

663
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:44,140
Give me.

664
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:45,940
I have paid the monthly salary.

665
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:46,740
Go to the washroom.

666
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:47,340
I just saw it.

667
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:48,340
When did I go to the washroom?

668
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:48,940
I don't have money.

669
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:49,740
Don't talk nonsense.

670
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:50,740
I want to tell you.

671
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:51,740
How can I do

672
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:52,540
such a stupid thing?

673
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:54,140
Who can ruin my reputation?

674
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:55,540
I am going to marry you.

675
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:55,940
You.

676
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:56,940
I am going to marry you.

677
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:59,740
My father is almost the same.

678
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:01,140
The weather is so good today.

679
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:02,740
Why don't you take me and Lin Yin

680
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:03,540
to go out and have a look?

681
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:04,740
Don't be so polite.

682
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:05,740
What's the matter?

683
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:07,140
You and Tong Liang are drinking together.

684
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:08,140
You have a lot of money.

685
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:11,140
Today is the official day.

686
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:12,540
It's the public day.

687
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:14,740
Lin Yue, you too.

688
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:16,540
You have been running around for three days.

689
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:18,540
You can't afford to be in this family.

690
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:20,140
Where is my mom?

691
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:23,140
I just saw the noodles in the house.

692
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:24,140
It's almost empty.

693
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:25,540
I want to go out and buy some.

694
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:28,140
Let Ning Ning go with you.

695
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:29,740
Me?

696
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:31,740
I want to see the military hall.

697
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:32,740
I will go to Wang Putou.

698
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:33,540
I can't go out.

699
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:34,140
I will stop the table.

700
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:36,740
You want to close the door again, right?

701
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:39,140
Give me the lock.

702
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:39,740
Wait.

703
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:42,940
Girls, let's go.

704
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:46,540
Miss, get on the horse.

705
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:50,540
Come back.

706
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:51,340
Come back.

707
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:55,340
Come back early.

708
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:06,140
Let me help you.

709
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:07,140
Let me help you.

710
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:08,140
Little brother.

711
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:08,940
I have both.

712
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:09,740
Brother.

713
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:10,740
You are not eating.

714
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:12,140
You have already eaten two times.

715
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:13,140
Come on.

716
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:13,740
Come on.

717
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:14,540
Come on.

718
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:16,140
Brother.

719
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:17,140
Brother.

720
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:18,140
Take care of him.

721
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:24,340
How much did you eat?

722
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:24,740
Let's go.

723
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:25,740
Eat more tomorrow.

724
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:26,740
Let's go.

725
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:27,140
This one.

726
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:28,140
I want the last one.

727
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:29,140
The last one.

728
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:31,540
Take it.

729
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:32,340
Here.

730
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:33,140
Let's go.

731
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:33,740
Come again.

732
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:35,340
Slow down.

733
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:36,740
You finished the whole thing.

734
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:38,940
Girl,

735
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:40,140
it's your fault.

736
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:41,140
Or I can't handle

737
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:42,740
this little thing.

738
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:44,940
He just sees people put on the dishes.

739
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:46,540
He knows that brother will blame him.

740
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:48,140
By the way,

741
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:49,340
I saw you reading that book

742
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:50,340
for a long time.

743
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:51,140
What did you read?

744
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:55,140
There are some treasure poems on the wall.

745
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:56,540
Although I am not like Second Brother,

746
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:57,540
I am a scholar,

747
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:59,340
I also want to read a book.

748
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:02,140
You like poems.

749
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:04,740
I don't like them.

750
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:05,940
It's better to read

751
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:07,940
the poems that you can say.

752
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:10,940
By the way,

753
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:12,140
Brother,

754
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:14,340
when did you start to write poems?

755
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:16,740
You were really a traitor before.

756
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:18,140
How could your older brother

757
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:19,540
write poems?

758
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:26,940
What did I do before?

759
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:28,940
I don't know.

760
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:30,540
You don't know?

761
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:33,140
My older brother used to be a little strict.

762
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:34,540
My dad called me several times.

763
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:36,540
He didn't want to eat with us.

764
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:39,740
But now,

765
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:41,140
he eats the most every time.

766
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:43,340
He even dares to be so nice

767
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:44,540
to his mom.

768
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:47,340
But now,

769
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:48,740
he is like a family to us.

770
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:57,540
Come on, Tang Hu.

771
00:31:58,140 --> 00:31:59,140
It's so sweet.

772
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:01,740
Tang Hu, it's so sweet.

773
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:03,740
Why are you still eating?

774
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:05,740
It's useless to find Brother.

775
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:06,740
Tang Hu is so sweet.

776
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:07,940
You don't want it?

777
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:09,140
How about this?

778
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:10,140
Please believe Brother.

779
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:13,140
I believe Brother.

780
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:15,940
Okay, Brother will buy it for you.

781
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:16,940
Wait for me here.

782
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:25,740
Look.

783
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:26,740
My dad.

784
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:29,340
Here.

785
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:35,340
My dad.

786
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:36,340
My dad.

787
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:37,940
My dad.

788
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:41,940
My dad.

789
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:45,340
Look at me.

790
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:56,140
I want to play ball.

791
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,140
My sister is pushing.

792
00:32:57,940 --> 00:32:58,940
My dad.

793
00:32:58,940 --> 00:32:59,940
My dad.

794
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:19,340
Don't go, my sister.

795
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:20,740
I'm helping you to catch the butterfly.

796
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:21,340
You don't need to catch it.

797
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:22,740
Catch it.

798
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:25,940
Where are you going?

799
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:27,540
I'm dying.

800
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:28,540
What?

801
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:36,540
Don't touch me.

802
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:37,340
Brother, touch me.

803
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:38,540
Touch me.

804
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:42,740
Tang Hu.

805
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:45,140
Tang Hu.

806
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:47,940
It's so sweet.

807
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:49,140
Tang Hu.

808
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:50,140
Where is he?

809
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:52,540
What's wrong with you?

810
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:54,740
How do you usually teach?

811
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:57,340
Do you know how to love?

812
00:33:57,340 --> 00:33:58,340
And you.

813
00:33:58,340 --> 00:33:59,340
The butterfly is alive.

814
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:00,340
You catch it for her.

815
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:02,740
Learn to bite.

816
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:05,940
Come on.

817
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:06,540
Sorry.

818
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:07,340
Sorry.

819
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:07,740
Come on.

820
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:08,540
Be careful.

821
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:13,540
Let's go.

822
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:17,540
Come on.

823
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:17,940
Don't be afraid.

824
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:18,540
Don't be afraid.

825
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:19,740
Brother is coming.

826
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:20,340
Here.

827
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:22,140
Tang Hu.

828
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:22,740
Mingyue.

829
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:23,940
Everyone, you should go.

830
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:25,740
Go.

831
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:31,340
Sorry, sir.

832
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:31,940
Sorry.

833
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:32,740
I was too excited.

834
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:33,540
I'm sorry.

835
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:34,540
I can't get the clothes.

836
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:35,340
Go.

837
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:38,140
What's going on?

838
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:38,940
So many people.

839
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:40,740
Go.

840
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:41,940
Go and get the teeth.

841
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:43,940
Sir.

842
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:45,540
My uncle is a guard of the guard.

843
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:46,340
Xu Pingzhi.

844
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:47,740
Just now, you two were my sisters.

845
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:49,340
I don't know how to offend you.

846
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:50,540
Xu Pingzhi?

847
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:52,740
That's the one.

848
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:54,740
The one who keeps the money.

849
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:56,340
Really?

850
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:57,940
So you know my uncle.

851
00:34:57,940 --> 00:34:58,740
That's good.

852
00:34:58,740 --> 00:34:59,940
I'll take my uncle

853
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:01,540
to the door to meet you.

854
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:03,540
I'll kill him.

855
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:04,740
Kill him.

856
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:14,940
Who's the one who's going to kill Mingyue?

857
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:16,740
Mingyue.

858
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:17,740
Uncle.

859
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:18,740
My brother has a hard time.

860
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:19,740
You should quickly rescue him.

861
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:21,340
And tell my father

862
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:22,740
that he's eating wine at Li Baihu's house.

863
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:36,940
Sir.

864
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:39,540
My sister and you are just talking nonsense.

865
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:41,140
It's not about the life of the wounded.

866
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:42,540
The phone.

867
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:44,140
The money is gone.

868
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:21,140
Mingyue.

869
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:27,140
Don't come over here.

870
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:28,740
Otherwise, I'll kill him.

871
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:34,340
You know who I am.

872
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:35,540
Who do you think I am?

873
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:37,340
I'll tell you a truth.

874
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:38,940
There's anger in the skin.

875
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:40,740
There's anger in the skin.

876
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:42,140
Stop.

877
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:44,340
Come and tell me.

878
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:46,340
Who dares to take the risk?

879
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:48,740
How dare you to take the risk in Changle County?

880
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:50,740
No.

881
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:53,740
Hurry and catch him.

882
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:55,340
I'm a family man.

883
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:57,940
I'm a family man.

884
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:06,140
Take him away secretly.

885
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:06,740
Yes.

886
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:07,140
Yes.

887
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:11,340
What do you mean?

888
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:12,140
Let me go.

889
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:14,340
Let go.

890
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:15,540
What are you doing?

891
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:17,940
What's wrong with you?

892
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:21,540
Are you blind?

893
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:23,540
I don't know who I am.

894
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:26,340
I'm so busy.

895
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:27,740
I don't eat.

896
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:29,540
What's the matter?

897
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:31,340
Go back and tell the old man.

898
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:32,340
Go. Go.

899
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:33,540
You bastard.

900
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:34,740
Let me go.

901
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:35,340
Go. Go.

902
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:35,940
Let go.

903
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:40,740
Did you lose?

904
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:41,740
You've been called.

905
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:43,340
You've got a way.

906
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:45,140
Tell the people.

907
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:47,540
You can't be so stupid.

908
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:48,140
You're a fool.

909
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:51,540
Brother.

910
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:54,140
Where's Ningning?

911
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:55,740
She's been frightened.

912
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:57,140
She's been sleeping in the morgue.

913
00:37:58,340 --> 00:37:58,940
My Lord.

914
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:00,940
Take your sister to the back hall.

915
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:01,940
Don't come out.

916
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:02,540
Yes.

917
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:03,140
Let's go.

918
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:06,540
Who told you to go?

919
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:07,540
Stop there.

920
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:11,140
Isn't this Mr. Zhou?

921
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:13,140
Zhou Shilan is a good man.

922
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:15,940
He killed me on the street.

923
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:17,140
He took my son down.

924
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:18,340
It's serious.

925
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:19,140
Mr. Zhou.

926
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:20,540
He's a good man.

927
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:21,540
He's a good man.

928
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:22,740
He's a family.

929
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:23,940
You're not a good man.

930
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:25,140
Don't be so mean.

931
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:26,140
Stop it.

932
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:27,940
Do you want to catch him?

933
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:30,140
No.

934
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:31,740
Fine.

935
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:32,940
I'll catch him myself.

936
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:34,140
Come on.

937
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:35,140
Take that car.

938
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:35,940
No.

939
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:36,540
Mr. Zhou.

940
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:38,540
I'm a court official.

941
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:40,340
I can do anything according to the rules.

942
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:41,540
Come on.

943
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:46,740
I have a letter here.

944
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:48,540
It's from Mr. Zhou.

945
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:50,540
He's from the family of the Ling family.

946
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:52,940
It's from Qi Lingyue.

947
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:56,940
Mr. Zhou.

948
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:58,340
Can I talk to you?

949
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:02,140
Mr. Zhou.

950
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:04,940
I'm glad to see you.

951
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:07,140
I'm glad to see you.

952
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:11,540
It's a good thing for Zhou Shilan.

953
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:12,140
Yes.

954
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:13,940
You...

955
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:14,540
What's wrong?

956
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:15,140
What's wrong?

957
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:16,140
Are you okay?

958
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:17,140
Why are you standing there?

959
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:18,140
Catch him.

960
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:19,140
Zhou Li.

961
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:23,140
You're a man of my heart.

962
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:24,140
Come on.

963
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:25,540
Take it.

964
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:27,540
You're lucky.

965
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:29,140
You dare to touch me?

966
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:34,340
Guess if I dare to.

967
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:35,340
Okay.

968
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:37,940
A limited number.

969
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:38,940
You're not a good man.

970
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:45,540
Tell me.

971
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:47,940
Someone can't see him.

972
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:49,140
Yes.

973
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:53,940
It's a secret.

974
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:55,540
Zhou Li's little bastard

975
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:56,940
has been helping me.

976
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:59,140
It seems you're in trouble today.

977
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:01,340
You can leave now.

978
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:03,740
I'll send someone to send you out.

979
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:04,740
It's better to run away.

980
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:05,140
Go.

981
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:07,340
What if I leave?

982
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:08,540
What if I lose?

983
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:10,340
When will I

984
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:11,540
think about it?

985
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:13,140
I can run away.

986
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:17,140
Come on.

987
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:23,340
Let's run away together.

988
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:25,340
Mustn't be here now.

989
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:29,140
Changeagn with these girls governor Zhang.

990
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:43,140
Raise me up.

991
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:44,140
How much for a pair?

992
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:45,940
A pair of.

993
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:47,140
Help me to make a statement.

994
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:48,300
Xu Qian is in trouble.

995
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:49,100
Su Jing.

996
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:52,300
No, no, no.

997
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:54,700
I can't go to a place like this

998
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:55,900
where I've seen it all day.

999
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:57,700
If something happens to me,

1000
00:40:58,140 --> 00:40:59,500
no one will pay you back.

1001
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:02,700
The money is moved.

1002
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:03,700
I'll pay you back

1003
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:04,500
the money I've spent in the next month.

1004
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:08,580
It doesn't matter

1005
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:09,980
if you see it or not.

1006
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:12,380
But remember to pay me back.

1007
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:17,140
Yellow.

1008
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:17,700
Blue skin.

1009
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:18,100
Blue skin.

1010
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:18,580
Okay.

1011
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:25,300
Brother.

1012
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:40,820
Don't worry.

1013
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:42,140
Brother is here.

1014
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:47,900
Mr. Zhou, you're so petty.

1015
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:49,900
It's not a big deal.

1016
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:50,900
How about

1017
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:52,300
I make a 20-year-old boy

1018
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:53,300
to play the game for you?

1019
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:54,140
If it doesn't work,

1020
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:55,300
I'll make him 50.

1021
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:57,700
I want him dead.

1022
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:58,180
You...

1023
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:02,780
Stop picking up the human race.

1024
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:04,140
The money is moved.

1025
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:05,300
Don't interfere.

1026
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:08,100
Get out of the way.

1027
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:10,700
Stop.

1028
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:12,300
Stop.

1029
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:14,100
Xu Qian.

1030
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:15,780
You're making a mistake.

1031
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:16,980
Xu Qian.

1032
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:18,100
Don't pretend you can't hear me.

1033
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:19,100
Get out of here.

1034
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:24,900
Take him down.

1035
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:26,180
Brother.

1036
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:28,380
Brother.

1037
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:29,500
He humiliated me

1038
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:30,900
and you're the one who made him suffer.

1039
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:32,500
Why did you have to punish me?

1040
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:36,580
If you're guilty,

1041
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:38,180
I'll punish you.

1042
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:39,540
Get out of the way.

1043
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:40,140
Mr. Zhou.

1044
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:40,700
You...

1045
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:49,300
I'm a man of my word.

1046
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:52,700
I'm a man of my word.

1047
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:56,020
I'm a man of my word.

1048
00:42:57,660 --> 00:42:59,860
I can't hold back my hands.

1049
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:03,380
I'm a man of my word.

1050
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:06,860
I'm a man of my word.

1051
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:10,220
I'm a man of my word.

1052
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:14,740
I'm a man of my word.

1053
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:17,900
How dare you solve the problem?

1054
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:20,700
You always come to me first.

1055
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:23,140
But when I first saw you,

1056
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:25,100
you always eaten my food.

1057
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:27,740
It was a superstition

1058
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:29,340
and I was muchísRE under the weight of taking the queremos scheme.

1059
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:31,060
I was afraid that La La would let go of me.

1060
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:32,820
So I banned this scheme.

1061
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:33,940
I was just άλλA

1062
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:35,760
and I was too weak.

1063
00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:37,760
And when I became the hätte-mãв fashion Frenchman,

1064
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:39,780
she thought I was the under Allāh.

1065
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:41,340
Then there was a greedy highness Pishe.

1066
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:42,860
I wanted to open theテーブル

1067
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:43,820
sowoman the boldness

1068
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:46,820
The body of the dead is in the thousands of clouds, not a single drop is determined

1069
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:49,820
Under the sky, the human is singing

1070
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:53,820
The voice of the clouds is too cold to talk to me

1071
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:56,820
At the end of the road, the heart is anxious

1072
00:44:56,820 --> 00:44:59,820
The heart is sad, the heart will stand in the river

1073
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:03,820
Under the sky, the human is singing

1074
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:06,820
The voice of the clouds is too cold to talk to me

1075
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:09,820
Under the sky, the human is singing

1076
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:12,820
The heart is sad, the heart will stand in the river

1077
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:20,320
You see how hard the responsibility is

1078
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:24,820
Once you look back, search for a golden opportunity

1079
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:27,820
The heart is scared now, I want to say something

1080
00:45:27,820 --> 00:45:32,320
It is not right to hold your heart first, but moves in any way

1081
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:36,820
The today, today, today, every day, any day, every minute, when will you go back?
