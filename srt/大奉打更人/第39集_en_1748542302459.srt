1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm afraid I'll be a little bit late

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Oh

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm curious what I'm talking about

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I don't want to think about the future

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
The whole story of the mouth

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Let this bowl of soup be a little bit more than that

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
When you're here

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'll give you the rules

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Just keep on being sick

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Extract this big piece of bowl

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
We're suddenly

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
We're suddenly

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
We're suddenly

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
We're suddenly

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
We're suddenly

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
We're suddenly

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
We're suddenly

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
We're suddenly

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
We're suddenly

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
We're suddenly

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
We're suddenly

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
We're suddenly

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
We're suddenly

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'll share my story

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm worried about the future

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'll give you the rules

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm afraid I'll be a little bit late

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Oh

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,400
It's hard.

30
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,440
This is the winning fever,

31
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,280
I'll be글

32
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,280
to take strength.

33
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,080
I care for you.

34
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:43,960
One girl use the that what time

35
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,060
Who dares step forward,

36
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:00,040
I'm willing for her to see

37
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,300
what she can think!

38
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:15,580
Bring them in!

39
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:17,560
I would like to protect change!

40
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,140
Salivary?!

41
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:25,360
It's the Fang family's case!

42
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,760
Take the criminal, Zheng Xinhuai.

43
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,680
I have a rival.

44
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,800
Kill them all!

45
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,440
Everyone.

46
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,000
Listen to me.

47
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,440
Listen to me.

48
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,880
I, Zheng Xinhuai,

49
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,280
have never colluded with the Kui tribe

50
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,880
and never bullied the King.

51
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,040
I'm not ashamed of

52
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,000
the King.

53
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,200
Mr. Zheng,

54
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,840
why is it so dangerous

55
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,960
for you to go with me?

56
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,160
My Lord,

57
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,080
I understand.

58
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,560
But

59
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:14,520
I, Zheng Xinhuai,

60
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,400
thank you

61
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,400
for your help.

62
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,800
I, Zheng Xinhuai,

63
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,560
have never colluded with the Kui tribe.

64
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,840
Dead or dead,

65
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,680
each time.

66
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,520
What's the matter?

67
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,520
Is it alwaysfry

68
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,480
the contribution

69
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,600
or the aspects

70
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,640
that can beсный divided?

71
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,360
I would go there.

72
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,400
Disgusting.

73
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,120
Take her away!

74
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,760
I'm sorry.

75
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,760
Xu Xin'an.

76
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,960
The old man who stole my clothes

77
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,360
was taken away by Duke Cao.

78
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,400
Before he left,

79
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,960
he asked me to give you this.

80
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,400
You...

81
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Zhao Xia.

82
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,160
That's right.

83
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,760
I'm the chef.

84
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,600
I'm the chef

85
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,360
who burned all the dishes in your family.

86
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,800
But now he...

87
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,100
People like you

88
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:55,240
have arabghana

89
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:57,380
and dig up the old once-prayed traitors.

90
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,160
Those people

91
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,680
are sons of a boss!

92
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:05,200
Nobody loves you!

93
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,280
gern me!

94
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,040
Hello?

95
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:17,840
Hello?

96
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,360
Hello?

97
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:28,080
You are quite

98
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,240
arrogant recently?

99
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,440
Smile!

100
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,100
Cry.

101
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:38,820
So great.

102
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,720
You 10 visits

103
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,200
These two should quickly

104
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,420
Let me down

105
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,040
I'm still up

106
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:09,320
Out.

107
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,300
W volley.

108
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:22,060
Hit him!

109
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,000
Such a giant.

110
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:42,980
He isn't Blazing.

111
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,260
Enough, enough, enough.

112
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:08,720
Nothing seems to be the point of leaving.

113
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,680
That's its whole of life.

114
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,720
Better go to跟 the army.

115
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,320
Old Song has died.

116
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,360
Why did you add me?

117
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,160
40 robots

118
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,000
can kill you, don't you get it?

119
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,800
The last few days you were inNext PUBG

120
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,880
you were done with doing that.

121
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,160
If it weren't because

122
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,160
were you absent譜

123
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,720
it may have been useless for you.

124
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:43,720
Zheng Qinghuan, you're still not smart enough.

125
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,960
If you can think about it,

126
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:49,320
if everything happens in Chu, you should know

127
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:53,320
who you are going to face.

128
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:29,020
Oh, my lord.

129
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:31,080
The I dedicate myself to you,

130
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,620
your Majesty and your nation,

131
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:35,980
that Iancing at your feet.

132
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:55,920
My lower forming is the

133
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:57,760
dissolved Golg

134
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,480
point

135
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:23,160
【oud

136
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:27,320
Our future is Segway God,

137
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:30,320
But he was too much of a person.

138
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,320
He also saw the people's pure and pure.

139
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,320
He was so heartless.

140
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:42,320
The street he loved the most was only because of the sheep's face.

141
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,320
Mr. Zhou, you haven't come for a long time.

142
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,320
Come here.

143
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,320
Today's noodles are very fresh.

144
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,320
He found out later that

145
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:56,320
the noodles sold in the street corner are also very delicious.

146
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:00,320
He saw the widow of the government died in the west.

147
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,320
He married the new king.

148
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,320
He saw the street corner was covered with the skin.

149
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,320
He was so playful.

150
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:10,320
He helped me to stir up the lamb soup.

151
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,320
More than twenty years,

152
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,320
he met many people there.

153
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,320
He changed every street.

154
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:28,320
He didn't have the potential to go to the south.

155
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,320
He didn't have the spirit of the capital.

156
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,320
But he was so sincere.

157
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:36,320
He became his hometown.

158
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,320
You are back.

159
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,320
Eat.

160
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,320
He decided to leave.

161
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,320
Go.

162
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:59,880
To burn through the dark stars

163
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,600
Passion to night

164
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:06,480
I don't hesitate

165
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,440
It's ok

166
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,400
Though I do nothing

167
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:17,040
I don't cry

168
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,320
and to me,

169
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,240
just love,

170
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:23,120
like there is nothing I can't do.

171
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,040
Not a lot.

172
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,840
You got to have sex with me,

173
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,560
others would be too much for you.

174
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,960
I really wanted to tell you something.

175
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,400
The human behavior

176
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,680
doesn't really work.

177
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,560
They only think you're making a scene.

178
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,480
It's not easy to get out of the city

179
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,520
and get into the capital.

180
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,240
Nothing married into our这个.

181
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:13,800
You will live,

182
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,640
right?

183
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:27,560
I thought there'd be a free undying for you.

184
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,960
Who would think

185
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:36,620
葷hip is a great achievement.

186
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,480
If we just remove him,

187
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,400
he'll...

188
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,380
become a great doctor.

189
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:46,820
Jin ludzi.

190
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:51,740
I can't help related.

191
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,140
I mean,

192
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:59,240
we need to get a brother flue Hungary.

193
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,240
I'll go now.

194
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,240
Yu Qian, you're so bold.

195
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,240
How dare you interfere with the law?

196
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:13,040
I'm just going to kill you.

197
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,640
I won't say anything.

198
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,640
Come on.

199
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:16,240
Take him down.

200
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,240
Who's going to kill him?

201
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,640
Let's stop here.

202
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,840
Yu Qian, you're here for a reason.

203
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,240
Such a big case.

204
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,040
Actually, you're a hero.

205
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,640
You can't leave.

206
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,040
Yeah.

207
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:05,800
Well done.

208
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:13,760
Your Majesty.

209
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,840
only since Zheng Xinuan is dead,

210
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,560
we can still settle the case.

211
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:20,840
It's just,

212
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:25,040
what will the workers say?

213
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,000
you're going to send a sub是什麼

214
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,720
Strong Walker into the assembly

215
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,160
to protect your safety.

216
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,720
Don't be afraid of being tortured.

217
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:35,760
Besides,

218
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:38,760
among the spy who come back to me,

219
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,960
it's your turn to your duty

220
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,720
to stay in old Bailing Palace.

221
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:44,840
Your Majesty,

222
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:48,680
you're in noisi

223
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,560
How treacherous it is!

224
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,560
We новo theон over the schools and monthly lectures.

225
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,560
He was caught by the evil spirit

226
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,560
and was quickly killed.

227
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:00,560
He was killed by Zheng Qinghui for committing suicide.

228
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,560
He didn't give the sixth floor to the State of Zhou.

229
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,560
Now,

230
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:07,560
they only have one last wish.

231
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,560
But...

232
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,560
the Sword of Zheng is gone.

233
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:16,560
The mysterious master is not sure about it.

234
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,560
He can't find him again

235
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,560
and find the Sword of Zheng back

236
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,560
and avenge for the King of Huai.

237
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:24,560
It can be done in a way.

238
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:29,560
The court will open tomorrow.

239
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:33,560
The case will be closed.

240
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,560
Before that,

241
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:41,560
let's let Zheng Qinghui

242
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,560
find out the news of the suicide.

243
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,560
We can't do that.

244
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:53,560
Yes.

245
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,560
So,

246
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,560
this is the back of the King of Fu.

247
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,560
Sister.

248
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,560
Why is this painting?

249
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,560
I heard that

250
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,560
the King of Zheng is dead.

251
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,560
I'm afraid.

252
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,560
I'm afraid.

253
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,560
What are you afraid of?

254
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,560
I'm afraid of Xu Xianyuan.

255
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,560
Who is it?

256
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,560
What should I do?

257
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,560
Mother.

258
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,560
Sister.

259
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,560
Mother.

260
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,560
Sister.

261
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,560
What's wrong?

262
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,560
Did you come back?

263
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,560
No.

264
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,560
What's wrong?

265
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,560
The King of Zheng is killed.

266
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,560
The King of Zheng?

267
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,560
We have to find him.

268
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,560
Do you have a man

269
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,560
who has a comb?

270
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,560
A comb.

271
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,560
I'll go there.

272
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,560
Thank you.

273
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,560
Brother.

274
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,560
Brother.

275
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,560
Did you find him?

276
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,560
No.

277
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,560
Keep looking.

278
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,560
Brother.

279
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,560
Did you see a man

280
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,560
who is as tall as me

281
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,560
wearing a man's clothes?

282
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,560
Sister Siting and Mother Ya have been looking for him.

283
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,560
Where is Xu Xianyuan?

284
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,560
Brother.

285
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,560
You've been looking for him for a whole night.

286
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,560
You're so stingy.

287
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,560
You have nothing to give him.

288
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,560
Xu Xianyuan.

289
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,560
Brother Xu.

290
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,560
We've been looking for you for a whole night.

291
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,560
Where have you been?

292
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,560
Li Yu.

293
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,560
What do you want to do?

294
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,560
How is Xiaowen?

295
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,560
I've thought it through.

296
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,560
Go back to the kitchen now.

297
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,560
Have a good meal.

298
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,560
I'm leaving.

299
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:40,560
I'll be back.

300
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,560
See you.

301
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,560
See you.

302
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,560
Bye.

303
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,560
Brother.

304
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,560
Brother.

305
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,560
I remember those two.

306
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,560
Do you want it?

307
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,560
Eat more.

308
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,560
Thank you, brother.

309
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,560
Meitan,

310
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,560
you should have one too.

311
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,560
Eat meat.

312
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,560
Why are you looking at me?

313
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,560
Let's eat.

314
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,560
Let's eat.

315
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,560
Where did you go last night?

316
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,560
To the club.

317
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:46,560
To the club?

318
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,560
I...

319
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,560
Yes.

320
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,560
I'm full.

321
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,560
I'm full.

322
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,560
I've got something for you.

323
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,560
What are you doing?

324
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,560
Go home and have breakfast.

325
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,560
Eat more.

326
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,560
After dinner,

327
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,560
pack up and go to the club.

328
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,560
Get out of here.

329
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,560
It's my turn.

330
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,560
The rain is falling.

331
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,560
Go to the kitchen.

332
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,560
Something is up.

333
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,560
Nothing is off.

334
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,560
Your Majesty,

335
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,560
I have something to report.

336
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,560
What?

337
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,560
Your Majesty,

338
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:46,560
the Chuzhou Department of Justice Zheng Xinghuai

339
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,560
and yesterday's lunch

340
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:50,560
were killed by crime in prison.

341
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,560
By crime?

342
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,560
How do you think

343
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:13,560
the case should be settled?

344
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:14,560
Your Majesty,

345
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,560
Zheng Xinghuai committed suicide because of crime.

346
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:19,560
The case can be settled.

347
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:22,560
The Chuzhou Department of Justice Zheng Xinghuai

348
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,760
and Zhangzhou people's

349
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,560
were killed by the Chuzhou Department of Justice

350
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:29,560
in the 19th year of the Yuan Dynasty.

351
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,560
And the Chuzhou Department of Justice

352
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,560
killed 38,000 people.

353
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,560
The most criminal and serious one.

354
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,560
The nine tribes of the same family.

355
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,560
Who else is there in his family?

356
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:40,560
He was killed by the Chuzhou Department of Justice.

357
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,560
It's so settled.

358
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:59,560
Does it make sense to be the Chuzhou Department of Justice?

359
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,560
Retreat.

360
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:10,560
Your Majesty.

361
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,560
Stop.

362
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,560
Xu Xi'an.

363
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,560
You're not allowed to enter.

364
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,560
What brings you here, Mr. Xu?

365
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,560
Xu Yuen.

366
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,560
I'm at ease, Mr. Zheng.

367
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,560
Tell me.

368
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,560
I'm at ease.

369
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,560
He deserved the credit.

370
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:22,560
Everything is fine.

371
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:25,560
I even swear by his siIce おい!

372
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:28,600
So I 늘破疑 僕 spicy

373
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,140
The Great Anger.

374
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,520
Public peace.

375
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,240
Public peace.

376
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:44,520
Public peace.

377
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,160
The Buddha is so simple.

378
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,780
We will lahm.

379
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,520
I'm sure you'll lose more.

380
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,520
The time is not up yet.

381
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,520
Go back.

382
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:32,520
Wei and I are different people.

383
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,520
Wei has a good reputation.

384
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:37,520
He's a good man.

385
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,520
He's a good man.

386
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,520
He's a pervert.

387
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:48,520
And I'm a pervert.

388
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:52,520
I can't do anything else.

389
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,520
I'm just a knife.

390
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,520
I'm just a knife.

391
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,520
I'm just a knife.

392
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,520
This is from the previous minister.

393
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:24,520
But I think he's more suitable for Wei.

394
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:54,520
The Emperor's Office

395
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,520
Master,

396
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,520
I've been calling you for a long time.

397
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,520
You've been out for so many years.

398
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,520
I've been calling you for a long time.

399
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,520
Don't go out for a few days.

400
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,520
I'll stay here.

401
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,520
Xu Qi.

402
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,520
Xu Qi.

403
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:14,520
This is the Imperial Palace.

404
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,520
You're a knife.

405
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,520
Xu Qi.

406
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,520
You're a pervert.

407
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,520
How can you do this?

408
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:23,520
How can you do this?

409
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:25,520
Xu Qi.

410
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,520
Don't be so self-conscious.

411
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:29,520
You're doing this alone.

412
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,520
He's the one who investigated the case.

413
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,520
Xu Qi.

414
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,520
Yes, it's him.

415
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,520
Xue Yongxiu,

416
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,520
Mr. Tang.

417
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,520
You two come here.

418
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,520
If I were to kill him here,

419
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,520
would His Majesty blame me?

420
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:48,520
I won't do it.

421
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:59,520
I'm the one you're looking for.

422
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,520
You want to do something?

423
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,520
Wei Gong,

424
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,520
you're not good enough to teach people.

425
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,520
Look at this useless kid.

426
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:11,520
How dare you act like a brother in the palace?

427
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,520
If you can't teach him,

428
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,520
what do I do for you?

429
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,520
Someone is going to the Imperial Palace.

430
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,520
Close the door and protect the house.

431
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,520
Don't go.

432
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,520
He's back.

433
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,520
Don't go.

434
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,520
Wei Gong.

435
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,520
We're not going to close the house.

436
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,520
You're not going to close it.

437
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,520
Xu Qi, don't come back.

438
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,520
What are you doing?

439
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,520
The Imperial Army only listens to His Majesty's orders.

440
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,520
Close the house.

441
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,520
You can't close the house.

442
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,520
Xu Qi.

443
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,520
Xu Qi.

444
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,520
Wei Gong.

445
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,520
Wei Gong.

446
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:14,520
Wei Gong.

447
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,520
Save me.

448
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,520
Save me.

449
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,520
You're going to die.

450
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,520
I'll kill you.

451
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,520
Wei Gong.

452
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,520
Wei Gong.

453
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,520
Wei Gong.

454
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,520
Wei Gong.

455
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:42,520
You're going to die.

456
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,520
You're going to die.

457
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,520
You can't live.

458
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:17,520
Your Majesty.

459
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,520
Your Majesty.

460
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:19,520
Your Majesty.

461
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,520
Something bad happened.

462
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,520
Xu Qi An was locked up at the gate of the house.

463
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,520
He locked up Duke Cao and Duke Hu.

464
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:27,520
Hai Yang Yan was going to kill him.

465
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,520
He was going to rebel.

466
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,520
Duke Cao and Duke Hu.

467
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,520
How is he now?

468
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,520
He's been taken out of the palace.

469
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,520
Stop him.

470
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,520
If there's any danger,

471
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:43,520
kill him immediately.

472
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,520
Yes.

473
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:47,520
Please look at Wei Gong.

474
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,520
He's gone.

475
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,520
He's really going to rebel.

476
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:57,520
Lord Xu.

477
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:00,520
Why don't I treat you to a bowl of Yang Chun noodles?

478
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,520
Yes.

479
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,520
I've been living in the house for over 50 years.

480
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:05,520
I've been living in the house for 50 years.

481
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,520
I've been living in the house for a long time.

482
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,520
I've been thinking about

483
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:12,520
taking care of my son and my son

484
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,520
in the house of the old man.

485
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:16,520
I've been living in the house for a long time.

486
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:19,520
I've been living in the house for a long time.

487
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,520
I've been living in the house for a long time.

488
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:27,520
All those people are dead.

489
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:30,520
Wei Gong said that Xu Xu was a disciple.

490
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:32,520
Maybe he's right.

491
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:36,520
But I can't stop him.

492
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:51,520
ö

493
00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:59,520
Company commander.

494
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,520
Why didn't you take a back entrance of the court,

495
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,520
Can you be CC?

496
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,520
Later on,

497
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:21,160
split into two different worlds

498
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:24,220
Program today

499
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,820
Blue quit

500
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:31,720
Who has

Not

502
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,240

Bye

504
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:48,360
Throw yourself in my hands!

505
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,160
The earth is full of heaven!

506
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,400
Any enemy,銀 and hot!

507
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:56,720
Bet諾!

508
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,040
Who dares to?

509
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,200
Nice one!

510
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:11,660
Time for our

511
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,400
What is this?

512
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,600
What am I lacking?

513
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,640
Isn't that a dream?

514
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:47,360
Yes.

515
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,800
Who is this?

516
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,160
I'm a man of the past.

517
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,680
I'm a man of the past.

518
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:52,880
Look.

519
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,160
So many people

520
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,080
died for you.

521
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,280
It's the one who reported

522
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,760
that Chu Zhou was not in the right mind.

523
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,360
The one who killed

524
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,560
Prince Zhenbei

525
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,240
in the end.

526
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:04,240
What's going on?

527
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,440
What's going on?

528
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,240
What's going on?

529
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:08,000
What's going on?

530
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,240
What's going on?

531
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,800
I'm a man of the past.

532
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,200
I'm a man of the past.

533
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:14,920
Look.

534
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,320
You said you were going to kill me.

535
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,040
You're in the hospital.

536
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:19,800
You're sick.

537
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:20,880
You're in the hospital.

538
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,160
I'm sick.

539
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:25,480
I'll save him.

540
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:27,360
I'll save you.

541
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,160
Xun Yunluan.

542
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:31,760
You saved your life.

543
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:33,400
It's all because of

544
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,200
the mistakes of Prince Hong.

545
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,760
They caused so much trouble.

546
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,840
They did it.

547
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,040
It's all because of the Hongkuan.

548
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:42,080
You're letting go of me.

549
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,000
You're in the capital.

550
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,400
You're not understanding

Be noticeable.

554
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,040
Tell those YOUS

555
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,400
who ellied Chu Zhou.

556
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,000
Brother Zhenbei

557
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,360

Not enough?

561
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:14,440
He is the one who is willing to live.

562
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,440
He is the one who is willing to die.

563
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:19,440
He said everything is true.

564
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,440
You all said that he is the one who is willing to die.

565
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,440
I am here to kill the people of Chu Chou City.
