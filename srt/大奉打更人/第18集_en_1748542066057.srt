1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,020
Andy and the

2
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:09,160
wrong

3
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:11,140
Opening

4
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:27,800
You

5
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:28,900
Damn

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
What?

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
He's dead?

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The case of the murder of the King of Tai Kang

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
is related to the murder of Sang Bo.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I went to the interrogation today.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I didn't expect to be late.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I was bitten by the antipyretic.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
This is the drug that Wei Gong personally brought up.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
How did he die?

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The cause of death is unknown.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm going to do my job.

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Sang Bo's drug was killed in the Golden Dauphan.

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
But it really has nothing to do with me.

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Sir,

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
if the police are willing to help you,

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
you can have a big risk in the six departments.

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
The King of Tai Kang is dead in the cell.

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
It's an accident.

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It has nothing to do with you.

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Thank you, sir.

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
No need to thank me.

27
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I heard from Miss Cai Wei that

28
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
you helped me in the execution yesterday.

29
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm just a big man.

30
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
You're a good man.

31
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm a good man, too.

32
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
So,

33
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I'll take my leave.

34
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Thank you, sir.

35
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Thank you, sir.

36
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I'll see you out.

37
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Thank you, sir.

38
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Thank you for helping me.

39
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
What about the corpse?

40
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Of course, there is a corpse.

41
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
When I saw the teacher asking about the corpse,

42
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I was so surprised that

43
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I was told by the teacher that

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
it's not a good magic.

45
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
It's not suitable for me.

46
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
This is our magic book.

47
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
It's a secret book of our school.

48
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
It's a secret book of our school.

49
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
It's a secret book of our school.

50
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
It's a secret book of our school.

51
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
As long as I write this book,

52
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I'll use it

53
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
to show you the magic power of this book.

54
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
So,

55
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
you're a lonely person.

56
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
But,

57
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
you can only get the corpse after you finish writing it.

58
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
The case is urgent.

59
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'm afraid it's been a long time

60
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
since you've been on the front line.

61
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I'm sorry.

62
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I'm sorry.

63
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I'm sorry.

64
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I'll tell you a secret book.

65
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I'll give you the power to keep an eye on it.

66
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
It's good to hear that.

67
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
This is the time.

68
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Of course.

69
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Of course.

70
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Brother Cheng.

71
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I heard that

72
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Taikang County is dead in the prison.

73
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I heard that I was also killed.

74
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Let's take a look at the TV.

75
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
There's no external injury.

76
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
It's not a serious poison.

77
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
They're so desperate to die.

78
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
The lady asked

79
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
for the corpse and the body

80
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
for the night.

81
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
She confirmed that they had no problem.

82
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
She confirmed it step by step.

83
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
The witness was indeed

84
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
the one who killed Xuan Tong.

85
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
She killed him in her dream.

86
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
What did you think?

87
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I just heard

88
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
that the three gods

89
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
can do this.

90
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
The three gods?

91
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'm the three gods.

92
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
The Golden Lotus Taoism

93
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
should be mentioned in the seal.

94
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
There's another

95
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
mention

96
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
besides this.

97
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
The corpse.

98
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
The corpse.

99
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Follow me.

100
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
You heard about the Godless Sect?

101
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
My uncle told me

102
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
that it was a god of the gods

103
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:38,560
besides the

104
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Five years ago,

105
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
the Great General of Yunzhou

106
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
and the Godless Sect

107
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
were born.

108
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
One night,

109
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
two thousand soldiers

110
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
died in the Dingning Mountain.

111
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
They had no wounds.

112
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
The whole city was

113
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
completely covered in blood.

114
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
So the Great General of the West

115
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
was not even born.

116
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
From then on,

117
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
the people became the place of the Five Realms.

118
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
They were changed to the sound of the sound.

119
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
They were changed to the sound of the sound.

120
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
The news about the death of the Great General

121
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
was spread by the people.

122
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
It was very likely

123
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
that they became the place

124
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
of the Godless Sect.

125
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
If this is

126
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
the relationship between Yunzhou City

127
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
and this case,

128
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I, the Godless Sect,

129
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
will be

130
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
killed by the two of you.

131
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Yes.

132
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I'm already fainted.

133
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Let's just settle the case.

134
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Don't go to the police station.

135
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Where are you going?

136
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Catch the beast.

137
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
The arch is in progress.

138
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I know.

139
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
What should we do?

140
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
What should we do?

141
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
What should we do?

142
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Ask Yunzhi.

143
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
He's here.

144
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
You need to give him the right.

145
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Since it's a rule,

146
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
let's just do it.

147
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
You really don't understand.

148
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
The emperor sent Yang Gong

149
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
to Qingzhou as a temporary official.

150
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
He was afraid that

151
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
you would send someone to the country to meet the need.

152
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
After all, Qingyun was publicly announced.

153
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Qingzhou was temporarily appointed

154
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
as Yunzhou's temporary official.

155
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
How could he do that?

156
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I heard

157
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
that Yunlu Academy was promoted.

158
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Lin Shang even took a poem of the student with no money.

159
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
He was also a public transfer student.

160
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
He came here to make money.

161
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
How could he

162
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
make some money?

163
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
What do you want to do?

164
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I'll take a look at your words.

165
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I'll take a look at your words.

166
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I'm still a general.

167
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I can't believe

168
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
you're so stubborn.

169
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
You're so stubborn.

170
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
You're so stubborn.

171
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
What's wrong?

172
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I'm not a person who eats the yellow food.

173
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I'm talking about Feiyan.

174
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
You're

175
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
walking on Yunzhou's foot.

176
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
You're so stubborn.

177
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
You're a good person.

178
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I'm grateful to the people in Yunzhou.

179
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
But

180
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
the rules are the rules.

181
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I'm still a court official.

182
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I should be the one to say this.

183
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Where are you going?

184
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I've taken the government server to the heaven.

185
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Seniors,

186
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
we'll go later to meet the minister.

187
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
General Li

188
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
What?

189
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
At the ward of Eighth eighth,

190
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
the doctor vertically translate the Chinese surname.

191
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,960
Since it's decided now,

192
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,920
I thought I動画 may retire,

193
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,880
Gong Hopian might reward me.

194
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,440
It's not important.

195
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,240
What's going on?

196
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,840
It's troublesome.

197
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,280
You are a good example of

198
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,840
the game he used.

199
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,440
But he is a friend.

200
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,680
He is not fast.

201
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,120
He can do anything.

202
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,480
But Fang Yan is willing to

203
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,400
support the court officials

204
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,680
who are willing to

205
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,600
save him.

206
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,480
If he wants to,

207
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,320
he can only blame Yuan Jin's old man.

208
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,440
Everyone,

209
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,080
something happened again.

210
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:40,920
What happened?

211
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,000
Did Yuan Jin die?

212
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,880
The outside world is closed

213
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,840
since the outside world is closed.

214
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,440
Without permission from anyone,

215
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,000
I would have paid for it.

216
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,080
lieber,

217
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,520
did you hear any news?

218
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,880
Interesting.

219
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,640
This young man

220
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:56,940
didn't sack people

221
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:58,040
to the mountain for a fight.

222
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,120
But it was a direct search.

223
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,040
Theцо Mix earthiest panarma

224
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:13,460
poorly made around the ci l

225
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,040
and got 1000 clues.

226
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,400
They probably solved the case.

227
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,560
The Kui Clan?

228
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:27,880
That's impossible.

229
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,360
What did the Kui Clan

230
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,120
use to destroy Sang Bo?

231
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,720
In the gold mine,

232
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,280
the Kui Clan passed the Yellow Mountain to get the消石.

233
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,800
Then they made the消石 mine into a fire.

234
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,560
Through the five hundred guards,

235
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,160
Zhou Chixiong was transported to the city.

236
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,560
Sang Bo was destroyed.

237
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,800
After Sang Bo was killed,

238
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,760
Zhou Chixiong took the family to escape.

239
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,880
Then the clue is broken.

240
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,720
It's not.

241
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:49,840
I think

242
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,080
the court will give the same order.

243
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,800
Zhou Chixiong either left the capital

244
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,560
or hid in a safe place.

245
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,960
Where do you think he hid?

246
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,160
You need to ask.

247
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,680
It must be Yunzhou.

248
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:02,800
No. 2.

249
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,840
You are in the Yunzhou Poyou City.

250
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,280
Can you help me investigate Zhou Chixiong?

251
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,520
You did a great job.

252
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,560
It seems that in No. 1,

253
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:13,120
No. 2 seems to be more reliable than the government.

254
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,160
I refuse to help you.

255
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,720
I provide revenge.

256
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,480
No.

257
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,240
You are the court's person.

258
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:22,400
I refuse to help you.

259
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,160
This is not good.

260
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,440
If No. 2 doesn't help,

261
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,280
Yunzhou is so big.

262
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,880
How can Zhou Chixiong be saved?

263
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,000
No. 2.

264
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,440
You said you owed me once

265
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,200
and you still didn't say anything.

266
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,280
Of course.

267
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,040
But I really need to say something.

268
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:44,760
OK.

269
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,920
You can help me to pay attention to Zhou Chixiong in Yunzhou.

270
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,680
It's the debt I paid last time.

271
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:49,960
As for No. 1,

272
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,760
you owe me this time.

273
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,280
Do you think...

274
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:54,920
Yes.

275
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,040
Yes.

276
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,320
Mr. Zhao.

277
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,520
Mr. Zhao.

278
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:14,360
Mr. Zhao.

279
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,200
Mr. Zhao.

280
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,480
Mrs. Zhao.

281
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,280
Go on.

282
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,040
ATC Run elektron tower to launch step to experts.

283
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:31,840
Mr. Zhang,

284
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,840
Miss Zhou's Holiness Huang Wei is here.

285
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,160
Good morning, Eyed Robe Prince.

286
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,320
I'm not afraid of you.

287
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,720
You did a good job.

288
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,520
You're very busy.

289
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,960
I'm afraid of making trouble for you.

290
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,400
The court has issued a notice

291
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,800
to Zhou Shixiong.

292
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:00,120
But it's hard to find him within half a month.

293
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,160
Is there any other way?

294
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,640
I'm guessing

295
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,360
Zhou Shixiong might escape to Yunzhou.

296
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,120
So I'm asking you to take the second place

297
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,120
as the catcher of Yunzhou.

298
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,560
Yunzhou

299
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,440
is a way.

300
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,440
But Yunzhou is more complicated than you think.

301
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,720
It takes time.

302
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,480
What you said is right.

303
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,240
Is there anything

304
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,200
that can be used by the court?

305
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,680
The court?

306
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,120
Zhou Shixiong's breath was hidden.

307
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,480
Even the number of four-times sword

308
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,560
is not determined.

309
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,760
It means two things.

310
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,440
First,

311
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,160
the number of the dead is too high.

312
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:50,760
Second,

313
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,760
he must have brought

314
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,080
the weapon of the breath.

315
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,080
This is Zhou Shixiong's passport.

316
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,080
Take a look.

317
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,880
He has only eight.

318
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,520
So Wei Gong has been helping me secretly.

319
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,520
Equalized with blood and six for meditation,

320
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,280
scrolled without veil for words and deeds,

321
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,480
an leap into the source of Marshoan's benevolence,

322
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,880
Let alone bathing with theичего,

323
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,880
and checking for impurity.

324
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,120
Wei Gong.

325
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,440
Teacher.

326
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:00,040
I didn't

327
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,760
think I would reward you

328
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:08,760
I will also be excited to kill the people who I have to kill from the bottom of my heart.

329
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,760
Father, prepare the carriage.

330
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,760
I will enter the palace.

331
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:36,760
Xu Qian,

332
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,160
follow me.

333
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:06,760
Go to the temple hall of Yuanni.

334
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:07,760
Go to Jianghu.

335
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:08,760
By the way,

336
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,760
your personality is not suitable for the temple hall.

337
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,760
Jianghu is your world.

338
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,760
If it's not because of Sang Zhuo's case,

339
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:22,760
you must leave the capital now in my arrangement.

340
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,760
I can't figure out this matter.

341
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:30,760
You should do the case of the official.

342
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,760
The case of the official

343
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,760
is a knife in my hand.

344
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:37,760
I can't see the light.

345
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:39,760
How is it?

346
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:41,760
Do you feel wronged?

347
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,760
As long as you can keep your life,

348
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,760
don't say a knife.

349
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,760
You can do it as a horse.

350
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,760
It's not easy to find out the case.

351
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,760
The case is to hide the life and death.

352
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:00,760
The life is to hide the life and death.

353
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:08,760
Even death is to hide the life and death.

354
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,760
I don't want to go to Jianghu.

355
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,760
I want to find out the truth

356
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:19,760
in the way I can.

357
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:23,760
Your personality is different from the outside world.

358
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,760
You are biased.

359
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,760
I don't like you

360
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,760
in my heart.

361
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,760
I know

362
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,760
the Yamen of Dagger

363
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,760
are more than long.

364
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,760
I know

365
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,760
you are more than long.

366
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,760
I know

367
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,760
the Yamen of Dagger.

368
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:50,760
I know it very well.

369
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,760
But the personality is like this.

370
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,760
Light and light.

371
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,760
How many people are like Li Yuchun?

372
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:03,760
If you are like him,

373
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,760
how can you be so suppressed?

374
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:07,760
You are so arrogant.

375
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,760
I know the truth.

376
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:13,760
But I can't bear to see

377
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,760
some things

378
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,760
with my own eyes.

379
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,760
I am not pressed on you.

380
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,760
You should not be surprised.

381
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:27,760
You are afraid to die

382
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:29,760
when you appear in the restaurant.

383
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:33,760
You need to know

384
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,760
that there is no fish when泡 andsoil of the water.

385
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,760
However,

386
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,760
Instead of thirst

387
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:43,760
maybe the additives

388
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,600
Just promote it?

389
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,680
I understand.

390
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,960
A large army flocked to the种 Wolfratence and the Four Suggestions.

391
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,680
Oceanside LandHelms were all frozen and gathered.

392
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:23,040
It wasn't only earlier andوت

393
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,800
but also earlier tooth.

394
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,240
I've seen Wei Gong earlier.

395
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,400
I dare you.

396
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:34,600
machsthe painter Xu Qian in thisells,

397
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,720
please dried out.

398
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,200
You dare not, don't you!

399
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,280
Ms.?

400
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,600
Yes.

401
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:48,920
Today is a bad day.

402
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,440
You slept well last night.

403
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,560
You slept well.

404
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,440
We came here from the north.

405
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,680
Linglong was in the forest.

406
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,560
We were close.

407
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,760
What happened today?

408
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,480
I was in the lake and I was thinking about it.

409
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,680
The lake is so beautiful.

410
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,840
You don't know.

411
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,280
After the Sanbo Palace,

412
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,120
Linglong was disturbed.

413
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,640
The lake was so beautiful that

414
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,320
it fell into the lake.

415
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,920
No matter how you deal with it,

416
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,880
you don't want to get hurt.

417
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:13,920
The Emperor.

418
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,480
He didn't want to have a heart.

419
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,240
He isn't beloved in Linglong.

420
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,840
Why is he chosen to live here today?

421
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,320
A long way from here.

422
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:22,640
I з kau n Punen wang.

423
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,120
Where are the princesses?

424
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,240
Take it easy.

425
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,680
It's not time to learn.

426
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,960
My back and back are hurting.

427
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,400
I don't want to stand up for today.

428
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,800
Noائer, I'm getting serious.

429
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,880
I'm here to see you, Your Highness.

430
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:49,880
The Wan State is in a hurry.

431
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,880
We're here to have a look.

432
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,880
Mr. Youlao,

433
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,880
you're here to see the leader of Li Ling.

434
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,880
I'm fine.

435
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,880
I'm fine.

436
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:02,880
I want to see the great emperor of the Yi Clan.

437
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,880
So,

438
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,880
you're the special princess of the Huaiqing Palace.

439
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,880
Why haven't I seen you?

440
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,880
I'm here to see the emperor of the Huaiqing Palace.

441
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:12,880
I haven't seen you.

442
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,880
I've been living in the palace for a long time.

443
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,880
I don't have a lot of money.

444
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,880
But the princess is a little maid in the palace.

445
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,880
She's the boss of the palace.

446
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:27,880
But there's one thing I can't bear to say.

447
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:31,880
You're not the daughter of Princess Lin An.

448
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:37,880
What's the daughter of the princess?

449
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,880
I mean,

450
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,880
you're the daughter of Princess Lin An.

451
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:47,880
But you're so close to the princess of Huaiqing.

452
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,880
Aren't you afraid that Princess Lin An will know?

453
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,880
I don't care if she knows.

454
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,880
Mingyuan,

455
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,880
you're really bold.

456
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:03,880
But how do you explain to Princess Lin An?

457
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:04,880
Explain?

458
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:05,880
You're lying.

459
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:07,880
When do I explain to her?

460
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,880
I know that you're kind to me.

461
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,880
But I'm a good person.

462
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,880
I only have a good heart.

463
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,880
She's a good person.

464
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,880
Please.

465
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,880
You're really a good person.

466
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,880
I'll explain.

467
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:28,880
One.

468
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:31,880
The first round.

469
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,880
The most important thing is to be the first.

470
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,880
You have to do it.

471
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:40,880
You can't get the first prize.

472
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:45,880
Only someone can get the first prize.

473
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,880
Then I'll take the first prize.

474
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,880
The moon falls on the roof.

475
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,880
The sky is full of stars.

476
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,880
The wind and the rain are on fire.

477
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,880
The enemy is young.

478
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:13,880
Good.

479
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,880
Good.

480
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,880
Good.

481
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:16,880
Good.

482
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,880
You're really a good person.

483
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,880
Ming An,

484
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,880
the moon is not in the sky.

485
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:29,880
I think I should look at you.

486
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:32,880
Eunuch,

487
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,880
today is...

488
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,880
You don't know

489
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,880
that the princes and girls are here to discuss the poems.

490
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,880
They're preparing for the national meeting.

491
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,880
Princess Zhang has prepared for this.

492
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,880
I've done everything I can to make up for her.

493
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,880
I'm satisfied.

494
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,880
That's the face.

495
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,880
Your Majesty, please wait.

496
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,880
You don't want to die.

497
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,880
Do you know the rules?

498
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,880
Eunuch, we know the wrong thing.

499
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,880
It's just that we met Mr. Xu for the first time.

500
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,880
I didn't see him.

501
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,880
I see him in the palace.

502
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,880
What's so good about this?

503
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,880
Didn't you see a man?

504
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:19,880
I've seen a man.

505
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,880
But I've seen a secretary.

506
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:22,880
I've seen a secretary.

507
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,880
It's Princess Lian An's face.

508
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,880
I'm her secretary.

509
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:30,880
I didn't see her and Princess Zhang.

510
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:31,880
I'm afraid that

511
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,880
she's got a lot of words.

512
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:35,880
No.

513
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,880
I'll let her die today.

514
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,880
I'll let her die today.

515
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:44,880
The water is clear, the smoke is bright.

516
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,880
The green pot is strong, the moon is bright.

517
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:49,880
Let's write a poem.

518
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:04,880
Good poem.

519
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,880
This poem is

520
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,880
a poem about a country.

521
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,880
Indeed.

522
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:14,880
Good.

523
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,880
Good.

524
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:16,880
Good poem.

525
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:17,880
This poem.

526
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:20,880
The young and old are not poor.

527
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,880
The water flows and the clouds...

528
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,880
What do you mean?

529
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:24,880
I have to kneel for you now.

530
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:25,880
No.

531
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:26,880
No.

532
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:27,880
Xu Tong, why are you here?

533
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:30,880
I'm here to find Princess Zhang.

534
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:32,880
What's wrong with you?

535
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:33,880
Don't worry about it.

536
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,880
What's the situation with Princess Zhang?

537
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,880
It's going well.

538
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:39,880
You can write a poem.

539
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,880
It's not about the secretary.

540
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:42,880
Don't you know?

541
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:43,880
Now...

542
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:46,880
I'm in the palace.

543
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,880
I'm Princess An.

544
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,880
I'm Princess Lian An's face.

545
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,880
There's no need to say it.

546
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:56,880
I won't do this.

547
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:57,880
I'll write a poem.

548
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:58,880
I'll write a poem.

549
00:25:58,880 --> 00:25:59,880
I'll write a poem.

550
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:00,880
I'll write a poem.

551
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,880
I'm so good at writing poems.

552
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,880
Princess Zhang won't write a poem.

553
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:06,880
Good.

554
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:07,880
I thought...

555
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:08,880
Don't worry.

556
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,880
Princess Zhang is not your type.

557
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,880
She's very understanding and kind.

558
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,880
I believe you're a good person

559
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:16,880
who's worried about you.

560
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,880
Princess Zhang is a famous lady.

561
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:23,880
Princess.

562
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:24,880
Hurry up.

563
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:26,880
I'll write a poem.

564
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:29,880
What are you doing?

565
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,880
I'm going to the capital to take a bath.

566
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:36,880
I'll go back to Mu's Mansion in the spring.

567
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:38,880
What does she mean?

568
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:39,880
She doesn't want to see me?

569
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:40,880
Princess, you're so far away.

570
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:41,880
I'm afraid she didn't see you.

571
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:42,880
She saw me.

572
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:43,880
She didn't see you.

573
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:44,880
I'm so close to you.

574
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,880
Are you close?

575
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:46,880
I'll tell her.

576
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,880
Hurry up.

577
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:48,880
Hurry up.

578
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:49,880
I'm just here.

579
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:50,880
She won't wake up.

580
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:51,880
Xiao Cheng.

581
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,880
I'll go back to find you.

582
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,880
Can you explain to me?

583
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,880
I'll go back to the capital in the spring.

584
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,880
I'll go back to the capital in the spring.

585
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:04,880
I'll go back to the capital in the spring.

586
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:05,880
Why is she here?

587
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,880
She said she has some important work to do.

588
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:08,880
But she's worried about me.

589
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,880
I've sent her away.

590
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,880
I'm glad she's awake.

591
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,880
Xu Qian looks like a forbidden spy.

592
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:19,880
Don't you think

593
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,880
you're too much of a person?

594
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:24,880
How long have you been using

595
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:25,880
the same name as Wei Gong?

596
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:26,880
Three years.

597
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,880
I'm better than you

598
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,880
for four months in the year 2001.

599
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,880
Xu Qian is so full of himself.

600
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,880
It's only three months to beat someone.

601
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,880
She's very fond of Wei Gong.

602
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:38,880
She doesn't like it.

603
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,880
She's even more fond of Wei Gong than Yuzhuan?

604
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:41,880
No.

605
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:43,880
There must be another reason.

606
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,880
Where's Xu Qian's group?

607
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,880
Why do you still want to be a spy?

608
00:27:58,880 --> 00:27:59,880
Tell me.

609
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:01,880
Tell me.

610
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,880
Xu Qian's group is far away from Wei Gong.

611
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,880
It's not a place.

612
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,880
It's not a place?

613
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:10,880
It really isn't.

614
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:14,880
Guys, are you tired?

615
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:15,880
Good job.

616
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:16,880
You're so stubborn.

617
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,880
Guys,

618
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:18,880
my brother is here.

619
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,880
He can let me go.

620
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:20,880
Really.

621
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:22,880
I'm fine.

622
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:23,880
I'm fine.

623
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:24,880
I'm tired.

624
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:25,880
Brother, go back.

625
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:26,880
Go back.

626
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:27,880
Go back.

627
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:28,880
It's okay.

628
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:29,880
Xu Qian,

629
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,880
your group is from the capital, right?

630
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:33,880
Is it?

631
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:36,880
It should be.

632
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,880
Have you been to the Cultural Places?

633
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:45,880
Not yet.

634
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:46,880
Have you seen the Princess of the Palace?

635
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,880
I've seen it.

636
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,880
I've seen the Princess of the Palace,

637
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:55,880
but I didn't go to the Cultural Places.

638
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,880
Why did you come out?

639
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,880
I don't know why I came out.

640
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:02,880
I just saw the Princess of the Palace.

641
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,880
I just said two words.

642
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,880
You saw it?

643
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:07,880
You took me out.

644
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,880
Let me tell you what it is.

645
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,880
It's the heaven's good round.

646
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:18,880
Don't think you're a gold-cutter.

647
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:20,880
Who dares to like you?

648
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,880
What are you doing?

649
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:24,880
Ning Yan.

650
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:28,880
Grandpa.

651
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:30,880
Ning Yan,

652
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,880
the Princess of the Palace is rich.

653
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,880
Lead the way.

654
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:53,880
Get himederach then.

655
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,880
Let me help you.

656
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,880
Pull the string.

657
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:00,880
Grandma acht핸.

658
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,880
You often catch your piano and play your piano,

659
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:05,880
but when you play,

660
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,680
it can't be got out of the gut.

661
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:09,880
headaches.

662
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,440
Xu Qian gave me ten of them.

663
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,920
You should also take one last sip of water.

664
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,560
What should we do?

665
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:17,760
Brother,

666
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,880
I think he's a good man.

667
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,080
I'm satisfied.

668
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,280
Only Huaiqing hasn't been punished.

669
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,640
He's the best.

670
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,480
Hurry and buy it for the princess.

671
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,040
Right.

672
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,440
We'll be in a hurry.

673
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,360
Right, Brother?

674
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,920
Come on, drink it.

675
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:33,960
Right.

676
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:34,520
Drink it.

677
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:35,360
Drink it.

678
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:39,000
I don't know what's in the water.

679
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,280
I can see the clear moon and the starry river.

680
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:43,480
Why are you...

681
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,080
I don't know what's in the water.

682
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,520
I can see the clear moon and the starry river.

683
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,040
Good poem.

684
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:56,920
It's indeed a good poem.

685
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,760
It's very good and full of energy.

686
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,400
I think you're right.

687
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,280
I'm Xu Qian.

688
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:06,080
I'm also the guest of Princess Huaiqing.

689
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:06,800
Xu Qian?

690
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:07,960
Why do you listen to me?

691
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,600
Aren't you the face of Lin'an?

692
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,360
Me?

693
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:15,280
This dance is for you.

694
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,320
I'm confused.

695
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:19,520
My lord,

696
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:22,480
which princess are you?

697
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,560
Sir.

698
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,400
How can I know?

699
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:28,320
Life is hard to get.

700
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,800
It's hard to hide.

701
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,840
I'm so hard to get.

702
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:35,640
I can get two princesses at the same time.

703
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,040
But I'm so worried.

704
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,040
I don't deserve it.

705
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,200
My lord,

706
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:42,760
I'm not a second-class princess.

707
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,520
I'm a small person.

708
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,400
But I have my own persistence.

709
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,080
Princess Huaiqing,

710
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,920
if you're not the one I have the wings for,

711
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:54,280
I don't know where I am.

712
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,040
I'm the only one who can do anything.

713
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,040
But I'm not qualified to be our master.

714
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,860
I'm not an중

715
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:12,600
and you're من the family not the one I'm talking about.

716
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:13,960
Your Highness.

717
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,600
You're a prestigious princess,

718
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:20,120
she could represent her return to me.

719
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,760
You don't even know the emotional Storm-Ying?

720
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:28,440
I was fragrance for you in the def秦 region.

721
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,520
I...

722
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,160
I...

723
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:31,880
I...

724
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,280
But am still Compassionless.

725
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,760
Xu Qian is here in thisDRónica Basics.

726
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,760
Her superb power and pure disability

727
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,200
is about止胸,

728
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,240
so I should work hard

729
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,360
to protect Princess Huaiqing.

730
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,640
Sorry about that!

731
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,120
Enough, Enough.

732
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:56,480
Who is this Princess Huaiqing?

733
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,200
Yin An,

734
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,000
Princess Ning An,

735
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,840
you are making a big mistake.

736
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:22,680
Princess, Princess.

737
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,560
Yueyue, Yueyue.

738
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:24,480
Call the doctor.

739
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,600
Call the doctor.

740
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:26,760
Call the doctor.

741
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:27,520
Hurry up.

742
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:28,320
Let's go.

743
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,040
Don't change your clothes.

744
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:31,760
Go to the Four Heavens to change.

745
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,120
Lin An's Yunjue Town

746
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,240
used to be in the Four Heavens.

747
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,440
They have a political role.

748
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,080
Right.

749
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:38,640
Right.

750
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:39,440
Four Heavens.

751
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,280
Four Heavens.

752
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,480
It's okay.

753
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,320
Let's go to the Four Heavens.

754
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,320
It makes sense.

755
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:47,680
Wait.

756
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,040
The Four Heavens.

757
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,760
The Four Heavens.

758
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:51,440
Lu Fang.

759
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:52,880
This one will be fine in a while.

760
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,320
Then let's go.

761
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:55,720
Let's go.

762
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:56,360
Let's go.

763
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:57,040
Let's go together.

764
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:57,760
Let's go.

765
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,640
Let's go.

766
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,000
Why are they so happy?

767
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,440
They are giving him a hand.

768
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:24,400
I just knew that.

769
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:28,440
That's the big deal.

770
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,240
They have offended me.

771
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:31,560
Please forgive me.

772
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,120
It's cold and cold today.

773
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,400
Walk with me.

774
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:44,560
Yes.

775
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:53,440
Why did you leave?

776
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,080
I don't know.

777
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:54,640
Where are you going?

778
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:55,400
I don't know.

779
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:57,120
I know.

780
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:05,800
The Four Heavens.

781
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:20,000
I worked in Blondieまず on Clanthose Feels.

782
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:23,920
Earlier,

783
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:29,000
It doesn't matter.

784
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:46,120
The gold flip.

785
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,140
Change your jue gentle,

786
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:49,520
turn theatching game.

787
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,420
It's not a bad thing.

788
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:51,120
It isn't.

789
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,920
I have someф related litGIولof me,

790
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:59,760
OMG to cure medical competition.

791
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,920
it's easy to do.

792
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:11,200
Thank you for things I graidiy

793
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:16,720
to your

794
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:21,040
assistance.

795
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:25,040
I will have a more Fengpu general.

796
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:29,040
I don't need to be sad

797
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,040
about those evil spirits.

798
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,040
Your Majesty,

799
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:44,040
I am not still

800
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:47,040
filial to you.

801
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,040
Wrong.

802
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,040
Your Majesty.

803
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,040
Your Majesty.

804
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:58,040
You didn't see it?

805
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,040
There is a ambush here.

806
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,040
I am sorry.

807
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,040
I was too hasty.

808
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,040
If you don't know,

809
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:12,040
you will be punished.

810
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,040
How is the investigation going?

811
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:23,040
The branch of the Ministry of Revenue and Justice

812
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,040
was messed up.

813
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,040
I remember

814
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,040
the chief officer of the Dagenen House

815
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,040
was a criminal.

816
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,040
A happy fellow.

817
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,040
That's right.

818
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:36,040
His name is Xu Qian.

819
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:38,040
He was a bit of a rascal.

820
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:41,040
He found out

821
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,040
about the case of Xiao Qi Guan and Zhou Chi Xiong.

822
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,040
He also pointed out

823
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,040
where I wanted him to be.

824
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:50,040
I heard about it.

825
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,040
This person is a clear-cut person.

826
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:56,040
He is a criminal.

827
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,040
Did you find anything?

828
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:02,040
I did say

829
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,040
that the Zhao County Magistrate of Taikang

830
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,040
found out

831
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,040
that he died in the dungeon of Fuya.

832
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:12,040
I have already known

833
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:14,040
the cause of his death.

834
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:16,040
The cause of his death is

835
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:18,040
natural.

836
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:20,040
There is no external injury.

837
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:22,040
There is no poison.

838
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:24,040
There is no treatment or other drugs.

839
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:26,040
If

840
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:28,040
the three-leaf clover

841
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,040
is what

842
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:32,040
the Beijing Wushi is.

843
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,040
Tell me.

844
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:50,040
How is the progress?

845
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,040
Your Highness.

846
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,040
Zhou Chi Xiong has hidden the forgotten tree

847
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,040
and escaped the capital.

848
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:58,040
He must have borrowed the Mongolian magic.

849
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:00,040
I want to use it as a breakthrough

850
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:02,040
to find out the trace of the magic.

851
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:04,040
I have already known these.

852
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,040
What else?

853
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:08,040
You won't only find out these, right?

854
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:12,040
I don't know what you want to know.

855
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:15,040
I have read your plan.

856
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,040
You found the seal of the Four Seasons Sword

857
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,040
in the Three Seasons Lake.

858
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,040
The seal of the Four Seasons Lake

859
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,040
has a natural temperature on the stone pillar.

860
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,040
Do you have any further investigation?

861
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,040
Your Highness.

862
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:28,040
Wei Gong specially ordered me

863
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:30,040
not to investigate the fox's body of the Three Seasons Lake.

864
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,040
I dare not disobey.

865
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,040
And

866
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,040
why the Kuizu

867
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,040
is going back to Yongzheng Mountain?

868
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,040
This is a point.

869
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,040
It is also another breakthrough in the case of the case.

870
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:40,040
The strong or the weak

871
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:43,040
are indeed the seal of the Yongzheng Mountain.

872
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:46,040
And this secret is only known by the Royal Descendant.

873
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:48,040
Wei Gong doesn't allow you to investigate.

874
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,040
He is protecting you.

875
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:52,040
He even knows this?

876
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,040
Keep talking.

877
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,040
Your reasoning.

878
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,040
The Four Seasons Lake

879
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:02,040
is just a five-star hotel.

880
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,040
But it can complete

881
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,040
such a secret plan today

882
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:06,040
and can borrow the magic to escape.

883
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:07,040
I have always suspected that

884
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,040
there must be someone behind it

885
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,040
who is loyal to the court

886
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,040
and secretly protects it.

887
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,040
And this person

888
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,040
is likely to disappear from the Great Wall.

889
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,040
The previous sleeping shadow

890
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,040
is related to the dead body.

891
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,040
There may be a huge hindrance behind it.

892
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,040
And their purpose is...

893
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,040
What you mean is...

894
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,040
I dare not to say it.

895
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,040
But this is the Kuizu

896
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:27,040
who still wants to release the seal of the Lake.

897
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,040
It is definitely not a simple

898
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,040
and simple method.

899
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:35,040
The body is in the court and has the power to seize it.

900
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,040
There is a chance

901
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:39,040
to borrow the secret from the Kuizu.

902
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,540
Let's destroy the Blue date

903
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,640
announcing it for the next three months.

904
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:46,040
Like this.

905
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:49,040
Spring Festival is about to start.

906
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,040
Don't you have theBB?

907
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,040
About the time of腮 ο

908
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:57,040
O- premiers

909
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:02,020
ys

910
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,040
Who can move their leg?

911
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:07,040
The wind saving strongeringen

912
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,540
Mother, doing well

913
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,040
is killing the first performance.
