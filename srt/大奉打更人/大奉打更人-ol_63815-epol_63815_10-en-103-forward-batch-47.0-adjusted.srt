Fame and wealth mean nothing to me.

42
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,720
I've made it clear.

43
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:40,600
I'll only serve Grand Princess Huaiqing.

44
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,520
Heaven and earth can be my witnesses.

45
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:46,830
You underestimated me.

46
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,360
You sound firm.

47
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,830
Firm as a rock.

48
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:52,670
Very well.

49
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,390
Grand Prin...

50
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:05,870
He's Huaiqing's lackey.

51
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:08,830
What now, Princess?

52
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:10,080
We've tried the carrot.

53
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,990
Use the stick now.

54
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:13,710
Guards!

55
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,080
Drag him out.

56
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,710
Princess Huaiqing...

57
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:17,590
Kill him!

58
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:22,340
(Lake Villa)

59
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:27,040
Orchids...

60
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,360
Beautiful.

61
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,320
Elegant.

62
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,080
Writing poems is so hard!

63
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,710
I wouldn't recruit talents

64
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:56,710
if I had help.

65
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:00,510
Princess.

66
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,480
How did it go?

67
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,430
Did Yang Ling yield?

68
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:05,800
He'd rather die.

69
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:08,150
You threatened him,

70
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:09,590
- didn't you?
- I did.

71
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:11,960
I threatened to use Guardians' 18 Skills

72
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,240
all on him the whole night,

73
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,520
but he was

74
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,830
as stubborn as a mule.

75
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,110
If all else failed,

76
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,320
whip him.

77
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:21,230
We did.

78
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,830
We whipped him hard over and over!

79
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:25,200
Was he not scared?

80
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,110
He was. He was terrified!

81
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:27,950
He even

82
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,390
passed out twice.

83
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:33,870
But when he woke up,

84
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:35,430
he wouldn't yield.

85
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:37,520
He kept saying the same thing.

86
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:39,270
What was it?

87
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,270
He'd serve Huaiqing

88
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,920
to the end.

89
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,550
Scratch me

90
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:00,320
with the whip. It's fine.

91
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:03,320
I've reached the Qi Stage.

92
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:06,910
The Guardians own

93
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:09,560
much worse tools of torture.

94
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:13,270
This is one of them.

95
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,520
Untie him.

96
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:38,760
What else can you do?

97
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:40,710
Bring it on!

98
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:41,590
Don't move!

99
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:43,550
Hey...

100
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,230
This is your last chance.

101
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:48,080
Who will you serve?

102
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,200
I'll serve Huaiqing

103
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:54,520
to the end!

104
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,880
You've left me no choice.

105
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:57,920
Take him away!

106
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,200
Where to?

107
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:02,120
I'll serve Huaiqing

108
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:04,150
to the end!

109
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:05,060
(Lake Villa)

110
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,200
What now?

111
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,080
You let me go?

112
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:11,320
Master said

113
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,470
if you refuse to join us,

114
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:13,680
we won't force you.

115
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,880
Wait, I meant...

116
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,880
Goodbye.

117
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,720
What?

118
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,180
(Lake Villa)

119
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,320
You've given up so easily?

120
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:26,820
Princess.

121
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,980
(Lucid Waters and Lush Mountains)

122
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:29,820
You let him go?

123
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:30,920
Yes.

124
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:32,960
Good.

125
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,270
He'd better not report us.

126
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:37,520
It'd be terrible if Mother found out.

127
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:39,230
Princess.

128
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:40,750
Princess.

129
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:41,630
What's up?

130
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,520
Yang Ling,

131
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:45,560
- he...
- He reported us?

132
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,280
No, he didn't.

133
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,850
He sticks around outside,

134
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:50,170
saying we tortured him all night,

135
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:51,290
but he didn't get to see you.

136
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:52,910
He demands a face-to-face talk

137
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:53,880
and an explanation.

138
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:57,000
(Come on!)

139
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:58,520
(If I left,)

140
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,120
(I'd be a big fool!)

141
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:10,640
12 whips!

142
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,590
One night's torture!

143
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:15,350
I, Yang Ling, demand an explanation!

144
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:18,000
(Lake Villa)
Let your master come out!

145
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,230
I can't go.

146
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,200
Drive him away.

147
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,040
Yes.

148
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:38,960
Is he gone?

149
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,440
He's still outside.

150
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,000
He's pigheaded

151
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,320
and persistent.

152
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,350
He's ready to sleep there.

153
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:48,910
He said

154
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,560
he'd keep waiting

155
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,760
as long as he could breathe.

156
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,270
Wow!

157
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:02,030
I've never seen anyone as unyielding

158
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,710
as him before.

159
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:07,710
He's different from the losers in my palace.

160
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,280
What a shame.

161
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,350
He isn't on my side.

162
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:13,470
Princess,

163
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,200
what should we do?

164
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,330
With him outside,

165
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:17,710
are we going back to the Palace?

166
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:18,760
We are.

167
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:22,750
Alright.

168
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:24,960
I don't want him to make a scene.

169
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,880
Let's see

170
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,320
what he's up to.

171
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:40,900
(Lake Villa)

172
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,760
This is unnecessary, sir.

173
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,200
You tortured me all night.

174
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:52,680
Don't I at least deserve an explanation?

175
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,000
I apologize for that.

176
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,790
I meant to win you over.

177
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:57,830
You refused

178
00:08:57,830 --> 00:08:59,440
for your integrity

179
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,390
and loyalty.

180
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,200
In that case,

181
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:03,760
may you have

182
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,230
a promising future.

183
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,160
Rise.

184
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:09,630
Hold it.

185
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,470
Do you always apologize

186
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:15,150
to others without showing your face?

187
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:20,830
I understand you're mad.

188
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,800
I'm sorry

189
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:01,350
for my rudeness.

190
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:14,440
Sorry.

191
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,560
I crossed the line.

192
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,470
Greeting, Grand Princess.

193
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:25,230
Grand Princess?

194
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,160
It's my honor to have finally met you.

195
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,830
I was so blind that I almost

196
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:34,470
missed a wise master like you.

197
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:37,710
Let me introduce myself.

198
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,400
I'm Xu Qi'an.

199
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:40,920
Yang Ling is my pen name.

200
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:42,340
Xu Qi'an?

201
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,660
Was it really Grand Princess's maid?

202
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:49,260
Of course.

203
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:52,420
Her visit to our house

204
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:55,620
showed a gesture of good faith.

205
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,140
Cijiu,

206
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,780
you'll become

207
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:02,060
as successful as Ningyan.

208
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:03,140
Don't be upset.

209
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:08,020
Ningyan.

210
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:08,980
Did it go well?

211
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:15,300
I made it.

212
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:18,500
I acted like

213
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:20,860
I didn't know she was Grand Princess

214
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:23,220
and that her bribery and coercion

215
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,700
made me

216
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:27,460
pledge allegiance to her.

217
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:28,820
That was how I passed her test

218
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,380
and gained her trust.

219
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,300
Did she

220
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,380
not know you?

221
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,340
She did, of course.

222
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:41,780
I was like a pawn
she casually placed on the board.

223
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:43,340
But I will show her

224
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:44,460
that a pawn

225
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:46,420
can decide the game.

226
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:49,380
Great wits have short memories.

227
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:50,580
It was you

228
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:52,620
who recommended me to the Guardians.

229
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,340
The Guardians?

230
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:57,100
(Xu Qi'an's Result, A+)
She's indeed sharp.

231
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:59,860
She chose a rare talent.

232
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:01,940
You're the one Huaiqing,

233
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:06,660
the one I

234
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,140
recommended to the Guardians, Xu Qi'an?

235
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:11,500
Yes, that's me.

236
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:12,860
Xu

237
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:14,180
Qi.

238
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:15,300
An.

239
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:16,460
And?

240
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:18,140
And it went smoothly.

241
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:19,980
She lauded my poems to the skies

242
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:21,180
and recruited me

243
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:22,580
to write more for her.

244
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:24,140
She invited me

245
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:26,380
to her place to talk tomorrow.

246
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:28,780
You may rise.

247
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:32,100
(Lake Villa)

248
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,060
I read your previous works.

249
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:35,380
They were excellent.

250
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,550
That's why I introduced you to Lord Wei.

251
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:40,500
What happened earlier is a test.

252
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:42,380
You proved yourself

253
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:44,420
worthy of trust.

254
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,460
I'm pleased.

255
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,540
Did you say

256
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:50,540
you want to thank me?

257
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:52,740
That'd be my pleasure.

258
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:55,260
I'll serve you for as long as I can.

259
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:58,100
Good. I'll ask you again.

260
00:12:58,540 --> 00:12:59,900
Will you be my aide

261
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:00,820
in writing poems

262
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:03,020
and joining the Poetry Contest with me?

263
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,820
I'll serve Huaiqing

264
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:12,400
to the end!

265
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:19,980
Grand Princess is known for her talent.

266
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:21,300
She has a great name.

267
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:23,140
Why need ghostwriters?

268
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:26,300
That's her public persona.

269
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:27,860
Persona?

270
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,540
Humans are complicated.

271
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:31,820
The one you see

272
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:33,900
is the one she plays in public.

273
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:36,100
When you become an official,

274
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,340
keep that in mind.

275
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:38,500
It'll be of great help.

276
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:40,460
I need a persona, too.

277
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:42,020
You know,

278
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,420
she offered a fortune

279
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:44,620
to recruit me

280
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:46,380
for my poetic prowess.

281
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:48,700
But this can be a chance for us.

282
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:51,260
Where's the money?

283
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:53,420
I turned it down.

284
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:55,580
Compared with her favoritism,

285
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:56,820
money is nothing,

286
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,020
however much it is.

287
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:00,060
Don't lose the greater for the less.

288
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,180
Right.

289
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:03,740
If you can please her,

290
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:06,820
your chief won't bully you again,

291
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:08,780
and our family will be backed,

292
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:09,620
right?

293
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:12,580
Ningyan,

294
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:15,340
don't forget me when you rise to the top.

295
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:17,820
I won't, Uncle.

296
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:19,540
Her success

297
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:20,580
is my success.

298
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:21,580
My success

299
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:23,820
is the Xu Clan's success.

300
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:26,620
Let's drink.

301
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:34,380
Refill his cup.

302
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,280
Cijiu,

303
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,460
I need your help tonight

304
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:37,820
for the future of our family.

305
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:38,740
What is it?

306
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:39,980
Grind some ink.

307
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:41,420
Sure.

308
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:43,100
We had a close call earlier.

309
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:44,940
Luckily, you acted cleverly

310
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:47,900
by playing Grand Princess,

311
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,380
making him dead set on serving

312
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:50,820
and following you.

313
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:52,580
Who knows

314
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,220
Yang Ling is Xu Qi'an?

315
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:57,260
But impersonating Huaiqing

316
00:14:58,580 --> 00:14:59,740
is risky.

317
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:02,660
They say success comes from risks.

318
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:03,820
You don't

319
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,100
need to worry too much.

320
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:07,700
As long as he doesn't see Grand Princess,

321
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,540
we'll be safe.

322
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:10,980
Easier said than done.

323
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,020
She introduced him to the Guardians.

324
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:15,780
Keeping them apart is

325
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:17,620
hard.

326
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,580
You're right.

327
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:21,500
The Contest is near.

328
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,620
Without him,

329
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:24,780
I stand no chance of defeating

330
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:26,180
Huaiqing.

331
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:27,740
So

332
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,100
are you saying...?

333
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:32,940
Stall

334
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:34,420
until we get his poems.

335
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:37,140
Once he

336
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,140
brings them to me tomorrow,

337
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,580
we'll find a way

338
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,380
to get rid of him.

339
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:49,100
Who knows

340
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,460
Xu Ningyan is that poet, Yang Ling?

341
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:52,900
Does that mean

342
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:55,180
we can see Miss Fuxiang

343
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:57,380
at the Imperial Office of Music?

344
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:58,820
And for free.

345
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:06,740
He's here.

346
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:07,860
Yang Ling!

347
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:08,740
Shhh!

348
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:09,580
Keep it down.

349
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:13,740
You're late.

350
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:15,940
I stayed up late last night

351
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:17,140
for family business.

352
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:19,500
Good. Chief isn't here.

353
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:20,580
He was here.

354
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:22,620
He came early and went to look for you.

355
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:24,780
What did he need me for?

356
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:25,660
Not sure.

357
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:27,340
When you missed the roll call,

358
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:28,620
his face darkened.

359
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,020
What will happen

360
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:34,220
if one misses it?

361
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:35,780
If he's lenient, he'll

362
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:36,700
criticize you

363
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:37,580
and demand a fine.

364
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,380
And if he's not?

365
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:40,540
He'll torture you

366
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:41,620
and grill you.

367
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:47,820
Chief!

368
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:54,180
Chief.

369
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,060
Where are you on the files?

370
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,060
All is well.

371
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:02,780
I'm screening them carefully.

372
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:05,340
Why don't you go back
to the Breeze Hall for tea?

373
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:07,180
I'll report the case to you later.

374
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:08,980
I heard

375
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:11,260
you were mad about this assignment,

376
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:13,420
thinking I treated you unfairly.

377
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:14,260
No.

378
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:15,830
Not at all.

379
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:17,340
Which rascal

380
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:18,940
spread such rumors?

381
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:22,060
Could be Zhao Jia of the Hall of Might.

382
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:24,300
If you don't want to do it,

383
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:26,540
just drop the act.

384
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:28,540
Go to the streets.

385
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:32,660
What?

386
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,020
Are you punishing me?

387
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:35,860
Chief, I'll read the files now.

388
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:37,300
I really enjoy reading them.

389
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,220
- Let's go.
- Come on.

390
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,140
Come on!

391
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:40,530
Wait. Hold on...

392
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:43,500
Chief, I love reading files in the Archive!

393
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,660
I don't like going to the streets!

394
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:46,620
Chief!

395
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:47,980
- You...
- Let's go.

396
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:49,100
Why go to the streets?

397
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,980
What are you going to do to me?

398
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:52,500
Will I be tied up?

399
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:55,620
Why drag me out all of a sudden?

400
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:56,980
8 Circles!

401
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:57,820
(8 Circles)
I won!

402
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:00,180
You got away.

403
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:02,020
Pay up.

404
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:03,420
You'll lose the next round.

405
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:04,820
Come on. Another round.

406
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:05,750
Catch him.

407
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,240
My tile.

408
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:10,860
Is this called "going to the streets"?

409
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,540
To go to the streets is

410
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:14,260
to go to play and patrol the streets.

411
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:17,060
The weather is dry.

412
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:18,780
Watch out for fire.

413
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:20,060
Patrols are done. Let's play.

414
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:21,860
Just now, you two dragged me out.

415
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:23,860
I thought you'd strip and parade me

416
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:25,300
through the streets as a criminal.

417
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:27,140
Turns out, we can have fun.

418
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,460
Going out is way better

419
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:29,980
than staying at the Breeze Hall.

420
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:31,100
We're on duty here.

421
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:31,940
Yes.

422
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:33,780
- Stack the tiles.
- Hurry!

423
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,380
I'm done. I quit.

424
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:37,620
I lost all my money.

425
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:38,580
Play again

426
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:39,500
another day.

427
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:40,820
- Play with us.
- Next time.

428
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,340
You can't quit.

429
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:44,060
Short of one player.

430
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:46,020
- Let's play.
- No, thanks.

431
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:48,980
Hey, come on.

432
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:49,820
Join us!

433
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:53,540
Wen Yang.

434
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:54,460
Wen Yang!

435
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:55,540
Join us!

436
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:56,420
Can't.

437
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:57,260
I'm busy.

438
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:58,700
Yuan?

439
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:00,820
My wife keeps the money.

440
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:01,980
Can't play with you.

441
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:03,780
So hen-pecked!

442
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:05,060
Goodness.

443
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:06,820
What to do?

444
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:09,540
Ju.

445
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:10,620
Ju!

446
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:12,860
Hey, come and play with us.

447
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:13,980
No, thanks.

448
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:15,140
I haven't made a penny yet.

449
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:16,980
Just use your fingers.

450
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:18,660
Quit it, you dirty dog!

451
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,220
Lan!

452
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:23,700
(Sweet and Tasty)
Yes?

453
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:25,620
Play with us.

454
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:27,060
Sure, I'm coming.

455
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:28,660
Lan is the best!

456
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:31,740
Hey,

457
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,380
Chief is tough.

458
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,500
If someone provokes him,

459
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,940
he won't let him go.

460
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:37,820
He yelled at you yesterday.

461
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:39,500
Why is he so nice to you now?

462
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,220
We're friends. Be honest with us.

463
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:45,740
Did you pull some strings?

464
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,140
The Bureau?

465
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:52,900
Yunlu Academy!

466
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,380
Or...

467
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:58,900
It is me.

468
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:02,900
You're on my side.

469
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,380
I'll protect you.

470
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:08,300
I've asked the Guardians.

471
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:09,300
You're

472
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:12,180
on bad terms with the Silver Gong.

473
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:14,020
I told Wei Yuan

474
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:15,540
to look after you.

475
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:19,380
What's wrong?

476
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:20,860
Are you troubled?

477
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:22,220
No, Your Highness.

478
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:24,580
You spared time for me

479
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:27,100
from your tight schedule.

480
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:30,700
I can't thank you enough

481
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:31,660
or pay you back.

482
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:35,020
You can.

483
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:36,740
Yes, you can.

484
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:47,300
The poem.

485
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,060
Where is it?

486
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:54,060
Here you are.

487
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,500
"Fine wine in golden cups, 10,000 a pot.

488
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:00,660
Delicacies in jade plates,

489
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,340
the same a dish.

490
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:11,820
I couldn't go on eating or drinking.

491
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:13,780
Drawing the sword, looking around,

492
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:16,060
I felt lost."

493
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:19,950
Terrific!

494
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:24,060
"Ice blocked my way through the Yellow River.

495
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:28,940
Snow filled the paths
up the Taihang Mountains.

496
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:36,700
Going fishing in a boat in greenish water,

497
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:37,620
suddenly..."

498
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:42,060
What's next?

499
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,140
Say it!

500
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:46,900
It's hard.

501
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:49,580
I racked my brain all night

502
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:50,940
last night.

503
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,500
I'm still working on it.

504
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,900
Do you like that half?

505
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:56,660
I love it.

506
00:21:57,210 --> 00:21:58,180
When can you

507
00:21:58,180 --> 00:21:59,380
finish the rest?

508
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,180
In a few days

509
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:05,100
or a few months, perhaps.

510
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:06,580
Poems

511
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:08,140
rely on inspiration.

512
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:10,060
It's as fickle as sudden gusts

513
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:11,700
of rain,

514
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:13,220
so it's hard to say.

515
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,660
Are you saying

516
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:16,940
I'll have to pray to the heavens

517
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:18,900
for you to finish the poem?

518
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:19,740
No.

519
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:26,460
If I can stay by your side,

520
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:27,780
maybe I'll be

521
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:29,180
enlightened

522
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:30,580
like the sky's brightened.

523
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:42,420
That makes sense.

524
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:43,980
Gang,

525
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:46,100
give her an entry badge.

526
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:49,140
You may come here anytime

527
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:50,500
if you ever need my help.

528
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:52,060
We'll meet every three days,

529
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:53,380
rain or shine.

530
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:59,780
(Badge)

531
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:02,740
Yes.

532
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:07,940
Your plan is working.

533
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:09,340
Everything is under control.

534
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:12,380
When did you go to see Lord Wei?

535
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:13,900
Why didn't I know that?

536
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:16,380
He wouldn't have time for me.

537
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,820
That man is so intimidating.

538
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:21,500
Xu Qi'an said it himself.

539
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,040
He didn't get along well with his chief.

540
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:24,620
I played along

541
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:26,700
so that he'd be grateful

542
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:28,180
and write poems for me.

543
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:29,540
You're indeed wise.

544
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,500
Still, I think

545
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:34,740
he's hiding things from you

546
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:36,420
in order to

547
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,620
bargain with you.

548
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:38,900
I know.

549
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:40,500
He's

550
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:41,980
not stupid.

551
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,780
His poems are one of a kind.

552
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:46,980
That half alone

553
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:48,260
has proved his talent.

554
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:51,420
Looks like

555
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:53,060
we need to alter our plan.

556
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:54,460
To get

557
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:56,020
more poems in the future,

558
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:57,980
we have to be patient.

559
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,700
Do you mean...?

560
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:01,740
Pass my order.

561
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:04,740
No one under my roof

562
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:06,500
shall slack off again.

563
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:08,300
They shall be elegant

564
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:09,940
and more cultured.

565
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:12,220
From now on, this is Huaiqing's place.

566
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:13,460
I'm

567
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:16,540
the Grand Princess.

568
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:18,260
Yes.

569
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:21,220
What?

570
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:23,660
He left his post without permission!

571
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,840
How audacious!

572
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:30,420
Bring Xu Qi'an back by the end of the day.

573
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:32,500
He's guilty of misconduct.

574
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:35,550
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

575
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:40,860
Xu Qi'an!

576
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:43,100
Yes, sir.

577
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:44,500
Where were you?

578
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,820
I...

579
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:50,260
Look at you!

580
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,100
No uniform.

581
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:54,340
No Copper Gong Badge.

582
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:57,420
You're wild and undisciplined!

583
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:00,380
Take him to the Punishment Hall.

584
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:02,580
Be harsh on him!

585
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:16,580
Don't provoke him.

586
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:18,060
Bear with it. Go.

587
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:18,940
Hold on!

588
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:23,060
You're on my side.

589
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,060
I'll protect you.

590
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:28,620
I've asked the Guardians.

591
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:29,940
You're

592
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:32,820
on bad terms with the Silver Gong.

593
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:34,700
I told Wei Yuan

594
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:35,890

I was patrolling the streets.

633
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:14,660
You wronged me.

634
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:16,940
I didn't do anything against the law.

635
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:18,700
Leaving without permission

636
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:20,140
is against the law.

637
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:21,780
To patrol

638
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:24,660
is to walk around to check.

639
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:26,900
Taking the same old routes every day

640
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:29,220
only to finish

641
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:30,860
the task

642
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:32,860
isn't proper patrolling.

643
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:35,060
It's like walking the dog.

644
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:37,730
You...!

645
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,380
No uniform. No...

646
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:41,980
No uniform. No Copper Gong Badge.

647
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:42,980
Not buttoned up.

648
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:44,900
I ruined the Guardians' image.

649
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,900
I'm a laughing stock.

650
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:47,900
Is that all?

651
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:49,060
Come on.

652
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:50,620
Same old, same old.

653
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:52,260
Can't you say anything new?

654
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:54,780
You...

655
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:56,620
I... I'm warning you!

656
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:59,020
Stop imitating me!

657
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:00,380
You're

658
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:01,980
incorrigible!

659
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:04,660
Me?

660
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:06,780
What have I done wrong?

661
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,020
I meant to ask you before.

662
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,980
Wearing such scary costumes is one thing.

663
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:11,300
Which idiot came up with this idea

664
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:13,220
of banging the gong?

665
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:15,540
Take a few steps and bang!

666
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:17,100
Everyone can hear it.

667
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:19,100
Everyone knows the Guardians are here.

668
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,940
Won't that alert the bad guys?

669
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:22,260
I'm here!

670
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:23,860
Run away, thieves!

671
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:25,580
Is that some kind of silly movie?

672
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:27,220
They're bad, not dumb.

673
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:28,340
How can you catch them?

674
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:30,820
You are a real laughingstock!

675
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:38,660
What is a movie?

676
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:39,780
It's a new metaphor.

677
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:40,860
Enough

678
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:42,740
of your mockery.

679
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:48,500

Look, guys,

680
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:50,220
I'm not yapping.

681
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:52,100
It's only been a month,

682
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:54,940
but I've discovered tons of issues among us,

683
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:57,060
not just among the Copper Gongs.

684
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:01,020
Guangxiao.

685
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:01,980
Yes, sir!

686
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:11,380
Yes.

687
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:12,580
Fetch the white book

688
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:14,060
from the Archive.

689
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:17,060
Sure.

690
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:18,620
Run!

691
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:20,300
He...

692
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:26,460
This office

693
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:28,820
hasn't been so lively for a long time.

(I'll use it to knock you down.)

697
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:44,220
If you had discovered

698
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:46,180
those issues,

699
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:48,740
why didn't you tell me earlier?

700
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:52,620
What if someone abused his power

701
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:54,380
for revenge?

00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,580
(10 Ways to Improve the Guardians)

703
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:00,580
I'll discuss everything

704
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,500
in the book with the Silver Gongs.

705
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:06,340
If there are issues among us,

706
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:09,460
I'll deal with them.

707
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:15,260
Yuchun,

708
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:17,900
it's good to admit your faults.

709
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:18,980
Alright.

710
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:20,340
I'll go back to work.

711
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:21,460
Have some tea.

712
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:22,580
Don't be mad.

713
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:26,500
A white book?

714
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,860
Li Yuchun accused Xu Qi'an of misconduct,

715
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:31,660
causing them to fight.

716
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:34,660
Then Xu showed him a white book,

717
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:36,660
listing out all the issues
among the Guardians.

718
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,860
(10 Ways to Improve the Guardians)
Look.

719
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:41,100
As unruly and rebellious

720
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:43,620
as that boy seems,

721
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:46,460
he acts with integrity.

722
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:47,580
He knows

723
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:48,860
what to do.

724
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:51,620
"The uniform's color

725
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:53,900

726
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:56,940
of the gong."

727
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:57,980
Yes.

728
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:01,860
He lists the flaws in the current uniform

729
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:04,300
and in banging before making arrests.

730
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:06,300
If we could catch bad guys

731
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:08,340
in uniform while banging the gong,

732
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:09,980
they must be stupid.

733
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:12,300
He asked who came up with that idea.

734
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:16,660
I did.

735
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:23,620
You're wise, Father.

736
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:34,780
(Li Yuchun is a paper tiger.)

737
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:39,300
(Now that I'm backed by Grand Princess,)

738
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,340
(all the Guardians)

739
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:43,420

Today is my 31st day as a Guardian.

743
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:59,620
I'm still a Copper Gong,

744
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:01,580
but I'm freed from the files

745
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:02,940
because

746
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:06,900
I'm under Grand Princess's wing now.

747
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:09,540

00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:10,380
(A few days ago,)

749
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:12,460
(I met a talent,)

(Xu Qi'an.)

751
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:15,740
(He mistook me for Huaiqing,)

752
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,580
(agreeing to write poems for me.)

753
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:19,860
(I'll become her confidant by copying)

754
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:21,820
(poems from the great ones.)

(A promotion and raise)

756
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,320
(Xu Qi'an's Promotion)
(will come in no time.)

757
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:27,180
(As long as he doesn't know,)

758
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:28,820
(I'm sure)

762
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:50,580
Go.

763
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:51,780
(The first of May,)

764
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:53,180
(in our society,)

765
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:54,580
(is Labor Day.)

766
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:56,540
(We have three days off.)

767
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:58,420
(I asked Li Yuchun)

768
00:32:58,420 --> 00:32:59,980
(for a three-day leave.)

769
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:01,860
(He granted it instantly.)

770
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:03,260
See you, Wang.

771
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:04,180
Bye.

772
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:05,500
(I know that's all)

773
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:07,900
(thanks to Grand Princess.)

774
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:10,980
(Cijiu said)

775
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:12,940
(she's talented)

776
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:15,140
(and proficient in poetry.)

777
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:17,020
(When she sees a good poem,)

778
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:19,420
(she'll comment on it as if she knows.)

779
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:21,420
(I have to act like her)

780
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:22,940
(to not raise any suspicion.)

781
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:24,020
(So)

782
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:25,860
(I have to study as hard as I can.)

783
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:28,020
(I have to write as many poems as I can.)

784
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:31,100
(There's...)
(Quality is the key.)

785
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:33,300
(From now on, I have to make full use)

786
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:34,940
(of every second)

787
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:38,580
(to hold on to a rare talent like Xu Qi'an.)

788
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:40,140
(No shortcut to the mastery)

789
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:41,860
(of any art.)
(To hold on to)

790
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:43,540
(the powerful Grand Princess.)

791
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:47,700
(Today is my second day to be Huaiqing.)

792
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:48,980
Princess,

793
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:50,140
it's already noon!

794
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:51,780
You have to wake up!

795
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:54,380
Wait until the You hour.

796
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:56,860
(I'm drained.)

797
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:59,580
(If only I memorized more poems before.)

798
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:00,860
Come on.

799
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:02,380
Let's eat lamb skewers.

800
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:04,100
- (There are two days left.)
- Let's go.

801
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:06,180
(I could use a day off.)

802
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,260
(Work hard, play hard.)

803
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:11,900
(It's the sunset again.)

804
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:13,420
(There are)

805
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:15,500
(still two days left.)

806
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:17,020
(I could)

807
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:18,900
(use a day off.)

808
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:20,660
Gang!

809
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:23,090
Good!

810
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:24,560
Nice!

811
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:26,700
Give me that!

812
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:27,700
Over here.

813
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:32,860
(I did nothing yesterday.)

814
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:34,140
(Today,)

815
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:36,660
(I have to work hard.)

816
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:38,540
(I even woke up early.)

817
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:42,420
"To appreciate poetry..."

818
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:46,060
(I'm too sleepy.)

819
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:47,820
Come.

820
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:49,140
Carry her to her room.

821
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:53,340
(Yesterday, at the Imperial Office of Music,)

822
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:55,740
(I ran into Constable Wang and those going)

823
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:57,580
(to Mount Dahuang with me.)

824
00:34:57,620 --> 00:35:00,220
(We drank together all night.)

825
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:01,340
(That's why)

826
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:02,820
(I got stoned.)

827
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:04,420
(That's why)

828
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:05,940
(I just woke up.)

829
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:10,140
(The early bird is sleepy.)

830
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:12,100
(I literally passed out.)

831
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:15,300
(The herbs prescribed by Imperial Physicians)

832
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:16,660
(woke me up just now.)

833
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:21,220
(Good heavens!)

834
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:23,420
(What should I do?)

835
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:24,980
(We'll meet tomorrow,)

836
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:27,180
(but I haven't written a word.)

837
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:30,460
(What will Grand Princess comment on?)

838
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:33,060
(I haven't read any books.)

839
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:36,780
(How will I comment on Xu Qi'an's poems?)

840
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:38,980
(What to do?)

841
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:41,980
(Can we postpone it?)

842
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:46,900
(It's the fourth of May,)

843
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:49,660
(the day we scheduled to meet.)

844
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:50,540
(Well,)

845
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:52,380
(I have to go for it!)

846
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:54,460
Cijiu!

847
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:56,980
What does Princess Huaiqing usually say?

848
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:58,260
Write down every word.

849
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:00,220
- Yes.
- Yes.

850
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:01,660
Cijiu!

851
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:03,540
Tell your teachers

852
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:05,460
I need to use the poems for them.

853
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:07,260
Cijiu!

854
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:08,580
Cijiu!

855
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:11,540
My dear cousin!

856
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,020
(Knowledge from books)
(So many poems!)

857
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:26,460
(is shallow.)
(What should I say?)

858
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:29,260
(They only wrote down a few lines just now.)

859
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:33,460
Your poems

860
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:35,540
are brilliant.

861
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:38,780
(Clearly, she's impressed by my efficiency.)

862
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:41,740
(She spoke highly of my works.)

863
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:42,860
Xu Qi'an!

864
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:44,060
- Get back the poems!
- Relax.

865
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:46,060
Or I'll kill you with this hammer!

866
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:47,260
Let me go!

867
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:48,740
I'll kill you!

868
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:50,260
I'll kill you! I'll...!

869
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:52,460
I...!

870
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:57,820
Bring them back.

871
00:36:58,740 --> 00:36:59,640
Do it.

872
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:01,100
Come on. You stepped hard on me.

873
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:02,660
Bring them back, you hear me?

874
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:04,060
- Or I'll kill you!
- Sure.

875
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:04,900
Fine.

876
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:06,300
You stepped on me again!

877
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,780
(Counting the days,)

878
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:10,440
(only three are left again.)

879
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:12,540
(From now on,)

880
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,340
(I must work hard!)

881
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:16,380
(I am)

882
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:18,900
(the master of my life!)

883
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:22,660
Princess,

884
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:23,900
let's kick the shuttlecock.

885
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:27,620
Take a break.

886
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:28,580
Go for a drink?

887
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:37,500
No!

888
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:45,820
(There are three days left.)

889
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:47,380
(Yes!)

890
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:49,140
(There's enough time.)

891
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:51,220
(Why not...?)

892
00:37:54,350 --> 00:37:55,420
(Do it tomorrow?)

893
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:00,220
Wait for me!

894
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:01,980
Wait!

895
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:03,180
Let's go!

896
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:04,660
One, two, three,

897
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:06,220
Rock Paper Scissors!

898
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:07,860
Rock breaks scissors!

899
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:09,260
Scissors cut the paper!

900
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:10,710
Paper covers the rock!

901
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:12,340
(Qi'an, A+; Tingfeng, B+)
I lost!

902
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:19,860
Rock!

903
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:21,820
Hold on.

904
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:25,940
- Brothel?
- Yes!

905
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:27,620
We should've gone there earlier.

906
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:34,770
(Breeze Hall)

907
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:35,620
Silver Gong Li.

908
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:42,660
(Li Yuchun, Song Tingfeng, Zhu Guangxiao)

909
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:46,700
Chief.

910
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:48,980
I only gave him three days off.

911
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:51,340
It's been almost ten days. Where is he?

912
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:52,460
That rascal!

913
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:54,460
He...

914
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:57,980
He said he'd make our office better.

915
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:00,460
He's working on it at home.

916
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:01,420
It's been so long!

917
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:03,380
What's he working on?

918
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:04,540
Making pigs fly?

919
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:06,460
I'm ordering you

920
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:07,660
to go to his place now

921
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:08,620
and bring him here!

922
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,020
Yes, sir.

923
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:11,740
Mr. Li!

924
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:17,620
(Tao Man, Guardian, 7th Rank Fighter)

925
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:20,020
Congratulations, Mr. Li.

926
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:23,220
Thanks to your man,

927
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:24,460
Copper Gong Xu Qi'an,

928
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:26,500
we've improved our ways

929
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:29,020
of handling cases based on his white book.

930
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:30,500
You know what?

931
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:32,900
We're unstoppable!

932
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:34,140
Over the last ten days,

933
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:35,860
we've solved more cases than I can count.

934
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,340
Look.

935
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:40,460
(Speed)
The Guardians' Speed Flag.

936
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:42,500
It's in my hand.

937
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:45,260
Hey,

938
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:46,620
I did tell my chief

939
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:47,460
we did so well

940
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:49,580
partly because of you guys.

941
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:52,460
Take a look.

942
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:54,580
(Guardians' Solved Cases, Hall of Might)

943
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:58,500
(Solved the Well Case, Serial Murder,
Zhang's Bones)

944
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:04,420
That's so nice of you, Mr. Tao.

945
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:06,860
Mr. Li,

946
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:09,740
I heard Xu Qi'an

947
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:10,780
was unruly

948
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:12,180
and ill-willed to you.

949
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:14,340
How about this?

950
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:16,540
Transfer him to our hall.

951
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:18,220
I'll discipline him for you.

952
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:19,580
How's that?

953
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:21,620
No need.

954
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:25,460
All our members are of one heart.

955
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:27,580
There's no ill will among us.

956
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:30,940
(Breeze Hall)

957
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:35,420
But I heard he was

958
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:38,340
absent for days.

959
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:45,340
I told him to work from home.

960
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:46,620
Yes.

961
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:48,500
It's noisy in the office.

962
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:51,660
Some will do anything to gain merits.

963
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:53,340
He's still young

964
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:54,980
and inexperienced.

965
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:57,060
I don't want him

966
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:59,420
to be fooled by others

967
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:01,300
or hold back his work.

968
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:07,380
You're

969
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:09,540
so thoughtful.

970
00:41:11,790 --> 00:41:12,630
Go.

971
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:15,300
What are you looking at?

972
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:23,420
How dare he poach people from me!

973
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:26,060
Chief,

974
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:28,940
do I still need to bring Xu Qi'an over?

975
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:32,300
Go back to work.

976
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:33,580
Got it!

977
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:46,740
Cijiu!

978
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:49,220
"There's no royal road to learning;

979
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:51,020
no shortcut to the mastery of any art."

980
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:51,860
Write.

981
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:53,340
Used it.

982
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:55,020
On your right cheek.

983
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:56,300
This one?

984
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:07,060
"Studying can lead to success."

985
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:09,140
"And happiness will follow."

986
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:10,420
Used it, too.

987
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:25,140
It's been four hours.

988
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:26,540
You said three lines,

989
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:28,060
including two used ones.

990
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:31,940
When will you finish the poems
for my academy?

991
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:34,340
Both sides want them.

992
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:37,260
I'm too exhausted

993
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:38,740
to think.

994
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:40,420
I need a snack break.

995
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:42,860
At this rate,

996
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:45,180
when can I go back to the Academy

997
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:47,060
and see my teachers?

998
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:49,500
The yogurt tastes good.

999
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:50,340
Have a spoon.

1000
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:51,220
Pass.

1001
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:52,900
Cijiu,

1002
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:54,620
calm down. Don't be mad.

1003
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:56,380
I have an idea.

1004
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:01,580
Ningyan,

1005
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:05,500
bring me to meet Grand Princess.

1006
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:07,420
I can be her slave.

1007
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:09,620
If I can make her happy,

1008
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:11,420
she won't ask you for poems.

1009
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:13,660
Then you can focus on

1010
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:16,020
the ones Cijiu needs for the Academy.

1011
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:16,940
Right?

1012
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:19,260
Let's continue, Cijiu.

1013
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:20,260
Let me think.

1014
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:25,620
"Read books or you'll regret it someday."

1015
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:26,460
Write.

1016
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:27,940
Used it.

1017
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:34,260
Ningyan!

1018
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:36,780
Miss Pretty came to see you?

1019
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:38,540
What Miss Pretty?

1020
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:40,300
Leave me alone. I'm busy.

1021
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:42,420
She's here. Look!

1022
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:44,500
Caiwei?

1023
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:46,060
Do you need me?

1024
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:46,900
Not me,

1025
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:48,260
it's Senior Song.

1026
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:49,900
He said he made progress

1027
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:50,860
on your mirror.

1028
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:53,140
Really?

1029
00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:54,820
Let's go.

1030
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:56,940
Sure, let's go! Come on!

1031
00:43:56,940 --> 00:43:58,900
Hey, wait! What about the poems I need?

1032
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:00,940
- Come back!
- Did you ride or use footwork?

1033
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:10,180
What do you think, Mother?

1034
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:13,300
Perfect!

1035
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:15,180
This half shows

1036
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:16,780
high literary attainments.

1037
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:18,300
Lin'an,

1038
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:21,540
where did you get such beautiful lines?

1039
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:23,460
Well, Mother,

1040
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:25,300
I found an aide earlier,

1041
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:26,300
who's a great poet.

1042
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:28,820
I've got plenty of such masterpieces.

1043
00:44:29,730 --> 00:44:31,740
Compared with Huaiqing's men,

1044
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:33,340
he's way much better.

1045
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:37,100
This poem is great.

1046
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:38,340
Lin'an,

1047
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:40,660
you must wow everyone at the Poetry Contest

1048
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:42,180
to make your brother proud.

1049
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:43,580
Look at you.

1050
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:45,020
You've lost tons of weight.

1051
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:47,060
My kitchen

1052
00:44:47,070 --> 00:44:50,340
happened to make your favorite Milk Cakes.

1053
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:51,740
Have some.

1054
00:44:57,780 --> 00:44:58,620
It's good.

1055
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:00,940
Chuntao,

1056
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:02,260
fetch more later

1057
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:03,380
for Lin'an.

1058
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:04,380
Yes.

1059
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:06,700
Thanks, Mother.

1060
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:11,580
Mother hasn't given me gifts for a while.

1061
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:15,580
She doesn't know

1062
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:18,380
you no longer like desserts.

1063
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:23,140
Still, she cares about me.

1064
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:25,740
Or she wouldn't give me these cakes.

1065
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:31,060
I should thank Xu Qi'an.

1066
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:32,460
He deserves rewards.

1067
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:34,940
Where did he go today?

1068
00:45:36,220 --> 00:45:37,500
He stayed at home all day

1069
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:39,100
without going to work.

1070
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:42,580
According to his routine,

1071
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:44,860
he'd get liquor from the tavern at dusk.

1072
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:46,460
And Huaiqing?

1073
00:45:47,020 --> 00:45:48,580
What did she do today?

1074
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:50,140
Today?

1075
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:51,740
The 25th...

1076
00:45:52,180 --> 00:45:54,940
She'd go to the Astronomical Bureau to study.

1077
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:57,300
With Xu Qi'an here,

1078
00:45:57,300 --> 00:45:59,500
I don't need to go there again.

1079
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:01,340
Princess!

1080
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:04,340
- Princess!
- Here. I'm here.

1081
00:46:05,020 --> 00:46:07,260
Princess! Princess!

1082
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:08,140
What's up?

1083
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:09,580
Breathe before you speak.

1084
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:11,900
Xu Qi'an...

1085
00:46:12,140 --> 00:46:13,500
went to the Bureau!

1086
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:14,500
