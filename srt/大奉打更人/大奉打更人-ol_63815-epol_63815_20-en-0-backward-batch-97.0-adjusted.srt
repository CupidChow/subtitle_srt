Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:23,390
Dirty beast!

44
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,830
Do you not understand what I say?

00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:41,480
Stupid Loong!

46
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,080
Your Majesty,

47
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:48,520
be appeased.

48
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,960
Don't be mad at an animal.

49
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,480
When I asked why it lost control just now,

50
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:55,080
it ignored me!

51
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:56,640
The Loong

52
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:59,270
wouldn't go wild for no reason.

53
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:01,640
Why did it

54
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:05,990
quiet down all of a sudden?

55
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,150
Maybe it vented out its anger,

56
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:10,520
or it didn't

57
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:12,760
want Princess Lin'an to get hurt.

58
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:21,590
About

59
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,480
that Copper Gong Xu,

60
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:26,320
I'm curious.

61
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,990
Do you really favor him?

62
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,240
He's capable enough

63
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:34,110
to serve the court.

64
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,670
Pass my order.

65
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:48,270
Step up security in the Imperial City.

66
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:50,360
No one

67
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,670
gets in or out

68
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,760
before the curfew's lifted.

69
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:56,510
Yes.

70
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:05,150
Did you just say Duke Zhenbei

71
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:07,320
hadn't returned to the capital for years?

72
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:08,990
Yes.

73
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:20,640
Call him back

74
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,270
next spring.

75
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:27,500
(Haoqi Tower)

76
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,110
I still can't reach Heng Yuan.

77
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,870
Neither can Mr. Jinlian or No. 4.

78
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:39,680
He killed Earl Pingyuan
to find his junior

79
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:42,150
and disappeared after the Sangbo Explosion.

80
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,680
I believe

81
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,030
he was involved in that case, too.

82
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:52,270
I have a guess.

83
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:54,640
When his junior, Heng Hui,

84
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:56,910
eloped with Commandery Princess Pingyang,

85
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:00,390
it's highly likely that he used
an energy-concealing weapon

86
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:04,270
that came from the Azure Hall.

87
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,640
I'd like to go there to confirm it.

88
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:13,000
That hall is the Tianyu Sect's base
in the Dafeng.

89
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:14,390
It's too far away.

90
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,160
Rou.

91
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:24,190
Lord Wei.

92
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,790
Go to the Azure Hall

93
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:27,000
to check

94
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:30,230
if they have any energy-concealing weapons,

95
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:31,310
and

96
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:34,710
if Heng Hui and Heng Yuan went there.

97
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:36,070
Yes.

98
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:40,080
Thank you, Mr. Nangong.

99
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,600
Lord Wei,

100
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,230
I'll meet with Jinlian later

101
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:57,830
to locate Heng Yuan as soon as possible.

102
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,120
Who knows

103
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:05,590
Princesses Huaiqing and Lin'an

104
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:08,080
both favor you?

105
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,520
Princess Lin'an

106
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:12,440
even put on a show to recruit him.

107
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,480
Never would I

108
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,640
see that coming.

109
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,200
Knock it off, Uncle.

110
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,080
Do you think that's good?

111
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:20,440
I had an adventurous day,

112
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,520
full of twists and turns.

113
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,150
Hadn't I played by ear,

114
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:26,000
now, I might be in the Municipal Jail again.

115
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,320
Ningyan,

116
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,640
you're a catch.

117
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,320
There were two sisters marrying one husband.

118
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,710
Now, you're serving two sisters.

119
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,790
Who will you choose?

120
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,470
Princess Lin'an

121
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:40,790
is spoiled,

122
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,270
and she tricked me,

123
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:44,440
but she saved my life, too.

124
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,270
Does she want you to be her kept man?

125
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,470
If so, you'll rise high.

126
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,790
Do you think a kept man is an honor, Father?

127
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,830
She meant to help me.

128
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,760
I've known her for a while.

129
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:05,080
She might be simple

130
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:06,390
and willful,

131
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,600
but

132
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,880
she's pure,

133
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,120
kind,

134
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,390
loyal,

135
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,680
and protective, too.

136
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:14,440
She treats me well.

137
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:16,910
Do you like her?

138
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:20,960
Uncle,

139
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,120
being an Imperial Guard is
a waste of your talent.

140
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,590
Had you written novels
for that bookstore in the alley,

141
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:28,000
you would've long been successful.

142
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,030
Don't tease me.

143
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,470
You're old enough to marry.

144
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,830
I care about your happiness.

145
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:37,200
Our family is humble.

146
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,270
A princess is so out of his reach.

147
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,230
What about Princess Huaiqing?

148
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:45,710
She is

149
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,230
calm

150
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,790
and collected,

151
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,880
deep, and intelligent.

152
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:53,910
If I choose her,

153
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:57,590
few in the state will dare bully us again.

154
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:59,030
The future of the Xu Clan

155
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:00,830
will also be guaranteed.

156
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:04,790
Whoever you choose,

157
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,590
you're still two-faced, aren't you?

158
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:09,470
I prefer the word "capable"!

159
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:13,680
Ningyan,

160
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,960
serving those two together

161
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,200
must be exhausting.

162
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:20,120
I'm worried about you.

163
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,470
Why don't you

164
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:22,830
introduce me

165
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,830
to Princess Huaiqing?

166
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:26,680
I'll be her slave

167
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,470
for the future of our family!

168
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,590
Mother,

169
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,150
Father wants to be Princess Huaiqing's slave!

170
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:35,710
- Shut up!
- Mother!

171
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:36,710
Shut it.

172
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:46,630
There you are.

173
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,000
Here I am.

174
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,520
Have you recovered since we met days ago?

175
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,640
You must be No. 3.

176
00:06:58,230 --> 00:06:59,830
Nice to meet you.

177
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,320
I am No. 3...

178
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:03,870
No. 3's brother,

179
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:05,990
Guardian, Xu Qi'an.

180
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,630
You must be No. 4.

181
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,870
No. 4 of the Realm Sect, Chu Yuanzhen.

182
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,680
You're No. 3's brother?

183
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:12,950
Where's he?

184
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:14,320
He can't show his face?

185
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,350
As you probably know,

186
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:20,200
my brother studies at the Yunlu Academy.

187
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,870
The Spring Exam is approaching.

188
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,510
He's studying at school all day,

189
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:24,710
so he can't be here.

190
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:25,800
But don't worry.

191
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,830
He's told me to take care of this matter.

192
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,110
Right, Jinlian?

193
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,160
No. 4,

194
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,320
message No. 6 and see if he's there.

195
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:43,830
No. 6, are you there?

196
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:48,950
No.

197
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,520
Wait,

198
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,680
what was that?

199
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,520
Messaging.

200
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:58,870
That can only be done in the mirror, right?

201
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,110
How did you know?

202
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,080
My brother told me.

203
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,240
Hey,

204
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:08,040
when was that new function available?

205
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,830
Why didn't you tell my brother?

206
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,630
The Jade Mirror

207
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:14,710
allows private chat.

208
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,590
Back then, I was severely injured and weak,

209
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:21,280
so that function was temporarily deactivated.

210
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,350
It's been

211
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,800
reactivated only recently.

212
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:27,590
Reactivated.

213
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:28,950
Deactivated.

214
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:30,830
Private chat.

215
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:32,590
Yes.

216
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,040
Look.

217
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:37,750
No. 2, wake up to practice.

218
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,510
Or I'll kill you.

219
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:41,880
Not if

220
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:43,230
I kill you first.

221
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:45,200
Alright, alright.

222
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,830
Get back to business.

223
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:53,680
No. 4 and I have been locating Heng Yuan,

224
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,350
but as of now,

225
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,400
we only know

226
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:57,800
he's still in the city.

227
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,510
His exact location remains unknown.

228
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:04,320
Couldn't you locate him with the mirror?

229
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:06,200
Theoretically, yes,

230
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:08,350
but he,

231
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:11,040
or No. 6's Jade Mirror

232
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:11,880
seems to

233
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,590
be shielded.

234
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,630
It can be shielded, too?

235
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:19,830
No. 3's brother,

236
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:22,230
did you call us

237
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,590
because you found something?

238
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,320
Do you still remember

239
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,440
Heng Yuan said he killed Earl Pingyuan

240
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,080
to find his junior?

241
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:32,080
So what?

242
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:34,960
I came across the news

243
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,320
that his junior, Heng Hui,

244
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,230
carried an energy-concealing weapon

245
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,040
when eloping with Princess Pingyang.

246
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:43,510
Then that weapon to conceal energy

247
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:45,230
was very likely to be

248
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:46,560
used by Zhou Chixiong.

249
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,160
Really?

250
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:50,750
If so, was Heng Yuan's disappearance

251
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,920
related to the Sangbo Case?

252
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:54,800
We aren't sure yet.

253
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,230
That's why we have to find him quickly

254
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:59,710
to put together the truth.

255
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:02,430
So

256
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,510
what's your plan?

257
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:05,710
I don't have one,

258
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:08,440
but we can go to this place

259
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:10,800
to try our luck.

260
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:19,380
(Earl Pingyuan's Mansion.)

261
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,040
Earl Pingyuan's Mansion?

262
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:30,310
Yes.

263
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,800
Heng Yuan came here once
to look for Heng Hui.

264
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,230
Maybe he'll come again.

265
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:37,200
Let's go and check.

266
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,040
Maybe...

267
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:41,110
Maybe we'll find leads to his whereabouts.

268
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:46,920
Let's go.

269
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:55,740
(Earl Pingyuan's Lineal Son)

270
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,120
Young Master!

271
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,280
Young Master,

272
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:23,350
all the trading in town has been suspended.

273
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,110
The women and children sent over

274
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:26,470
are staying where they are.

275
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:27,400
I suggest

276
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,400
we wait until things blow over

277
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:30,830
and then send them away.

278
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:32,200
Stay put for now.

279
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,470
Don't draw the Guardians' attention.

280
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,680
What about the authorities in town?

281
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,630
Any actions so far?

282
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:40,630
Not yet.

283
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,000
You may leave.

284
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:43,440
Stay alert.

285
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,280
Yes.

286
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:54,040
Liven it up.

287
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,320
No sooner is Earl Pingyuan buried

288
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,160
than his son is indulging in decadent music.

289
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,510
What a dandy.

290
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,990
His lineal son seems to
have taken over that group of traffickers.

291
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,080
Lord Wei has already known that.

292
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,560
I'm sure things are under his control.

293
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,510
Those people are in his hand.

294
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:20,280
Lower your voice.

295
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:22,280
- Be quiet.
- What are you doing?

296
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,120
No. 4,

297
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,320
no, Mr. Chu,

298
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,350
watch your sword case, please.

299
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,400
What's wrong with it?

300
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:33,710
It's fine. It's my fault.

301
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:34,880
Look,

302
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,560
this is a covert operation.

303
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,750
Your huge case might give us away.

304
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:39,960
Let me put it on the side.

305
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:41,920
Sorry, you can't.

306
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:43,920
Enough.

307
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,280
Can you two be quiet?

308
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,680
He's carried that case for 10 years.

309
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,320
You want to take it off him?

310
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,040
In your dreams!

311
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:52,590
10 years?

312
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,520
Yes.

313
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,080
Over the years,

314
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:56,710
my sword's been in its scabbard

315
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:58,280
in its case on my back,

316
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,960
nourished by Qi force day and night.

317
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,200
Once it's powerful enough,

318
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:02,470
I'll battle No. 2.

319
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,830
I see. "Ten years it takes to grind a sword.

320
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:06,320
Its frosty edge has yet to be tested."

321
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,280
Exactly.

322
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:11,800
"Ten years it takes to grind a sword.

323
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:14,510
Its frosty edge has yet to be tested."

324
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,990
"Ten years it takes to grind a sword.

325
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,870
Its frosty edge has yet to be tested."

326
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,560
Brilliant!

327
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,440
Spot on! It speaks to me.

328
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,630
What's the next line?

329
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:34,930
Xu...

330
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,200
Qi'an.

331
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,280
Xu Qi'an,

332
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:38,190
Mr. Xu,

333
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:40,710
what's the next line?

334
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:41,680
Could you tell me?

335
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:42,870
Next line?

336
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:43,870
Yes, there's one,

337
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,110
but I forgot.

338
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,400
Please think again.

339
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,350
I don't remember it.

340
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:52,510
- If I knew, I'd tell you.
- Stop it.

341
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:56,590
We got company.

342
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:14,350
Who is this?

343
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:15,190
Go away!

344
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,160
Who are you?

345
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,470
A debt collector.

346
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:34,030
It's you.

347
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:36,760
No way!

348
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,990
I saw you die with my own eyes!

349
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,160
I crawled back from hell

350
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:47,270
to take revenge on you!

351
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,440
I'll track down all of you

352
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:09,070
and...

353
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,070
A mummy?

354
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,920
This hand was the evil object in Sangbo.

355
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:59,640
One Chop to Kill All!

356
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,750
(If one chop fails to kill it,)

357
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:14,750
(then...)

358
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:16,870
Run!

359
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:53,440
Are you safe? Have you got out?

360
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,510
Look up.

361
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:05,120
Jinlian?

362
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,440
Look down.

363
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:16,200
Wow!

364
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,750
They're amazing!

365
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:18,990
That thing is too powerful.

366
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:19,840
It's formidable.

367
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,070
We aren't its match.

368
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:22,230
I've talked to No. 4.

369
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:24,230
We'll go back to the sect for safety.

370
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,750
Wait. You aren't one of the sect members.

371
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,160
Why do you have the Jade Mirror?

372
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:31,990
(Oh no! I was careless.)

373
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:33,070
(I forgot that.)

374
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,360
My brother has to focus on

375
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:36,750
the upcoming Spring Exam.

376
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,230
He let me keep the mirror for now.

377
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:45,030
- Stop!
- Who are you?

378
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,310
It's me!

379
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,760
Mr. Xu.

380
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:51,440
An assassin broke
into Earl Pingyuan's Mansion

381
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,400
and killed everyone.

382
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,750
I ran into him while investigating

383
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,310
by His Majesty's order.

384
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:56,990
He's formidable. Don't act rashly.

385
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:57,920
Alert others now.

386
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:58,760
Yes.

387
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:18,330
Chief,

388
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:19,790
we looked everywhere

389
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:21,790
but didn't find
Earl Pingyuan's lineal son's body.

390
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:23,920
Tell them to stop.

391
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:36,880
I think

392
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:40,230
other than the killer, someone else was here.

393
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:49,230
Who discovered the massacre first?

394
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:50,470
They did.

395
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:51,820
- Gold Gong Jin.
- Gold Gong Jin.

396
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,840
When you came,

397
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,880
did you see anyone suspicious in this area?

398
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,230
No, sir.

399
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,510
Actually, we didn't discover the massacre.

400
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,710
It wasn't you?

401
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:04,020
Who was it?

402
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:05,200
Copper Gong Xu Qi'an.

403
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:06,750
Xu Qi'an?

404
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:10,720
Where is he?

405
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:12,260
(Heng Hui)

406
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:15,640
Lord Wei,

407
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:17,470
everyone in Earl Pingyuan's Mansion

408
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,360
was killed. No one survived.

409
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,600
When were they killed?

410
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:22,840
Who killed them?

411
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,310
Just now,

412
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:26,510
when I went there for investigation,

413
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:27,470
I witnessed everything.

414
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,680
The killer is a man in a gray robe.

415
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,550
He's above the 4th Rank.

416
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:32,790
I'm no match for him.

417
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,920
I believe he's carrying

418
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,550
the thing once sealed in Sangbo.

419
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:37,840
What makes you say that?

420
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:39,920
Earl Pingyuan's lineal son

421
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:43,230
died in the same way
as those Imperial Guards.

422
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:47,400
Take a look.

423
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,120
Is he that killer?

424
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:54,580
(Heng Hui)

425
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,720
Yes.

426
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,750
He's Heng Hui?

427
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:05,880
The Azure Hall had
an energy-concealing weapon

428
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,550
that went missing a year ago.

429
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,440
Abbot Panshu of Tianyu

430
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,680
kept that secret
to not cause himself trouble.

431
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,310
Heng Hui left the Azure Hall

432
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:15,070
almost at the same time.

433
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,680
In that case,

434
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:20,750
Zhou Chixiong did use that weapon

435
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:21,960
to get away.

436
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:25,680
How did Zhou get Heng Hui's weapon?

437
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:28,640
Heng Hui came back and killed so many people.

438
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,230
I'll track down all of you

439
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,710
and...

440
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:39,750
He's back for revenge.

441
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:41,310
He said he'd continue to kill.

442
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,480
Revenge?

443
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,480
Lord Wei,

444
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,960
there might be more

445
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:49,960
to Princess Pingyang's elopement.

446
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,480
Go on.

447
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,400
I found that a year ago,

448
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:57,230
His Majesty meant to
let Duke Yu in the Cabinet.

449
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:58,510
Meanwhile,

450
00:22:58,750 --> 00:22:59,790
His Majesty fumed.

451
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,960
Officials attacked Duke Yu.

452
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:02,680
Then he passed away in distress.

453
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,750
A year later,

454
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:06,960
Heng Hui came back

455
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,070
and killed Earl Pingyuan's lineal son.

456
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,440
The Earl had a group of traffickers,

457
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,550
able to send people out of town in secret.

458
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:17,400
Do you mean

459
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:20,990
it's actually a power struggle

460
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:23,120
between civil officials and the nobility?

461
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:27,310
Do you know

462
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:29,200
after Pingyang ran away

463
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:30,750
and Duke Yu died,

464
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:33,230
who benefited the most under the table?

465
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:36,680
You're right.

466
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,880
It concerns tons of officials' transfers.

467
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:43,230
Lord Wei,

468
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:44,680
Earl Pingyuan's Mansion...

469
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:48,870
Jiang Lyuzhong,

470
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:51,070
come closer.

471
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:55,750
Any update on the group of traffickers

472
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:56,840
you're investigating?

473
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,840
I've been digging into them

474
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:01,120
without alerting any forces or authorities.

475
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,920
Since Earl Pingyuan died,

476
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,270
they've been lying low.

477
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:06,160
No one is going after them,

478
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,200
so they remain in the capital.

479
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:10,400
I see.

480
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,070
Looks like

481
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:13,960
Earl Pingyuan's lineal son

482
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:16,200
did take over that group.

483
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:19,960
It's time to crack it.

484
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:20,960
Yes.

485
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:22,960
You may leave.

486
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,270
I have other things to attend to.

487
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:25,840
Good night, Lord Wei.

488
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:34,640
How dare you steal my case!

489
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,790
Don't be mad, Gold Gong Jiang.

490
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:41,710
I know you're investigating the Earl's case.

491
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:45,360
It's closely linked to the Sangbo Case.

492
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,360
If we work together

493
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:50,230
to solve them,

494
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:52,310
you'll gain merits, too, right?

495
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:55,760
Hey,

496
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,030
do whatever you see fit.

497
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,200
If you need my help,

498
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,440
just let me know.

499
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:03,710
Thanks a lot.

500
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:05,200
You're welcome.

501
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:07,550
Were you injured?

502
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:09,070
Heng Hui hit me.

503
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:10,470
Sorry about that.

504
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:20,580
(Duke Yu's Mansion)

505
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:35,860
(Duke Yu's Mansion)

506
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:38,020
Princess Pingyang might be
involved in the Sangbo Case.

507
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:39,990
That's only my speculation so far.

508
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,280
Lin'an.

509
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:57,900
(Endless Fortune)

510
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:04,750
Ever since the Sangbo Ceremony,

511
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:06,510
Her Ladyship has been bringing you up.

512
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:07,840
You've finally come.

513
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,040
Lin'an.

514
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:32,920
Aunt.

515
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,400
When was the last time

516
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,750
you came here after Pingyang left?

517
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:42,510
No one eats the pomegranates

518
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:44,200
on the tree.

519
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:47,960
A while ago,

520
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:49,600
the heavy rain

521
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:51,920
knocked off many of them.

522
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:56,710
Come in.

523
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:11,680
Aunt,

524
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,640
this is...

525
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,680
I have nothing to do.

526
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:20,030
I copy Buddhist sutras

527
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:21,600
to kill time

528
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,070
and pray for my husband and daughter.

529
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,750
It's been a while since your last visit.

530
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:33,400
Her Ladyship misses you
and Princess Pingyang every day.

531
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:37,070
Here.

532
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,920
Try the newly picked pomegranate.

533
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,550
Is it sweet?

534
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,880
When Pingyang

535
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,270
was 10,

536
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:54,840
her father had the tree

537
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:57,120
delivered from the South.

538
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,750
She's always been a picky eater.

539
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,960
She said other pomegranates were sour.

540
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,440
Only those

541
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,710
from that tree were her favorites.

542
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:13,680
Are pomegranates on that tree

543
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,120
from the South really that sweet?

544
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:19,390
I think

545
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:21,120
she liked them

546
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,440
simply because she planted

547
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,360
that tree herself.

548
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:32,550
She loved the tree

549
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:35,920
but wouldn't come back to see it.

550
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:41,710
Does she

551
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,270
still hate me and her father?

552
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,720
Aunt,

553
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,990
even if parents and children fought,

554
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:52,640
they'd make up overnight.

555
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:55,030
She doesn't hate you anymore.

556
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:58,900
Then

557
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,500
when you hear from her again,

558
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:02,540
please tell her

559
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:06,340
this year's pomegranates are sweet and juicy,

560
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:08,820
and let her know...

561
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:14,860
I'm no longer mad at her.

562
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:17,500
Were her father alive,

563
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:20,100
he'd forgive her, too.

564
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:22,900
I just

565
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:24,860
want her to come back

566
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,420
to visit me.

567
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:39,820
Uh,

568
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:42,660
actually, a while ago,

569
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:45,660
I received her letter.

570
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:48,100
She said she went to...

571
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:50,500
Zhongzhou.

572
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,660
The scenery there was beautiful.

573
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:54,980
She didn't want to leave.

574
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:56,980
She...

575
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:01,500
She was afraid His Majesty was still mad.

576
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:02,860
That's why

577
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:03,980
she didn't come back.

578
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:06,380
In that case,

579
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:08,980
I can go there to visit her.

580
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:10,740
I'm free anyway.

581
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:11,580
Aunt...

00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:15,600
♪Brings whom to my side♪

583
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:18,340
Zhongzhou is far.

584
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:23,500
It'll take over a month to get there.

585
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:26,420
When you arrive, she's probably left.

586
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:31,350

How about this?

590
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:42,300
When I

591
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:44,700
write to her next time,

592
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:46,500
I'll persuade her.

593
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:50,380
♪I only wish for Xu's safety♪

594
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:52,060

Alright.

596
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:54,220
I...

597
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:57,300
I'll ask Butler Li

598
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,860
to prepare

599
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:00,710
new clothes and jewelry

600
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,660
for her to wear when she

601
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:02,790
- Aunt,
- comes back...

602
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:05,860
I have to go back to the Palace

603
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,660
to attend to a few things.

604
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:10,580
Lin'an,

605
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:16,140
please help me

606
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:18,980
bring Pingyang back.

607
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:36,940
You have three days

608
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:38,580
to solve this case,

609
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:40,500
or you'll be dismissed!

610
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:41,380
(Report)

611
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:51,500
Please be appeased, Your Majesty.

612
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:53,620
Cultivators

613
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:55,020
cultivate their minds, too.

614
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:59,180
Don't ruin your state of mind.

615
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,340
Your Majesty,

616
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:07,700
the Guardians have let go
of the culprits twice.

617
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,180
That's malpractice.

618
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:10,780
I suspect

619
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:12,860
Wei Yuan is colluding with the enemies.

620
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:14,340
He's a traitor.

621
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:18,380
He must be dealt with seriously.

622
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:33,340
Magistrate Chen,

623
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:34,940
what do you think?

624
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:37,860
While the Sangbo Case's under investigation,

625
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:41,660
a massacre happened
at Earl Pingyuan's Mansion.

626
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:43,160
Your Majesty, please don't be mad.

627
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:45,500
You should stay calm.

628
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:46,740
Let's hear

629
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:48,820
what Lord Wei

630
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:50,700
has to say first.

631
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:00,700
Your Majesty,

632
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:03,180
I believe

633
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:06,340
those two cases are

634
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:08,260
part of a bigger case.

635
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:11,380
I've found out

636
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:14,060
who killed Earl Pingyuan.

637
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:17,500
(Zhang Feng, Minister of War)

638
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:21,460
Who was it?

639
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:26,260
The case also involved Princess Pingyang
who went missing a year ago.

640
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:29,060
The tip-off the Guardians received

641
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:32,060
shows that her disappearance

642
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:35,900
might've been planned by court officials

643
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:37,220
in order to

644
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:39,820
bring down Duke Yu.

645
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:44,060
What exactly happened?

646
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:45,140
Your Majesty,

647
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:46,740
please

648
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:49,260
make others leave.

649
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:17,340
That eunuch

650
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:18,900
dared to ask us to leave.

651
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:20,820
He's up to no good!

652
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:23,380
Minister,

653
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:26,140
if what Lord Wei has to say is classified,

654
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:28,100
it's understandable

655
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:29,860
to clear the room.

656
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:31,780
We're high-ranking officials.

657
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:34,340
How classified is it
that even we can't hear it?

658
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:35,700
I bet

659
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:37,580
he's showing off to us

660
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:40,900
how much His Majesty favors him!

661
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:49,020
Lord Wei,

662
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:50,060
good day.

663
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:51,940
Lord Wei.

664
00:34:58,340 --> 00:34:59,180
Lord Wei,

665
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:02,820
who is that cold-blooded killer that massacred

666
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:04,660
all those in Earl Pingyuan's Mansion?

667
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:07,580
Mr. Zhang,

668
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:09,460
it's confidential as it's linked

669
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:10,700
to the Sangbo Case.

670
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:13,500
However,

671
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:15,700
the Guardians

672
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:17,900
have been tipped off.

673
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:20,940
The truth will soon come out.

674
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:23,180
You'll know it then,

675
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:25,020
Minister.

676
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:26,820
I see.

677
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:42,060
Eunuch Yang,

678
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:44,820
what did Wei Yuan say

679
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,260
to His Majesty just now?

680
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:47,740
This case

681
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:51,220
is being handled
by Copper Gong Guardian, Xu Qi'an.

682
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:53,540
Lord Wei simply said

683
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:55,900
what Xu Qi'an had told him.

684
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:59,220
Xu Qi'an?

685
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:07,780
What's taking you so long to pack up?

686
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:09,100
Can you hurry up?

687
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:11,700
Hurry! Box it!

688
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:12,700
Master,

689
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:14,340
don't be too mad.

690
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:16,100
We're doing it as fast as we can.

691
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:17,220
Where is our son?

692
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:18,220
It's been a while.

693
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:19,300
Why hasn't he come out?

694
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:20,740
I've rushed him a few times.

695
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:22,020
He'll be out soon.

696
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:23,420
Calm down.

697
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:24,500
Hurry up! Come on!

698
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:28,260
- Son.
- Did you ask for me?

699
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:29,580
Pack up your valuables.

700
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:31,300
We need to get out of town now.

701
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:32,460
(Zhang Yi, Zhang Feng's son)

702
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:33,980
Go now!

703
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:35,180
Hurry!

704
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:37,020
- Yes, Father.
- Go.

705
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:50,660
Stop.

706
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:54,180
The Guardians are working on a case. No exit.

707
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:56,380
Officer, we're going out for business.

708
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:57,220
Please let us go.

709
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:58,300
Here's something for you.

710
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:00,060
The suspect is on the run.

711
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:01,300
No one is allowed in or out.

712
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:06,460
I'm the Minister of War, Zhang Feng.

713
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:08,020
I have state affairs to attend to.

714
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:09,220
No delay is allowed!

715
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:11,220
Let us through now!

716
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:13,140
It's His Majesty's order.

717
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:14,780
Please think twice, Minister Zhang.

718
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:21,060
Have some tea.

719
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:23,340
Thanks, Lord Wei.

720
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:37,980
Lord Wei,

721
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:40,540
the Minister of War, Zhang Feng,
meant to leave with his family.

722
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:41,820
Our people stopped them just now.

723
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:43,820
I see. You may leave.

724
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,580
The fish took the bait?

725
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:50,860
Your plan was brilliant.

726
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:51,980
We simply baited...

727
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:54,940
We simply baited the trap.

728
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:56,660
The suspect fell right into it.

729
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:58,660
Hadn't you, a little Copper Gong,

730
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:01,820
figured out the power struggle
behind this case,

731
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:05,340
Zhang Feng wouldn't have fled in haste
after hearing the news.

732
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:06,540
Yes.

733
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:11,900
But

734
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:14,700
did the mastermind go to such great lengths

735
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:17,060
to release that thing from the lake

736
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:20,380
only to help Heng Hui take revenge?

737
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:22,420
Given his ability and rank,

738
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:25,900
he wasn't qualified to join the Sangbo Case.

739
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,560
My original theory was

740
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:33,260
court officials were behind the Sangbo Case.

741
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:34,540
Releasing that thing

742
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:35,900
was to stage a revolt.

743
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:37,100
Besides,

744
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:38,060
I even thought

745
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:39,540
that thing was...

746
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:40,420
What was it?

747
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:45,780
Tell me.

748
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:48,620
The former Supervisor.

749
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:51,580
What do you think now?

750
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:55,820
Heng Hui's appearance proved me wrong.

751
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:58,260
What baffles me is

752
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:00,940
if other forces are behind Heng Hui,

753
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:04,260
they released that thing for what?

754
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:06,540
Speculation is of no use.

755
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,180
Once we seize him,

756
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:12,020
