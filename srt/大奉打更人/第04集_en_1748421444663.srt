I'm a friend who has a lot of friends

00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm a friend who has a lot of friends

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm curious what I'm talking about

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I don't want to think about the future

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I'm not good at talking about the past

6
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm not good at talking about the past

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm not good at talking about the past

I'm not good at talking about the past

We are ordinary, we are like step by step

00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
We are ordinary, we are like step by step

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
We are short, we are patient

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
We are riderike street singers

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Never say no

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000

00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,460
Well, then matterlessly

30
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:19,920
Let's meet Yawning

31
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,020
Mr. Tang

32
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,280
The noodles are fixed

33
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:26,360
Here's Zero

Episode 16

36
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:33,660
Vinguo S20

37
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,400
Very pervasive

38
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,400
Appearing of beauty

39
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,480
See in display,

40
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,680

41
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:46,960
Brother!

42
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:48,680
My Lord!

43
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,320
Be patient.

44
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,520
It was he who humiliated me

45
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,600
before I was brought up here.

46
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,360
Why did he accuse me of my crime?

47
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,560
Is there a crime?

48
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,920
I will keep itладen.

49
00:02:59,600 --> 00:02:59,960
Go on!

50
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,520
My Lord,

51
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,500
I...

52
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,020
여,

53
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:11,040
I hate you!

54
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:11,920
You...

55
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:14,620
You will never get in the competition.

56
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,020
You only have the two teams to choose.

57
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:19,960
You should assist me because I'm coming to wager.

58
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,460
Thanks.

59
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,400
Cut it out!

60
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:26,760
OH!

61
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,360
Despite your actions this time,

62
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,160
Dad and Sushi are good з credential at my home,

63
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,800
who are going to kick your ass?

64
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,020
Do you really not like to play Hard stellt?

65
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:34,560
OK.

66
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,580
But nothing is real.

67
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:38,460
I'll get you Ge Ge,

68
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:41,460
but the owner can't afford it now.

69
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:43,900
How many% is this?

70
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:48,660
Boss Ru.

71
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:49,180
Yes.

72
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,700
I'll tell your appearance to your sister.

73
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:51,740
Don't worry.

74
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,220
Take her away!

75
00:03:59,060 --> 00:03:59,620
Young Master Zhao,

76
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:01,540
if we need anything,

77
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:02,100
please leave it to me.

78
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:03,380
Not necessary.

79
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,820
I want to do it myself.

80
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:07,180
Clean up!

81
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,020
Clean up!

82
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:31,300
Now...

83
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:32,060
Now...

84
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,180
Who are you?

85
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:40,860
I have a friend who asked me to give this book to Miss Caiwei

86
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,260
and give her a sentence.

87
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,700
Xu Qian'an is in trouble. She's in a hurry.

88
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:46,540
What's going on?

89
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,060
This is already the 48th time.

90
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:50,420
Song has been in this house for two days and two nights.

91
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:51,820
He hasn't succeeded at all.

92
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:55,020
He's the most talented hunter in the four days.

93
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:56,860
How could he fail?

94
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:57,860
Let's see.

95
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:58,700
Come on.

96
00:04:58,700 --> 00:04:59,700
Let's check it out.

97
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,220
You Xin.

98
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:08,980
What are they recording?

99
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:14,980
Is there something wrong?

100
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:16,020
What happened to them?

101
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:25,820
Come and find these potatoes.

102
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:27,020
How can you find these?

103
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,180
These?

104
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:32,380
Don't worry.

105
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:33,620
He must have a bury detector or something.

106
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:35,500
We'll go find them at the location.

107
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:36,500
Why?

108
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,500
It's not about the salt content.

109
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,500
It's not about the temperature.

110
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,500
It's not about my training.

111
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,500
Right.

112
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,500
Why can't I practice?

113
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,500
Brother Su.

114
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,500
Brother Su.

115
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,500
Brother Su.

116
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,500
I found a treasure to find the treasure.

117
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,500
I also brought a sentence.

118
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,500
It's about the disaster of Qi'an.

119
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,500
Brother Su.

120
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,500
Xu Qi'an?

121
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,500
Where did you hear this name?

122
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,500
What did the person say?

123
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,500
He even left this book.

124
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,500
The price of the exchange is the principle of the practice of gold and silver.

125
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,500
The price of the exchange?

126
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,500
The price of the exchange is the principle of the practice of gold and silver.

127
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,500
The teacher taught me the hand-made clothes of the practice of gold and silver.

128
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,500
The principle of the practice of gold and silver is not the exchange.

129
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,500
It's the exchange of the importance.

130
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,500
Who gave this book to you?

131
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,500
What is this painting?

132
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,500
What is the person's name?

133
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,500
Why do I know all the characters in this book?

134
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,500
But they are combined.

135
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,500
I don't understand anything.

136
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,500
Brother Su.

137
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,500
Do you know?

138
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:05,040
Brother Su.

139
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:05,800
Great.

140
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,500
ピ日本劣易方法.

141
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,500
Do you know the principle of the practice of gold and silver?

142
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,500
He is right.

143
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,500
I did so.

144
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,500
对意?

145
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,500
It's true that rock masonryzil became gold,

146
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,500
and功绝娥獰黄.

147
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,500
So I am familiar with it.

148
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,500
3rd驻艳

149
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:26,500
The Buddha created a temple in thehis training camp to make this god'sclim散 sword and see how the signing ceremony got its life.

150
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,500
This temple is here.

151
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,340
Here.

152
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,860
The third step.

153
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:37,020
Come.

154
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,220
No more?

155
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:44,100
How could he be gone?

156
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,140
Is he just giving you one?

157
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,300
He's giving you one?

158
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:48,220
No.

159
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:50,700
Then what does the third step mean?

160
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:53,100
He deliberately dropped our position.

161
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,020
Let me ask you again.

162
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:57,380
Who gave you this book?

163
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,620
I don't know.

164
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:00,620
I don't know.

165
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:01,660
I don't know.

166
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:02,660
I don't know.

167
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:03,660
I don't know.

168
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:04,660
I don't know.

169
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:05,660
I don't know.

170
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:06,660
I don't know.

171
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:07,660
I don't know.

172
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:08,660
I don't know.

173
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:09,660
I don't know.

174
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:10,660
I don't know.

175
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:11,660
I don't know.

176
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:12,660
I don't know.

177
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:13,660
I don't know.

178
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:14,660
I don't know.

179
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,660
I don't know.

180
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:16,660
I don't know.

181
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:17,660
I don't know.

182
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:18,660
I don't know.

183
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:19,660
I don't know.

184
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:20,660
I don't know.

185
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:21,660
I don't know.

186
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:22,660
I don't know.

187
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:23,660
I don't know.

188
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:24,660
I don't know.

189
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:25,660
I don't know.

190
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:26,660
I don't know.

191
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:27,820
I don't know.

192
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:30,660
I don't know.

193
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:31,820
I don't know.

194
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:39,820
He wrote this without mentioning.

195
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:51,620
Really.

196
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:53,820
He wrote this?

197
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:54,820
I don't know.

198
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:55,820
I don't know.

199
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:58,140
is Pingzhi.

200
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,780
It's me.

201
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:04,540
Mr. Zhong,

202
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:06,700
can we stop

203
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,500
this case?

204
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:13,620
Yes, yes, yes.

205
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,860
Mr. Bai Hu has already sent the message.

206
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:19,100
It's not a bad thing.

207
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,220
Let me think.

208
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:24,220
How about this?

209
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,020
You

210
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:28,060
cut her into pieces

211
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:30,220
and cut yourself into pieces.

212
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,240
Today will be a deal soon.

213
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:32,460
What do you say?

214
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:40,260
Cut her into pieces?

215
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:43,980
Even the beating

216
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:46,820
may cylinder my way out.

217
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,220
After her.

218
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:49,060
Aye

219
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:12,900
Nngyong

220
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:15,860
I have uncle today

221
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,860
No one can take you away.

222
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:42,860
Who else?

223
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:49,860
Master,

224
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:52,860
I thought they could have a good relationship

225
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,860
and fight with me.

226
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:59,860
Who would have thought that they would never talk about anything?

227
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:05,860
But don't worry.

228
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:08,860
Second Uncle always stays behind.

229
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:10,860
Before I came,

230
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:14,860
I told your aunt to ask for help from the hospital.

231
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:18,860
And

232
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:21,860
I asked someone to bring the knife.

233
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:24,860
As long as my brothers come,

234
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:26,860
we'll go out of here.

235
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:28,860
That's not a problem.

236
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,860
The knife.

237
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:31,860
With their help,

238
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:33,860
they won't be able to get out.

239
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,860
He's waiting.

240
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:42,860
Second Uncle,

241
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:44,860
he's a good man.

242
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:45,860
He's not bad.

243
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:46,860
He's a good man.

244
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:47,860
He's a good man.

245
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:48,860
He's a good man.

246
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:49,860
He's a good man.

247
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:50,860
I'm not bad.

248
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:53,860
Master,

249
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:54,860
Mr. Mu Bai,

250
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:55,860
I have a request.

251
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:56,860
What is it?

252
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,860
Jia Xiong Yin is bullied by her sister.

253
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,860
He's offended by the minister of the Ministry of Revenue.

254
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:03,860
Please help him out.

255
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:05,860
Your brother?

256
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:07,860
That's the one who wrote the letter.

257
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,860
Mo Chou is the most ignorant.

258
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:10,860
Who doesn't lose his life?

259
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:11,860
That's the one.

260
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:12,860
That's the one.

261
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:13,860
That's it.

262
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,860
Leave your brother's matter to me.

263
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,860
You go back to study with your teacher.

264
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:19,860
Mr. Xian, you don't care about the matter.

265
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:21,860
I'll handle the family matter.

266
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,860
What's your brother's decision?

267
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:24,860
Chang Le County.

268
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:27,860
I'm a minister of the Ministry of Revenue.

269
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:29,860
This old fart is really a matter of the Ministry of Revenue.

270
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:31,860
I don't belong to this land.

271
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:33,860
I belong to Chang Le County.

272
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:44,860
I haven't learned it yet.

273
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:45,860
Okay.

274
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:49,860
You're already very handsome.

275
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:52,860
I thought you two wouldn't help each other.

276
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:56,860
Then I...

277
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,860
At least go.

278
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:03,860
Where's Ning Yan?

279
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:05,860
Ning Yan was arrested by the Ministry of Revenue.

280
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:08,860
Miss Xu, don't worry.

281
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:11,860
What Ning Yan told me has been done.

282
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:14,860
If Siyan Sword can really be executed,

283
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:17,860
Ning Yan will definitely be in danger this time.

284
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:19,860
Siyan Sword is a man.

285
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:20,860
Ning Yan is really capable.

286
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:22,860
If Ning Yan is so good,

287
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:23,860
if something happens to her,

288
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:24,860
I'll go to fight them.

289
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:25,860
Yes.

290
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:26,860
Listen.

291
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:32,860
Is your brother and Tong Liang's relationship good?

292
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:33,860
Yes.

293
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:35,860
Is Tong Liang's relationship good?

294
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:40,860
Ning Yan is a very interesting person.

295
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,860
Interesting?

296
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:48,860
Uncle Wang, can you tell me about my brother?

297
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:52,860
I'm not afraid of you laughing.

298
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,860
Actually, a person like me

299
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:00,860
is not that quiet in the bottom.

300
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:02,860
I think ordinary people like him

301
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:04,860
are kind of good.

302
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:08,860
As for those rich and wealthy people,

303
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:10,860
they're like they're running a water business.

304
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,860
Isn't it the first thing they do?

305
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:18,860
But your brother doesn't know how to do it.

306
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,860
He's a good person.

307
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:23,860
He's rich and wealthy.

308
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:26,860
He never likes to be arrogant.

309
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:32,860
When you guys met in the front,

310
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:34,860
I thought of

311
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:36,860
finding a chance

312
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:38,860
to take a pen with him.

313
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,860
He was smiling and smiling.

314
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,860
After that, he paid for his money.

315
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:52,860
He turned around and gave it back to people.

316
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,860
If he knows something,

317
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:59,860
he won't understand

318
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:02,860
the simple reason of water business.

319
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:05,860
But if he doesn't know something,

320
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,860
he'll know it very well.

321
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:10,860
He's very humorous.

322
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:13,860
He's very friendly and kind.

323
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:17,860
He's good at the relationship with the brothers.

324
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,860
So this time, he's in trouble.

325
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:28,860
His family is in trouble.

326
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:40,860
Uncle.

327
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:43,860
Uncle.

328
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:51,860
Uncle.

329
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:53,860
It's been an hour.

330
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:55,860
Why hasn't he come yet?

331
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:59,860
Well, he's on his way.

332
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:01,860
Let's wait for him.

333
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:05,860
Hey.

334
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:06,860
Here, take it.

335
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:18,860
Xu Xia, I'll give you a meal.

336
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:24,860
Get out.

337
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:28,860
Listen to me.

338
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,860
You'd better be honest with me.

339
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:32,860
I don't want to cut your hand and foot.

340
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:34,860
I'll drag you out.

341
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:37,860
Hurry up.

342
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:41,860
Hurry up.

343
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:47,860
Hurry up.

344
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:52,860
Mingyu.

345
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:55,860
Where are you taking him?

346
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:56,860
Mingyu.

347
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:57,860
Come back.

348
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:00,860
Zhou Yi.

349
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:02,860
My men are coming.

350
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:04,860
If you dare to touch your nephew,

351
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:06,860
I'll kill you.

352
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:23,860
You said you were angry just now.

353
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:24,860
What's the matter?

354
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:27,860
You're angry?

355
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:33,860
All right.

356
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:35,860
Keep it.

357
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:49,860
Draw it yourself.

358
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:51,860
I'll take the skin off.

359
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:54,860
I can't talk.

360
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:58,860
But you misunderstood what I meant.

361
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:00,860
I meant

362
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:03,860
you want to draw first and then take the skin off.

363
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:05,860
Or you want to draw first and then take the skin off?

364
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:27,860
Are you angry?

365
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,860
Why are you so angry?

366
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,860
What will you do

367
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:35,860
if you're angry now?

368
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:38,860
Every time I do this,

369
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:42,860
I'll make people suffer and hurt.

370
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:45,860
But he can't get hurt.

371
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,860
I just want you to know

372
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:51,860
that I'm not a good person.

373
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:53,860
I just want you to know

374
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:56,860
that

375
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:59,860
Luo Yi is a good person.

376
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:04,860
As long as I can live a year,

377
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:07,860
I'll make you suffer.

378
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:13,860
My lord,

379
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:14,860
something happened.

380
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:16,860
The two ministers of the Yulu Academy

381
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:17,860
are waiting outside to see you.

382
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:18,860
Yulu Academy?

383
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,860
You're Mr. Guan from Gulao Village.

384
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:22,860
This is my family business.

385
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:23,860
What's the relationship with you?

386
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:26,860
Brother Chen,

387
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:28,860
Brother Yan,

388
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:29,860
dare to ask

389
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:31,860
what's the situation in my department?

390
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:35,860
The department caught a disciple named Xu Qian today.

391
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:38,860
I hope you can let go of him.

392
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:42,860
I'll find the situation in my department

393
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:44,860
and ask him to let me go.

394
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:47,860
Before I find the situation,

395
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:50,860
I won't let you go.

396
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:51,860
Please make it clear.

397
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:53,860
He...

398
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:56,860
My lord,

399
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:58,860
there are many people from the Yulu Academy.

400
00:19:58,860 --> 00:19:59,860
We can't stop them.

401
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:01,860
I'm the spy.

402
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,860
I'm the disciple of the Yulu Academy.

403
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:04,860
I'm Song Qing.

404
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:06,860
Greetings, my lord.

405
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:09,860
After I find the situation,

406
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:11,860
I've already given the law.

407
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:13,860
I'll leave now.

408
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:14,860
My lord,

409
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:18,860
I came here to ask for someone from the Ministry of Justice.

410
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:20,860
My lord.

411
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:21,860
Xu Qian.

412
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,860
I just got caught by the Ministry of Justice.

413
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:32,860
My lord.

414
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:34,860
Is there anyone from the Ministry of Justice

415
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,860
who can catch Xu Qian?

416
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:37,860
As far as I know,

417
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:39,860
there's no one from the Ministry of Justice today.

418
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:40,860
No.

419
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:41,860
Xu Qian.

420
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:44,860
But in the prison,

421
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:48,860
there's someone from the Ministry of Justice.

422
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:50,860
Who sent people to catch him?

423
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:51,860
This...

424
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:53,860
Wang Zhong.

425
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:55,860
Come back.

426
00:20:58,860 --> 00:20:59,860
My lord.

427
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:00,860
Xu Qian.

428
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,860
Did you send people to catch him?

429
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:04,860
It's me.

430
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:08,860
You should know

431
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:10,860
what I'm saying.

432
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:13,860
It's true.

433
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:16,860
Mr. Zhou handed in the letter.

434
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:18,860
He said there were thieves in the street.

435
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:19,860
But he suddenly

436
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:22,860
didn't have time to go to the other cases.

437
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:24,860
He tried to take the thief down

438
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:26,860
to avoid his crime.

439
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:32,860
The emperor is a man of the word.

440
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:33,860
He's a man of the word.

441
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:35,860
I'm telling you.

442
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:37,860
Mr. Zhou wants to kill Xu Qian.

443
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:38,860
He wants to kill him.

444
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:39,860
He wants to kill him.

445
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:40,860
I want to send Mr. Zhou

446
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:41,860
a pure love.

447
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:46,860
Four pieces of books.

448
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:47,860
Ask him.

449
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:55,860
My lord.

450
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:09,860
I heard

451
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:12,860
you're the second uncle's wife.

452
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:14,860
I suspect

453
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:17,860
you and your uncle

454
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:19,860
have the same plan.

455
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:23,860
Shou Li.

456
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:25,860
Don't move my family.

457
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:28,860
There's a sister.

458
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:29,860
She's beautiful.

459
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:33,860
I'll go to the other case.

460
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:34,860
She's beautiful.

461
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:39,860
I'll call her Fang Si.

462
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:40,860
My lord.

463
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:41,860
You didn't write the letter?

464
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:42,860
No, I didn't.

465
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:45,860
I'll write it here.

466
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:49,860
Write it in front of her.

467
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:50,860
Yes.

468
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:58,860
Take her away.

469
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:00,860
She's here.

470
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:01,860
She's finally here.

471
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:05,860
My lord.

472
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:08,860
I haven't interrogated her yet.

473
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:10,860
She's a criminal.

474
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:11,860
She's not a guard.

475
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:13,860
If you want to interrogate her,

476
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:15,860
you can go to the guard's.

477
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:16,860
If the guard meets her,

478
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:19,860
no one wants to talk to me.

479
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:21,860
You can't kick her away.

480
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:22,860
Wait.

481
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:24,860
My lord.

482
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:26,860
I'm the one who

483
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:28,860
killed her and her brother.

484
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:30,860
My lord.

485
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:31,860
I suggest you

486
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:33,860
not to be too cautious.

487
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:34,860
Mr. Zhou.

488
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:36,860
We'd better

489
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:38,860
tell the minister.

490
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:48,860
How can we get her love?

491
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:49,860
What?

492
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:50,860
If you want to be loved,

493
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:52,860
you have to kick her up first.

494
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:53,860
Oh, no.

495
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:54,860
Eight hundred heads.

496
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:55,860
Kick.

497
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:57,860
Ninth Five Dragon.

498
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:58,860
Kick.

499
00:23:58,860 --> 00:23:59,860
Eight hundred heads.

500
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:00,860
Ninth Five Dragon.

501
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:01,860
Eight hundred heads. Ninth Five Dragon.

502
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:02,860
Super cow.

503
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:03,860
The super cow of the Tailan family.

504
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:04,860
Super cow.

505
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:05,860
The cow-dung dragon.

506
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:08,860
The best-selling dragon in 2025.

507
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:10,860
Wear a red one.

508
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:11,860
Come to the new town.

509
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:13,860
Come to the scene.

510
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:17,860
The opening is a good brand.

511
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:19,860
All the family members are ready.

512
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:20,860
The code is not suitable.

513
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:21,860
The door is free.

514
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:22,860
The top-class is popular.

515
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:23,860
The red one is popular.

516
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:24,860
The brand you want.

517
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:25,860
The price you like.

518
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:26,860
All are in the top-class.

519
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:28,860
Mr. Zhou.

520
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:29,860
Mr. Zhou.

521
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:30,860
You are too bold.

522
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:31,860
Such a big thing.

523
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:33,860
You are a good leader.

524
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:34,860
I can't even face you.

525
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:36,860
How can you be so stubborn?

526
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:55,860
Lin should be happy that I didn't get out of the mountain.

527
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:57,860
I can't even introduce myself.

528
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:01,860
I am the disciple of Sister Siting.

529
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:11,860
Xu Xi'an.

530
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:13,860
I have met a few of you.

531
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:22,860
This is the letter from Zhu Ni.

532
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:23,860
It's from Zhu Ni.

533
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:25,860
Xu Xi'an.

534
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:27,860
This is not the place to talk.

535
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:28,860
When you leave the Ministry of Justice,

536
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:29,860
what does Brother Xu want to ask?

537
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:30,860
You will read it.

538
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:31,860
I will not.

539
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:32,860
I will not.

540
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:35,860
Xu Xi'an.

541
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:36,860
Brother Xu is here.

542
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:37,860
I am afraid.

543
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:38,860
Brother Xu, protect me.

544
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:41,860
Lord Sun.

545
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:44,860
The four-day gold and the tree are real.

546
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:47,860
They are here to ask for people.

547
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:49,860
Then...

548
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:51,860
The two masters of the Academy.

549
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:53,860
They are here to ask for people.

550
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,860
Xu Xi'an.

551
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:04,860
Yes.

552
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:06,860
I am the senior of the Academy.

553
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:07,860
Master.

554
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:08,860
Master.

555
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:10,860
The world is not a city.

556
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:11,860
No one is a master.

557
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:13,860
But you wrote it.

558
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:16,860
No.

559
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:17,860
What?

560
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:19,860
I will explain it to you later.

561
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:20,860
No.

562
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:22,860
We will leave the Ministry of Justice first.

563
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:23,860
Okay.

564
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:26,860
Wait a minute.

565
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:30,860
I have something to deal with.

566
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:32,860
Please wait a moment.

567
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:51,860
Xu Xi'an.

568
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:53,860
What are you doing?

569
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:54,860
Xu Xi'an, don't be too fast.

570
00:26:58,860 --> 00:26:59,860
You...

571
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:02,860
You...

572
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:05,860
Two eggs.

573
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:06,860
Have some.

574
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:12,860
I am afraid.

575
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:14,860
I am afraid.

576
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:16,860
I am afraid.

577
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:17,860
I am afraid.

578
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:18,860
I am afraid.

579
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:19,860
I am afraid.

580
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:21,860
I am afraid.

581
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:22,860
I am afraid.

582
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:24,860
Xu Xi'an.

583
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:26,860
Xu Xi'an...

584
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:31,860
You want to get in the tour guide stick by yourself?

585
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:32,860
Xu Xi'an.

586
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:35,860
This is my second Haoven Thuser.

587
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:38,860
Xu Xi'an.

588
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:41,860
Over.

589
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:43,520
Brother,

590
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,860
I bet you devour

591
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:48,860
my throne to obtain America's wealth.

592
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:49,900
But there's no gun.

593
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:51,260
I'm sure I'll get it.

594
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:52,260
Get up.

595
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:53,060
Brother.

596
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:55,700
What are you doing?

597
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:57,820
I just want to tell you today.

598
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:59,820
I have a problem with my skin.

599
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:03,900
My skin is exposed.

600
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:07,700
Let's go.

601
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:21,700
The End

602
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:25,700
Episode 1

603
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:30,820
I see.

604
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:32,580
Luckily, the teachers arrived in time

605
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:34,100
to let you have a rest.

606
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,860
By the way, I just want to ask you.

607
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:39,060
When did I become so strong?

608
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:41,660
The two of you are fighting for the victory.

609
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:43,580
You want to say I'm a official disciple.

610
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:44,580
And you want me to have time

611
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:46,020
to go to the Yunlu Academy

612
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:47,940
to have a talk with them.

613
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:50,460
They are reading your poems.

614
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:53,660
The one from the Yangtze River.

615
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:56,860
I thought they were reading my personal works.

616
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,500
But they are my poems.

617
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:00,900
When did I learn that poem?

618
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,540
I don't remember when I wrote it.

619
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:05,740
Then how did the Four Heavens Sword

620
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:07,380
come back?

621
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:08,740
I asked Wang Butou

622
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:10,620
to give a book to the Four Heavens Sword.

623
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:12,780
They are interested in the book.

624
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:17,780
And I have to go to the Four Heavens Sword to learn it tomorrow.

625
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:19,780
It's hard to be sure.

626
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:20,780
Here you go.

627
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:21,780
Take it easy.

628
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:22,780
Take it easy.

629
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:23,780
Take it easy.

630
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:24,780
It's cold.

631
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:25,780
It's cold.

632
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:27,780
Miss, please give me a bottle.

633
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:29,780
Boss,

634
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:31,780
take a few bottles.

635
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:32,780
OK.

636
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:34,780
Here you go.

637
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:35,780
Thank you.

638
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:36,780
Here you go.

639
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:38,780
Take one for sister.

640
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:39,780
Thank you.

641
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:40,780
I'll take one.

642
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:44,780
This is good.

643
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:49,780
As for the honey melon flavor,

644
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:52,780
I'm very grateful to you.

645
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:53,780
Here you go.

646
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:01,780
I'm not doing this for you.

647
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:04,780
If you have something to do,

648
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:05,780
we can go to the Four Heavens Sword.

649
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:06,780
You don't need to do that.

650
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:07,780
I love you.

651
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:12,780
Xu Ling!

652
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:14,780
Don't do that.

653
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:15,780
Take it easy.

654
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:18,780
A'Zi.

655
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:19,780
A'Zi.

656
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:23,780
Brother, you...

657
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:24,780
Take it away.

658
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:25,780
Don't let Li Ning find out.

659
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:26,780
Hurry up.

660
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:30,780
Brother,

661
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:31,780
how did you know?

662
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:33,780
I knew it.

663
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:35,780
You can make a few money on a business trip.

664
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:36,780
What do you want?

665
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:37,780
I'll buy you two.

666
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:39,780
I'm not rich than you.

667
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:43,780
Where's A'Zi?

668
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:44,780
He's not back yet.

669
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:47,780
Zhu Li,

670
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:50,780
my life is coming to an end.

671
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:53,780
If you dare to touch the face of the world,

672
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:55,780
I'll kill you.

673
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:58,780
Zhu Li,

674
00:30:58,780 --> 00:30:59,780
my life is coming to an end.

675
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:02,780
If you dare to touch the face of the world,

676
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:04,780
I'll kill you.

677
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:06,780
Someone's here.

678
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:08,780
Help.

679
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:18,780
Everyone,

680
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:21,780
if I guess it wrong,

681
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:26,780
did you forget me?

682
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:32,780
Zi Ji,

683
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:33,780
your dad is talking to you.

684
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:37,780
Your dad is talking to you.

685
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:43,780
Dad,

686
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:47,780
eat more.

687
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:49,780
I'll make it for you.

688
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:51,780
I'll make it for you.

689
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:57,780
I'm not conscience.

690
00:31:58,780 --> 00:31:59,780
What else?

691
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:02,780
How did you take the credit card?

692
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:03,780
You promised me

693
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:05,780
to give me a lot of money.

694
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:07,780
I'm not rich.

695
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:09,780
I'm just to save your heart.

696
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:11,780
I'm just a horse.

697
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:13,780
If you want to blame me, blame Zhu Li.

698
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:16,780
If I marry a woman,

699
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:18,780
I'll have a hard time with my family.

700
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:19,780
Can you forgive her?

701
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:20,780
Is that right, Zi Ji?

702
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:22,780
I'll have a hard time with my brother.

703
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:24,780
Good brother.

704
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:25,780
A bunch of money.

705
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:27,780
Eat.

706
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:28,780
Eat.

707
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:32,780
I can't use it again next time.

708
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:35,780
I'll learn from you.

709
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:38,780
What's the matter with the fairy?

710
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:44,780
This is also a blessing.

711
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:45,780
From now on,

712
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:47,780
our family

713
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:49,780
is united.

714
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:51,780
We share the same fate.

715
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:52,780
Eat.

716
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:56,780
Eat.

717
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:00,780
Eat.

718
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:03,780
Miss.

719
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:04,780
Are you...

720
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:05,780
Is Xu Xian here?

721
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:08,780
What?

722
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:10,780
You weren't in the private room before?

723
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,780
I was in the front door.

724
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:14,780
You're really lucky.

725
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:16,780
You met our brother Song.

726
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:18,780
Or I was your man.

727
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:19,780
I didn't care.

728
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:23,780
Wait.

729
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:25,780
Why did you fight with him?

730
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:26,780
I was shopping at my sister's.

731
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:27,780
I was shopping at her sister's.

732
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:29,780
I was looking at her color.

733
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:31,780
Your sister is indeed a good girl.

734
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:32,780
She is.

735
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:33,780
She is like you.

736
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:37,780
She is indeed a beautiful fairy.

737
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:38,780
She is a mortal.

738
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:43,780
No.

739
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:44,780
I have something serious to do today.

740
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:46,780
I want to tell you about the sleep shadow.

741
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:47,780
Do you know

742
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:49,780
who fell down the second uncle's sleep shadow?

743
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:52,780
I'm just a little girl.

744
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:53,780
The one who fell down the sleep shadow

745
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:55,780
is the one who was in the front door of the meeting room.

746
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:57,780
And the one who was in the front door of the meeting room is Zheng Xin.

747
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:00,780
So?

748
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:03,780
The one who fell down the sleep shadow is Zhou Xianping.

749
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:05,780
That is, Zhou Li's boss.

750
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:06,780
They are their reliable friends.

751
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:10,780
As long as I can live a year,

752
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:13,780
I can make you die.

753
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:18,780
Zhou Xianping.

754
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:19,780
Zhou Li's boss.

755
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:22,780
I agree.

756
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:24,780
You broke the sleep shadow.

757
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:26,780
You have offended the nurse.

758
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:29,780
You are in the back door.

759
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:31,780
So the things that happened that day

760
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:33,780
were also deliberately done by them.

761
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,780
They were pretending to be in my side.

762
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:37,780
They were making fun of my sister.

763
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:38,780
You are in search of a friend.

764
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:40,780
You are my brother.

765
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:41,780
Cang Lu.

766
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:44,780
By the way,

767
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:45,780
you are looking for me today

768
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:46,780
to say this?

769
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:48,780
Thank you.

770
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:52,780
There is something else.

771
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:56,780
Say it.

772
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:00,780
I didn't get the hang of it.

773
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:02,780
I found Zhou Xianping's clue.

774
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:04,780
But he is a wolf-caught thief.

775
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:07,780
The Golden Tent is afraid of beating the grasshopper.

776
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:09,780
So you put the case in the general.

777
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:11,780
But His Majesty said

778
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:12,780
if I don't finish this case,

779
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:13,780
I can't see it in person.

780
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:15,780
So, Xiqian.

781
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:17,780
I saw you in the Golden Tent.

782
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:18,780
The ones that broke your sleep shadow

783
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:20,780
were all written down.

784
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:23,780
So you want me to help you analyze the case.

785
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:25,780
Okay.

786
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:26,780
I'll listen to it.

787
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:35,780
Sister.

788
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:36,780
What are you looking at?

789
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:38,780
You scared me.

790
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:41,780
Who is that woman?

791
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:43,780
She is a middle-aged woman.

792
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:45,780
She is a private woman.

793
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:47,780
She has a lot of friends.

794
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:50,780
That is the tree master of the Four Heavens.

795
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:52,780
The water master of the Wind and Water Master.

796
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:53,780
Four Heavens?

797
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:55,780
Yes.

798
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:57,780
He is also one of the main officials of the Water Council.

799
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,780
Okay, kid.

800
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:02,780
The girl of the Four Heavens.

801
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:04,780
You should be confident.

802
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:06,780
I think it's not right.

803
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:10,780
How can we fight over the wolf?

804
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:12,780
Ning.

805
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:15,780
You know the tree master of the Four Heavens.

806
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:17,780
He is a student of the Yunlu Academy.

807
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:19,780
With these two relationships,

808
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:21,780
I think as long as we keep our hands on it,

809
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:23,780
they won't touch us.

810
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:27,780
As a group, I am the weak.

811
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:30,780
We don't have the right to be the main official.

812
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:32,780
That's right.

813
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:34,780
When the Shui Yan case happened,

814
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:36,780
I am also a student of the Yunlu Academy.

815
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:38,780
Brother can come back today.

816
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:41,780
It's because the methods of Zhou Li are too low and not reasonable.

817
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:43,780
If Zhou Shi Lang makes a move again,

818
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:44,780
and then the Shui Yan case,

819
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:47,780
he will be able to expand our whole family.

820
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:48,780
By then,

821
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:50,780
the Four Heavens and the Yunlu Academy

822
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:52,780
can be settled for us.

823
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:55,780
What should we do?

824
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:57,780
We should deal with the shui Yan case.

825
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:59,780
We should settle for the Shui Yan case.

826
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:01,780
We should settle for the Shui Yan case.

827
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:04,780
I can think of the first thing.

828
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:07,780
Zhou Shi Lang has a plan behind him.

829
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:08,780
Second,

830
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:13,780
His Majesty is a very subtle person.

831
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:16,780
Cai Wei Guang Yang told me

832
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:18,780
that in the past few decades,

833
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:21,780
the Shui Yan case was suppressed by the emperor.

834
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:23,780
Zhou Shi Lang was the one who did it.

835
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:24,780
Among the ancient ones,

836
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:26,780
the royal family is always equal.

837
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:28,780
His Majesty didn't make a move.

838
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:30,780
Which means this is a fact.

839
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:32,780
It seems that even the Shui Yan case

840
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:33,780
can't be opposed.

841
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:34,780
That's not true.

842
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:35,780
First,

843
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:36,780
why would Zhou Shi Lang

844
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:38,780
make the Shui Yan case?

845
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:39,780
He is definitely not greedy,

846
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:41,780
because he can always be greedy.

847
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:43,780
Right.

848
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:46,780
He doesn't have to stand on the edge of the cable car.

849
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:55,260
Is it because of the money he needs

850
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:58,220
to fill up a well with the money?

851
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:00,380
The reason for filling up this well

852
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:01,980
is because of the police?

853
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:04,380
I understand.

854
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:07,100
So we have to expose him

855
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:09,180
and let the Xingzhou people do nothing.

856
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:11,180
Mr. Qu and Mr. Tun,

857
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:13,740
we are not dealing with Zhou Shilang's plan.

858
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:15,100
What we have to do is

859
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:17,060
burn down Zhou Shilang's fire line.

860
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:19,620
And the fire is getting better and better.

861
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:20,860
Once we step back,

862
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:22,860
we don't need to deal with Zhou Shilang.

863
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:24,940
The official and the new officers

864
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:26,620
have all the new weapons and handguards.

865
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:28,540
We can't deal with them now.

866
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:30,940
But he

867
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:32,940
will have a weakness.

868
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:34,740
Zhou Li.

869
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:35,660
Yes.

870
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:37,300
Compared to Zhou Shilang,

871
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:39,060
he is better at dealing with Wang Ku.

872
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:41,140
If he doesn't meet his quota,

873
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:42,740
we will make a quota

874
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:45,860
and give Zhou Xianping the right to fight.

875
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:48,420
I have the right to fight.

876
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:50,420
Uncle, stop talking nonsense.

877
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:51,780
You have moved your people.

878
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:53,860
Hurry up and investigate Zhou Li.

879
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:55,340
He usually meets someone.

880
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,660
He has a special hobby.

881
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:57,900
He likes to go to any place.

882
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:59,420
He will do everything he wants.

883
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:00,620
Take it from me.

884
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:01,140
Second Brother,

885
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:02,420
go to Yunlu Academy tomorrow.

886
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:04,660
Ask the chief officer to protect the girl in the dressing room.

887
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:05,420
Okay.

888
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:10,340
What about you?

889
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:11,860
Me?

890
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:15,460
I want to make a後果 for my Xu family.

891
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:21,380
This place is modern enough.

892
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:23,460
You've visited the近est store before,

893
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:25,260
you bought it?

894
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,340
Show me.

895
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:31,860
You should be surprised.

896
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:35,500
I've seen many tall gentleman who plays on the range.

897
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:36,300
Sure,

898
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:39,060
speaking of

899
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:42,540
I know how to play한테

900
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:45,660
but specially bad by light.

901
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:48,060
Maybe this is called talent.

902
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:51,140
Great.

903
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:53,100
Only this performance

904
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:55,140
matches my style.

905
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:01,740
If you have any mistakes,

906
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:03,300
please give me a call.

907
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:05,100
Show me.

908
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:18,220
If you have this ability in your life,

909
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:21,220
you will live for many years.

910
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:29,420
Wait.

911
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:33,900
Are your failures

912
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:35,460
in this place?

913
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:36,380
Yes.

914
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:38,660
Please give me a call.

915
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:42,060
Your failures

916
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:43,820
are not because of talent,

917
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:45,260
but because of the temperature.

918
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:46,980
It's not your practice method.

919
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:48,860
The problem is

920
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:50,100
two words.

921
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:52,060
The voltage

922
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:53,740
is a little bit more common.

923
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:55,980
The power of the voltage.

924
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:58,740
The current is the same as the voltage.

925
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:00,820
They are all from the top.

926
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:02,180
They are low.

927
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:08,620
The water in this cup.

928
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:12,780
It won't be a problem

929
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:14,140
for people like this.

930
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:14,820
Right?

931
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:15,740
Right.

932
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:18,180
But if it's a breakthrough,

933
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:19,980
in your life,

934
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:22,300
you will be charged with water.

935
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:23,740
The voltage is broken.

936
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:25,220
You will lose your faith.

937
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:28,060
The current is the same.

938
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:31,060
I call this phenomenon voltage.

939
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:34,220
I see.

940
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:35,900
You are so smart.

941
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:37,020
Are these content

942
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:38,900
also in the secret of the practice?

943
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:40,220
Of course.

944
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:42,380
And the secret of the practice

945
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:43,940
is only from me.

946
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:45,460
Researcher.

947
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:46,620
The last one

948
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:48,060
sent me the book of the four days sword.

949
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:50,180
It's just a book of the Changhai.

950
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:52,020
The secret of the practice

951
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:53,660
is not only a knowledge.

952
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:56,060
There are also many

953
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:57,580
so-called

954
00:41:57,580 --> 00:41:58,860
practice methods.

955
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:04,260
I decide

956
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:05,900
to share the secret of the death

957
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:07,380
to the four days sword.

958
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:09,460
Great.

959
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:12,780
The blue leather book

960
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:13,700
was saved by you.

961
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:14,540
I thank you.

962
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:15,700
But I just

963
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:16,780
helped you to complete

964
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:18,020
the practice of fake sleep.

965
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:19,660
And the knowledge of voltage.

966
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:21,420
These are not free.

967
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:22,580
Remember

968
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:24,540
the principle of the chain metal.

969
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:30,100
Fall.

970
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:31,620
Jump.

971
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:32,900

973
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:37,140
That's the nature.

974
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:38,100
Zhong Kai,

975
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:39,260
how much money do you want?

976
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:41,300
Out of the blue.

977
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:43,020
The chain metal

978
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:45,100
can be used to measure the silver.

979
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:48,940
The most expensive

980
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:50,380
is not money.

981
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:57,700
All ready.

982
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:01,940
Change.

983
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:03,700
Change.

984
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:07,860
Change.

985
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:10,420
Change the silver.

986
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:11,660
My senior.

987
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:13,020

988
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:14,500

989
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:21,780
So these two are...

990
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:22,900
Those two are

991
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:24,420
prepared by the Sword-master.

992
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:26,020
Do you often use knives

993
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:26,820
or swords?

994
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:27,820
Knife.

995
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:30,980
You like knives?

996
00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:41,140
Heh.

997
00:43:57,660 --> 00:43:58,300
Don't be scared.

998
00:43:58,780 --> 00:43:59,660
The Sword-master

999
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:00,540
will send you away.

1000
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:14,620
The will shall never budge

1001
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:20,080
Episode 3

1002
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:11,820
I want to ask you a lot

1003
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:13,620
How many letters are there in the letter?

1004
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:15,700
I remember the letter in the letter

1005
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:16,700
