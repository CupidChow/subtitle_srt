1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm afraid I'll be a little bit late

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm curious what I'm going to do

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I don't want to think about the future

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Let's make this bowl of soup

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Not very solid

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
When you're here

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'll keep the rules

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'll keep my mouth shut

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'll take this big piece of bowl

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
We're strangers

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
We're strangers

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
We're strangers

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
We're part of the family

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
We're part of the family

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Don't go for real

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
We're strangers

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
We're relentlessly

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,160
How

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Is there someone that wants to see my life

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,200
Downright

21
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,200
Don't hold onto the tilted saucepan

22
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,400
Feelliche

23
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:19,500
Every mobile phone Although the marriage is a shot

24
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,000
C'mon

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm a fairy

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Disgusting

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:41,000
The End

28
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
My throat hurts.

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I can't take it.

30
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I can't either.

31
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
My throat hurts.

32
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
It may be a virus.

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
It's a virus.

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
It's a virus.

35
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:16,000
The End

36
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
So the black-haired man

37
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
wants me to be in the body.

38
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
So Feng Quan is right.

39
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Before the magic book was published,

40
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Feng must not be in the world.

41
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
The End

42
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I didn't say it.

43
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
This Wang Shusi

44
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
looks pretty good.

45
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Really.

46
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
He's so good.

47
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
He's so good.

48
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
What are you doing with the knife?

49
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
The magic of the heart.

50
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
We've been talking for so long.

51
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
We've talked about it for a while.

52
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Let's go.

53
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Let's eat.

54
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
How can I talk to you

55
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
and talk to my brother?

56
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Jian Zhou Yan.

57
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Senior,

58
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
is that really the way to go?

59
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Jian Zheng is right.

60
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Staying with him

61
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
is the best way to go.

62
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
The End

63
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Uncle.

64
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
It's getting late.

65
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Go to bed.

66
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Yes.

67
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
It's late.

68
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Go to bed.

69
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Xu Ji An has something for me.

70
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
The magic of the heart belongs to you.

71
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Xu Ji An belongs to me.

72
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
He's already fallen for me.

73
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
When will he fall for me?

74
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I'm just a small person.

75
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
He must have a lot of ways

76
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
to take me away.

77
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
When it comes to sleeping pills,

78
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I'm going to be released.

79
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Do you want to be released first?

80
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Or first?

81
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
The sleeping pills

82
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
and the Zhou Li thing

83
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
that started from the beginning

84
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
are all to make me a criminal?

85
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
You want to release me in the dark?

86
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Xu Ji An

87
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
The End

88
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Master.

89
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
It's my fault.

90
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I didn't bring Xu Ji An in.

91
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I didn't punish you.

92
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I'm a spy in the capital.

93
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
It's not easy to be with the two saints.

94
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Why do you have to be so reckless?

95
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Master.

96
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Let's remember you.

97
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
It's time.

98
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
He will come.

99
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Yes.

100
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
But I've been to Yun Zhou.

101
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I also went back to sleep.

102
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
But the black robe man didn't take me away.

103
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
He just put the sacred book in my body.

104
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Why?

105
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
The black robe man is a senior.

106
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
The only thing I can confirm

107
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
is that he is the spirit master of the Wusheng Sect.

108
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
He told me about the sacred book.

109
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
He wants to fight with the spy

110
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
and bring you out of the capital.

111
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
The spy?

112
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
The black robe man is afraid of the spy.

113
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
The only explanation is after Zhou Li An.

114
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
The black robe man knows that the spy

115
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
has noticed me.

116
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
He has no chance to take me away

117
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
under the eyes of the spy.

118
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
So he put the sacred book in my body

119
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
to kill people.

120
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
In this way,

121
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
everything is reasonable.

122
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
The black robe man wants to take me away.

123
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
And the spy has been protecting me secretly.

124
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
They are not in the police.

125
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
They are in the line of the Wusheng Sect.

126
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
There are many people in the capital.

127
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
And all of this

128
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
is for the weird spirit in my body.

129
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
And this is the secret treasure in the palace.

130
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I don't know where the

131
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
few thieves 19 years ago went.

132
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Xu Qian An.

133
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Why are you in the dark at night?

134
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Are you afraid that

135
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
you will be in big trouble?

136
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
No.

137
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Then what's behind you?

138
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
The secret secret case.

139
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Yes.

140
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
These cases are over.

141
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
What's the secret secret?

142
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Why is the two days of the clothes

143
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
being translated?

144
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
The dog.

145
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Is he watching these old cases?

146
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Not only that.

147
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
He also asked me to

148
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
take out all the related things

149
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
related to the Wusheng Sect.

150
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
He said that someone would investigate it.

151
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I didn't expect it to be you.

152
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Come out.

153
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
What's the matter?

154
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
What's the matter?

155
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Wine?

156
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Tell me.

157
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Wei Gong.

158
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I'm at home.

159
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
No.

160
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
When I was a fast-finger in Chang Le County,

161
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I learned a new drink from a video map.

162
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I used the points of the dice to make a theory.

163
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
The points are small.

164
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Either answer a question,

165
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
or drink a cup of wine.

166
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I want to play this game with Wei Gong.

167
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
If Wei Gong doesn't drink wine,

168
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
he will only say the truth.

169
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
If Wei Gong doesn't want to drink,

170
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
he will drink it now.

171
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
You really want to play?

172
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Yes.

173
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I'll ask the editor first.

174
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Wei Gong.

175
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
What's the relationship between you and Empress?

176
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
You know a lot.

177
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I'll tell you later.

178
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
But it has nothing to do with

179
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
what I'm concerned about.

180
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
But it has nothing to do with

181
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
what I'm concerned about.

182
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Do you remember what happened in the palace

183
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
when the imperial guards were fighting?

184
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
If you want to ask about

185
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
the palace's treasure,

186
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I know that.

187
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
The imperial guards saw the opportunity

188
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
and took away the treasure.

189
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
When we found out that

190
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
he had escaped from the big storm.

191
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
What's the secret treasure?

192
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I think the one who was taken away

193
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
must be the national transport of the big storm.

194
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Are you still playing?

195
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Come.

196
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
It's rare.

197
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
You can ask a question.

198
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Okay.

199
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
What is the national transport?

200
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
In all sizes,

201
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
the one related to the luck

202
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
is the four-day sword and the school.

203
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
The person's luck is only half.

204
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
And the one who is independent from the outside

205
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
represents the capital of the country

206
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
is the national transport of the big storm.

207
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Every time the war begins,

208
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
it begins when the national transport is suspend.

209
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Once the national transport is suspended,

210
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
one step down,

211
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
the national transport is musique.

212
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
The越 a Rock of Gold flag with a high alert,

213
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
the greater the national transport.

214
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
The Yuan wrestler was joined

215
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
by Li Yuan Guan Они By Travel Association,

216
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
but ten figure of soldier aggregates

217
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
move over tens of millions.

218
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
When the kind sword was announced,

219
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,720
was למ�aking the sword soup.

220
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,600
It was no precedent

221
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,400
to shift the intellect-making strategy

222
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,520
of the meidän movement as the Imperial Council

223
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:50,640
chase the ascension of four Qin.

224
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,800
At the command of many descendants

225
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,400
drinks and becomes mute,

226
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,560
she is entangled.

227
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:57,760
Yet the genius continues to wear and go to war.

228
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,840
Your Majesty gave love towind.

229
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,120
Only before injection.

230
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,400
However, theotto,

231
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:14,100
Counseling the retent to succeed the

232
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:17,380
political affairs does that

233
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:22,240
ah

234
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:27,420
we post

235
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,400
I should ask you.

236
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,080
The national seal of Dafeng

237
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,800
is in your body, right?

238
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,320
Not only that,

239
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,600
the seal of the seal

240
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,520
is also in your body.

241
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:08,800
As for Xu Qian's case,

242
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,480
it's all clear.

243
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:15,000
Your Majesty.

244
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:21,760
Keep going.

245
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,600
Don't keep going.

246
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,040
Eunuch Wei.

247
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,040
When I was in Yunzhou,

248
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,800
that demon entered my body.

249
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,200
He came from the heaven,

250
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,560
and his name was Shen Shu.

251
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,840
But he didn't have the past memory.

252
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,680
He was so ignorant about the past.

253
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,760
I also found out

254
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,360
that a man who was black-dressed

255
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,800
suddenly put him in my body.

256
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:45,720
Then...

257
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,040
Then you started investigating this person's identity.

258
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,400
You came to my place to inquire about

259
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,280
the matter of the Li Yuanguan War.

260
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,200
Li Miaozhen's investigation

261
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,560
was known to be the Ministry of Rites.

262
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,720
But there, you found out

263
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,880
that the palace lost its treasure.

264
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,400
And you guessed that

265
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,080
the lost treasure

266
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,680
was related to the demon in your body, right?

267
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:12,200
And what did the winner of the heaven talk to you about?

268
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,880
You were afraid that the black-dressed man

269
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,520
would still be afraid of you.

270
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,960
So you went to the secret library

271
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:23,120
and found out the source of the seal and the evidence of the Zhou Lian.

272
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,600
Then you found out

273
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,640
that I seem to know everything.

274
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,360
Yuweniao,

275
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,080
what must we do now?

276
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,960
You couldn't escape the escape.

277
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,480
You couldn't escape as well.

278
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:48,620
The

279
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,360
Yuweniao,

280
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,920
what were you doing?

281
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,280
My grandpa created everything.

282
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:58,280
You're a person who's important to me.

283
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,520
This kind of medicine.

284
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:07,880
These these integrate the five elements of my mind.

285
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,400
It removes my dead body.

286
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,160
classes three

287
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,760
With a beginner's get used to the effect.

288
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:29,340
Haven't experienced any Kauf

289
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,640
I can guess a few things

290
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,640
by a simple copy.

291
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,640
Before the fight, you came to ask me

292
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:41,640
why the witness sent you to the battle.

293
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,640
I remember I asked you before.

294
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,640
What do you want to say?

295
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,640
I hope you can be honest with me,

296
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,640
but you chose to hide it.

297
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:54,640
Xu Tian,

298
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:58,640
you just believe that the witness won't touch you.

299
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,640
The devil won't kill you.

300
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,640
You believe it all.

301
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,640
The only one who doesn't believe

302
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,640
is me.

303
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,640
What are you doing?

304
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,640
Why don't I believe Wei Gong?

305
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,640
Wei Gong's leg broke my arm.

306
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,640
Come out.

307
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,640
The witness is a god.

308
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,640
I don't believe him.

309
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,640
I don't dare to provoke him.

310
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,640
And the god,

311
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,640
he called me to help him.

312
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,640
Wei Gong, you don't know how powerful he is.

313
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,640
I don't dare to act.

314
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,640
Why don't you tell me?

315
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,640
I told you before.

316
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,640
As long as you don't do anything,

317
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,640
you can't be a criminal.

318
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,640
Wei Gong, I'm sorry.

319
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,640
Don't be angry.

320
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,640
You need to get up first.

321
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,640
You need to get up first.

322
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,640
You're not good to your body.

323
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,640
Wei Gong.

324
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,640
Wei Gong.

325
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,640
Wei Gong.

326
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,640
Wei Gong.

327
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,640
Wei Gong.

328
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,640
I can't go out.

329
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,640
The first step is to stop the cold.

330
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,640
It's okay.

331
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,640
Use the 999 baby medicine.

332
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,640
The baby is a cold.

333
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,640
How many symptoms do you have?

334
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,640
The cold is coming.

335
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,640
Come back soon.

336
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,640
The baby is a cold.

337
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,640
Today is a happy day.

338
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,640
The baby is born.

339
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,640
He's been a baby for a year.

340
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,640
He's a father and a mother.

341
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,640
He's a legend.

342
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:42,640
He wants to be a good brand.

343
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,640
He likes to bring home all the products.

344
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,640
He's a big fan of Hong Yun.

345
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,640
The brand you want.

346
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,640
The price you like.

347
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,640
He brings the products.

348
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,640
Wei Gong.

349
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,640
I have one last question.

350
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,640
The name of the baby is

351
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,640
the person who lost his hair.

352
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,640
The hair will be removed soon.

353
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,640
So no one can remember him.

354
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,640
I've checked his identity.

355
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,640
There's no definition.

356
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:16,640
But the hair is called a genius.

357
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,640
It's not a second-hand number.

358
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,640
If this tree is dangerous,

359
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,640
if it's going to be a big deal,

360
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,640
it will be a big deal.

361
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,640
The 18th person will practice the endless energy.

362
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,640
He will train the soul-striking.

363
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:32,640
You can train the soul-striking.

364
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,640
It's possible.

365
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,640
Second-hand.

366
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,640
Fourth-hand.

367
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,640
Second-hand.

368
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,640
Fourth-hand.

369
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,640
Wei Gong.

370
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:04,640
Is this related to the Jin State?

371
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,640
Are you scared?

372
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,640
Wei Gong.

373
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,640
Don't suspect the witness.

374
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,640
The witness is not far away from you.

375
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,640
He won't harm you for now.

376
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,640
Besides, he and the black-skinned man have been together for a long time.

377
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,640
He has nothing to do with you

378
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,640
when he goes out or takes a move.

379
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,640
What if the emperor

380
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,640
finds out that the state is in my hands?

381
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,640
What will he do?

382
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:34,640
Among the three-sided lovers,

383
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,640
I don't know what to do, right?

384
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,640
That's why you asked me

385
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,640
what the relationship between the Empress and me is.

386
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,640
I just want to know

387
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:46,640
whether I will ignore the Empress

388
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,640
and turn against the emperor for you, right?

389
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,640
So...

390
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,640
Will Wei Gong do it?

391
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,640
So if possible,

392
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,640
I will kill you.

393
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,640
Wei Gong, have a cup of tea.

394
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,640
Get in the car.

395
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,640
I don't want to drink.

396
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,640
Don't think too much.

397
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,640
Keep walking the path that the witness has chosen for you.

398
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,640
During this time,

399
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,640
you must be very careful with your capital and your life.

400
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:22,640
Only then can you become a chess player.

401
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,640
Understand?

402
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,640
Don't worry.

403
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,640
I will help you.

404
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,640
I know that Wei Gong is the best.

405
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,640
Xiao Qi, Xiao Qi.

406
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,640
I made a mistake.

407
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,640
Father,

408
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,640
I have a paper knife.

409
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,640
Greetings, Wei Gong.

410
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,640
Greetings, Eunuch.

411
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,640
Lord Xu is also here.

412
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,640
He is just in time.

413
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,640
Let's take the paper together.

414
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,640
The Emperor's Majesty is here.

415
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,640
Please come in.

416
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,640
Please come in.

417
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,640
Please come in.

418
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,640
Please come in.

419
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,640
Please come in.

420
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,640
Please come in.

421
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,640
Please come in.

422
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,640
Please come in.

423
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,640
Please come in.

424
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,640
Please come in.

425
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,640
Please come in.

426
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,640
Please come in.

427
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,640
Please come in.

428
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,640
Please come in.

429
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,640
Please come in.

430
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,640
Please come in.

431
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,640
Wei Gong.

432
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,640
Please come in.

433
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,640
Your Majesty, I have a message.

434
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,640
After seven days,

435
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,640
Your Highness will follow the investigation team

436
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,640
and go to Chu Zhou together.

437
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,640
Your Highness,

438
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,640
please get ready in advance.

439
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,640
Anything else?

440
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,640
I don't know.

441
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,640
I just want to ask you to come in.

442
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,640
I am not sure.

443
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,640
I don't know.

444
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,640
I just want to ask you to come in.

445
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,640
Anything else?

446
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,640
Just leave.

447
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,640
I finally meet this step.

448
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,640
Your Majesty,

449
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,640
I have a message.

450
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,640
The police has sent a dozen of them

451
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,640
to investigate the blood sample.

452
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:18,720
The

453
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,640
officer is Xu Qian.

454
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,640
Are you sure it's Xu Qian?

455
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,640
I am sure.

456
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,640
I think

457
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:28,640
the police has a clear view on the state.

458
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,640
But the police is so powerful.

459
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,640
They are trying to kill me.

460
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,640
What should we do next?

461
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,640
Please tell me.

462
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:50,640
Everyone, please go to Lang Tao

463
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,640
to see the people.

464
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,640
The chief is a man.

465
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,640
Who is afraid of the emperor?

466
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,640
He is a man who is a man of justice.

467
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,640
These poems are made by students.

468
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,640
If you like them,

469
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,640
you will be happy.

470
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,640
The students are working hard.

471
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,640
I don't know if you like them.

472
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,640
I don't like them.

473
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,640
But this poem

474
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,640
was used

475
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:18,640
a few months ago.

476
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,640
Just this poem.

477
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,640
You changed my book

478
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,640
for several months.

479
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,640
Don't you remember?

480
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,640
Recently, I have been thinking about my health.

481
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:36,640
I am not feeling well.

482
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,640
But don't worry.

483
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,640
When I find out the case,

484
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,640
I will be free

485
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,640
from the family.

486
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,640
I will do my best for you.

487
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,640
Then what are you waiting for?

488
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,640
Go.

489
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,640
Yes.

490
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,640
We have to cut the issue.

491
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,640
We won't send it.

492
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,640
Go.

493
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,640
No.

494
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,640
Doctor.

495
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,640
Doctor.

496
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,640
Doctor.

497
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,640
You two are my legal secretary.

498
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,640
I have been doing my best.

499
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,640
So...

500
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,640
I have been thinking about my health.

501
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,640
So...

502
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,640
My health is not good.

503
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,640
I am not feeling well.

504
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,640
Please go back.

505
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,640
When you come back from Chuzhou,

506
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,640
we will fill up the rest of the books.

507
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,640
No.

508
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,640
You are here.

509
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,640
Okay.

510
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,640
The director of the founding country.

511
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,640
The director of the founding country.

512
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,640
The director of the founding country.

513
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,640
Come with me.

514
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:46,640
I heard you are going to Chuzhou.

515
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,640
To investigate the case.

516
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,640
Aren't you afraid of being punished?

517
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,640
I am afraid.

518
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,640
It seems that I have to go.

519
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,640
You know that.

520
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,640
I was the one who ordered the legal office.

521
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,640
His Majesty has given me the position.

522
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:08,640
Why do I still go to Chuzhou?

523
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,640
The position of the Zijie is not Bai De.

524
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,640
You were just a silver-lover.

525
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,640
You are not qualified to be the chief official.

526
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,640
With this position,

527
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,640
you will have this position.

528
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,640
You can't risk your life.

529
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,640
But this position is dangerous.

530
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,640
It is a little bit late.

531
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,640
I am afraid.

532
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,640
The Wei State has told me.

533
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,640
The reason why this matter is not settled.

534
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:38,640
It is because His Majesty doesn't want to find a government to hold the position.

535
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,640
But the county committee is a silver-lover.

536
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,640
It doesn't exist anymore.

537
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:46,640
But the position of the Zijie is in Chuzhou.

538
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,640
As the chief official,

539
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,640
if you really find out something,

540
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:54,640
it will be the Yangru Lake.

541
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,640
The life and death.

542
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,640
But if I can't find out anything,

543
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:02,640
the people of Dagen will be the innocent and the evil.

544
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,640
They will try to mess up the military.

545
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,640
They will be the state officials.

546
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,640
With this position,

547
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,640
I will be attacked by all sides.

548
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:15,640
Do you have any objections to the Wei State?

549
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:19,640
The only need is to secretly investigate.

550
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,640
After we arrive in Chuzhou,

551
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,640
we can't have any conflicts with the subordinates of the Prince of Zhenbei.

552
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,640
The enemy is weak.

553
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,640
We can protect ourselves.

554
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,640
We can also let the enemy relax.

555
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,640
After we find the evidence,

556
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,640
we will take the people back to the capital.

557
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,640
Wei State is really a member of the imperial court.

558
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,640
It is not easy to be a member of the imperial court.

559
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,640
Today,

560
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,640
Wei State is also a member of the imperial court.

561
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,640
Wei State is also a member of the imperial court.

562
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,640
Wei State is also a member of the imperial court.

563
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,640
Wei State said that

564
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,640
you have something here.

565
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,640
I need it very much.

566
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,640
What is it?

567
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,640
Wei State didn't say it.

568
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,640
But he said that

569
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,640
you will definitely help me.

570
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:16,640
This is a gift for the postman.

571
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:28,640
As the prefect,

572
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,640
hereby announce the military registration.

573
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:35,640
Please leave everything.

574
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,640
Your Majesty,

575
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,640
you will publish a small report

576
00:29:41,640 --> 00:30:09,740
Dignified by millions of people from his newly-ableés

577
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,520
Yes, Your Highness!

578
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,440
Please remain워요ρι

579
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,280
I have an order, Your Highness!

580
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:35,960
I can't let Miss here.

581
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,920
Have you received the order?

582
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:38,760
Thank you.

583
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,240
The book

584
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,920
was sent by the dean.

585
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:00,840
Really?

586
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:02,040
Why did he

587
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,120
send you so many books?

588
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:09,920
Don't count it.

589
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:10,920
Let me see the book.

590
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:11,920
Have you heard of it?

591
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:12,920
What's the name?

592
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,920
The Great Huang Shigu?

593
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:20,920
I don't know.

594
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:22,920
I don't have the qualification

595
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:24,920
or the opportunity

596
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:26,920
to enter the Yasheng Hall.

597
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:33,920
But

598
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:34,920
I don't know

599
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:36,920
what's going on.

600
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:38,920
I read the dean's mind

601
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,920
and I know the origin of the book.

602
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:43,920
What's the meaning of it?

603
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,920
The book was sent by Sitenjian

604
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:47,920
20 years ago.

605
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:49,920
Since it was sent,

606
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,920
it has been in Yasheng Hall.

607
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:52,920
It hasn't been changed yet.

608
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:55,920
Sitenjian?

609
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:57,920
Sitenjian again?

610
00:31:58,920 --> 00:31:59,920
What's wrong?

611
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:02,920
Nothing.

612
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:06,920
I still can't understand.

613
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:08,920
Why did the dean

614
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:09,920
send you so many books?

615
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:14,920
Are you really going to read it here?

616
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:15,920
Aren't you hungry?

617
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:16,920
Don't fight.

618
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:19,920
Xijiu.

619
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:20,920
Go home.

620
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:21,920
What's the name of this book?

621
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:25,920
I don't know.

622
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:26,920
Aren't you a scholar?

623
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:28,920
I don't know.

624
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:39,920
Go.

625
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:41,920
Kill the sheep and eat it.

626
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:08,920
Go.

627
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:38,920
Go.

628
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:08,920
Go.

629
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:38,920
Go.

630
00:34:58,920 --> 00:34:59,920
Hold on.

631
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:00,920
Come on.

632
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:01,920
Let me see.

633
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:02,920
Give me a hand.

634
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:03,920
Give me a hand.

635
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:06,920
Hurry up.

636
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:07,920
You carry it.

637
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:17,920
Princess, take it.

638
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:24,920
Princess,

639
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:25,920
the weather is clear today.

640
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,920
It's the perfect day for the football.

641
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,920
It's been a long day.

642
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:32,920
Right.

643
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:34,920
Then,

644
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:36,920
I'll give you the ball.

645
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:37,920
The high one.

646
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,920
You can't push me to the outside of the palace.

647
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:41,920
Of course.

648
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:43,920
You can't.

649
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:44,920
Princess,

650
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:46,920
you'll endure it for two more days.

651
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:47,920
When the time comes,

652
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:48,920
I'll see you're good.

653
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:50,920
Of course, I'll be able to solve your problem.

654
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:53,920
That's so annoying.

655
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:55,920
Where's Xu Jia?

656
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:56,920
Where did he go?

657
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:57,920
Why didn't he come to look for me?

658
00:35:58,920 --> 00:35:59,920
Maybe,

659
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:01,920
maybe,

660
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,920
he's busy with the affairs of the palace.

661
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:03,920
Maybe,

662
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,920
he's looking for something.

663
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:06,920
He's not happy.

664
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:07,920
Xuan Zi,

665
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:08,920
didn't I ask you to go to the beach?

666
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:09,920
Tell me.

667
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:12,920
Princess,

668
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,920
Lord Xu goes to the beach every day

669
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:15,920
to pick up the cat from the door.

670
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:16,920
He only went to the Yunlu Academy

671
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:17,920
some days ago.

672
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,920
He went to the Four Heavens to see her yesterday.

673
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,920
What's the matter with you?

674
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:23,920
Where's Jin Rui?

675
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:24,920
Jin Rui...

676
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:27,920
Jin Rui...

677
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:28,920
Jin Rui...

678
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:29,920
Jin Rui...

679
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:33,920
Jin Rui is a troublemaker.

680
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:34,920
What?

681
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:36,920
He's a troublemaker.

682
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:37,920
He didn't come to look for me.

683
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:39,920
Please, Your Highness.

684
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:42,920
Princess,

685
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:43,920
maybe,

686
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:44,920
a troublemaker

687
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,920
is also part of Lord Xu's investigation.

688
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:47,920
Let's not think too much.

689
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,920
Let's continue to play the ball.

690
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:00,920
Prince,

691
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:03,920
since you were five years old,

692
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,920
it's been eleven years.

693
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:11,920
It's been eleven years.

694
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:13,920
We've been together for a long time.

695
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:15,920
We've been in the same heart and same mind.

696
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:18,920
I don't know you well.

697
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:22,920
You'll be in trouble if you're nervous.

698
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:26,920
Maybe,

699
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,920
it's too hot.

700
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:31,920
You'll be in trouble if you lie.

701
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:37,920
To be honest,

702
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:39,920
where's Xu Qian?

703
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:42,920
Hurry up.

704
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:43,920
Okay, Lord Xu.

705
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:47,920
Clean up.

706
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:48,920
Everything is in order.

707
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:49,920
Yes.

708
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:58,920
Remember what I said.

709
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,920
Everything in Chuzhou is in order.

710
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:02,920
In the future,

711
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:03,920
the name of your flying family

712
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:04,920
shouldn't be difficult, right?

713
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:06,920
I know.

714
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:07,920
I know.

715
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:08,920
I'm the one who's going to do it.

716
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,920
It's like you sent me money.

717
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:12,920
If it goes well,

718
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:14,920
you'll help me.

719
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:15,920
I'll owe you a favor.

720
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:17,920
How can I contact you when we're in Chuzhou?

721
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:21,920
I've already given you the money.

722
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:23,920
I've already given you the money.

723
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:24,920
I don't know if I can get it.

724
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:25,920
I don't know.

725
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:26,920
I've already given you this.

726
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:35,920
I'm leaving.

727
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:36,920
Lord Xu, you're so happy.

728
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:37,920
I'm waiting for you at home.

729
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:40,920
It's a fair way.

730
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:43,920
This time,

731
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:44,920
you're in charge of the business.

732
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:45,920
You owe me nothing.

733
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:47,920
Then see you in Chuzhou.

734
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:50,920
By the way,

735
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,920
don't call me a flying woman.

736
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:53,920
You're so stupid.

737
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:54,920
You're so stupid.

738
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:55,920
Are you leaving?

739
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:57,920
Let's go.

740
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:03,920
Drink less on the way.

741
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:04,920
Don't get into trouble.

742
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:05,920
I'm really so stupid.

743
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:22,920
Everyone, go back.

744
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:24,920
The boat is leaving.

745
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:25,920
I have to go on the boat.

746
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,920
Shen Shen, I don't have the ingredients.

747
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:35,920
I'm not in good shape recently.

748
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:36,920
I can't eat it even if I wear it.

749
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,920
But I have a recipe.

750
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,920
The boat is equipped with a refrigerator.

751
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,920
Pack it up and it's dangerous.

752
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:51,920
What's that?

753
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:55,920
A husheng suit?

754
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:57,920
Who?

755
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:58,920
Take it.

756
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:01,920
By the way,

757
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:02,920
I'll buy you

758
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:03,920
the specialty of Chuzhou,

759
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:04,920
the yellow-yellow jade.

760
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,920
Little Dou Ding.

761
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:10,920
Are you leaving?

762
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:11,920
Do you miss me?

763
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,920
Brother, when are you coming back?

764
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,920
I'll be back when you're done with the flute.

765
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,920
Brother, I can't come back.

766
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:20,920
I can't come back.

767
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:23,920
Don't hush me.

768
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:25,920
You.

769
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:27,920
Be careful.

770
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,920
Don't be like the previous time.

771
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,920
Last time, you were so deep.

772
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:35,920
You were so full of food and water.

773
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,920
You almost got through it.

774
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:39,920
Who got through it?

775
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,920
It's impossible.

776
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:46,920
Be careful on the way.

777
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,920
Write a letter to report to the security.

778
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:52,920
Do you hear me?

779
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,920
Don't worry, Mr. Xia.

780
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:06,920
And you.

781
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:08,920
I won't talk much.

782
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,920
Just drink with your sister.

783
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,920
I'll be waiting for you to drink.

784
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:14,920
Brother, you're so stubborn.

785
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,920
Why do you go anywhere?

786
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:18,920
I'm serious.

787
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:20,920
I wish you a smooth trip.

788
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:21,920
I won't go anywhere.

789
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,920
We'll wait for you to choose.

790
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:24,920
Look.

791
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,920
You're not as good as a girl.

792
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:27,920
Exactly.

793
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,920
Brother, you even said that

794
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,920
Princess Ling'an is in the palace.

795
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,920
Will you go with her?

796
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:42,920
You're so much more than that.

797
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:46,920
All right.

798
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:48,920
Bye.

799
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:02,920
Bye.

800
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:17,920
Bye.

801
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:48,920
Will they eat here?

802
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:50,920
Hurry up and come back other wards.

803
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:51,920
Wait a minute!

804
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,920
Why are you allowing yourself?

805
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:13,580
The wind is

806
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:14,620
A good brand

807
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:16,540
All the family members are ready

808
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:17,580
It's not suitable to eat

809
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:18,820
It's not suitable to eat

810
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:19,660
The last time we held a party

811
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:20,740
We were all in the street red

812
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:21,740
The brand you want

813
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:22,700
The price you like

814
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:23,940
All in the party

815
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:26,740
The flowers in the garden

816
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:28,580
And the road under the road

817
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:30,820
Time grows

818
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:33,980
The wind blows in the night

819
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:35,820
The line is made of spring tea

820
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:38,140
Where are the people who write the script

821
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:41,300
The starlight is cutting through the window

822
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:43,180
The head sounds us

823
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:45,540
The moon is smiling

824
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:50,540
The time we spent together

825
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:54,780
The melting of time becomes a poem

826
00:43:56,580 --> 00:43:58,180
Time is flying

827
00:43:58,180 --> 00:44:00,260
The wind blows in the night

828
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:03,860
The door is open and the wind blows in the night

829
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:05,940
The wind blows in the night

830
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:09,060
The line is made of spring tea

831
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:11,100
Where are the people who write the script

832
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:12,740
The time is flying

833
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:14,780
The wind blows in the night

834
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:16,980
The line is made of spring tea

835
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:18,740
Where are the people who write the script

836
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:20,700
The line is made of spring tea

837
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:25,180
Where are the people who write the script

838
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:28,860
The line is made of spring tea

839
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:35,860
The flowers in the garden

840
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:37,700
And the road under the road

841
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:40,060
Time grows

842
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:43,100
The wind blows in the night

843
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:44,940
The line is made of spring tea

844
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:47,180
Where are the people who write the script

845
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:50,380
The starlight is cutting through the window

846
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:52,300
The head sounds us

847
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:54,700
The moon is smiling

848
00:44:55,820 --> 00:44:59,540
The time we spent together

849
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:03,660
The melting of time becomes a poem

850
00:45:05,660 --> 00:45:07,300
Time is flying

851
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:09,340
The wind blows in the night

852
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:13,260
The door is open and the wind blows in the night

853
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:15,100
The wind blows in the night

854
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:18,100
The line is made of spring tea

855
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:20,020
Where are the people who write the script

856
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:22,500
The time spreads

857
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:23,900
The wind blows in the night

858
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:27,700
The line is made of spring tea

859
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:31,220
Where are the people who write the script

860
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:34,100
The line is made of spring tea

861
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:36,300
The world is lost

862
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:38,500
The wind blows in the night

863
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:41,500
I'm not afraid of tears or wind

864
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:43,500
Mountains and rivers are far away

865
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:44,500
Mountains and rivers are far away

866
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:45,500
Mountains and rivers are far away

867
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:46,500
Mountains and rivers are far away

868
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:47,500
Mountains and rivers are far away

869
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:48,500
Mountains and rivers are far away

870
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:49,500
Mountains and rivers are far away

871
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:50,500
Mountains and rivers are far away

872
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:51,500
Mountains and rivers are far away

873
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:52,500
