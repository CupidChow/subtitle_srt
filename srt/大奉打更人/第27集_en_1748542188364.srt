1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm a lonely person

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Someone is approaching me

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm so lonely

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I can't hold my hands

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I can't see how many hearts are sold

6
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm afraid that I might die

7
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm afraid that I might die

8
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm afraid that I might die

9
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm afraid that I might die

10
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm afraid that I might die

11
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm afraid that I might die

12
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm afraid that I might die

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm afraid that I might die

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm afraid that I might die

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm afraid that I might die

16
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm afraid that I might die

17
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm afraid that I might die

18
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Episode 6

19
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Come on.

20
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,200
Come on.

21
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,440
I'll assist you to trim your hair.

22
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,840
This is from Cui Huanyan.

23
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:58,980
This is what I came for.

24
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,820
Cheers, Xiaowen.

25
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,700
Fang Immortal呀.

26
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:20,700
I'm also a fan of Haoran's political power.

27
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:23,700
Well said.

28
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:28,700
I'm very cautious about your good news.

29
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:32,700
I didn't expect that there is such a thing in the capital.

30
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,700
We have ten stars today.

31
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:35,700
Come.

32
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:36,700
Come.

33
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:46,700
Don't fall.

34
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:53,260
It seems that the bear's

35
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:56,700
and the snake's venom are not common.

36
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,700
How can it be as good as my weapon?

37
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:00,700
You have good eyes.

38
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,700
The so-called bear sword is hidden in the jade.

39
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:05,700
The snake's weapon is a hundred years old.

40
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:09,700
It has been preserved for ten years.

41
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,700
It was not released in the past.

42
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:15,700
It's a sword weapon.

43
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:16,700
Yes.

44
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,700
I have not seen a sword for ten years.

45
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:19,700
I can't fight or fight.

46
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:20,700
I can't fight.

47
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,700
I have been working with the weapons and resources.

48
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,700
I only wait for the day when the sword is out of the war.

49
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:30,700
Why are you so annoying?

50
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:33,700
The whole world is talking about a convenience.

51
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:38,700
Is there another option for the bear's sword?

52
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,700
I'm afraid that I will fall.

53
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:45,700
It's really different.

54
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:48,700
The bear sword has been preserved for ten years.

55
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,700
I think this sword is not responsible for the war.

56
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,700
It's responsible for the war.

57
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,700
It must be useful one day.

58
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:57,700
I have a plan with someone.

59
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,700
This sword is prepared for the internal people.

60
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,700
This person must be the one who doesn't set the map.

61
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:05,700
Then I will live in the bear's house.

62
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:06,700
I will do whatever I want.

63
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:07,700
I will kill the enemy.

64
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:08,700
I will do whatever I want.

65
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:09,700
I will kill the enemy.

66
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,700
Miss Cheng, you are so beautiful.

67
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:17,700
You look like a real man.

68
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:20,700
Good acting.

69
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,700
This sword is made by Tianyu.

70
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,700
It's sharp and sharp.

71
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,700
Even if it's a four-point sword,

72
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,700
it can't be easily broken.

73
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:33,700
To be honest,

74
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,700
I'm also practicing martial arts.

75
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:39,700
I just want to fight with the enemy one day.

76
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:42,700
You are so brave.

77
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,700
You don't know the enemy.

78
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:45,700
Don't think too much.

79
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:46,700
I'll take your word for it.

80
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:53,700
This is the sword and my gun.

81
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,700
They are so weak.

82
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:56,700
It's hard.

83
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,700
But I have a bad idea.

84
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,700
We can make a mistake.

85
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:03,700
I will make a decision.

86
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:04,700
I will make a decision.

87
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:08,700
Cixiu, are you too exaggerated?

88
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:09,700
The gold is big.

89
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,700
It's so easy to make a mistake.

90
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:17,700
Brother, hold the line.

91
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:18,700
Don't let go of your hand.

92
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:19,700
I'll be right back.

93
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,700
You are so worried about your brother.

94
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,700
You are the most worried about him.

95
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:24,700
Don't go.

96
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:30,700
Shi Xian.

97
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:32,700
Princess.

98
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:35,700
Why are you here?

99
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:35,700
I want to write a letter for you.

100
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:06,700
Princess.

101
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:08,700
Princess.

102
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:13,700
Miss.

103
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:14,700
There are so many lights.

104
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:15,700
Come and see.

105
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:16,700
Lights?

106
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:18,700
Snowy wolf.

107
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:21,700
Miss, come here.

108
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:30,700
But it's not her style to be so arrogant.

109
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,700
I'm afraid that she will be angry.

110
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:35,700
Miss.

111
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:36,700
Look.

112
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:37,700
There are words.

113
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:38,700
Miss, you are right.

114
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:39,700
It's not Xiquiao.

115
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:41,700
It's you and Mr. Xu.

116
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:42,700
It's a love affair.

117
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,700
So many lights.

118
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:48,700
You said she should miss you so much.

119
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,700
She must be so eager to

120
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,700
make up for the time she missed.

121
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:53,700
It's annoying.

122
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:54,700
You girl.

123
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,700
You are so funny.

124
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:06,700
You are so...

125
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:10,700
Brother.

126
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,700
Brother.

127
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:16,700
Why are you here?

128
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:19,700
Princess.

129
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,700
Who do you think it is?

130
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:25,700
I don't know.

131
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,700
Why am I here?

132
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,700
Why did I come back?

133
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:30,700
I remember.

134
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:32,700
I remember.

135
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:33,700
I remember.

136
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,700
I went to the Xu's Mansion.

137
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:39,700
I think I met Xu Qian.

138
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,700
Mr. Xu sent you back.

139
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:46,700
Really?

140
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:47,700
She didn't die.

141
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:48,700
Yes.

142
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,700
Mr. Xu ate the silk sword

143
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:51,700
and gave it to Tuotai Bay.

144
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:52,700
He was so upset.

145
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:53,700
He escaped.

146
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,700
I thought I was going to give it to you.

147
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:57,700
That's great.

148
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:58,700
That's great.

149
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:00,700
I want to run away.

150
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:01,700
Princess.

151
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:03,700
Don't be so excited.

152
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,700
The doctor said you are too tired.

153
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,700
If you are too emotional,

154
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,700
you will be like last night.

155
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:10,700
You will be in a coma.

156
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:11,700
I will be in a coma last night.

157
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:16,700
Mr. Xu.

158
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,700
What's wrong with you?

159
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:19,700
It's nothing.

160
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:20,700
I've seen the doctor.

161
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,700
You just have to rest for two days.

162
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:32,700
What's wrong?

163
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:51,700
Mr. Xu.

164
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,700
I will hold you up.

165
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,700
Put it down.

166
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:55,700
Then hold you up again.

167
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:56,700
Put it down again.

168
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:57,700
Then hold you up again.

169
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:58,700
Put it down again.

170
00:09:58,700 --> 00:09:59,700
Then hold you up again.

171
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,700
Put it down.

172
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:01,700
Put it down.

173
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:04,700
The point is

174
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,700
no matter what,

175
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:07,700
you can't hold it.

176
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:08,700
At this time,

177
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,700
Mr. Xu thought of a trick.

178
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,700
He changed himself to me.

179
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:13,700
That's why he escaped.

180
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,700
I was...

181
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,700
I was too tired.

182
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,700
I was too tired to hold it.

183
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:31,700
That's why I did this.

184
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,700
I didn't have other reasons.

185
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,700
Princess, you are awake.

186
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,700
The bottle is pulled down.

187
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,700
Why is the bottle still here?

188
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,700
Mr. Xu said he would wait for you to wake up and leave.

189
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,700
He stayed in the guest room last night.

190
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:47,700
He is dead.

191
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,700
I heard the princess's voice just now.

192
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,700
Did Mr. Xu hear it wrong?

193
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,700
The princess has been sleeping.

194
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,700
I was awake too.

195
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,700
Fine.

196
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,700
I've upgraded the chicken and rice recipe recently.

197
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,700
You should keep the dishes.

198
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,700
When the princess is asleep,

199
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,700
she will be in a bad mood.

200
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:14,700
What's the sound?

201
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:19,700
No sound.

202
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,700
Did Mr. Xu forget the sound?

203
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:24,700
Mr. Xu,

204
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,700
you are busy with your work.

205
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,700
You should take more rest.

206
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:30,700
Thank you for your concern.

207
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:31,700
By the way,

208
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,700
is it convenient for you to stay here?

209
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,700
I have something to ask you.

210
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:36,700
It's convenient.

211
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:40,700
It's convenient.

212
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,700
I mean,

213
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:43,700
Mr. Xu,

214
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,700
can you say something to her?

215
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:49,700
Fine.

216
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:53,700
The princess has gone to the far away place.

217
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:54,700
When did she come back?

218
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:56,700
The princess has been...

219
00:11:58,700 --> 00:11:59,700
The princess...

220
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:02,700
The princess came back a few days ago.

221
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:06,700
Since she came back,

222
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:07,700
why didn't she summon me?

223
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:09,700
Besides,

224
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:10,700
I thought about it last night.

225
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:11,700
I didn't even think about it.

226
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,700
Why did the princess

227
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,700
have a long and dirty look last night?

228
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,700
She didn't even have a hairpin.

229
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,700
The princess is not because...

230
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:25,700
Because...

231
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:27,700
Because...

232
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:29,700
The princess is lost.

233
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,700
She also met a bunch of bandits.

234
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:35,700
Bans?

235
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:36,700
Yes.

236
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,700
The bandits are so cruel.

237
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,700
They know how to bully people.

238
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:44,700
The princess has been running for three streets.

239
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,700
Fortunately, the princess is rich and big.

240
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:47,700
She is brave and kind.

241
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,700
That's why she lost her memory.

242
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:51,700
She found Xu Zhai.

243
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:53,700
No wonder...

244
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,700
I ran up when the princess saw me.

245
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,700
Did the bandits catch her?

246
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:01,700
Don't worry, Mr. Xu.

247
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:03,700
The bandits have already been defeated.

248
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:07,700
That's good.

249
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:10,700
I thought...

250
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,700
The princess must have been shocked.

251
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:20,700
What did you think?

252
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:23,700
Nothing.

253
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:25,700
The princess is fine.

254
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:26,700
I have something to do.

255
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:27,700
I'm leaving.

256
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,700
The princess is coming to tell me.

257
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,700
Mr. Xu, take care.

258
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,700
Princess, Mr. Xu is gone.

259
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:44,700
How can you let him go?

260
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:46,700
No, no.

261
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,700
You...

262
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,700
You just asked about the importance.

263
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,700
I'll take him back.

264
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:52,700
Okay.

265
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:53,700
He's gone.

266
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:00,700
The princess is awake.

267
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:04,700
What's the matter, Mr. Xu?

268
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,700
I heard her voice just now.

269
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:11,700
The princess...

270
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,700
The princess didn't wake up.

271
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:17,700
Okay.

272
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:18,700
I forgot to tell you.

273
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,700
This chicken essence is made from natural ingredients.

274
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:22,700
It's also good for the mood.

275
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:23,700
Use it as soon as possible.

276
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:25,700
Please tell me.

277
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:27,700
Don't worry, Mr. Xu.

278
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:29,700
I'm leaving.

279
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:37,700
Princess,

280
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,700
since Mr. Xu is back,

281
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:40,700
why don't you ask him?

282
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:42,700
You...

283
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,700
You're a chicken.

284
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:46,700
But...

285
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:49,700
I can't ask him this kind of thing.

286
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,700
Can you be quiet?

287
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,700
You've already sung four songs.

288
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,700
Don't worry about me.

289
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,700
Your friend won't come today, right?

290
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:19,700
He'll definitely come.

291
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:17,700
Xu Lang!

292
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:21,700
Si Mu!

293
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,700
Si Mu, I'm coming!

294
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,700
Xu Lang!

295
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,700
Where are the people who wrote the lyrics?

296
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:48,700
It's sweet.

297
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:12,700
Si Mu!

298
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:14,700
Xu Lang!

299
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,700
We're running on the wrong foot!

300
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:24,700
You only hate me!

301
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:26,700
You're far away.

302
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,700
You're afraid of your family!

303
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,700
You're a big man!

304
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,700
Love is the source of creation.

305
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:40,700
But the second brother is the master.

306
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,380
and down here,

307
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:06,380
Where is he?

308
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:08,560
Mu

309
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:14,700
Shi Lang, we are running on the bridge again.

310
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,700
The bridge is opposite to the army.

311
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:24,700
Shi Lang has crossed the Wanchong Mountain.

312
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:30,700
Si Mo, don't move.

313
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,700
I'll go find you.

314
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:42,700
Si Mo.

315
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:43,700
Shi Lang.

316
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:01,700
Miss Wang, don't call me Shi Lang.

317
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,700
We don't have any manners.

318
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:06,700
Okay.

319
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,700
Mr. Xu.

320
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:11,700
What's the matter, Mr. Xu?

321
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:12,700
Nothing.

322
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,700
You have been asking me out for two days.

323
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:18,700
There must be something.

324
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,700
I'll see if you can keep me.

325
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,700
Since there's nothing,

326
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,700
I'll take my leave.

327
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:28,700
Mr. Xu, I'll see you later.

328
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:41,700
You said you wanted to leave.

329
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,700
You're not going to leave.

330
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,700
You don't want to leave.

331
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,700
Are you looking at me?

332
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:53,700
Miss, you're a little boring.

333
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:05,700
You're so mean.

334
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,700
You're so mean.

335
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,700
Miss, please stay.

336
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:11,700
You are...

337
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:14,700
I'm Xu Qi'an, the eldest brother of Xu Ci.

338
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:17,700
Xu Qi'an, the eldest brother of Xu family.

339
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,700
He grew up with Xu Lang.

340
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:22,700
Although he's a brother, he's still a brother.

341
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,700
If he gets into a fight,

342
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,700
he might be a breakthrough.

343
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:30,700
Brother Xu, I've heard about your name.

344
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:33,700
You're the youngest and most handsome one in the family.

345
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,700
The sensation of the good.

346
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:38,700
You deserve the next goal.

347
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,700
You're so old and photographic.

348
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:42,700
The rings have piled all the time.

349
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,700
How would she react to all these?

350
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,700
See you in 언 monument meeting.

351
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,700
It's clearly your year's work.

352
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:52,700
I can't think of anything.

353
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,700
You're so sweet.

354
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,700
Second brother.

355
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,700
The short-witted girl has way more height than you.

356
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,700
Today is not a несort meeting.

357
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,700
Since it's Xu Jia's fault,

358
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,700
I'll do my best to help her.

359
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,700
Thank you, Miss.

360
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:10,700
I should go to the Ministry of Rites to review the case.

361
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:13,700
The letter says you have a way.

362
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,700
I see.

363
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,700
I do have a way to go to the Ministry of Rites.

364
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,700
It's just...

365
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,700
I just learned it from the book.

366
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:25,700
I'm afraid I can't find the information you need.

367
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,700
I've lost my brother's key.

368
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,700
I'm in a hurry.

369
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,700
You went to the door.

370
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,700
You just came and went.

371
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:36,700
It depends on whether you can get on the road.

372
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:38,700
I definitely can.

373
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,700
Miss Song is indeed a problem.

374
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:42,700
I want to clean up the situation,

375
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,700
but it's not convenient to break through

376
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,700
the identity of Naihe and Dagen.

377
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,700
What should I do?

378
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:51,700
How about this?

379
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,700
Please go with me.

380
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,700
What do you think of the neighborhood?

381
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:01,700
That's good.

382
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,700
Thank you for your help.

383
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:05,700
I'll do my best.

384
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:08,700
I'll go to the Ministry of Rites to review the case.

385
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,700
I don't want to see my father.

386
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:13,700
I'll ask Mr. Xu to come to the Ministry of Rites

387
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,700
to look for me tomorrow.

388
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,700
Take care.

389
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:24,700
Xiaoxi, let's go.

390
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,700
Where's he?

391
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:36,700
Where's he?

392
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:38,700
He's gone.

393
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,700
You...

394
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:54,700
I'll be back.

395
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,700
I'll be back.

396
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:03,700
Xiaoxi, where are you going?

397
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,700
Let's go.

398
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,700
I'm just going to look for you.

399
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,700
I'm going to look for you.

400
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,700
Xiaoxi, where are you?

401
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,700
I'm going to the Ministry of Rites to review the case.

402
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:16,700
I'm going to the Ministry of Rites to review the case.

403
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:18,700
I'm going to look for you.

404
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:20,700
Xiaoxi.

405
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:21,580
Slow down.

406
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:22,580
What are you doing?

407
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:23,860
Sorry, I'm sorry.

408
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:24,620
I'm sorry.

409
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:27,180
Second Brother, enough.

410
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:28,500
It's a bit too much.

411
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:29,580
Brother, you go home first.

412
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:29,940
I have something to say.

413
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:30,620
Don't follow me.

414
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:32,100
It's almost done.

415
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:33,300
I'm leaving.

416
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:35,420
Why are you doing this to me?

417
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,700
I'm watching you fall down

418
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:38,860
and come to care about you.

419
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:40,380
Why do you think I'm a tourist?

420
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:44,460
Boss, I'm sorry.

421
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:50,380
You're singing a song.

422
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:52,420
I like it when I'm straight.

423
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:54,500
I'm so heartless.

424
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:57,260
I'm not as good as a person.

425
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:59,020
Do you have such a problem with the students?

426
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:00,820
Brother, what do you know?

427
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:03,860
I'm like the sky and the earth to her.

428
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:05,140
No way.

429
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:07,340
Why do you want to be a bandit?

430
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:09,220
Even if you can't do it,

431
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:11,740
I'm the one who's going to fight and win.

432
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:14,100
At the same time, I can help you

433
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:15,260
to recognize the two princesses.

434
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:18,260
What's your problem?

435
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,300
Compared to her father,

436
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,620
she's just a little girl.

437
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:22,100
That's too much.

438
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:25,300
What does her father make her for?

439
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:27,180
You're soมot botany.

440
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,540
As the second general,

441
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:34,460
as such the head of the famous

442
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:41,660
Second old man,

443
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:43,060
catch him.

444
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:49,940
Yuan Xiong was saying something important to you.

445
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:55,700
Duke Cao and you are in the military field.

446
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,700
And this and this.

447
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:58,700
All of these.

448
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:03,700
I can't see your books today.

449
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:05,700
Wang Zhenwen.

450
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:12,700
How many years have you been a cabinet secretary?

451
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:14,700
I don't know.

452
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:22,700
Father.

453
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:25,700
I heard Duke Cao's attack on the imperial court this time.

454
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:29,700
It seems that even if the king doesn't fall, he will be defeated.

455
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:34,700
However, we can't stop these crimes.

456
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,700
It's so interesting.

457
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:40,700
This year, the King's Manor has been in danger.

458
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:42,700
A few days ago, the imperial court was in a state of emergency.

459
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,700
It hit the emperor.

460
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:47,700
The emperor was beaten by the emperor and was in the police.

461
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,700
It's the emperor's idea.

462
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:52,700
Why didn't you recommend the emperor to the imperial court?

463
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:53,700
The king has been defeated recently.

464
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:54,700
No one will be defeated.

465
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:58,700
It seems that you think the king is the best.

466
00:25:58,700 --> 00:25:59,700
Of course.

467
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:07,700
Xiaorou.

468
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:14,700
Remember that a familiar opponent is better than an unknown enemy.

469
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:16,700
Take it.

470
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:49,700
Your Majesty.

471
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,700
Ling'an is in a state of emergency.

472
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:57,700
The princess is in a coma.

473
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,700
She is worried about me.

474
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:04,700
Please punish me for my crime.

475
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:07,700
Mother, please don't get angry.

476
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:09,700
Ling'an was just angry because of the emperor.

477
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,700
That's why she is worried about me.

478
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:13,700
She has a strong heart.

479
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:14,700
Now...

480
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,700
Now she is back safely.

481
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:17,540
Go out.

482
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:18,420
Mother!

483
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:19,420
Go out!

484
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:40,420
Thanks to youreen filler.

485
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,820
I shall extend my punishment!

486
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,160
entrevival.

487
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:47,980
Master has a met florist.

488
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:49,980
Can you see her?

489
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:14,420
We've take a step back.

490
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:15,460
Ok.

491
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:19,980
Come on, get up

492
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:48,660
Since you were enfant,

493
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,340
what did you do?

494
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:51,980
I —

495
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:55,340
sedate Wang Jiali.

496
00:28:58,460 --> 00:28:59,260
I said —

497
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:02,940
do what you see and say.

498
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:12,100
Sit down.

499
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:20,280
Well, I have managed to save the good fortune,

500
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:26,980
but Xi Warrior has allowed the people to search for anyone.

501
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:28,900
And I learned that

502
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:32,340
the growth of software isropolitan in China.

503
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,420
Marshalimun comes toüll

504
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:43,000
and prepares it for Xi Warrior.

505
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:45,640
So it means

506
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:48,640
I was so polite to you.

507
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,640
I was so polite to you.

508
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,640
I was so polite to you.

509
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,640
But a few days later,

510
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,640
the fire started to burn.

511
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,640
But what I wanted to know

512
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,640
was that

513
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,640
I was afraid that you would be like Pingyang.

514
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,640
But you wouldn't.

515
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,640
All these years,

516
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,640
I was so worried.

517
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:36,640
I was so worried about your brother.

518
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:42,640
I was so worried about you.

519
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,640
But then,

520
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:49,640
I found out that you lost the most important thing.

521
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,640
No.

522
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,640
You were very good.

523
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,640
I was not good.

524
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,640
I was so good at hiding things.

525
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:14,640
I didn't know anything.

526
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,640
I was so worried about you.

527
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,640
Mother is at the harem.

528
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,640
I know that.

529
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,640
But in the East Palace,

530
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,640
I know that too.

531
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,640
I know that.

532
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,800
I don't know.

533
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,840
We have grown up.

534
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,440
We are all good.

535
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,360
Mother, you don't know

536
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,440
I went to the mountain and water all the way here.

537
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,560
I went to the wind and rain.

538
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,160
I went to many places

539
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,760
and met many interesting things.

540
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,000
I went to the desert.

541
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,360
I saw the moon and the mute under the night.

542
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,560
I also saw the ice-cream of the thousand-year-old.

543
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,880
It was dangerous and many people.

544
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,240
But fortunately, I met many good people.

545
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,800
I solved it one by one.

546
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,400
Princess Yu said that

547
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,120
I have the world.

548
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:24,160
But I think it's Pingyang who is crying in the dark.

549
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,320
Xu Qian said that

550
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:33,280
it's better to read a thousand books than to write a thousand gifts.

551
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,240
It's a lot of travel.

552
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,240
I'm not a good person

553
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,360
but I dare to live a happy life.

554
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,280
My life is not only in the big city of the wind.

555
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,320
There is also the world of the bitter.

556
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,080
I know nothing about the world.

557
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,280
I'm just a person.

558
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:51,920
I'm just a person.

559
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,920
If I didn't know Xu Qian's death,

560
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,160
I would be so angry and afraid to go back.

561
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:08,080
Xu Qian.

562
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:11,700
As you decreases your train of thought,

563

564
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:26,660
Sister,

565
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,960
Xia Clear,

566
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,000
here's the question.

567
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,400
What is the interpretation of thiscrimeology?

568
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:40,280
I can't you I can't

569
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,640

Yes, the lady went to theunto

zucchini

574
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,600
Teacher

575
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:23,120
in the cold

576
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:24,960
a ci icon

577
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:26,600
I was not cold

578
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,560
Are you feverish

579
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,360
I went to open the window for you

580
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:34,680
I am not

581
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:40,660
I wanted to say

582
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:46,100
丁 room

583
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:47,940
It's okay

584
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:50,100
Make it

585
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:52,000
It tastes more stronger

586
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,620
but it's actually stronger

587
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:58,340
Like delicious

588
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:00,120
Dali

589
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,040
I love

590
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:04,400
you

591
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,260
No

592
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:07,760
I...

593
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,320
I'm not hungry.

594
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:13,600
Miss Wang,

595
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,120
we said before that

596
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:16,880
we're still...

597
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:17,840
I know.

598
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,320
It's not suitable for you.

599
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,120
Mr. Xu.

600
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,720
It's really not suitable for you.

601
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,880
You're really a fool.

602
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,280
Mr. Xu,

603
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,000
you're so annoying.

604
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,680
Do you want to rest for a while?

605
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,120
I...

606
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,280
Mr. Xu.

607
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:06,800
You...

608
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:08,680
I...

609
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,520
Su Mo.

610
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,600
Father, why are you here?

611
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:26,640
Who is this?

612
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:28,920
This...

613
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:32,800
This is my new suit.

614
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,440
I'm here to see you.

615
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,280
I heard you're Xu Xin Zi.

616
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,400
It seems like you're not dreaming.

617
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,120
Did I say anything?

618
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,160
Xu Xin Ni.

619
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:58,240
Miss.

620
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:59,360
Zi Shu.

621
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,160
Don't be a disciple.

622
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,480
Don't come near the door of the Ministry of Rites.

623
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,400
Hurry up and get Miss back.

624
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,320
Who's this kid?

625
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,520
Big brother.

626
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:23,960
Big brother.

627
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:26,960
Is this your little heart?

628
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,560
You're asking more than big brother's head.

629
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:35,280
I heard my parents' little heart yesterday.

630
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:40,040
But no one calls me little heart.

631
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:45,000
Because you're not a little heart.

632
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:47,480
Then what kind of heart am I?

633
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:48,680
You're...

634
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,080
The wind-tower.

635
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,360
The wind-tower?

636
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:53,560
The wind-tower?

637
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,560
It should be not suitable.

638
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,040
By the way, did you see your second brother?

639
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,440
I saw him.

640
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,480
My brother.

641
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,960
Now I'm back.

642
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,000
What's wrong?

643
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,240
Have you been to the Ministry of Rites?

644
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,000
Miss Wang.

645
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,280
Where's Xu Lang?

646
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,240
Inside.

647
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,760
What's wrong?

648
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,520
He was humiliated today.

649
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:29,440
He said he would never step into the Ministry of Rites again.

650
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,000
I'm going to see him.

651
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:33,480
Xu Lang is so lucky.

652
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,000
I'm really worried about him.

653
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,440
Sorry, big brother.

654
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:37,360
No problem.

655
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:38,840
Have fun.

656
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:44,160
Sister Kailan.

657
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,120
Good girl.

658
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:48,880
Can you tell me where your parents are?

659
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,200
Sister is so delicious.

660
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,040
It's all yours.

661
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,200
Over there.

662
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,440
Let's go find them.

663
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:00,920
Brother Yang.

664
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,200
You still don't understand?

665
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,200
Zhiz Ing,

666
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,240
Senior.

667
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,680
Xu Qian.

668
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:12,600
Apologize to you.

669
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:14,520
I shouldn't have.

670
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,640
It was your call.

671
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,920
I lost my schoolmaid's face.

672
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,680
Rehguruing.

673
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:24,000
My grandmother has died.

674
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,520
Now I'm aめた少.

675
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:29,340
I need to say alone.

676
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,840
This matter is not that serious.

677
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:34,600
It's just that we were kicked out of the Ministry of Rites.

678
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:37,720
A few days later, we naturally forgot.

679
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:39,360
But...

680
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:42,160
That's right!

681
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,640
I believe in you.

682
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:49,160
Although you were kicked out today,

683
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:52,760
you will surely be able to

684
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:55,840
step into the Ministry of Rites with your own abilities.

685
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,600
You are a scholar.

686
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,400
You are a beautiful woman.

687
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,400
You are a wise man.

688
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,680
Even Wang Zhenwen should be proud of you.

689
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,000
Sun,

690
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,960
you can't just be so selfish.

691
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:10,320
If you have a long and short life,

692
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:13,920
you should be sad about the 22nd.

693
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:23,240
I thought that you are already a natural.

694
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:25,400
But I found out that

695
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:28,360
he only inherited your five silver coins

696
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:30,640
and your three beautiful hair.

697
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:35,880
You are so naive.

698
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:36,880
You are so...

699
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:39,320
I said I am so naive.

700
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:45,800
They don't know that this matter can't be blamed on them.

701
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,280
Miss Wang.

702
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,800
Miss Wang, I am sorry.

703
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:50,920
I just saw you.

704
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:54,080
Don't mention how sad you are.

705
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:55,280
I know.

706
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,600
I haven't asked you about your character.

707
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,040
That's right.

708
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:02,120
How does our uncle look like?

709
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:04,040
I am his roommate.

710
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:06,920
Madam, you can call me Si Mu.

711
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:08,120
Si Mu?

712
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:09,600
That's so nice of you.

713
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,960
Although the school is small,

714
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:14,120
the wealth is not as small as the neighborhood.

715
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:16,520
Even the fortune-telling is antique.

716
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:18,800
It seems that I am not good at hiding.

717
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,600
Luckily, I have prepared it.

718
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,080
I almost forgot.

719
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:25,280
I prepared some gifts for you.

720
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,680
I hope you can have fun.

721
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:28,680
You are so polite.

722
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:29,920
No need.

723
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:30,920
Thank you.

724
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:36,120
Madam, this set is for you.

725
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:44,120
This...

726
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:45,440
This is too expensive.

727
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,680
I can't accept it.

728
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:49,120
Compared to your status and temperament,

729
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:51,440
how can it be considered expensive?

730
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,840
I drew it for you.

731
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,600
I will ask the craftsman to make it for me.

732
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,640
I hope you can like it.

733
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:00,120
You drew it yourself?

734
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:04,440
This is so beautiful.

735
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,240
Good.

736
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:10,880
It seems that the housewife is a simple woman.

737
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,040
Miss Wang,

738
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:17,320
how can you say that you are so generous?

739
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:22,720
Madam, this set is made by Master Zhidao Gu Huanzhen.

740
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,520
Gu Huanzhen?

741
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:27,920
Didn't you already retire from the forest?

742
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:28,920
Yes.

743
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:30,720
I visited him three times.

744
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,920
He finally got moved by my sincerity.

745
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:35,320
That's why I am willing to go out to the mountains to make this set.

746
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:37,120
You must spend a lot of money on it.

747
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:38,120
Indeed.

748
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:41,320
This future Eunuch is a famous martial arts master.

749
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:43,520
It's not difficult to get along.

750
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,320
The set is so beautiful.

751
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:46,320
It's not difficult.

752
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:49,320
