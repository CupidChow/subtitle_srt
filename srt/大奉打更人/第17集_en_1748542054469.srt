00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The End

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:07,600
Mom,

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,400
didn't you give that bracelet to Wang Yi?

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:13,600
Your dad said I brought it when I married him.

5
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,040
I kept it when I was in prison.

6
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,200
I can't keep it.

7
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,400
It's more precious than my life.

8
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,000
Did you have a chance to get it?

9
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:23,800
I didn't this time.

10
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,000
You know it.

11
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,800
Dad thinks he has no use.

12
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,400
He owes us.

13
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,600
Where is he?

14
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,200
Who sent you here?

15
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,400
No one.

16
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,600
No one.

17
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,600
My dad was on the way.

18
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,400
He was on the way.

19
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,400
He's still in the corner.

20
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,800
No corner.

21
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,400
I won't say it.

22
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,000
Did you hit him?

23
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,000
No.

24
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,000
Did you hit him?

25
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:57,800
No.

26
00:00:58,800 --> 00:00:59,800
Did he hit you?

27
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:01,400
No.

28
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,400
Did he hit you?

29
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,400
No.

30
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:10,800
Sir.

31
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,400
Please forgive me.

32
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,400
You are so stubborn.

33
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,000
No, I'm not.

34
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,200
Did you hurt me?

35
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,400
No.

36
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,000
I didn't hurt you.

37
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I didn't hurt you.

38
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,400
I said everything.

39
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,400
I was so stubborn.

40
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,400
I was so stubborn.

41
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,000
I was so stubborn.

42
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,400
I was so stubborn.

43
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,200
I was so stubborn.

44
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,200
I was so stubborn.

45
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:37,600
No.

46
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,000
You can't say it.

47
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,400
I'm afraid he's not good to me.

48
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,400
So stubborn?

49
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,600
Is it the same Luo Jin Luo or Jin Luo?

50
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,400
No.

51
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,200
Sir.

52
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,400
I was just kidding.

53
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,400
Kidding?

54
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,400
You're dead.

55
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,600
What?

56
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,800
You fainted again.

57
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Oh, no.

58
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,200
I'm fine.

59
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,600
I'm so stupid.

60
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,200
I'm not brave anymore.

61
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,600
You're an old man.

62
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,600
I'm not old.

63
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I like you.

64
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,600
You're stubborn.

65
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,600
You're an old man.

66
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:28,800
No, no.

67
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I'm not old.

68
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,200
Say it.

69
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,400
Is it the same Luo Guo?

70
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:35,600
Yes.

71
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,200
To be honest, I'm Luo Guo.

72
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,200
I ate a bowl of noodles in the yard.

73
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,200
I was so angry.

74
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,200
I was wrong.

75
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,000
I changed my mind.

76
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,400
I never went out of the yard.

77
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,200
Sir, please forgive me.

78
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,920
Did you forget it?

79
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,400
Pardon me?

80
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,720
You did?

81
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,800
Subst하세요.

82
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,960

No.

84
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,560
What is the number of satettenings?

85
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,200
One year, four coats are one hour in.

86
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,460
My Sally goes to the ge gelecek Bosca.

87
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:19,160
I don't drink, garlic and beer.

88
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,160
Clear trees,by the Quang Meng moon.

89
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:22,700
I picked the leaves

90
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:26,940
and got in the hot spring

91
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,680
Yes

00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:31,780

00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:39,500

00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,960

00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,720
Right!

97
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:57,840
Eunuch Wei!

98
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,500
What do you want?

99
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,560
Is this the decree of His Majesty?

100
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,880
Xu Xin is in danger.

101
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,700
Threatening.

102
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,680
Your Majesty's posture

103
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,260
is characterless.

104
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,320
It's because you wear the courtesy.

105
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,160
You may leave now.

106
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:56,960

I'll do them by chance.

111
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,800
From now on,

112
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,560
I'll go and meet Imperial Escort Master.

113
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,880

00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,440

I know what this is.

135
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:03,580
Your mission is to find out who is the one

136
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:05,980
who destroyed Yongzheng Mountain and River Temple.

137
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,540
As for whether this thing exists

138
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:11,820
or not, it has nothing to do with you.

139
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:16,140

Hang in there.

Where are we going?

175
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:26,540
To the scene

176
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:58,540
The scene is full of bombings

177
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:00,540
The temple is full of bombings

178
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:02,540
The body of the refugees is full of bombings

179
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:04,540
No one has ever been here since then

180
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:10,540
It seems that there is no clue on the roof

181
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:22,540
From that night, he has been working on the wall

182
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:28,540
Use the¡¯s

00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:31,540

00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:14,540
Have a safe trip

187
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:38,540
Hey, Boss Jiang

188
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:40,540
Are you OK?

189
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:43,420
You don't have to wait for so long.

190
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:45,700
This is like a new kind of spiritual mirror.

191
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:49,340
Maybe it's because I'm doing it every day.

192
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:51,300
It's not bad.

193
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,780
Nan, do you think you can find something?

194
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:56,740
The bottom of the lake is well-plated.

195
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:58,700
The high-street point is at the top.

196
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:02,060
It means that the explosion point is in the temple, not under the water.

197
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:05,180
This fire should be secretly hidden in the temple.

198
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:08,500
The bottom of the lake has a circle of stone-shaped domes.

199
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,900
It's like a word with a shell.

200
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:13,340
Probably...

201
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:15,260
Probably like this.

202
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:30,180
This shape seems to be a heaven.

203
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:32,740
It's a heaven.

204
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:35,740
Not only that,

205
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:37,380
the stone-shaped domes around the ground

206
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:40,140
are arranged according to certain rules.

207
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:43,300
The way this line-up comes in

208
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,780
must be the formation.

209
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:51,380
What if it's in Dafeng Capital that the line-up goes wrong?

210
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:53,820
It must be the sea of heaven.

211
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:56,060
I think so.

212
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:59,220
It should be forever.

213
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:03,000
Mister Sun, Emissary Chen.

214
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,060
How is the investigation?

215
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:09,340
Eunuch Hui,

216
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:36,700
I compressará conform cultivation cooperation

217
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:38,100
all of them were sacrificed.

218
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,300
All the dead bodies of the dead

219
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,300
were killed in one piece.

220
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,900
They were all drained.

221
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,900
There were no other wounds on them.

222
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,300
According to our speculation,

223
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,900
this method

224
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:50,100
must be a decisive move.

225
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,900
You know the decisive move again.

226
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:54,500
It's more complicated.

227
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:55,900
Report!

228
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,500
Minister.

229
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,100
That Dage is still outside.

230
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,500
He said that he's given the emperor's life

231
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,700
and that he must be sent to the Ministry of Human Rights.

232
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:03,300
Mr. Hong.

233
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:03,900
Yes.

234
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:04,700
Minister!

235
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,300
What's going on with the Ministry of Public Affairs?

236
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,500
There's a problem with the Ministry of Public Affairs.

237
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,900
But there's a problem with the people in Guangxiang.

238
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,300
Let's go.

239
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:12,700
Let's go.

240
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,500
The Ministry of Public Affairs is conferring a case.

241
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,700
An executive is promoted to the Ministry of Public Affairs.

242
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:18,900
The person who works here

243
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,300
should be executed.

244
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,100
The Ministry of Public Affairs is in place.

245
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:28,900
No matter how many people are waiting,

246
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:29,900
they can't get off the train.

247
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,500
miles away

248
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:40,680
não

249
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,680
The monster has stayed!

250
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:46,640
Die!

251
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,780
Yan

252
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:03,820
brother

253
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:05,600
brother

254
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:06,920
Director.

255
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:09,680
Before!

256
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,860
funky people

257
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,940
non- [( Subaru mask has his brand new name.))]

258
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:47,660
No describe thesescreams

259
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:49,900
Is there any problem

260
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,740
Am I in trouble?

261
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:53,760
To me, we are all living beings

262
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:57,920
Even if I don't roar it, they won't fear me

263
00:16:58,580 --> 00:16:59,560
Get out

264
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:07,000
Actually it's only He

265
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:10,660
Bei

266
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:11,660
Uncle

267
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,040
Zhang

268
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,580
what happened

269
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:15,740
The Big Butcher

270
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,960
They've pushed in

271
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,500
Waited to hurt our guys

272
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,840
How bold and serious

273
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,460
I Xu Xi'en

274
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,320
God

275
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:46,560
Mirandaadhara

276
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:53,600
Wait

277
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:55,720
How can they get one

278
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,800
Peter

279
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,780
Keep that resurgence over

280
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:02,780
and send X Imperial En Palm.

281
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:04,140
I don't regret every single day.

282
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:22,940
There is nothing

283
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:26,400
to do it.

284
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,920
You have a few brains

285
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,360
I'll do the case that the Ministry of Justice can't do

286
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:35,400
I'll do the case that the Ministry of Justice can't kill

287
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,040
And

288
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,920
If the Ministry of Justice dares to stop me from doing the case

289
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,840
I'll do it with the Ministry of Justice

290
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,520
Is it clear enough?

291
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:55,800
Xu Jie'er

292
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:57,920
Is it clear enough?

293
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:00,600
No

294
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,000
Gosh

295
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,600
Are you all right?

296
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,240
an official,

297
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,120
a entrance in Polit manifested by the Emperor,

298
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,600
and allowed him to avenge hisurdies.

299
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,760
Prince of Qin is a democratic official.

300
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,000
Well, you made all the big-assembled leaders

301
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,080
come here,

302
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,640
and it's really a quick time

303
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,760
for me to travel once more

304
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,440
to talk together with you.

305
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,480
Sit down.

306
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,040
Xu Qian!

307
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,320
Make a seat too.

308
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,520
Go

309
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,080
Hey

310
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,600
Good-bye

311
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:04,720
I hate calling you

312
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:14,920
Your gold medal

313
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,840
Go

314
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,560
Be careful

315
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,600
Master Xu.

316
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,600
Are you done?

317
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,600
This man

318
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,600
sent a bunch of colleagues

319
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,600
to investigate.

320
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,600
It's called a joke.

321
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,600
Since you've finished talking,

322
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,600
I'll just talk to you

323
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,600
casually.

324
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,600
According to the推測 of Master Sun,

325
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,600
I have a few questions.

326
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,600
I've been to Sangbo Lake this morning.

327
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,600
I want to take back Yongzheng Mountain river temple.

328
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,600
The fire quality needs to be extremely high.

329
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,600
Yes.

330
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,600
Is there any problem?

331
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,600
The problem is coming.

332
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,600
Master Shang Shu just said

333
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,600
that the prevention measures of fire

334
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,600
are extremely strict.

335
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,600
He wants to extract the fire from the public.

336
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,600
It's very difficult.

337
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,600
He also needs to remove the traces of the corresponding.

338
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,600
What kind of person

339
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,600
do you think can do this?

340
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:28,600
Master Shang Shu and two men.

341
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,600
So, Master Shang Shu and two men

342
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,600
are the same.

343
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,600
Then it's reasonable.

344
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,600
It's just...

345
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,600
Is it too stupid?

346
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,600
What do you mean?

347
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,600
If you want to extract

348
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,600
such a large amount of fire,

349
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,600
even if your hands and feet are clean,

350
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,600
you will still have to think about it.

351
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,600
You will still have to think about it.

352
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,600
You will still have to think about it.

353
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,600
According to my opinion,

354
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,600
this is just the way to extract the fire.

355
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,600
Let's not think that the fire is coming from the public.

356
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,600
It's the core of the investigation.

357
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,600
Let the real thief

358
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,600
take the time to escape the capital.

359
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,600
Except for the public,

360
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:11,600
how can you extract such a large amount of fire?

361
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,600
Is it possible that

362
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,600
it's from the outside?

363
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,600
Such a dangerous fire,

364
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,600
you are so stupid.

365
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,600
Don't say that.

366
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,600
The internal city's market is full of goods

367
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:25,600
that will be checked by all the people.

368
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,600
The yellow city is more strict.

369
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,600
If you want to extract it,

370
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,600
there is no way that it's possible.

371
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,600
Fire is not only in the city.

372
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,600
What about the raw materials?

373
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,600
Yes.

374
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,600
If it's just raw materials,

375
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,600
the soldiers in the capital

376
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,600
don't know what they are using.

377
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,600
They don't know anything about it.

378
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,600
If you want me to do it,

379
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,600
you can do it.

380
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,600
Look.

381
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,600
The raw materials.

382
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,600
The raw materials I want

383
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,600
are wood, charcoal,

384
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,600
and sulfur.

385
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,600
They are all normal things.

386
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,600
Another thing is

387
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,600
that it's strictly controlled by the wind.

388
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,600
It's a waste.

389
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,600
It's a waste.

390
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,600
The big yellow city.

391
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,600
The head.

392
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,600
Take the route apart.

393
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,600
We just analyzed

394
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,600
from the big yellow city to the outside city,

395
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,600
the inner city.

396
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,600
Because the transport is raw materials,

397
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,600
they can be controlled by the wind.

398
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,600
The next is the most important

399
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,600
yellow city.

400
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,600
Mr. Yang,

401
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,600
everyone.

402
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,600
There is still something to do.

403
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,600
I'll leave first.

404
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,600
Miss Caiwei,

405
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,600
let's go together.

406
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,600
Everyone,

407
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,600
goodbye.

408
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,600
I...

409
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,600
Miss Caiwei,

410
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,600
I...

411
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,600
I...

412
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,600
Where are we going, sir?

413
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,320
The

414
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:47,920
transport is to

415
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,640
destroy the

416
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,600
Yellow City in the big yellow city.

417
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,600
The fire is to blow back Yongzheng Mountain and River Temple.

418
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,600
And the wind is to blow the lake.

419
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,600
And the fire is to help them

420
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,600
move into the inner city of Sangbo.

421
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,600
It should be a person

422
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,600
who can get out of the yellow city freely.

423
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,600
A person who can get out of the yellow city freely.

424
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,600
Jin Wei.

425
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,600
The day before the big event

426
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,600
happened,

427
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,600
there was a small flag.

428
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,600
Before Liu Hanzhi was killed,

429
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,600
he was in charge.

430
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,600
Liu Hanzhi is a small flag.

431
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,600
He can

432
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,600
hide the fire from the Yellow City

433
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,600
in the upper level.

434
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,600
Unless he is the one

435
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:20,800
who is only

436
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,600
stealing the fire,

437
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,600
it's his reward.

438
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,600
After the matter is done,

439
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,600
he will kill his target.

440
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,600
You are so thoughtful.

441
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,600
You remember it?

442
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,600
His upper level...

443
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,600
Zhou Baihuo,

444
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,600
I ask you,

445
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,600
is Liu Han your subordinate?

446
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,600
Yes.

447
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,600
Does he have any

448
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,600
abnormal behavior recently?

449
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:41,600
No.

450
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,600
He is just like the internet.

451
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,600
Is he suspicious

452
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,600
during the yellow city?

453
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,600
Or is he just like the internet?

454
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,600
No.

455
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,600
Five hundred guards,

456
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,600
Zhou Baihuo.

457
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,600
Wait.

458
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,600
I asked him.

459
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,600
He didn't lie.

460
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,600
He may use some means.

461
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,600
Let's find the person first.

462
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,600
Okay.

463
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,600
Take my token

464
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,600
and go to the east gate of the yellow city.

465
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,600
Take the Zhou's hand.

466
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,600
Be quick.

467
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,600
You have to rush to the front.

468
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,600
Yes.

469
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,600
You guys, follow me.

470
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,600
Go.

471
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,600
Take the rest of them to the Zhou's house.

472
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,600
Take the prisoners.

473
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,600
Yes.

474
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,600
Chen,

475
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,600
where are they?

476
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,600
What's the big deal?

477
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,600
What's the big deal?

478
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,600
Chen,

479
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,600
do you know

480
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,600
what they are talking about?

481
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,600
I know.

482
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,600
The case before the Golden Court

483
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,600
was reported by the Golden Court.

484
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,600
I don't know

485
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,600
what they are talking about.

486
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,600
I don't know.

487
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,600
Juedong,

488
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,600
go and get the Juedong.

489
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,600
Okay.

490
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,600
Pig brain, come here.

491
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,600
Sir,

492
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,600
go and get it.

493
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,600
Be careful.

494
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,600
Yes.

495
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,600
Are you crazy?

496
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,600
Hurry up.

497
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,600
The fire is about to start.

498
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,600
It's coming.

499
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,600
Open the door.

500
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,600
Let's go.

501
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,600
The old man is sick.

502
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,600
He's not well.

503
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,600
Please go back.

504
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,600
Two people,

505
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,600
guard the door.

506
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,600
Other people,

507
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,600
shoot.

508
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,600
Yes.

509
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,600
Sir,

510
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,600
why don't you shoot?

511
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,600
Why don't you shoot?

512
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,600
You've seen

513
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,600
the Emperor's reign in the Linyuanguang State.

514
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,600
You were just in the Ministry of Justice.

515
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,600
That's called a human being.

516
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,600
Human being?

517
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,600
Try to create

518
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,600
a man who is

519
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,600
as blind as a knife.

520
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,600
With such a human being,

521
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,600
they want to

522
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,600
attack again.

523
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,600
They have to try.

524
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,600
Mr. Xu.

525
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,600
The front door is closed.

526
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,600
No one is here.

527
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,600
The things in the manor

528
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,600
have been moved away.

529
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,600
The other cities are all finished.

530
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,600
Zhao Shixiong.

531
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,600
The White Tiger Master

532
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,600
took his wife

533
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,600
and Young Master

534
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,600
to wake up.

535
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,600
Aren't you sick?

536
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,600
The White Tiger Master

537
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,600
has been

538
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,600
a little bit of a trick.

539
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,600
When?

540
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,600
A few days ago.

541
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,600
The ceremony was held.

542
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,600
The day after.

543
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,600
Sir,

544
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,600
the White Tiger Master

545
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,600
committed a crime.

546
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,600
I...

547
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,600
I don't know.

548
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:11,600
I don't know.

549
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,600
Let's go.

550
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,600
Zhou Shixiong is gone.

551
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,600
It's too early

552
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,600
to talk about this now.

553
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,600
Those who know Hmong

554
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:05,600
Wang Gui starts to live in the house.

555
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,600
I still can't think of anything else

556
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,600
except the Ranhe Pavilion.

557
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,160
I've already covered your hands.

558
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,760
How about you all take the third time and search for it?

559
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,440
My Lord.

560
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,680
Zhou Baihu didn't bring the emperor here.

561
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,920
He invited Chengjia after the memorial service.

562
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,320
He escaped?

563
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,600
It's good that he's dead.

564
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,920
It's good that he escaped.

565
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:36,320
This clue is broken.

566
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,920
My Lord, go!

567
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,600
He kidnapped his brother.

568
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,800
Brothers!

569
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:51,880
Retreat!

570
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:52,720
Yes!

571
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,480
Thief!

572
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,280
Where's Mr. Cheng?

573
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,320
Are you still in there?

574
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:11,600
I heard that His Majesty asked you to investigate Sang Bo case.

575
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:13,360
Yes.

576
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:14,360
What's wrong?

577
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:16,880
This case...

578
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,160
You can't investigate it.

579
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,960
I'm responsible for the investigation.

580
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:26,080
I'm not responsible for the big truth behind it.

581
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,520
You can try it.

582
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,920
After all, your brother is guilty.

583
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,520
So, what did you investigate?

584
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,800
The thief did investigate it.

585
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,320
He escaped.

586
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:39,440
He ran away.

587
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,080
So you...

588
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:45,520
No way.

589
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,320
You can run away too.

590
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,960
I just came out of the prison.

591
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,640
I didn't sleep in the room.

592
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:56,520
Besides,

593
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,920
there's no one outside.

594
00:30:59,040 --> 00:30:59,960
Where can I escape?

595
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:03,960
No way.

596
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:05,440
Then whatever what?

597
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:09,400
You can become the one who overhears the truth.

598
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:15,360
Do you explanation?

599
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:16,640
I did that.

600
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,200
Return to Yunzhou.

601
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:23,880
Yunzhou?

602
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,960
If you need to be a threat to His Majesty being in justice,

603
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:27,440
if my prolonged─

604
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,400
desires are your second kong,

605
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,320
nobody will love you orLY

606
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,040
then they far far 不要擁抱我Adذا Bugün halfway to their democracy.

607
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,000
To betray Buddhism.

608
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:32,920
The Consumer eats mind scourge.

609
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:35,920
The three tribes of Zhahui are the leaders of the whole sect.

610
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,920
The three tribes of Zhu Lian.

611
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:41,920
No matter where he runs, the court will not let him go.

612
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:45,920
If you are Zhou Baihu, where will you run?

613
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:47,920
Brother, you really think it's good?

614
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,920
It's Yunzhou.

615
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,920
Slow down.

616
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,920
What's going on?

617
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,920
Why are you locked up in the prison?

618
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,920
It's for Ningye.

619
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,920
For Ningye?

620
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:21,920
Yes.

621
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,920
For Ningye.

622
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,920
As long as I can save her,

623
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:30,920
I will live a life without any problems.

624
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:33,920
Madam, please take my knife.

625
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:37,920
I promised my father that I would give him the right to live.

626
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,920
Second uncle.

627
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,920
Ningye.

628
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,920
Why are you here?

629
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:56,920
I came back after you left.

630
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:58,920
It's okay.

631
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:01,920
Your Majesty ordered that you take the crown prince's position and bring him the most important case.

632
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,920
It's okay for now.

633
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:05,920
Yes, it's okay.

634
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:06,920
It's your turn.

635
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:08,920
It's your turn.

636
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:10,920
Go and get some rest.

637
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:12,920
Okay, okay.

638
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,920
You should go to bed early today.

639
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,920
It's okay.

640
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,920
It's okay.

641
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,920
It's okay.

642
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:34,920
It's okay.

643
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,920
It's okay.

644
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:43,920
Your Majesty.

645
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:46,920
The thief broke into the funeral house and burned back the Yongzhun Mountain and Temple.

646
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,920
He was the son of Feng.

647
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:51,920
As the leader of the Dage Clan,

648
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,920
the guard of the imperial city, Huang Cheng Buzhou,

649
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,920
is hard to save.

650
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:57,920
I ask Your Majesty to take this matter into consideration.

651
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,920
I will do my best to help you.

652
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,920
I will do my best.

653
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,920
I will do my best.

654
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,920
I will do my best.

655
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:09,920
Wei Yuan, you always come to the inn.

656
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:12,920
You are always busy with your work.

657
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:16,920
You should not be responsible for your work.

658
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:19,920
I will go back.

659
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:23,920
Your Majesty.

660
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,920
The worker Xu Xi'an

661
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,920
is at the door of my office.

662
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,920
He hurt the guard and killed Huang Quan.

663
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,920
I ask Your Majesty to punish him.

664
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,920
I will do my best.

665
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:39,920
Your Majesty.

666
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:42,920
The guard of the office is the one who is responsible for the crime.

667
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,920
He is very considerate.

668
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:49,920
I suspect that the guard's uncle and the thief are colluding with each other to ruin the funeral house.

669
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:52,920
Please put this matter into the prison.

670
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,920
I will interrogate it.

671
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,920
I will do my best.

672
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,920
I will do my best.

673
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,920
I will do my best.

674
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,920
I will do my best.

675
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:05,920
Wei Yuan, you are a vile man.

676
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,920
You should be punished.

677
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,920
Your Majesty, there is a big problem in the Ministry of Justice.

678
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:13,920
I will do my best to cut off the duty of the officials.

679
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,920
You are a criminal.

680
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,920
Brother Xu Xi'an, you still do not admit your crime.

681
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,920
You dare to act in the court and kill the emperor.

682
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,920
You are a vile man.

683
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:22,920
You are a vile man.

684
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,920
Brother Xu Xi'an.

685
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:45,920
It is the most important thing to punish Xu Xi'an.

686
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:50,920
It is difficult to avoid the consequences of the crime.

687
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:58,920
When you are not the one who is responsible for the crime,

688
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:01,920
you should not be a vile man.

689
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:06,920
Next time, I will not be responsible for the crime.

690
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,920
From now on,

691
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,920
we will remove the seal of the city gate.

692
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:17,920
The imperial court will be closed for more than six days.

693
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,920
We will not leave the capital.

694
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,920
We will leave the court.

695
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,920
We will leave the court!

696
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:27,920
We will send Your Majesty away!

697
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,920
Wei Gong! Wei Gong!

698
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,920
Please stay.

699
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,920
Wei Gong.

700
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,920
This is our Teng Chao.

701
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,920
Please take it back and take a look.

702
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,920
Thank you, Eunuch.

703
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,920
Next time, I will ask Eunuch Xiao Zhuo to come.

704
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,920
Uncle.

705
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,920
Uncle.

706
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,920
Uncle.

707
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,920
What are you laughing at?

708
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,920
I thought Your Majesty would be in trouble today.

709
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:25,920
I didn't expect that you would pass the trial smoothly.

710
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,920
Pass the trial smoothly?

711
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,920
No one is going to attack you.

712
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,920
It's been only a day since the trial.

713
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,920
I have this kind of feeling.

714
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,920
It's indeed a good thing to do.

715
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,920
A good thing to do?

716
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,920
Is this a wedding?

717
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,920
You are so lucky.

718
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:57,920
You have picked up such a good girl.

719
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:00,920
It's a pity that you are late.

720
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:06,920
I have already interrogated the county magistrate of Taikang.

721
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,920
They have already reported it.

722
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,920
He said that he didn't collude with the Kuizu.

723
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,920
I forgot that he was angry.

724
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,920
Then, did you interrogate the head of the county magistrate?

725
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,920
The number of the exorcism can only be verified.

726
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,920
But he won't be able to talk about this.

727
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,920
I have no choice.

728
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:27,920
It's okay. I will teach him to be honest.

729
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,920
Please come with me.

730
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,920
What is your name?

731
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:37,920
I am Zhang Shun from Yunlu Academy.

732
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,920
Okay.

733
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,920
I will tell our teacher at the beginning.

734
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,920
There is an old man named Zhang Shun from Yunlu Academy.

735
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:48,920
He said that he was more angry than he forgot.

736
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:51,920
I will let our teacher talk to your dean.

737
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:54,920
No need. We all have our own common sense.

738
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,920
This is it.

739
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,920
Wake up. There is a question.

740
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,920
What about you? Are you angry?

741
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:11,920
No need.

742
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:16,920
It's the same whether he cooperates or not.

743
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,920
The holy man is pregnant.

744
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,920
The man is a man.

745
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,920
The skin is dry.

746
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,920
The fire is so strong.

747
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,920
No.

748
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,920
Open the door.

749
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,920
It's broken.

750
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,920
It's broken.
