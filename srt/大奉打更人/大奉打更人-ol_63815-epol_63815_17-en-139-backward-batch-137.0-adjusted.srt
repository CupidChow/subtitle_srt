40
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,110
Mother,

41
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:47,670
didn't you give the bracelet
to Ms. Wang?

42
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,880
Your father said I brought it with me
when I married him.

43
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,270
I kept it when we went to prison.

44
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,550
He insisted I keep it.

45
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:55,720
It's more precious than life.

46
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:59,360
Did you nag at Father again?

47
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,080
This time I didn't.

48
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:03,390
You know this.

49
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:05,910
Your father always thinks he's useless

50
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:07,960
and he owes us.

51
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,080
Where exactly did he go?

52
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,670
Who sent you here?

53
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:03,800
No one sent me.

54
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:04,960
I'm not lying.

55
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,040
My Lord, I was just passing by.

56
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,760
Just passing by.

57
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:10,590
Still trying to argue?

58
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:12,150
I'm not arguing.

59
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:13,640
Tell me the truth.

60
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,160
Well.

61
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:18,960
Did you hit him?

62
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:20,080
No.

63
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:21,590
- You hit him?
- No.

64
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,200
Is he so weak?

65
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:26,110
Wake him up.

66
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:31,870
My Lord.

67
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:34,550
Please spare me.

68
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:36,830
You brat.

69
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:38,480
You're tight-lipped, huh?

70
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:39,670
No, no. I'm not.

71
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:40,870
Do you have any accomplices?

72
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:41,960
No, no.

73
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:43,990
I really don't.

74
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,550
I'll tell you everything.

75
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:47,320
I'll tell you everything

76
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,480
that I know.

77
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:50,360
My name is Xu Pingzhi.

78
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,110
I'm a Baihu in the Imperial Guards.

79
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,240
My nephew is also a Guardian.

80
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,320
He's actually your colleague.

81
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:57,760
(No.)

82
00:00:57,990 --> 00:00:59,110
(I can't mention Ningyan.)

83
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:01,520
(It might be bad for me.)

84
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,670
A Guardian?

85
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,670
Is he a Copper Gong, Silver Gong,
or Gold Gong?

86
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,640
No, no, no.

87
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:12,510
My Lord,

88
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,670
I was just joking with you.

89
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,390
Joking?

90
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:20,520
Are you tired of living?

91
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:22,920
This...

92
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:24,710
He fainted again.

93
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:27,230
Wake him up.

94
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,390
I'm wrong.

95
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:37,200
I won't do it again.

96
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:39,920
You are a seasoned one.

97
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:41,640
No, no. I'm still new.

98
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:44,270
I like you the way you are,

99
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,710
tight-lipped

100
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,990
and seasoned.

101
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,590
No, no. I'm not seasoned at all.

102
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,590
Tell me.
Were you really just passing by?

103
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,800
I was telling the truth.

104
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,430
I really was just passing by.

105
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:01,230
I had a bowl of noodles
outside the yamen.

106
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:03,350
My stomach even got upset.

107
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:05,030
I'm wrong. I'll change.

108
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:08,230
I won't pass by the yamen again.

109
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,150
Please spare me, My Lord.

110
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,080
You brat.

111
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,590
Did you eat garlic?

112
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,590
New garlic.

113
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,960
Ten years apart bring out ambitions.

114
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:26,590
Serving the people
without seeking credit.

115
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:29,560
The galloping horse kicks up dust,

116
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:32,270
welcoming a better future.

117
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,520
On the grassland outside Haoqi Tower,

118
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,170
we share the drink and time
in the breeze.

119
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:39,030
Enough.

120
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:41,440
With the clear moon and wind,

121
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,230
we read by a lamp in Breeze Hall.

122
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:45,790
Enough, enough.

123
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:48,200
On the grassland outside Haoqi Tower,

124
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:51,910
we share the drink and time
in the breeze.

125
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,100
Congratulations, Silver Gong Li.

126
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:56,440
You've been reinstated.

127
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:00,150
Congratulations
on Mr. Li's reinstatement.

128
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,350
Li Yuchun.

129
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,000
Lord Wei.

130
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,710
What is this about?

131
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:23,830
This is His Majesty's command.

132
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:26,120
Xu Qi'an defied his superior

133
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,030
and violated the law.

134
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:29,790
His Majesty appointed him.

135
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:32,470
If the Guardians don't follow,

136
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,690
we'll also violate the law.

137
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,440
You may leave now.

138
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,790
Xu Qi'an.

139
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:26,230
Come in.

140
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,840
Yes.

141
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,680
Greetings,

142
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,120
Lord Wei.

143
00:04:58,790 --> 00:04:59,960
The Gold Hall,

144
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,960
Breeze Hall,

145
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,080
and Suppression Hall

146
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,030
will handle this case

147
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,790
together,

148
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:07,150
and you'll be

149
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:09,320
the Lead Investigator.

150
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:32,060
(Sangbo Case Summary)

151
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:35,710
Beneath the Sangbo,

152
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,270
is there something sealed there?

153
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,710
Tell me what you think.

154
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,200
Sangbo is the forbidden area
of our Dafeng,

155
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:49,640
but to outsiders,

156
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,960
the only valuable thing there
is the Supreme Sword.

157
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:54,320
This file states that the Supreme Sword

158
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,760
is unharmed,

159
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,590
so the culprit's goal is not that.

160
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,270
I think

161
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:02,470
there might be something else
in the Ancestral Temple.

162
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,830
As for the reason

163
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,560
why it shows up in Sangbo,

164
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:08,000
let me make a bold guess.

165
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:09,640
It's because this thing

166
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,470
needs the Supreme Sword to seal it.

167
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:17,830
Lord Wei, you must know

168
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:20,230
what this thing is.

169
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:22,630
Your task

170
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:26,440
is to find out who destroyed
the Ancestral Temple.

171
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:28,960
Whether this object exists

172
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,780
and whether it needs to be recovered

173
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,280
is none of your concern.

174
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,470
If you encounter any problems,

175
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,230
inform Yang Yan.

176
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:41,560
He will handle it.

177
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:53,230
His Majesty gave you a Gold Badge.

178
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,890
With this, you may move freely
within the Imperial City,

179
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:59,470
except in the Palace

180
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,560
and special restricted areas.

181
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,590
Yes, My Lord.

182
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:31,990
Has the Supervisor recovered?

183
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:43,630
That old man...

184
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,740
(Peace)

185
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,040
My Lord,

186
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:57,350
everyone from the Gold Hall,

187
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:58,920
Breeze Hall, and Suppression Hall

188
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,830
is here.

189
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:00,830
Please instruct us.

190
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:04,990
His Majesty ordered me

191
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,110
to investigate the explosion at Sangbo.

192
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:08,470
You all shall cooperate with me

193
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:09,630
and do your best

194
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:10,750
to repay the royal favor.

195
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,680
Yes.

196
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:12,920
Copper Gong Song Tingfeng.

197
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,760
Yes.

198
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:15,440
Lead a team to the Ministry of Works

199
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,630
to check the production

200
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:19,200
and usage records of gunpowder
over the past month.

201
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:20,870
A huge amount of gunpowder

202
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:22,660
is needed to destroy the entire temple.

203
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,070
It's impossible to transport it out
without leaving traces.

204
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:26,590
Even if the records are falsified,

205
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:27,630
there will still be clues.

206
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:28,470
Yes.

207
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:30,440
- Copper Gong Zhu Guangxiao.
- Yes.

208
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,040
Lead a team to the Ministry of Justice,

209
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:36,040
arrest all the officials
who went to the Ancestral Temple,

210
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:37,710
and interrogate them one by one.

211
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:38,550
Yes.

212
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:39,800
The rest,

213
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:41,230
follow me.

214
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:42,310
Yes.

215
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:46,430
My Lord, where are we going?

216
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,280
To the scene.

217
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:50,580
♪Watch out for fire late at night♪

218
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:52,520

230
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:17,620
(Forever Peace)

231
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,710
The temple
has been completely destroyed.

232
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,120
The bodies of the fallen soldiers
have been carried back.

233
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,920
No one has passed here afterward.

234
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:27,590
It seems

235
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,350
the lake surface
no longer holds any clues.

236
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:48,800
Why not

237
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:50,680
go see the bottom of the lake?

238
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,520
Sure.

239
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,200
Please, My Lord.

240
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:58,830
I'm here.

241
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,230
Are you okay?

242
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,710
You held your breath for a long time.

243
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:05,990
Your Qi force is too strong
for your Spirit Stage.

244
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:09,470
Perhaps it's because I cultivate

245
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:11,400
nonstop every day.

246
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:12,830
So,

247
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:14,200
did you find anything down there?

248
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,050
The foundation at the lakebed is intact.

249
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,060
The high platform collapsed
from a great height.

250
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,290
This suggests the explosion
happened inside the temple,

251
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:22,160
not at the lakebed.

252
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:25,160
They must've hidden the gunpowder
inside the temple.

253
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,870
Around the foundation,
there's a circle of stone pillars,

254
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:30,810
with tadpole-shaped inscriptions
carved on them.

255
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:32,280
They're roughly...

256
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:34,670
They're roughly like this.

257
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:45,710
This shape

258
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:47,440
seems to be

259
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,960
the Tianyu Language.

260
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:51,870
Is Tianyu behind this?

261
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:55,230
Not only that.

262
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:57,470
The stone pillars around the foundation

263
00:12:57,470 --> 00:13:00,110
seem to be arranged
according to some specific pattern.

264
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,200
This arrangement

265
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:04,630
should be a formation.

266
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:10,440
Arranging a formation
in the capital of the Dafeng...

267
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:12,990
The Astronomical Bureau.

268
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:15,670
Ningyan.

269
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,630
This seems to involve a lot.

270
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,280
Mr. Sun,

271
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:22,680
Mr. Chen,

272
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:24,830
how is the case going?

273
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:29,350
Eunuch Yang,

274
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:31,510
the Ministry of Justice and the yamen

275
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:32,560
interrogate

276
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,440
over a hundred people overnight.

277
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,800
Currently,

278
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:38,320
we have some leads.

279
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,080
Leads?

280
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:44,750
So, it's not settled yet.

281
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:55,750
This time, 312 soldiers

282
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,160
patrolling near Sangbo

283
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,350
died in this explosion.

284
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,590
Their death is the same.

285
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,110
They were drained of their blood

286
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,200
without any other wounds
on their bodies.

287
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:06,590
We think

288
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:08,230
it must be an expert

289
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,470
who did this.

290
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:13,280
Another expert.

291
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,920
This makes things more complicated.

292
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,200
Report!

293
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:18,760
Mr. Sun,

294
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,350
the Guardians are still outside,

295
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:21,730
saying it's an imperial command,

296
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:22,960
and they want the people back.

297
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,200
- Drive them away.
- Yes.

298
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:25,280
My Lord.

299
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:26,410
How's it going?

300
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:27,680
The Ministry of Works is fine,

301
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,160
but Guangxiao has a problem.

302
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:31,310
Let's go.

303
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:32,710
Let's go.

304
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,560
(Ministry of Justice)
We're on a case.

305
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:37,960
Whoever trespasses

306
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,460
and interferes with the investigation

307
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:40,630
shall be killed.

308
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,160
This is a restricted area.

309
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:49,120
Unrelated personnel,

310
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,230
get off your horses!

311
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:05,710
Anyone who trespasses

312
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:06,550
will die.

313
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,480
One

314
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:24,310
Chop

315
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:25,950
to

316
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:27,650
Kill

317
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:30,390
All.

318
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:58,960
The Guardians are on a case.

319
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:00,400
Anyone who obstructs it

320
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,200
will be killed without mercy.

321
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:07,710
How dare you attack here

322
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:08,920
as an official?

323
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:09,960
Won't this cause trouble?

324
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,990
Should I be afraid of trouble now?

325
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:13,620
For me, progress is life.

326
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,710
If I don't assert my authority,
they won't fear me.

327
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:16,990
They'll continue obstructing us.

328
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,380
Pull yourself together.

329
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:19,720
Let's go.

330
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,200
Report.

331
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:26,630
Mr. Sun.

332
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:28,440
What's going on now?

333
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,510
The Guardians broke in

334
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,200
and injured our people.

335
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:36,750
Who's so bold?

336
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,550
I am Xu Qi'an.

337
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:40,550
My Lord.

338
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:47,470
Greetings, My Lords.

339
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,750
I heard you detained many officials
from the Ministry of Rites

340
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,750
and obstructed our investigation.

341
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:54,070
Mr. Sun,

342
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,790
may I ask what you mean by this?

343
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,280
Xu Qi'an,

344
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,400
you trespassed into my ministry

345
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,160
and injured my men.

346
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:03,680
What do you mean by this?

347
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:07,750
The Guardians are on a case.

348
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:09,950
Why should we report
to the Ministry of Justice?

349
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:14,200
You're simply lawless.

350
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:15,910
Guards!

351
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,070
Take him down.

352
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,640
I am here under imperial orders.

353
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,470
I suspect the Ministry of Justice
is colluding with the culprit

354
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:34,550
and blew up the Ancestral Temple.

355
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:35,640
Guardians!

356
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,230
Escort Mr. Sun
back to the yamen for tea.

357
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:39,200
Yes!

358
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:45,600
How dare you draw your sabers
in my ministry?

359
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:48,230
How many lives
do you think you have?

360
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:52,600
I will handle the cases you can't

361
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:55,640
and kill the people you don't dare to.

362
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,360
Also,

363
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:08,120
if your ministry dares
to obstruct my investigation,

364
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:13,200
I'll take down your ministry as well.

365
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,920
Is that clear enough?

366
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:15,960
Xu Qi'an.

367
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,710
Good.

368
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:20,840
Good.

369
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,310
You're indeed young and brash.

370
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,920
Your arrogance truly stands out.

371
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,400
Perfect timing.

372
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:29,510
Let me introduce

373
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:33,310
this Copper Gong Xu Qi'an in the middle.

374
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:35,640
He was recommended by the Crown Prince

375
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:40,400
and appointed by His Majesty
as the Guardians' Lead Investigator.

376
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,790
A few days ago,

377
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:43,990
he injured a superior

378
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:45,550
and was sentenced to a waist chop.

379
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,470
His Majesty is wise

380
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,400
and merciful

381
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:52,030
and allows him to atone for his crimes.

382
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,220
The appointed Lead Investigator
by His Majesty?

383
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,400
Good, you Guardians

384
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:00,440
have come

385
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:02,160
at the right time.

386
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:04,160
I don't have to make another trip

387
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,680
to talk to you.

388
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:07,920
Everyone, please sit.

389
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,240
Xu Qi'an,

390
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:12,680
you sit too.

391
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:20,110
My Lord,

392
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:21,550
your Gold Badge.

393
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:29,270
I'm too angry to eat this.

394
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:30,790
But it's so sweet.

395
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:31,990
I'm really angry today.

396
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:33,470
This is so delicious. Eat some.

397
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:34,310
Go.

398
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:35,790
Record it carefully.

399
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:42,640
My life is difficult now.

400
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:44,960
If I don't handle this case well,
I'll die here.

401
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,880
Investigator Xu.

402
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:51,760
Are you done?

403
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:55,620
(Hid a large amount of gunpowder
near Sangbo Lake.)

404
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,840
The Guardians

405
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:00,310
sent a mere Copper Gong
to investigate the case.

406
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,400
It's truly laughable.

407
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,240
Exactly.

408
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,030
Since you've done speaking,

409
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:07,990
I'll just comment

410
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:09,310
on what you've said.

411
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,400
Based on Mr. Sun's deduction,

412
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,470
I have a few questions.

413
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,790
I visited Sangbo Lake this morning.

414
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:18,680
The amount of gunpowder required

415
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:20,750
to blow up the Ancestral Temple
is enormous.

416
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:21,960
Yes.

417
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,120
Is there a problem?

418
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:26,750
Here's the issue.

419
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,960
As Mr. Sun just mentioned,

420
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,310
the security measures
for the gunpowder are very strict.

421
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:35,070
It's already extremely hard
to steal such a large amount

422
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,880
from the Ministry of Works.

423
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,880
Let alone erase the relevant traces.

424
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:43,880
Who do you think
could pull off such a thing?

425
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:46,880
The Minister of Works

426
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,000
or

427
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:49,920
the two Vice Ministers.

428
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:56,790
So, it was the Minister
and two Vice Ministers.

429
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:58,880
Now, everything makes sense.

430
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,840
But

431
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:03,360
isn't it too reckless?

432
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:05,640
What do you mean?

433
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,920
To steal such a large amount
of gunpowder,

434
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,920
no matter how careful they were,

435
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:12,840
there would still be traces left behind.

436
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,190
An investigation would find out.

437
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:15,710
In my humble opinion,

438
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:17,440
this is just a trick by the culprit,

439
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,790
making us believe the gunpowder
came from the Ministry of Works,

440
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:22,710
thus shifting the focus
of the investigation,

441
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:26,680
and giving the real culprit time
to escape the capital.

442
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,600
Apart from the Ministry of Works,

443
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:31,710
where else could such a large amount
of gunpowder come from?

444
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:33,310
Is it possible

445
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,710
it was transported
from outside the city?

446
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,030
Gunpowder is obvious.

447
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,320
How could it be smuggled in?

448
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,850
Let's put aside the Outer City.

449
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:43,500
The soldiers in the Inner City

450
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:46,030
inspect all incoming and outgoing goods.

451
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:48,510
The Imperial City is even stricter.

452
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,790
Smuggling it in

453
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:51,880
is simply impossible.

454
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,040
If the gunpowder can't be
brought into the city,

455
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,680
what about the raw materials?

456
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:57,110
That's right.

457
00:21:57,230 --> 00:21:58,680
If it was just the raw materials,

458
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:02,230
the soldiers guarding the city
wouldn't know its use,

459
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:04,160
and there would be no contraband.

460
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,200
If you ask me, I'll let it pass.

461
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:07,750
Mr. Chen, how wise of you.

462
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:08,590
Look.

463
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,920
The raw materials...

464
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,030
Among the raw materials for gunpowder,

465
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:18,440
charcoal and sulfur are common items.

466
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,310
But there's one more thing
that the Dafeng strictly controls:

467
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:22,270
Saltpeter.

468
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:24,920
Saltpeter mines.

469
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,120
Mount Dahuang.

470
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:29,920
Mount Dahuang.

471
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,710
Breaking down the route.

472
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:32,750
We analyzed it earlier.

473
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:35,640
They went from Mount Dahuang
to the Outer City and Inner City.

474
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:37,920
They were only
transporting raw materials,

475
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:40,120
so they could easily pass the gate.

476
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:43,510
Next was the most crucial checkpoint
of the Imperial City.

477
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:49,200
Eunuch Yang.

478
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,270
My Lords.

479
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,120
I have other matters in the yamen.

480
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,160
I will take my leave now.

481
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:54,030
Caiwei,

482
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:54,870
shall we go together?

483
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:56,390
Everyone,

484
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:57,510
goodbye.

485
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:58,680
Wait...

486
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:00,310
Caiwei...

487
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:01,750
What about me?

488
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,080
My Lord, where are we going?

489
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,840
The Kui drove out the miners

490
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,960
to get the saltpeter mines
inside Mount Dahuang

491
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,310
to make gunpowder
to destroy the Ancestral Temple

492
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:13,990
and release the seal under the lake.

493
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,930
The inside man who helped them
smuggle the gunpowder into Sangbo

494
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:19,600
should be someone who can freely
enter and leave the Imperial City.

495
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,600
Someone who can move freely
in the Imperial City?

496
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:22,540
The Insignia Guards?

497
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:25,400
The day before the worshiping ceremony,

498
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,750
a small Flag Officer died.

499
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,440
Before Flag Officer Liu Han died,

500
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,600
he was on duty.

501
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,600
Liu Han was just a small Flag Officer.

502
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:35,070
He wouldn't be able

503
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:39,550
to deceive his superiors
and smuggle gunpowder.

504
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:42,750
Unless his superior

505
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:44,400
instructed him to do so.

506
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:46,070
After the task was completed,

507
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:47,900
his superior killed him to silence him.

508
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:51,400
Your words reminded me.

509
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,200
His superior is...

510
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:54,790
Baihu Zhou.

511
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:56,070
Let me ask you.

512
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:57,640
Was Liu Han one of your subordinates?

513
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,270
Yes.

514
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,230
Had he been acting strangely lately?

515
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:02,070
No.

516
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,510
He was just as usual.

517
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:06,270
Had anything suspicious

518
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:09,120
entered the Imperial City
while he was on duty?

519
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:11,800
No.

520
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,070
Baihu Zhou Chixiong
from the Insignia Guards.

521
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:16,790
Wait.

522
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,270
I've gazed at his aura.

523
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:19,360
He wasn't lying.

524
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,880
He might have used some trick.

525
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,440
In any case, we need to find him first.

526
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,030
Chief, take my Gold Badge,

527
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:29,870
hurry to the East Gate
of the Imperial City,

528
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:31,030
and arrest Zhou Chixiong.

529
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:32,650
Get there
before the Ministry of Justice.

530
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:33,490
Yes.

531
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:35,880
You all come with me.

532
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:36,830
Let's go.

533
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:41,310
The rest of you,

534
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:42,560
follow me to the Zhou Mansion

535
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,310
to arrest him.

536
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,240
Yes.

537
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:46,910
Mr. Chen,

538
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,440
where did they go?

539
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,160
What Mount Dahuang?

540
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,710
What saltpeter mines?

541
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:54,720
Mr. Chen,

542
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:57,550
do you know what they're talking about?

543
00:24:57,550 --> 00:24:58,390
I know.

544
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:00,640
The case
from the Municipal Office earlier.

545
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,070
The metal sodium

546
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:03,470
explodes.

547
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:09,550
Anyway, I don't remember it clearly.

548
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,200
The case files.

549
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,470
Hurry and bring out the case files.

550
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:14,400
Alright, alright.

551
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:16,600
Pig Brain, come here.

552
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:18,350
My Lord.

553
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:20,960
Go get the files.

554
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,360
Take your time.

555
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:23,960
Yes.

556
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:37,790
Are you crazy?

557
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,510
Hurry up.

558
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:46,200
Be patient.

559
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,810
The files will be here soon.

560
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:03,300
(Zhou Mansion)

561
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:10,910
Open the door!

562
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,120
The Guardians are on a case.

563
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,680
The Baihu is sick.

564
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,750
He's not seeing anyone.

565
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:16,160
My Lords, please leave.

566
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:21,680
Two men guard the gate.

567
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,880
The rest of you, rush in.

568
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:23,910
- Yes.
- Yes.

569
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:32,030
Mr. Lead Investigator,

570
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,570
why aren't you charging in?

571
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:41,680
In the Battle of Linyuan Pass,

572
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,840
did you see His Majesty
charging into battle?

573
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:46,880
You weren't like this earlier
at the Ministry of Justice.

574
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,070
That's called a persona.

575
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:50,680
A persona?

576
00:26:50,930 --> 00:26:52,310
I'm trying to leave an impression

577
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:54,960
of a tough guy who'll attack
at the slightest provocation.

578
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,230
With such a persona,

579
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:57,470
if they want to take credit,

580
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:58,680
they'll have to think twice.

581
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:04,160
Mr. Xu, we've searched the house.
There's no one.

582
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:05,880
All the valuables have been taken,

583
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,430
but the other furnishings are intact.

584
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:12,340
Where is Zhou Chixiong?

585
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:13,640
The Baihu and his wife,

586
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,270
along with the young masters,

587
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:16,510
went to visit their relatives.

588
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:17,840
Didn't you just say he was sick?

589
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,400
The Baihu said so himself.

590
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,160
I just followed orders.

591
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:23,030
When was this?

592
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:24,310
A few days ago.

593
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:25,980
On the day
the worshiping ceremony ended.

594
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:27,150
My Lord,

595
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:28,840
what crime did the Baihu commit?

596
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,440
I don't know.

597
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,280
I really don't know.

598
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:34,590
Go.

599
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:40,880
Baihu Zhou has escaped.

600
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,640
It's too early

601
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:44,960
to say that now.

602
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,960
There's no corpse in the house,

603
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,470
and no one has died here recently.

604
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,880
It might be covered up with some trick.

605
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:32,260
Why don't you dig into the ground
and search?

606
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:37,390
My Lord,

607
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:39,790
Baihu Zhou isn't
at the Imperial City gate.

608
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:41,890
After the worshiping ceremony,
he took a long leave.

609
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,280
He's escaped?

610
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,510
Whether he's dead

611
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:52,680
or alive,

612
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,750
this lead is cut off.

613
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:57,640
Come on, search!

614
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:05,750
Brothers, pack up.

615
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:06,640
Yes.

616
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:09,790
Move.

617
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:21,550
Where's Uncle?

618
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,680
He hasn't come back?

619
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,850
Mother has gone out to look for him.

620
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,710
I heard His Majesty

621
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,900
ordered you
to investigate the Sangbo Case.

622
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:33,630
Yes.

623
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:34,590
What's wrong?

624
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:36,960
You can't afford

625
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,360
to get involved in this.

626
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,990
I'm just investigating.

627
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:46,270
I won't track down
the big shots behind it.

628
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:48,640
I have to try.

629
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,070
After all, I was sentenced to die.

630
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:54,710
So, have you found anything?

631
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,030
The culprit have been found,

632
00:29:57,230 --> 00:29:58,550
but he managed to escape.

633
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,840
He ran away?

634
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,440
Then you...

635
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,750
If you can't handle it,

636
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:07,550
you should run too.

637
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:13,310
I've just come out of the death row.

638
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:15,880
I haven't even warmed up my bed.

639
00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:16,740
Besides,

640
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:19,160
our family doesn't have
any allies outside.

641
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,200
Where can I escape to?

642
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,300
If the worst comes to the worst,

643
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:27,680
you can go to Yunzhou.

644
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:29,800
Yunzhou?

645
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:31,200
It's full of bandits,

646
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:32,510
far from the Emperor's reach.

647
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,070
Even if you're wanted,

648
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:35,540
the court can't do anything to you.

649
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:36,990
If you're really ruthless,

650
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,470
you can become a bandit

651
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:40,790
to practice martial arts and gain power.

652
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:42,920
Many of the criminals
wanted by the court

653
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:44,880
and those desperate men
from the underworld

654
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,270
all gather in Yunzhou.

655
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:47,550
That's right.

656
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,550
The more chaotic the place,
the safer it is.

657
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,480
Wait.

658
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:53,200
Collaborating with the Kui

659
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,750
and blowing up Sangbo

660
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,310
is a capital offense,

661
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,600
punishable by exterminating
his three families.

662
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,920
No matter where he runs,

663
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,640
the court won't let him off.

664
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,270
If you were Baihu Zhou,

665
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,700
where would you escape to?

666
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,600
Ningyan, are you sure about this?

667
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,070
It's Yunzhou.

668
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,600
Slow down.

669
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,840
What happened?

670
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,550
Why were you locked up
in the Guardians' prison?

671
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:39,160
It's for Ningyan.

672
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,880
For Ningyan?

673
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:41,870
Yes.

674
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,360
It's for Ningyan.

675
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,840
As long as I can save him,

676
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,840
my life

677
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:51,360
is worth nothing.

678
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:52,870
Dear,

679
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:54,440
bring me my saber.

680
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,840
I promised his father

681
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,760
to protect him.

682
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,080
- Uncle?
- Father.

683
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:09,960
Ningyan,

684
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:14,280
why are you here?

685
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:17,320
I got off work, so I came back.

686
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:19,510
You're fine now?

687
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:20,800
His Majesty issued an order

688
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,090
and reinstated Ningyan,

689
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:23,270
allowing him to make amends.

690
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,190
Everything's fine now.

691
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:26,960
Yes, everything's fine now.

692
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:27,920
But you

693
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,630
should take this

694
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,440
to get rid of the bad luck.

695
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:34,760
Alright,
you all should rest early tonight.

696
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:39,760
I'm glad you're fine.

697
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:45,920
I'm glad you're fine.

698
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:54,880
Alright.

699
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:56,400
I'm fine now.

700
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,510
I'm glad you're fine.

701
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,120
Your Majesty,

702
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,760
the culprit broke into Sangbo

703
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,190
and blew up the Ancestral Temple.

704
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:10,320
It is truly a shame for our Dafeng.

705
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:11,390
Wei Yuan

706
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:13,340
is the leader of the Guardians.

707
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:14,920
He failed to protect the Imperial City.

708
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,190
He can't avoid responsibility.

709
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:17,720
Your Majesty,

710
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:20,330
(Wang Zhenwen, Cabinet Prime Minister)
please dismiss him

711
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:21,670
to calm the public anger.

712
00:33:21,670 --> 00:33:25,630
Seconded.

713
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:27,420
(State Duke Cao)
Seconded.

714
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:28,400
Wei Yuan

715
00:33:28,670 --> 00:33:30,380
has always been diligent in his duties.

716
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:33,320
The incident at Sangbo was unexpected,

717
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:34,430
so

718
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:36,140
the Guardians should not

719
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:37,660
bear this responsibility.

720
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:39,940
Rejected.

721
00:33:42,810 --> 00:33:43,860
Your Majesty,

722
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,780
Guardian Xu Qi'an

723
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:48,380
injured the guards and disrespected

724
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:50,700
imperial authority
at the Ministry of Justice's gate.

725
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:53,060
Your Majesty, please punish him severely

726
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:54,700
and exterminate his entire family.

727
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:00,060
Your Majesty,

728
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:01,600
the Ministry of Justice had the guards

729
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,260
obstruct the Guardians
from case-solving.

730
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:04,900
They have ill intentions.

731
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:05,980
I suspect

732
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:08,580
that Mr. Sun colluded with the culprit

733
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:09,780
to blow up Sangbo.

734
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:13,140
Your Majesty,
please dismiss and imprison him,

735
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:15,100
so I can interrogate him.

736
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:17,060
Seconded.

737
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:18,660
Seconded too.

738
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:20,060
Seconded.

739
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:21,380
Seconded too.

740
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:22,390
Seconded.

741
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,460
Seconded.

742
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:24,540
Wei Yuan,

743
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:25,820
you are slandering me.

744
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:27,440
You should die for this.

745
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,840
Your Majesty, something's off
with the Ministry of Justice.

746
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:30,740
We all second it.

747
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:32,390
(Yuan Xiong, Left Censor)
Please dismiss

748
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,540
all the Justice officials.

749
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:36,100
Stop slandering me.

750
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:37,940
Mr. Sun, do you still deny your crime?

751
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:40,380
How dare you twist the truth
in the court?

752
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:41,980
You deceived His Majesty.

753
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:43,380
You obstructed the investigation.

754
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:45,070
- Quiet!
- What are your intentions?

755
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:01,940
Copper Gong Xu Qi'an

756
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:05,180
is bearing a crime.

757
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:08,020
To redeem himself,

758
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:09,140
his actions

759
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:11,180
are bound to be extreme.

760
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:16,500
You all

761
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:18,860
should work together on the case,

762
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:21,700
instead of obstructing each other.

763
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:23,740
If it happens again,

764
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:25,020
I will

765
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:26,940
punish you severely.

766
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:31,860
From today on,

767
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:34,660
the city gates will be unsealed.

768
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:38,500
Officials with positions
of 6th Rank or above

769
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:40,740
are prohibited from leaving the capital.

770
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:42,900
Dismiss the court.

771
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:45,260
Dismiss the court!

772
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:47,940
Your Majesty, farewell.

773
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:56,300
Lord Wei.

774
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:57,300
Lord Wei.

775
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:58,620
Please stay for a moment.

776
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:10,500
Lord Wei.

777
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:13,340
This is what we've transcribed.

778
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:15,180
Take it back and review it first.

779
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:18,180
Thank you, Eunuch Yang.

780
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:19,620
Another day,

781
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:21,540
I'll surely invite you for a drink.

782
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:32,700
Father.

783
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:33,780
Father.

784
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:39,380
Why are you smiling?

785
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:42,620
I thought His Majesty would act today,

786
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:44,380
but unexpectedly,

787
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:46,180
we passed smoothly.

788
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:47,540
We passed smoothly?

789
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:49,300
No one used the chance
to attack you?

790
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:57,500
(The Ministry of Justice shall work
with the yamen.)

791
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:03,980
In just one day,

792
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:05,580
we've made such progress.

793
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:09,700
He's really good at solving cases.

794
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:11,380
Good at solving cases?

795
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:13,360
Are you talking about Xu Qi'an?

796
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:15,700
You're lucky

797
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,700
to find such a good talent.

798
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:20,340
It's a pity you were too late.

799
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:27,420
I've interrogated
the Taikang County Governor.

800
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:29,580
The report has been submitted.

801
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:32,220
He said he didn't collude with the Kui.

802
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:33,060
I gazed at his aura.

803
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:33,940
He was lying.

804
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:36,540
Did you uncover
the mastermind behind this?

805
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:39,140
The Gazing Spell

806
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:40,520
can only tell if someone is lying.

807
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:42,600
He didn't answer this question
no matter what,

808
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:43,880
so I had no way to proceed.

809
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:44,740
It's alright.

810
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:46,060
I'm here.

811
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:48,180
I'll make him speak the truth.

812
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:49,780
Please come with me.

813
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:54,380
Old man, what's your name?

814
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:55,220
I...

815
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:58,740
I am Zhang Shen from Yunlu Academy.

816
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:00,680
Alright.

817
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:02,780
Then I'll tell my master

818
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:06,220
that the old man Zhang Shen
from Yunlu Academy

819
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:09,580
said that the Heart Spell
was better than the Gazing Spell.

820
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:12,620
I'll ask my master
to talk to your Dean.

821
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:13,460
No need.

822
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:14,340
We all

823
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:15,580
have our strengths.

824
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:18,500
This is it.

825
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:25,180
Wake up.

826
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:26,560
Officials have questions for you.

827
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:29,100
Hey, you.

828
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:29,980
Are you deaf?

829
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:32,340
It's okay.

830
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:33,940
Whether he cooperates or not,

831
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:35,260
the result

832
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:36,940
will be the same.

833
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:43,260
The sage has read it.

834
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:45,780
(Heart Spell)
A gentleman must be sincere,

835
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:47,780
and so must an ordinary person.

836
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:00,020
Wow, so impressive.

837
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:04,620
Something's off.

838
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:06,620
Open the door.

839
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:23,380
