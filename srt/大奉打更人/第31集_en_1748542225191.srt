00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I'm afraid I'll be a little bit late

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I'm curious what I'm going to do

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I don't want to think about the future

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000

00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I'll give you the rules

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I'll keep my mouth shut

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'll take out this big piece of bowl

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
We're all one step at a time

We share the same story

I can see how hard she's trying to cling onto Junior

26
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
How much trouble she's getting into

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000

00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:52,540
How about driving

33
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:53,920
I'm taking down every move I get in this video.

34
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,060

Senior Yang,

42
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:24,540
did you okay?

43
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,540
Oh, no!

44
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:36,460
Do you see

45
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,460
that the lady didn't care

46
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:44,020
what happened?

47
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:46,500
I don't see

48
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:48,820
Li Xiao Yu,

49
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,220
that's not a good idea.

50
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:51,880
Your performance

51
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:55,680
This is my opponent, Yang Qianhuan.

52
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,480
Why do you stop me again?

53
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:16,280
You can't even get ten moves in my hands.

54
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,680
Only Yang Qianhuan can break the law.

55
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,680
You don't deserve it.

56
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:22,480
Okay.

57
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,680
This is unfair.

58
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,480
I'm going to grant you the right to be a witness.

59
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:38,880
Don't be a fool and become a person who loves me and the world.

60
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,480
The witness is the same age as me.

61
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,080
Yang Qianhuan will be re-established in the world.

62
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,280

65
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,680
It's even hotter than spring season.

66
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,680
It's not that the old man is ordinary and arrogant.

67
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,680
He's a good man.

68
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,680
We can't get close to him today.

69
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,880
We can't watch the fighting.

70
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,280
We can also see so many officials and officials.

71
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,680
And Huang Shizongxin.

72
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,680
Yes, yes.

73
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:44,680
Hello, hello.

74
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,280
Ask this official.

75
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,680
Why is he here?

76
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:50,680
Sister.

77
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:51,880
Sister.

78
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,280
Sister Ru is here.

79
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,880
Sister Xiuhe.

80
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,280
It's a good thing to have a country.

81
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,680
Everyone wants to come and enjoy the hot weather.

82
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,480
So our family can come and have a look.

83
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,880
Sister, you know what?

84
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,080
Ordinary people are standing.

85
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:10,880
The officials and officials have already arranged the position.

86
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,480
It's not only good to have a seat.

87
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,280
If you want to see the details,

88
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,280
I can bring you here.

89
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,880
My master is still a good talker.

90
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,680
It's not difficult to order a few seats.

91
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:24,680
No, no, no.

92
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,880
It's not troublesome.

93
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,880
After all, we are sisters.

94
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:31,280
Besides, you are so small.

95
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,480
I'm afraid you haven't seen such a big scene.

96
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,280
Sister can help.

97
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,280
Yes, yes.

98
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:38,880
Lady.

99
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,680
We have found the position.

100
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:41,680
It's here.

101
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,480
Come, come, come.

102
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:43,880
Master.

103
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,480
Sister Xiuhe, I'll take a walk first.

104
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:48,480
No.

105
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,880
Mr. Zhang, what makes you feel uncomfortable in here?

106
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:59,880
I feel this was a tough time.

107
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,080
But he is a journalist in ourOK.

108
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,680
Besides at ourOK,

109
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,680
I' don't mind consultants.

110
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:08,180
You just wanna talk with you.

111
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,780
tre友,

112
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:12,980
Please be cool since it's late.

113
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:13,980
We really can't believe this.

114
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:14,880
Brother Of Feng,

115
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,380

116
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:18,380

00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:19,380
the Noble Lady of the Daguang.

118
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:23,380
No need to be mad.

119
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:25,380
I'm free now.

120
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:29,380
Thank you.

121
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:41,380
I didn't expect

122
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:43,380
we could sit together

123
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:44,380
with the Noble Lady of the Daguang

124
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,380
of the Jin City.

125
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:47,380
I'm so happy.

126
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:53,380
Where's your father?

127
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:58,380
If I hadn't mentioned it,

128
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:01,380
I wouldn't have made it today.

129
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,380
I've been so grateful

130
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:06,380
to be here to thank you.

131
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:09,380
You're welcome.

132
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:11,380
Then let's say

133
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:12,380
I'll visit you

134
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:13,380
with Ning Yan

135
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:14,380
the day after tomorrow.

136
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:18,380
Okay.

137
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:26,380
I won't bother the Noble Lady.

138
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,380
I'll go first.

139
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:29,380
Mom.

140
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:31,380
What's the matter?

141
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:33,380
The purple sand tiger.

142
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:37,380
Look at her.

143
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:38,380
Look at her.

144
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:40,380
I'm sorry.

145
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:42,380
I won't bother her.

146
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:43,180
I don't know.

147
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:47,780
The dead man looks familiar.

148
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,380
Where have you seen Mo Fei?

149
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:56,580
I'm hiding down there.

150
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:58,580
Come, sit on my back.

151
00:08:58,580 --> 00:08:59,580
Where are you from?

152
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:02,580
Dad, I'm from the same family.

153
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:03,580
I am from the same family.

154
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:04,580
That's good.

155
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:08,580
This one seems to be Xu Qian's sister.

156
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:09,980
She is a little bit older.

157
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:11,580
Wait a minute.

158
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:14,380
Hey, hey, hey.

159
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:15,780
Why are you up there?

160
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:16,580
Come down, come down.

161
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:17,380
It's okay.

162
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:18,980
I'll play with the child.

163
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:19,980
This thing

164
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:21,780
is the longer the time in the mouth,

165
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:24,180
the longer the sweetness is.

166
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:27,780
Come, come, come.

167
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:28,380
I know.

168
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:29,580
It's too sweet.

169
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:31,580
I'm afraid that people will eat it.

170
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:32,580
I always eat it.

171
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,180
I always eat it.

172
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:35,980
Can you eat it?

173
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:37,180
Eat it.

174
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,180
I have it.

175
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:47,380
Honey.

176
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:54,980
patrimonious.

177
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:56,580
What kind of clothes are these guys?

178
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:00,020
This boy is too old-fashioned

179
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,380
and busy at flying,

180
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:02,700
but unfortunately how long

182
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:06,860
If you love him.

183
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:09,220
No wonder he could eat it so much.

184
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:11,220
Maybe it's the the案.

185
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:15,500
I'm so happy to have you.

186
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,860
I'm so happy to have you.

187
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,620
Why is Xu Qian so exquisite?

188
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:20,900
Why is she so exquisite?

189
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,580
I'm so happy to have you.

190
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,020
Did you see Xu Qian?

191
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:32,820
No.

192
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,420
She didn't come out, did she?

193
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:38,180
Xu Qian is a martial art.

194
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,700
How can she fight with Tian Yi Men?

195
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:40,860
Besides,

196
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:42,380
she's very good at being screened.

197
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:43,420
What a high notation.

198
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:46,540
Unless she and Tian Yi Men draw more兒臃.

199
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:49,860
You must be happy for her.

200
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:51,820
Think twice.

201
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:52,700
Li A.

202
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:55,420
They only talk, don't move.

203
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:56,020
I…

204
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,480
To be follow the path of a reasonable person

205
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:16,100
is to anyone who mistakes

206
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,040
except for the NPCs.

207
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:19,780

Awesome!

216
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:57,140
Dad, don't worry.

217
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,460
I'm not a great person.

218
00:11:58,460 --> 00:11:59,460
I won't be a common reporter

219
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:01,060
with Lingying.

220
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:01,900
Besides,

221
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,380
I'm always here to take care of our family.

222
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:04,100
Don't worry.

223
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:06,740
You're right.

224
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:08,540
And today,

225
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:10,740
I'm here for some famous people.

226
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:13,180
I'm also the family of Xu family.

227
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:14,660
I can't lose my identity.

228
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:25,900
Good.

229
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:30,100
Cheers.

230
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:32,460

234
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:43,580
How did you like it?

235
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:50,380
Is that my father and uncle Wang?

236
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:52,420
Who wants

237
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:53,220
to be the üç- strangely?

238
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,260
It must be so close.

239
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:56,980
It's not a coincidence.

240
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:00,100
I heard from Brother Xu

241
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:03,580
that he wants to introduce you and my father.

242
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,500
Maybe

243
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,660
he arranged it.

244
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,220
I really thank him.

245
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:13,780
Father, I beg you.

246
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:15,900
Don't talk to Uncle Wang.

247
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:17,020
Don't talk.

248
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:21,020
Hello.

249
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:28,360
My name is Xu the Li.

250
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:34,760
I am Xu Pingt hesitant to judge.

251
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:41,260
I think you are an xiaoyuan.

252
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:46,340
You are very kind and like RST Junior in gym.

253
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:50,300
Why could you be a ultimate man?

254
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,500
The one who looks like a khan is my eldest son.

255
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:58,500
Xu Qi'an.

256
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:00,900
Yes, yes, yes.

257
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:06,300
Xu Qi'an, the eldest son of the Great Geng,

258
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,700
had broken the sleep-dream case.

259
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:13,700
He also solved the way to break the fake sleep-dream.

260
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:16,700
He also found out the truth of the disappearance of many years

261
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,900
of the Princess Pingyang's death.

262
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,100
And the Sangbo case.

263
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:24,300
Xu Xinyan is your son.

264
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,300
Yes, yes, yes.

265
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,700
He is the son of the Prince.

266
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,500
I didn't expect that the son of the Prince is so famous.

267
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,300
You are just a friend of Yueyue.

268
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:39,700
How did you find out about the son of the Prince?

269
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:47,300
I just heard that he is good at reading.

270
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:48,900
He wants to break the sleep-dream.

271
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,300
I am a good person.

272
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:58,100
I am young and have a good reputation.

273
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,900
I am also good at reading.

274
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,100
After a hundred years,

275
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:06,900
I have told my family to be a good person.

276
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:16,300
My lord, I have something to ask you.

277
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:20,500
Do you know where the Inner Court's head of the Household Department,

278
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,700
Wang Zhenwen and Wang Daren are?

279
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:27,300
Can you show me?

280
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:32,900
Why do you ask him?

281
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:35,900
I am not sure.

282
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:40,700
Wang Shoufu and Wang Daren are my family.

283
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:44,500
What's wrong?

284
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,900
Take it easy. Don't shoot.

285
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:49,700
Look at them.

286
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:50,900
They are so harmonious.

287
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,300
Really?

288
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,100
They are so harmonious.

289
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,500
Have some melon.

290
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,300
Is it delicious?

291
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:07,700
Wang Shoufu's daughter is a good friend of my family.

292
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:10,500
She is a good friend of the Emperor.

293
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:14,100
But she is too old to participate in the epidemic.

294
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:15,800
Is she calling from the backyard?

295
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:16,700
Yes.

296
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:23,500
Aftercollection?

297
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:25,900
Yes.

298
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:26,900
Leave him be.

299
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:30,900
Make deck.

300
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:35,900
Don't take it off.

301
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,500
Come on, bring her with you.

302
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,500
The time has come.

303
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,500
The legend of the show is full of sense.

304
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,500
He is the general.

305
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,500
All good brands.

306
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,500
Like to bring home.

307
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,500
The top brand.

308
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,500
The big red-banded brand.

309
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,500
The brand you want.

310
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,500
The price you like.

311
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,500
All in the same brand.

312
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:24,500
The scent of the sky.

313
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,500
The scent of the hair.

314
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,500
It's called the Xiumi ring.

315
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,500
The so-called Xiumi-like ring.

316
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,500
The ring is a very good ring.

317
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,500
What is Xiumi's ring?

318
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,500
The world is a world between a marriage.

319
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:41,500
The world is a world without a thousand meters.

320
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,500
That's right.

321
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,500
The person who breaks the formation

322
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,500
will enter a small world

323
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,500
that is independent.

324
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,500
Break the formation.

325
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,500
Forget about the beginning.

326
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,500
If you don't break the formation,

327
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,500
your heart will break.

328
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,500
You will never forget.

329
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,500
The formation.

330
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,500
It's hard to deal with.

331
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,500
The gold medal.

332
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,500
The little mark of the star.

333
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,500
The little mark of the star.

334
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,500
The little mark of the star.

335
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,500
The little mark of the star.

336
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,500
The little mark of the star.

337
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,500
The little mark of the star.

338
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,500
The little mark of the star.

339
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,500
The little mark of the star.

340
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,500
The little mark of the star.

341
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,500
The little mark of the star.

342
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,500
The little mark of the star.

343
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,500
The little mark of the star.

344
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,500
The little mark of the star.

345
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,500
The little mark of the star.

346
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,500
The little mark of the star.

347
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,500
The ring.

348
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,500
The little mark of the star.

349
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,500
Which part?

350
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,500
The town.

351
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,500
The moon.

352
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,500
The stone.

353
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,500
The grass.

354
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,500
The water.

355
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,500
The water.

356
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,500
The water.

357
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,500
The relationship.

358
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,500
What's the relationship?

359
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,500
The relationship.

360
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:38,500
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

361
00:20:38,500 --> 00:21:08,500
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! No! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! So angry. Let's end here. Our bodies are turning red. If we don't cut the needle,

362
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,980
How can I get a job?

363
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:16,620
Xu Qian.

364
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:19,740
I'll give you the rose cake.

365
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:21,060
Eat it when you're thirsty.

366
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:22,500
I'm not hungry.

367
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:24,420
You can have it.

368
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:26,340
It's delicious.

369
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,420
And some water.

370
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,460
Wish you success in your horse race.

371
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:32,020
Although I don't know

372
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,820
why Jianzhen chose you,

373
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,660
since he chose you,

374
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:36,820
he must have his reasons.

375
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:39,340
Don't be nervous.

376
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:43,540
I'm not nervous.

377
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:44,540
I'm not nervous.

378
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:45,100
I'm nervous.

379
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:50,020
What are you waiting for?

380
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:53,700
Me.

381
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:56,460
Get up.

382
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:57,500
Act.

383
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,700
Great dream, victory.

384
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,260
Great dream, victory.

385
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:03,780
Great dream, victory.

386
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:05,260
Mr. Xu.

387
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:06,460
Are you ready?

388
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:07,140
Mr. Xu,

389
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:08,380
you must start the second race.

390
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,820
You must have a feast

391
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:10,860
in the coffin.

392
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:12,060
Wish Mr. Xu

393
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:13,380
a happy victory.

394
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:14,820
Don't talk, Xu.

395
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:15,580
Take a break.

396
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:21,220
Xu Qian.

397
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:29,540
I've been looking for you.

398
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:32,580
What's this?

399
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:35,060
It's the poem you wrote for me.

400
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:36,900
When you were on the ladder,

401
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:38,180
you could make a big sound.

402
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:39,580
It's too heavy.

403
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:41,900
It's heavy, right?

404
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:44,060
This is a good time for a man to make a sound.

405
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:47,180
You're my close friend.

406
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:48,300
You can't lose in this world.

407
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:53,380
Then...

408
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:56,020
I'm going.

409
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:02,260
Wait.

410
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:06,540
You're going to do that?

411
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:07,700
What's wrong?

412
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:09,540
Change your clothes.

413
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,060
Steam engine easy.

414
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,620
Start the the second race.

415
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:56,260
Brother,

416
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:57,420
Men fade in this deep of the world.

417
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:01,140

419
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:05,700
Go.

420
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,380
What people does it concern here?

421
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:12,340
Aren't you happy, vátos?

422
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:14,420

423
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:16,460
Lift up his high head.

424
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:18,420
Pay off your 때�ille

425
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:20,500
Or a world is better.

426
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,460

Look after me.

433
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:34,780
The interviews into the office

434
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:37,620
do not appear in my report.

435
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:43,140
Huang He VIP

436
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:46,060

00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:44,660

00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,720

We can all hold our Cinnamon Carn Let's sweep the yard

470
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:01,040
The vigilant

471
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:05,660
Su Qian

472
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:07,660
I heard about this.

473
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:08,660
I'm serious.

474
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:12,660
I hope this method is not against the power.

475
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:14,660
It's not about the power.

476
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:18,660
It's a very strange method.

477
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:21,660
No miracle.

478
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:23,660
No danger.

479
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:26,660
The method should not be attacked.

480
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:30,660
The way of the shield is not the same.

481
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:33,660
The shield is not the same.

482
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:36,660
The one who is blind,

483
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:38,660
the one who is blind,

484
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:41,660
the one who is blind,

485
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:43,660
must not be born.

486
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:50,660
The heart of the person who is in the town

487
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:54,660
will be replaced by the evil that he saw in the ordinary.

488
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:56,660
If you die,

489
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:59,660
the magic town can still be transformed into the future that you want.

490
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:05,660
The person who is in the town will be replaced by the evil that he saw in the ordinary.

491
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:08,660
The one who is blind will be replaced by the evil that he saw in the ordinary.

492
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:13,660
The more he is blind, the more difficult he is to break the formation of the night.

493
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:14,560
X places the diesem juice etc on their body

494
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,220
I saw six of them

495
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,260
but there were even four words

496
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:18,440
like changing powers

497
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,040
In those words

498
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,040
what have I seen already?

499
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,360
Me

500
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:24,880
I, the Princess parenra

501

fee

502
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,400
you must listen to the true life

503
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:40,440
You can't compare to your life

504
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,640
If the burning hot pot works

505
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,800
You will be like a sheep.

506
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:45,440
Mom.

507
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:47,440
Give me.

508
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,440

00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,240
Give me.

511
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,640
Wang Man is awake.

512
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,040
Everyone come here and see.

513
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:00,440

00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:07,240
Where are you going to come back this late?

517
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,040
Just work hard.

518
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,040
Boss is drinking some wine.

519
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,640
Why are you so quiet?

520
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,640
Drinking wine?

521
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:13,840
What is this?

522
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:14,640
And this.

523
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,840
Who is this?

524
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:16,440
I'm sorry.

525
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:16,840
I'm really sorry.

526
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,440
I'm so tired.

527
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,040
You are not easy to get into the exam.

528
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,440
Don't give up for my soldier.

529
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,240
Mom, it's okay.

530
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,640
It's not bad to enter the society early.

531
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,640
I'm collect however much wine there is.

532
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,040
We're all in this.

533
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,640
See you tomorrow.

534
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,440
Then I'll be there.

535
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,640
See you, mom.

536
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,040
Oh, no.

537
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:07,040
But why the dive is so hard?

538
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:07,560
Okay.

539
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,560

00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:31,520
I'm going to show you my next concert again.

543
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:39,200
Yes, yes, action.

544
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,280
Director YangHuang.

545
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,520
In the online chatroom alone,

546
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,360
the two come out with collision,

547
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,280
causing theivity of organizing business.

548
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,680
Thank you, Director Yang.

549
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:01,800
Fine, I think you are quite right.

550
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:05,760
I expected.

551
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:10,140
It's not good

552
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:18,660
I think she is screwed

553
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:20,700

00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:44,760
Let's go.

568
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:47,760
Let's go.

569
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,760
Let's go.

570
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,760
Let's go.

571
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:11,760
Let's go.

572
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:13,760
Let's go.

573
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:15,760
Let's go.

574
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:17,760
Let's go.

575
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,760
Let's go.

576
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:19,760
Let's go.

577
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,760
Ling Ling, come on.

578
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,760
Let's go.

579
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,760
The one you like.

580
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,760
Yes.

581
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:25,760
You've seen the model.

582
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:26,760
There are only two models.

583
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:27,760
They're very strong.

584
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:28,760
Look.

585
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:29,760
The model is very good.

586
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,760
Okay.

587
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:31,760
Please.

588
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:32,760
Thank you.

589
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:33,760
I've said that.

590
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,760
This is the front of the public.

591
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,760
I'll show you.

592
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:37,760
I'll show you.

593
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,760
You like it.

594
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:39,760
I like the model.

595
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:40,760
I'll make money.

596
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:41,760
I'll show you the house.

597
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,760
I'll show you.

598
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:43,760
I'll show you.

599
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:44,760
I'll show you.

600
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:47,760
Wait a minute.

601
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:48,760
Brother.

602
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:49,760
Brother.

603
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:50,760
Can you borrow the light?

604
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:53,760
No.

605
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:55,760
Look.

606
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,760
This is very good.

607
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:57,760
Look.

608
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:58,760
There's a lake next to it.

609
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,760
We'll live in a lake house.

610
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:01,760
We'll have money.

611
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,760
Let's come here.

612
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,760
I'll show you Er 때문에Detente.

613
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,760
The oil.

614
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:09,760
Let's go.

615
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,760
Where is the original material worser I designed?

616
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:35,160
You are pretty.

617
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,720
How should we respondき у ФСССААСАСААСА СПЛА screams,

Look at you

620
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,880
The plague is so serious

621
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:50,520
I see

622
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:55,620
The people would share you

623
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:56,480
with it

624
00:35:58,260 --> 00:35:59,040
and say that you love it

625
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:01,360
I'll pay you a edit

626
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,360
Two, one.

627
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,160
I paid my son for the handkerchief.

628
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:13,840
Except for the money,

629
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:16,040
I paid the father a medical fee.

630
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,200
How much do you still have?

631
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:19,720
All of it is here.

632
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:32,800
Make it a matter of what somehow.

633
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:33,920
I km

634
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:36,600
work half and half by myself.

635
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,880
It is difficult for me to understand

636
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,280
about my size.

637
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:04,620
Michelle Zhang

638
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,580

I will be the top of the forest

643
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,760
and grow up in the mountains.

644
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,160
You will be the top of the forest.

645
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:49,640
I'm so happy.

646
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,200
My name is Yang Ling.

647
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,240
We have met before.

648
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,360
Many years ago,

649
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:59,000
we finally know how to be good people.

650
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,400
We have met before

651
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,640
but it is still flashing.

652
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:07,120
But you promised before,

653
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,320
you can live as a woman.

654
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:09,360
You had something special to say?

655
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:14,800
We promised before,

656
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:15,440
it is Connective with Fine.

657
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,360
The acupoint must stay with us

658
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:18,160
after we get makeup done inside.

659
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,280
We don't break an eye with it.

660
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:21,960
Don't fall.

661
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,000
I mean,

662
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:27,640
Grandmother, why don't you eat some pho ish multiply,

663
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,980
書 Native is so reliable.

664
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:36,100
When you turn to zero solution on single floor,

665
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:38,400
the potential is quite small.

666
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,920
You can ground the wind ad colliding with it in the future.

667
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,420
What is it?

668
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:44,440
What is it?

669
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:46,560
I am getting bored.

670
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,080
I hope I have no Caf�?!

671
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:50,840
Sir, why isn't my brother moving?

672
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:52,820
Nothing.

673
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:53,660
I don't know.

674
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:01,100
It's been half an hour.

675
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:03,020
If we lose this battle,

676
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:05,420
the relationship between the two of us

677
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:09,380
will be clear.

678
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:12,340
You'd better stay behind.

679
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:13,180
Otherwise...

680
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:13,900
Your Majesty.

681
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:17,740
You don't know anything?

682
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:20,180
You...

683
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:22,180
You're a fool.

684
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:24,540
How?

685
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:26,460
I have seen the world,

686
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,300
having broken the gesund czym,

687
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,140
having diffused in his direction.

688
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:31,740
Have broken hearts.

689
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:33,300
Those are the guilty ones.

690
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:36,460
How do you find these samples right?

691
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:44,860
Xu Xuan, your sickness is right now.

692
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:47,460
But why aren't they having the same experience?

693
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:48,980
These studies are chutters.

694
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:56,260
King him and Ren Jie is young too.

695
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:59,780
Be successful in this part of life

696
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:04,480
My treatment of the Empress Dowager

697
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:06,940
shows that

698
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:18,860
she may soon be in treacherous Đ между

699
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:21,940
but next,

700
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:23,940
I have nothing to fear.

701
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:26,940
I have nothing to fear.

702
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:28,940
In this life,

703
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:31,940
you are in a difficult life,

704
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:33,940
in a difficult love,

705
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:36,940
in a difficult heart.

706
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:38,940
You are in a difficult life.

707
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:42,940
I dare to ask you,

708
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:47,940
what is the meaning of your life?

709
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:55,940
The meaning of life,

710
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:03,940
is the common childhood of birth and development.

711
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:06,940
The love of failure,

712
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:09,940
the ideal of the king.

713
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:14,940
One day or one year,

714
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:17,940
the last day,

715
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:19,940
the last day,

716
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:21,940
the last day,

717
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:24,940
Lei,

718
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:27,940
if I follow your instructions,

719
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:32,940
I am indeed a failure.

720
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:44,940
It's just...

721
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:52,940
Failure in life,

722
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:57,940
is there no meaning?

723
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:02,940
There are many meanings in life.

724
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:06,940
The essence of life is a meaning.

725
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:09,940
I have come,

726
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:11,940
I have done,

727
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:13,940
I have done.

728
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:17,940
Whether it is a success or a failure,

729
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:20,940
the essence of life,

730
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:22,940
is the meaning of life.

731
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:29,940
The long wind and waves will have time.

732
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:31,940
Today is the day of the big phoenix.

733
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:33,940
Welcome to the big phoenix observation room.

734
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:36,940
Today's guest is the first-ever manager of the big phoenix.

735
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:37,940
Hello, Mr. Song.

736
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:39,940
Hello, everyone.

737
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:41,940
There is a news from the nationality recently.

738
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:42,940
The angel of the law is real.

739
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:44,940
Niannian, what do you think?

740
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:45,940
What do I think?

741
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:46,940
I look at it from the top.

742
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:48,940
You are thinking so much.

743
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:49,940
You are too late.

744
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:50,940
Wait a minute.

745
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:51,940
What is it?

746
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:52,940
You just need to send it.

747
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:53,940
You are still waiting.

748
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:55,940
Someone has already sent it to the first-ever manager.

749
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:57,940
No, no, I have to go.

750
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:01,940
Wait a minute, Mr. Song.

751
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:02,940
I have to do it.

752
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:03,940
What?

753
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:05,940
Is it the treasure case of the adult?

754
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:09,940
The big phoenix is here to do the work.

755
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:10,940
What work?

756
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:11,940
Look,

757
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:13,940
this is complicated.

758
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:15,940
If I want to go to the station one by one,

759
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:18,940
I'm afraid I have to change four horses in a day.

760
00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:20,940
I just need one horse.

761
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:21,940
What horse?

762
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:22,940
The champion.

763
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:23,940
The champion?

764
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:24,940
You can do it.

765
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:25,940
You can do it.

766
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:27,940
You can't be afraid of the distance.

767
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:29,940
Unfortunately, sometimes,

768
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:30,940
it's not the map.

769
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:32,940
It's the human heart.

770
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:33,940
Look.

771
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:36,940
How can you make the word so serious?

772
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:38,940
Miss Wang is here.

773
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:39,940
Look at Wang Weng.

774
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:42,940
The farther the map is, the more people will come to see her.

775
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:43,940
You should persuade her.

776
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:45,940
My mouth is almost dry.

777
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:47,940
Isn't this the typical hard food?

778
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:49,940
One doesn't talk, one is called magic.

779
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:52,940
Why don't you find a surprise?

780
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:54,940
You can express your feelings for the word.

781
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:56,940
You can also let Miss Wang face the map.

782
00:43:56,940 --> 00:43:58,940
The word is brilliant.

783
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:01,940
Mr. Song, why are you talking about

784
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:02,940
running around in the old house?

785
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:04,940
Ningye, do you remember my human horse experiment?

786
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:07,940
I finally developed a reliable

787
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:08,940
original new weapon,

788
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:10,940
an electric car.

789
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:11,940
No wonder.

790
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:13,940
The first line of the first line of the watermelon experiment.

791
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:14,940
The distance must be long.

792
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:16,940
Song Li wants to be high-end.

793
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:18,940
The electric car of the duckling can be satisfied.

794
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:22,940
The long wind will be broken.

795
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:23,940
When there is a stone,

796
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:25,940
watch the wind with the duckling.

797
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:26,940
It must be worth it.
