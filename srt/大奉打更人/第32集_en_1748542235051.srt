My life is up to you.

00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:04,740
Why are you here?

57
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:07,740
Life is different.

58
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,740
One person lives.

59
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:12,740
If you're a fool,

60
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:17,740
you're not interested in living.

61
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,740
Life is up to you.

62
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:22,740
And

63
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,740
don't think you're just a piece of cake.

64
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:29,740
You're so cool when you ask me about the problems of high-school.

65
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:31,740
If you're really cool, you'll answer me.

66
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:33,740
What's the point of your life?

67
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:35,740
You can't leave, can you?

68
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:38,740
Just listen to me.

69
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:41,740
The most annoying thing is that you...

70
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:45,740
I can't breathe for a while.

71
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:47,740

Don't leave.

75
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:55,740
I'll talk to you in the next life.

76
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,740
Come out.

77
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:02,740
Don't be late.

78
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:03,740
Okay.

79
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:06,740
Don't leave.

80
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:07,740
Don't move.

81
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,740
I'll talk to you in the next life.

82

Little girl!

83
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:16,740
Where did you come from?

84
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:17,740
You're a man.

85
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:18,740
Yes.

86
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:19,740
I've thought it through.

87
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:23,740
My purpose in life is to come and ask you.

88
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:26,740
Do you think you're fine with eating in the heaven?

89
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:29,740
What's the purpose of your life when you come to Da Feng?

90
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,740
You want to find you and go back to heaven?

91
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,740
You ask me the purpose of my life.

92
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:36,740
I want to ask you what the purpose of your work is.

93
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:39,740
What's the purpose of eating?

94
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:42,740
What's the purpose of your love?

95
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:46,740
Think about it.

96
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,740
I can't get used to it.

97
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:50,740

98
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:52,740

99
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:00,740
Don't leave.

100
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:02,740
I'll talk to you in the next life.

101
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:07,740
Hongsheng!

102
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:08,740
Have you thought it through?

103
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,740
What's the purpose of your love?

104
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,740
Come on, answer me.

105
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:14,740
Hongsheng, have you ever been in a relationship?

106
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:16,740
Little girl!

107
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:18,740
You're really suffering.

108
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,740
I heard you have a junior.

109
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:21,740
His name is Du.

110
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:23,740
He's in a relationship.

111
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,740
You haven't been in a relationship?

112
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,740
You two are really miserable.

113
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,740
I see your beard is very different.

114
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:31,740
No girl likes you.

115
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:34,740
You haven't even been in a relationship.

116
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,740
You're afraid to talk to me.

117
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,740
You're also worthy.

118
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,740
I'm not familiar with it.

119
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,740
I'll talk to you in the next life.

120
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,740
What's the purpose of your love?

121
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:52,740
Little girl!

122
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,740
What's the matter?

123
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:56,740
Sir, have you ever eaten hot pot?

124
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:58,740
Have you ever eaten spicy food?

125
00:05:58,740 --> 00:05:59,740
Have you ever eaten food?

126
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:00,740
Have you ever eaten food?

127
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:01,740
Have you ever been in a relationship?

128
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,740
I'll talk to you in the next life.

129
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:08,740
Little girl!

130
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:10,740
I'm coming back again!

131
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,740
Have you ever taken a video?

132
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:14,740
The new bridge.

133
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:17,740
Have you ever seen a game?

134
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:20,740
Is it the air-conditioning or the political game?

135
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:25,740
How can you play the game?

136
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:28,740
Sir, have you ever played basketball with your friends?

137
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,740
I'll tell you the truth.

138
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:32,740
Oh, right!

139
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:34,740
No, the way Tang San is.

140
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:35,740
Yes, this way.

141
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:37,740
You love to eat five-person food.

142
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,740
That's right.

143
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:42,740
No.

144
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:43,740
To beat up the ice.

145
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:44,740
To beat up the ice.

146
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:45,740
To beat up the ice.

147
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:46,740
To beat up the ice.

148
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:47,740
To beat up the ice.

149
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:48,740
To beat up the ice.

150
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:49,740
Is there any meaning?

151
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:50,740
No, there is no meaning.

152
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:51,740
It's just that you're happy.

153
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:52,740
Sir, have you ever played the game?

154
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,740
Sir, have you ever eaten hot pot?

155
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,740
Sir, have you ever played basketball with your friends?

156
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:57,740
Sir, why aren't you talking?

157
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:58,740
Sir, sir, sir.

158
00:06:58,740 --> 00:06:59,740
Sir, how can you be so rude?

159
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:00,740
Can you hear me?

160
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:01,740
Tell me the meaning of life.

161
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:02,740
It's the meaning of the hot pot.

162
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:03,740
The meaning of the Koujiazhao.

163
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:04,740
Why don't you speak?

164
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:05,740
Sir, sir, sir!

165
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:06,740

why don't you

174
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,580
keep your mouth shut

175
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:49,140
about what I did?

176
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,280
What's going on?

177
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,080

Someone is drawing off the dwaing?",

181
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:11,740

182
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:13,740
Hurry up and pull the knife!

183
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,740
The process

184
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:37,740
So, you should use your own rules to define others

185
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:40,740
Just like your PUA

186
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:43,740
Different life has different beauty

187
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:46,740
You should face different sorrows

188
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:48,740
You should be responsible for your life

189
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:51,740
You should smile and cry

190
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,740
Life is a big regret

191
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:55,740
It's not like money

192
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:17,740
The knife!

193
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:26,740
I can answer you, I'm your life

194
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:34,740
Now, my will is

195
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:39,740

Hurry up!

199
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:17,740
Hurry up!

200
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:19,740
Hurry up!

201
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:37,740
I'm going to kill you!

202
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:50,740
Tianyu

203
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:53,740
Lost

204
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:54,740

205
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:56,740
Win, PUA

206
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:57,740
Win

207
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:00,740
The first place in the fifth round of the game is Xia Di

208
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:04,740
I'm the first place in the fifth round of the game

209
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:24,740
I'm the first place in the fifth round of the game

210
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:26,740
Brother, you're really talented

211
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:30,740
I'm so good

212
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:33,740
I'm so good

213
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:35,740
I'm so good

214
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:46,740
I'm so good

215
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,740
You're so good

216
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:50,740
You're so good

217
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:52,740
He's so good

218
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:54,740
He did it

219
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:57,740
I'm good at my brother's skills

220
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:01,740
He's just a little bit worse than a wolf

221
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:02,740
Si Mu

222
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:04,740
A wolf

223
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:09,740
He's really just a god

224
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:14,740
I'm not helping him in the dark

225
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,740
The way he fights is not in the cultivation

226
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:20,740
He's good at sports

227
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,740
You can be a good player

228
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:24,740
Isn't that right?

229
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:28,740
Jianzhen, you're still a good player

230
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,740
You're so good

231
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:53,740
Tianyu

232
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:54,740
Yes

233
00:12:58,740 --> 00:12:59,740
Tianyu

234
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,740
Don't run away, girl

235
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,740
Don't run away

236
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,740
You're awake

237
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,740
You're awake

238
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,740
Young lady

239
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:21,740
Why am I here?

240
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:23,740
The key to your hand

241
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:25,740
is to get it

242
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,740
I've been holding it in your hand

243
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:29,740
No one can take it

244
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:33,740
I can only take you back to the Academy

245
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:41,740
Thank you for your blessing

246
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:50,740
Thank you

247
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:51,740
Thank you

248
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:52,740
Thank you

249
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:53,740
Thank you

250
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:56,740
Thank you

251
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:13,740
This is the key to the Yasheng

252
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:15,740
You're right

253
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:17,740
Since the Yasheng was first established

254
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:21,740
This kotao has been in use for more than a thousand years

255
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:27,740
Is Lord Xu awake?

256
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:30,740
His Majesty sent us to visit

257
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:33,740
and meet with Mr. Zhao

258
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:39,740
Lord Xu, you're finally awake

259
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,740
His Majesty has something to ask

260
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:50,740
Jianzhen, you can't go out

261
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:52,740
I can't go out

262
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:54,740
It's okay

263
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:56,740
Use the 999 Kotao

264
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:58,740
to get more symptoms

265
00:15:58,740 --> 00:15:59,740
Kotao, hurry up

266
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:01,740
Kotao, hurry up

267
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:02,740
The Kotao

268
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:03,740
The Kotao

269
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:05,740
The Kotao will be in the next round

270
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:06,740
Wear some red

271
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:08,740
The new battle gear

272
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:09,740
Please come on

273
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:12,740
The opening game

274
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:13,740
A good game

275
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,740
The family will be ready

276
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:16,740
The horse is not suitable

277
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:17,740
The horse is free

278
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:18,740
The horse is not suitable

279
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:19,740
Eat a horse

280
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:21,300
when you return to Resurrection

281
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,740
All two of us pay the price

282
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:26,740
that you want

283
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:28,740
The arm

284
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:30,040
Are you leaving

285
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,040
Mr. Zhao

286
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,540
Xuácong recently came to the Harbour

287
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:35,740
Four hundred years ago

288
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:36,740
He came to the war

289
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:37,820
That's kind of allow

290
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:40,900
The horse's arm

291
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:41,660
is a на hac

292
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:42,740
A long time ago

293
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:43,260
HA料

294
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,020
Star

295
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:45,040
A long time ago

296
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:45,900
There was a thought about this

297
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:46,700
Are there any reasons

298
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:47,700
for the horse or the horse

299
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:50,080
Just to slaughter alone and...

300
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,880
Why do you everytime mention the saying,

301
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:19,600
Would you like to give His Majesty

302
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,400
his reward?

303
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,520
It's a pleasure to meet The President.

304
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,460
He came here

305
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,560
but there are too many prerogatives.

306
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,680
I'm sorry

307
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,960
to have made you

308
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:41,920
misunderstand me.

309
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,440
I beg your mercy, Youramen.

310
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,800
Director Wang.

311
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:48,080
There's something I don't know about the students.

312
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,960
The Feng people are the best.

313
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,080
If Yunlu Academy and Si Tianjian

314
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,680
are not as good as the one in the first place,

315
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,280
why did you choose me?

316
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,280
Although the level is high,

317
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,880
but the best candidate

318
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,680
for Yunlu Academy and Si Tianjian

319
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:13,480
is Lord Xu and the second person.

320
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,680
Thank you for your consideration.

321
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,080
How long did you sleep?

322
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:41,080
It turns out that you chose Shi Tao.

323
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,480
Didn't I choose him, too?

324
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,180
Of course.

325
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:57,880
He can keep a up- dew but with more power.

326
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,080
You made a shot to the person down.

327
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,780
It was indeed an masculino

328
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:04,880
choice.

329
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:05,580
Rather than choosing him,

330
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:08,280
he chose him for the advantage.

331
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,880
The real reason that is irregularcy

332
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,280
is Xu Qian'an's letshappyness.

333
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,760
He has the cold hands

334
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:15,960
His丑长新

335
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,000
accepted the court

336
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:19,640
to belt

337
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,600
His ability to appreciate espionage

338
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,240
guides him

339
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,880
without knowing

340
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,160
everything he'd come up with

341
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:30,760
It's hard

342
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,200
to entrance

343
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,720
when there's discontin tipo

344
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,320
있는当初与我们的

345
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:36,780
正好

346
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,160
和天下的

347
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:38,720
地上的

348
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,080
一场好节

349
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,120
都是预兴会和天下的

350
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,080
一场好节

351
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:41,960
like that.

352
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:45,200
Ba Sang foods and disaster are heroine.

353
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,080
This is the cyclical measures.

354
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,720
This foundation

355
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,960
might as well be not far from that.

356
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,000
The only thing we can do

357
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,320
is to protect the Great Sage.

358
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:06,040
It's just that it Damnates the conquerors.

359
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:07,720
Has that

360
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:10,760
the Prince's war мор.

361
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:14,280
While he's still serving such dès

362
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:32,300
under His Majesty's good

363
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,820
and prevailing 이것 in the feel.

364
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:38,880
Li Fillu.

365
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:48,320
Telling me that His Majesty is far too agEtlat.

366
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,200
If Xu Qi'an deployed imperial forces to Meaningless Потому,

367
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:55,240
he might對對 since the beginning

368
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,680
contact His Majesty.

369
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:00,080
If you have someone to help him

370
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:01,520
Into surrounding force the moon!

371
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,000
topdeling the moon?

372
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:21,580
to

373
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:23,440
If Solstice

374
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,560
speaks to this trouble,

375
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:28,480
he doesn't say it anymore.

376
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:45,080
The Imperial Side must closeDBJ

377
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,860
Search

378
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:00,020
It's really an赈Che Memphis

379
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:04,900
or even Guo Shix grandson is cheating me

380
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:08,940
You are tired for some days

381
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:10,460
so you need some body drainage

382
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:12,980
but you want to rest

383
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:14,780
You said that

384
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:16,820
Xu Qian wanted a reward.

385
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:17,940
Your Majesty,

386
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,620
you are so determined.

387
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:27,580
Although Xu Qian

388
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:28,900
is a good fighter,

389
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:30,180
it's because

390
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:31,860
you have the chance

391
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:33,300
to reward him.

392
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:36,340
To reward him with some gold and silver jewelry,

393
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:37,860
for him,

394
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:40,140
he is already very lucky.

395
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:41,740
As for the rank,

396
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:44,140
you can't say it.

397
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:47,740
I have theépoque идеo.

398
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:49,580
Give it to him.

399
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:52,540
All용.

400
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:54,180
Order

401
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:56,620
that Zhou Sansi hazards the 1600 sq.

402
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:58,680
And please

403
00:22:58,780 --> 00:22:59,940
have Censor of Y추 3000

404
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:03,460
deposited on your throne for running.

405
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:10,500
Didn't you say

406
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,880
You said the result is bad,

407
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:16,300
but the А is 0,

408
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:22,940
what do you need to remove?

409
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:26,980
Young man into deep indignant disordered

410
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:36,820
Now take care ofess

411
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:40,220
We are bosses

412
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,720
Hence, I can still work out.

413
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:44,480
I think

414
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:53,460
JianzhenLettuceotherapySt 1944

415
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:57,460
I'm afraid I want to send anotherolutions

416
00:23:58,380 --> 00:23:59,660
Oh

417
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:03,080
Alright

418
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,000
How about it?

419
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:17,020
Princess, Wrap bows to Gu hoped he will enter Yue Lядong Hill soon.

420
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:40,360
Make sure to let him know where the

421
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,980
You're not going out to walk.

422
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:43,820
You just want to see Lord Xu.

423
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:44,420
But...

424
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:47,020
How about this?

425
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:49,580
My dear country is shining.

426
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:51,860
I'm afraid I'll die for it.

427
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:54,380
Can't I be a part of it?

428
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:08,180
I'm their main observer.

429
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:10,180
I have no other choice.

430
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,180
But you're different.

431
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:14,620
From now on,

432
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:15,900
you're the princess.

433
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,820
I'm the Ganzi.

434
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:19,620
Let's change our clothes.

435
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:20,660
Let's change our clothes.

436
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:21,500
Then,

437
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:22,980
when they're free,

438
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:24,420
I'll sneak out from the back door.

439
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:26,100
No, princess.

440
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:27,820
It's too risky.

441
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:29,620
I'll just watch it from afar.

442
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:30,620
Just one eye.

443
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:31,220
Just one eye.

444
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:32,740
I'll be back

445
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:33,620
when I see him.

446
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:34,620
No one will notice.

447
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:36,460
But if they do,

448
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:37,660
it'll be like the Noble Consort.

449
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:40,500
You must be suffering.

450
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:42,420
You can't do that.

451
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:43,780
What should I do?

452
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:52,060
Am I good to you?

453
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:54,660
Yes.

454
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:55,300
No.

455
00:25:58,380 --> 00:25:59,060
Yes.

456
00:25:59,060 --> 00:25:59,980
That's right.

457
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:02,020
Just kick me out.

458
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:02,700
No, no.

459
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:03,260
I'll do it.

460
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:05,060
Just wash your hands.

461
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:06,060
I'll be back soon.

462
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:06,420
Okay.

463
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,420
Princess Xiaoyue.

464
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:10,980
Princess Xiaoyue.

465
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:12,660
You're news about

466
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:14,340
the Minister Xu waking up.

467
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:16,180
Really?

468
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:23,220
除毛功所錯.

469
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:25,740
best about 200 Jin襲'v.

470
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:30,420
Newly diverted concubine Yin by Bunuqai?

471
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:31,900
Well....

472
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:36,620
Oh no.....

473
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:41,100
Beautiful and beautiful.

474
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:42,820
I can see the official coat color.

475
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:44,260
Not too much color.

476
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:46,300
Well, about 200.

477
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:49,300
But we have 12 of this coat.

478
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:51,420
Also less than 2,000.

479
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:54,820
Take a look,

480
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:58,100
Vice-Sister-in-Law

481
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,580
is serving the first primordial說.

482
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:02,420
This painting...

483
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:05,420
This painting is awesome.

484
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:11,420
This should be the true skill of the great Feng Si Ming family.

485
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:14,420
I'm afraid it's the true skill of the Wu family.

486
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:18,420
Qing Jia, this is from Si Mu.

487
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:20,420
It's different from these things.

488
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:24,420
Good.

489
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:25,420
Good.

490
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:27,420
It's very good.

491
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:29,420
Good.

492
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:32,420
It seems that we haven't seen each other for days.

493
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:35,420
Xu Jia is different.

494
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:38,420
Who sent these?

495
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:41,420
It was made by the previous-day people in the public office.

496
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:45,420
It seems that after I finished painting,

497
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:48,420
we have a lot of work to do.

498
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:49,420
Yes.

499
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:51,420
Thank you for your hard work.

500
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:56,420
You are the great Feng Si Ming family's master.

501
00:27:56,420 --> 00:28:00,420
Xu Jia is the hero of the whole Feng family.

502
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:01,420
Yes.

503
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:03,420
You made me look good.

504
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:05,420
You are right.

505
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:06,420
You are so good.

506
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:08,420
So you are doing your job

507
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:10,420
to protect the interests of the eyes

508
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:12,420
and take me as the so-called great work.

509
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:15,420
I'm not alone at that time.

510
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:22,420
Wen Yue, is the pot still boiling?

511
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:23,420
Yes.

512
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:25,420
I boil the chicken when you come back.

513
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:27,420
Wait.

514
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:34,420
Shen Shen and my sister are women.

515
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:36,420
It's not convenient to visit me.

516
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:38,420
I can forgive you.

517
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,420
As for you two,

518
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:51,420
I'm your nephew.

519
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:53,420
And you, Ci Qiu.

520
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:55,420
You are the student of Yunlu Academy.

521
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:57,420
I'm here every day in Yunlu Academy.

522
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:58,420
You two are my uncle and aunt.

523
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:00,420
We are family.

524
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:04,420
You, do you really want us?

525
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:06,420
We were worried about you.

526
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:08,420
We went back to the Academy together.

527
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:09,420
We wanted to take care of you,

528
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:11,420
but others were the first to turn on us.

529
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:15,420
When we arrived at the Academy,

530
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,420
we found Princess Lian An was coming along.

531
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:18,420
Mr. Zhao.

532
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:19,420
Mr. Zhao.

533
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:20,420
You brought her here.

534
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:22,420
There must be a way to save her, right?

535
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:24,420
Don't worry, Princess.

536
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:25,420
When you were here,

537
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:26,380
you were so capable and

538
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:28,420
so tired.

539
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:30,420
You had no trouble taking a rest.

540
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:33,420
You two come with me.

541
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:34,420
I'll go with you.

542
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:37,420
You are very delicate.

543
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:39,420
Until you knew that you were alive,

544
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:40,420
you were relieved.

545
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:42,420
So we went to the Academy together.

546
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:53,420
I'll do it.

547
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:24,420
I'll do it.

548
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:30,420
I'll do it.

549
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:40,420
It's a bit hot.

550
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:48,420
I'll do it.

551
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:49,420
You two.

552
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:50,420
So,

553
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:52,420
we wanted to take care of you,

554
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:53,420
but we didn't know

555
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:55,420
about Princess Lian An.

556
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:56,420
Until then,

557
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:58,420
she just took us away.

558
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:00,420
She said she was enough.

559
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:06,420
So,

560
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:08,420
it's Lin An.

561
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:10,420
Why didn't I see her?

562
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:12,420
She took care of you for two days and two nights.

563
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:13,420
But after all,

564
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:15,420
it's not right.

565
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:16,420
Yes.

566
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:21,420
Go down.

567
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:50,420
Lin An, wait.

568
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:53,420
Lin An.

569
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:55,420
As a princess,

570
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:56,420
you are a family.

571
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:58,420
You took care of a young man here.

572
00:31:58,420 --> 00:31:59,420
You are still...

573
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:01,420
still waiting for him.

574
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:03,420
No matter what,

575
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:05,420
how can you marry him?

576
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:06,420
Mother,

577
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:08,420
Xu Qian is my guest.

578
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:09,420
She has a husband and a son.

579
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:10,420
I'm a princess.

580
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:11,420
I'm a maid.

581
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:13,420
I should wait for her to wake up

582
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:15,420
and ensure that she is safe.

583
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:16,420
Mother.

584
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:18,420
Lin An.

585
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:20,420
I'll send someone to guard here.

586
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:21,420
Don't worry.

587
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:23,420
But you are indeed not suitable here.

588
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:26,420
I'll take her back.

589
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:31,420
How is she?

590
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:37,420
The hospital said she is fine.

591
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:51,420
Xology.

592
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:08,420
So it is.

593
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:11,420
I heard Lin An was drawn to the hospital

594
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:12,420
after getting brought back.

595
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:14,420
But I don't know what happened.

596
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:15,420
Ning Yue,

597
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:17,460
I can't say that

598
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:18,940
Lord Xu is so smart.

599
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:20,340
After he died,

600
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:21,420
he came back to Xu's family.

601
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:23,460
Not only that,

602
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:24,620
there's something even better.

603
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:26,500
There's something even better.

604
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:28,420
I was on my way back

605
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:29,780
and I just met Mr. Yang.

606
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:31,180
I rushed to the Hanling Courtyard.

607
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:32,380
I found out

608
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:35,140
that he asked Lord Xu to give me a reward.

609
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:37,540
And it's a reward.

610
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,420
What are you talking about? Tell me.

611
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:49,780
Your Highness, guess.

612
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:52,660
He's selling me a coffin.

613
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,220
I heard Lord Xu

614
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:56,260
gave him a reward.

615
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:58,500
He asked for a purple-brown.

616
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:12,140
Purple-brown?

617
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:13,100
Yes.

618
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:14,980
And the emperor

619
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:15,820
said yes.

620
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:21,300
You're so nice.

621
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:23,420
You're so nice.

622
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:27,140
You're not a fool.

623
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:28,700
This position

624
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:31,220
is actually for saving you.

625
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:32,460
Me?

626
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:35,420
At first,

627
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:37,620
I couldn't understand

628
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:39,620
the reason why Princess Ling'an reminded me.

629
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:41,660
Xu's family wanted to make a profit.

630
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:43,260
It's not stable

631
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:47,220
to rely on me and Ling'an to get along.

632
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:49,060
The meaning of this position

633
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:50,420
is not in the power.

634
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:52,140
Do you know what it is?

635
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:53,700
It's about

636
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:56,260
the glory and the social status.

637
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,220
No.

638
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:59,060
You're a fool.

639
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:01,660
It's about you and Miss Si Mu.

640
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:04,140
There's no difference between you and me.

641
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:06,620
Brother.

642
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:08,900
I can only help you here.

643
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:10,620
You

644
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,620
can't give me the real power.

645
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:15,020
You're so happy when you receive it.

646
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:20,300
Give it to me.

647
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:24,220
Here.

648
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:29,100
I'm happy when I receive it.

649
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:30,140
I don't think about

650
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:31,460
the status of a man.

651
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:33,860
I don't know what to do

652
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:35,460
with the value.

653
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:37,220
I'm not worried about the peace.

654
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:39,500
I have to go to the back door

655
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:40,820
and check it.

656
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:43,260
It's good to have a good position.

657
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:44,500
It's okay to talk about peace.

658
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:46,180
It's okay.

659
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:48,980
I'm in Guan Xing Lou.

660
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:50,260
I've thrown our Xu family

661
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:51,500
into the face.

662
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:53,500
You said it clearly.

663
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:55,060
Why did I throw our Xu family

664
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:56,300
into the face?

665
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:59,260
I said hello to Wei Gong that day.

666
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:01,020
They all looked at you.

667
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:02,740
I was so angry.

668
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:04,860
Do you know who's next to you?

669
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:05,580
Who?

670
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,700
An old man.

671
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:07,940
Old man?

672
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,700
That's Si Mu's father.

673
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:11,260
He's the head of the royal family.

674
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:14,260
To be honest,

675
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:16,420
the head of the royal family

676
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:18,980
is my future relative.

677
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:22,940
What's wrong?

678
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:23,660
Take it slow.

679
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:24,940
Don't shoot.

680
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:35,980
What did they say?

681
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:37,420
I heard it clearly.

682
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:39,580
It seems that

683
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:40,740
my brother is in the Academy.

684
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,180
A girl is taking care of him.

685
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:43,500
Girl?

686
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:47,980
That girl who sent the medicine

687
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:49,860
to the court.

688
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:55,140
What a pity.

689
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:57,220
She didn't meet him.

690
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:58,580
The royal family

691
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:00,580
should have the same face.

692
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:02,340
Otherwise,

693
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:04,020
it wouldn't be so stupid.

694
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:06,060
Mother is blind and vicious.

695
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:07,740
She does have a different face.

696
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:09,380
What does she do?

697
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:10,980
Is she a servant?

698
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:12,620
Where's the servant?

699
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:16,060
She's not a good servant.

700
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:17,580
She's quite...

701
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:21,820
She's quite a master.

702
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:24,660
Let me tell you this.

703
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:26,260
Father is a guard.

704
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:27,420
His official position is seven-point.

705
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:28,220
Do you know that?

706
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:30,420
You should say that.

707
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:32,060
His father is

708
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:35,220
seven-point than father.

709
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:37,740
Seven-point?

710
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:38,900
Seven-point.

711
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:44,380
Seven-point?

712
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:50,860
Your Highness.

713
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:58,180
Then,

714
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:01,380
I have no idea who he is.

715
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:02,140
Besides,

716
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:03,780
the clase Abbot is innocent.

717
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:05,300
The시부,

718
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:06,300
I'm a bandit.

719
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:07,260
Who's the bandit, Hi.

720
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:08,260
I'm not drunk.

721
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:10,180
That old man doesn't look like

722
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:12,260
a normal person.

723
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:13,460
How about this?

724
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:15,620
I'll explain it to him.

725
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:18,100
Dad, don't go.

726
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:20,180
As long as you don't follow Tian Luan,

727
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:20,980
it's enough.

728
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:22,980
How can you call him Tian Luan?

729
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:24,300
Maybe we can

730
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:26,580
get a good husband and a good wife.

731
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:27,540
What's your name?

732
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:28,980
It's called the old man.

733
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:30,580
What's the old man?

734
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,860
Is that how you talk to dad?

735
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:34,420
Come here.

736
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:34,940
I'm not.

737
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:35,660
I'll tell you something.

738
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:36,660
Come here.

739
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:38,100
Hey, come here.

740
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:39,060
We can get it from him.

741
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:55,060
Here comes the thunder shower.

742
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:57,220
growing

743
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:57,420
Fire

744
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:57,860
God,

745
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:07,460
I give you.

746
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:29,420
You're familiar with my feelings.

747
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:31,420
Can you tell me

748
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:34,420
who I am?

749
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:45,420
You should have done that.

750
00:39:58,420 --> 00:39:59,420
What was that?

751
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:01,420
What's that?

752
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:04,420
What you've experienced.

753
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:05,420
What I've experienced?

754
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:07,420
What I've experienced?

755
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:08,420
What I've experienced?

756
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:09,420
I think...

757
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:10,420
I think...

758
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:11,420
I think...

759
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:13,420
I think I've been influenced by many parts.

760
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:15,420
I'm more than you.

761
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:17,420
I'm less than you are.

762
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:18,420
I'm less than you are.

763
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:19,420
Who is he?

764
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:22,420
He's the princess.

765
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:24,420
He's the princess, right?

766
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:25,420
He's the princess, right?

767
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:28,420
You're familiar with my feelings.

768
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:30,420
Can you tell me

769
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:32,420
who I am?

770
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:34,420
Not yet.

771
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:37,420
You're a mortal.

772
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:41,420
You must bring your freedom to the end.

773
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:43,420
You must remember everything.

774
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:46,420
Freedom...

775
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:47,420
is the only way.

776
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:56,420
I...

777
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:57,420
I...

778
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:08,420
You got it, right?

779
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:09,420
Yes.

780
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:11,420
Why do you know

781
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:13,420
that Uncle Shen is in my body?

782
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:16,420
You mean

783
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:17,420
Uncle Shen is in a person

784
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:19,420
called Xu Xi'an.

785
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:22,420
Even so,

786
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:24,420
why did you tell me that?

787
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:27,420
Xu Xi'an has

788
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:29,420
something belong to me.

789
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:32,420
The meaning of the meaning?

790
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:35,420
That's right.

791
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:37,420
You're the one who belongs to me.

792
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:40,420
Xu Xi'an belongs to me.

793
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:54,420
Master.

794
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:57,420
Who is that man in black?

795
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:02,420
That man in black is Gao Shan.

796
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:04,420
The only thing I can confirm is

797
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:06,420
he's the person in the Martial Arts School.

798
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:09,420
He told me about Uncle Shen.

799
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:11,420
He wanted to fight with the government

800
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:13,420
and take you out of the prison.

801
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:17,420
Uncle Shen.

802
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:20,420
Please.

803
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:23,420
Please.

804
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:25,420
He's a good man.

805
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:27,420
He won't be able to come back.

806
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:30,420
He should finish everything he has to finish.

807
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:32,420
It's all because

808
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:35,420
your energy is your freedom.

809
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:38,420
So that man in black

810
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:40,420
wants me to have my own energy?

811
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:44,420
So Fengquan is right.

812
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:46,420
Before Uncle Shen's death,

813
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:48,420
he must not go out of the prison.

814
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:59,420
You risk your life,

815
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:00,420
but you're going to find out

816
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:00,940
that

817
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:05,420
if you can still do it

818
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:06,420
you must be brave enough

819
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:12,420
to be a الف Saver to stay in control ofMagical...

820
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:18,160
Life

821
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:20,420
Speed医生,

822
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:21,420
I can't see it

823
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:23,020
You're thinking so much now

824
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:24,220
You can't be in a hurry

825
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:25,220
Wait a minute

826
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:26,220
What's that?

827
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:27,220
Just send it over

828
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:28,220
You're still waiting

829
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:30,020
Someone has already sent the first box

830
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:31,820
No, no, I have to go too

831
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:36,820
Wait for me, I have a box

832
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:37,820
What box?

833
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:40,220
Is it a adult treasure case?

834
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:43,020
Big跟勇

835
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:44,620
Come to hit me

836
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:45,620
What big fire?

837
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:46,220
Look

838
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:48,020
This is a complicated answer

839
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:50,220
If I want to go to the beach one by one

840
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:53,020
I'm afraid I have to change four horses in a day

841
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:55,020
I only need one horse

842
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:56,020
What horse?

843
00:43:56,020 --> 00:43:57,020
The champion's body

844
00:43:57,020 --> 00:43:58,020
The champion's body

845
00:43:58,020 --> 00:43:59,020
Can be thousand years old

846
00:43:59,020 --> 00:44:00,020
Can be thousand years old

847
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:02,020
I'm not afraid of you going any further

848
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:04,420
But sometimes

849
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:05,620
It's not the way

850
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:07,020
It's the heart

851
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:08,020
Look

852
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:11,020
How can you make the words sound so serious?

853
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:13,220
Miss Wang is here too

854
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:14,220
Look at Wang Weng

855
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:17,020
The further the way is, the farther it will be

856
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:18,820
You should persuade her

857
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:20,820
My mouth is almost dry

858
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:22,820
Isn't this the hard food of the typical beauty?

859
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:24,820
One doesn't talk, one is called a devil

860
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:27,420
Why not find a surprise

861
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:29,420
To help the magnetist express his feelings

862
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:31,620
Also let Miss Wang face the path of the path

863
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:33,620
The magnetism is brilliant

864
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:34,820
Brother Song

865
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:36,820
Why do you say that you love me so much?

866
00:44:36,820 --> 00:44:37,620
Ningye

867
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:39,620
Do you remember my human horse experiment?

868
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:42,220
I finally developed a reliable

869
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:43,720
Exhaustive new weapon

870
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:45,020
The duck's electric car

871
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:46,920
No wonder

872
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:48,420
The first line of the watermelon-like feeling

873
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:50,020
The road is long and long

874
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:51,520
Song Li wants to be high-end

875
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:53,520
The duck's electric car can be satisfied

876
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:57,820
Long wind and waves will have time

877
00:44:57,820 --> 00:45:00,520
Watch the wind with the duck

878
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:01,520
It must be worth it

879
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:19,620
Enjoy the لاصص муж

880
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:24,520
A roof flutter

881
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:26,620
It must be an electric car

882
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:28,720
A superb friend

883
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:30,620
The one who can open the beautiful system

884
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:33,060
Ning

885
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:34,220
Lida

886
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:47,520
It is difficult to make proper 피망

887
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:49,520
The world is not good, it is not good

888
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:51,520
The world is not good, it is not good

889
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:55,520
The fate is not fair, it is not fair

890
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:59,520
The people are not cruel, they are cruel

891
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,520
If I want to be the black and white part

892
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:04,520
I will go with the gods

893
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:16,520
Who is he?

894
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:18,520
The heart is not happy, the people are not happy

895
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:20,520
The world is not good, it is not fair

896
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:22,520
Only my heart is not happy

897
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:24,520
Only the light is not happy

898
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:26,520
I am not satisfied

899
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:28,520
I am proud

900
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:31,520
I am a young man who is kind

901
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:34,520
I am full of warmth and warmth

902
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:37,520
I remember the past and the present

903
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:40,520
I will go with the gods

904
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:42,520
The world is not good, it is not fair

905
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:44,520
The world is not good, it is not fair

906
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:46,520
The people are not nice, I am proud

907
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:48,520
I am more suitable for the world

908
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:50,520
The world is not good, it is not worth it

909
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:52,520
The fate is not fair, it is not fair

910
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:56,520
The people are not cruel, they are cruel

911
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:59,520
If I want to be the black and white part

912
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:02,520
I will go with the gods

913
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:05,520
Who is he?

914
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:08,520
The heart is not happy, the people are not happy

915
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:10,520
The world is not bad, it is not fair

916
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:12,520
Only my heart is not happy

917
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:14,520
Only I am a coward

918
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:16,520
Only you are the best

919
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:18,520
I am a coward

920
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:20,520
Only you are the best

921
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:22,520
Next is the young man

922
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:24,520
Wei Feng

923
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:28,520
I am a man

924
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:30,520
I am a man

925
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:32,520
I am a man

926
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:34,520
Only I am a coward

927
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:36,520
Only you are the best

928
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:38,520
Only you are the best

929
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:40,520
Only you are the best

930
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:42,520
Young man is like Yun Feng

931
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:44,520
Who is he to me

932
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:46,520
I am a man

933
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:48,520
I am a man

934
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:50,520
Only I am a coward

935
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:52,520
Only you are the best

936
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:54,520
I am a man

937
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:56,520
I am a man

938
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:58,520
Young man is like Yun Feng
