You...

41
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,030
Who are you?

42
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,390
Who am I?

43
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,520
I've seen you before.

44
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,030
Are you the demonic hand
at the Sangbo lakebed?

45
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,000
I am called Shen Shu.

46
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,710
I wish to borrow your body

47
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:17,790
to nourish my severed arm.

48
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,760
I hope you can understand.

49
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,760
Why were you at the Sangbo lakebed?

50
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:24,710
Sangbo Lake?

51
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:31,080
Why was I sealed in Sangbo Lake?

52
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:32,880
Where did I come from?

53
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,030
Why am I here?

54
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:35,350
Who am I?

55
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:36,210
I can't remember.

56
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:37,560
In Sangbo Lake.

57
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,440
At the lakebed.

58
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,200
Why was I at Sangbo?

59
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,230
Where did I come from?

60
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,270
I...

61
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:50,470
I got off the point.

62
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:58,880
My primordial spirit is incomplete.

63
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:01,270
So, I can't remember
what happened in the past.

64
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:03,230
I only know my sacred title

65
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:04,960
but can't recall where I came from

66
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:07,030
or what happened before.

67
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:07,990
Master,

68
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:09,790
I have no grievance with you.

69
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:12,120
Why must you enter my body?

70
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,440
Someone

71
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:15,830
brought me to you.

72
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:17,640
Because we are the same kind of people.

73
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:22,520
Master, can you explain it more clearly?

74
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,080
I instinctively feel this way.

75
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:26,440
I can't remember

76
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,270
more than that.

77
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:31,560
Who brought you here, Master?

78
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:51,750
Follow me.

79
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:01,660
(Linyuan Pass)

80
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:03,340
(High with Moat)

81
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:12,470
That man in black

82
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,910
is the one who brought me here.

83
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:15,710
I once merged with him

84
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:18,270
and got this memory
from his primordial spirit.

85
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:20,520
Who is that man in black?

86
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:23,640
I don't know.

87
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,590
You merged with him

88
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:28,880
like you did with Heng Hui.

89
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,350
(The Sangbo Case)

90
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:34,620
(still has secrets behind it.)

91
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:38,030
(Could it be to merge with this demon?)

92
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,640
I am not a demon.

93
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,440
I am called Shen Shu.

94
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,640
How can you hear what I'm thinking?

95
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,200
I have merged with you.

96
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,760
I know what you're thinking.

97
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:50,390
Nonsense.

98
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,280
Nine, eight.

99
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:00,310
One, two.

100
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,520
Two, zero.

101
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:08,390
3.14159265597.

102
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:11,150
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 4, 3, 2, 1.

103
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:12,000
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

104
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,080
Stop.

105
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,000
Don't worry.

106
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,200
I won't harm you.

107
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:20,430
Yes,

108
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,390
I need to stay in your body for a while.

109
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:23,520
But your body

110
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,470
is much stronger than Heng Hui's.

111
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,560
I won't devour your energy
or kill the innocent.

112
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,680
I won't possess you

113
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,470
nor control you.

114
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,230
Fine, fine,

115
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,470
I get it.

116
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,080
You're like the worm in my stomach.

117
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:40,440
You know everything I think.

118
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,470
In that case,

119
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,350
I'll stay here and recover.

120
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,680
Thank you, benefactor.

121
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,000
No, no, wait.

122
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:50,590
Master, I'm just a humble Guardian.

123
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:52,200
I can't help you with anything.

124
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,960
You might as well find another host.

125
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,830
No.

126
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,790
Your body

127
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,200
is very strong.

128
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:00,750
I feel very comfortable in your body.

129
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:03,110
Also, inside you, there is something

130
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,510
that can help me nourish my severed arm.

131
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:07,310
Something?

132
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:09,110
What thing?

133
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,960
I don't know.

134
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,680
I only know

135
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,960
that thing

136
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:17,040
was not originally inside you.

137
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,560
Someone deliberately

138
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:20,680
put it there.

139
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:21,920
Well then.

140
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:24,080
Master, you can just
take that thing away.

141
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,510
- I absolutely won't...
- It's connected to you.

142
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,400
I don't know its origin,

143
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:30,350
and I can't take it away.

144
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,160
So, you're sticking to me now.

145
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,810
Besides using this place to recover,

146
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,280
there's one more thing

147
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:37,590
I need to ask you for.

148
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:39,110
Now you're going too far.

149
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:40,400
Help me search for the past

150
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,450
and recover my memories.

151
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,990
In the process,

152
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,710
I will give you some help.

153
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:47,710
Help?

154
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:49,560
There are few in this world

155
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:50,710
who can defeat me.

156
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:52,080
Those three Gold Gongs

157
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,300
and the sorcerer from the Bureau
were no match for me.

158
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:03,710
As long as I'm here,

159
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,590
it's like you have an extra trump card.

160
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,510
A cheat.

161
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:13,800
What cheat?

162
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,830
I am called Shen Shu.

163
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,320
Cheat Shen Shu.

164
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:18,590
No.

165
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,680
Master Shen Shu.

166
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,230
Master Shen Shu,

167
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,110
from my observations,

168
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:26,080
I now know some things

169
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,870
about your origin.

170
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,640
What do you know?

171
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,710
You must be

172
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:33,630
from Tianyu.

173
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,350
How can you tell?

174
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:40,680
Your demeanor.

175
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,680
I see.

176
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,440
So, I am from Tianyu.

177
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,560
Good, good.

178
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,810
I'll rely on you in the future.

179
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,750
Please take care of me.

180
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:54,680
Of course.

181
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:22,500
(Tianyu)

182
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,110
The soup base from the Dafeng

183
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:33,350
is way better than our Tianyu's.

184
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:34,190
Come on.

185
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:37,350
Bro,

186
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:38,830
we're lucky today.

187
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:40,320
With that wild rabbit,

188
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:41,990
plus a marten,

189
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:43,190
it's enough to make a fur coat

190
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,320
for our younger brother.

191
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,380
I'll go up the mountain

192
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:46,830
and catch a snow deer

193
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:48,160
to make you one

194
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,040
for the winter.

195
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,400
Stop.

196
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,040
Where are your parents?

197
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:54,400
I don't know.

198
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:56,750
Don't know?

199
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:08,350
It's a hallucination.

200
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:13,830
Without this,

201
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:17,440
how could I see the true form
of Tianyu Dharma?

202
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:20,590
Reveal yourself.

203
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:25,390
Who are you?

204
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,580
(Du'e, Tianyu Prophet, 3rd Rank Vajra)
Why disturb us?

205
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,730
(Duku, Tianyu Prophet, 2nd Rank Arhat)
A Hypnotizer.

206
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:32,080
(3rd Rank Hypnotizer
from the Witcher's Sect)

207
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,470
Greetings, Prophets.

208
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,440
Sorry for my rudeness.

209
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:38,920
I came to deliver a message.

210
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,160
Shen Shu

211
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:41,590
has emerged.

212
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:54,820
(Xu Mansion)

213
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,440
(What to do?)

214
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:00,630
(Should I)

215
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:02,750
(report this?)

216
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:14,600
(Guardian, Lord Wei)
As a Guardian,

217
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,280
you only need to stick to your duty.

218
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,400
Remember.

219
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:20,200
Even if the sky falls,

220
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,800
I will protect you.

221
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,110
(Lord Wei surely values me.)

222
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:28,630
(If he can remove
this severed hand from me,)

223
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,710
(then it's not a problem.)

224
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,000
(But if he can't...)

225
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:37,030
(Sangbo Lake, demonic hand, explosion)
(It's from the Sangbo lakebed.)

226
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,800
(Will he cover for me)

227
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,320
(or seal me along with it?)

228
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:53,500
(Tell the Supervisor)
The Supervisor...

229
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:55,810
(With his abilities,)

230
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:58,670
(he's surely able
to remove the severed hand.)

231
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:02,040
(But he's too mysterious.)

232
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:04,510
(Though I've never met him,)

233
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,990
(he seems to have always been
watching me.)

234
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:09,050
(Will he help me?)

235
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:17,420
(Tell the Supervisor)

236
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,160
(That Hypnotizer)

237
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:23,530
(used great effort to release the seal.)

238
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:28,040
(Why did it end up in my body?)

239
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,350
(Who is he?)

240
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:36,510
(What's his real purpose?)

241
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,650
(Will he take the severed hand back?)

242
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,760
(For now,)

243
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:47,450
(I need to find out his identity asap.)

244
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:50,680
(Well, the problem is back.)

245
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,680
(How should I figure it out?)

246
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:55,470
(Should I seek help from others?)

247
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,040
Keep the secret.

248
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:07,830
Master?

249
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,470
You're here?

250
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:15,760
Master,

251
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:18,160
do you have more clues about that man?

252
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,510
Tell me more.

253
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:21,760
Master,

254
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:26,680
you said we were
the same kind of people.

255
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:28,510
What does that mean?

256
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,630
Do you also pick up silver every day?

257
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,990
Or are you good at pitch-pot?

258
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,190
Ring toss?

259
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:36,110
Do you never miss it?

260
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:39,470
Master, say something.

261
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,230
Why not come out for a chat?

262
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:42,800
I'll make you a cup of milk tea.

263
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:45,400
Come on, Master.

264
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:47,310
Master.

265
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:48,190
Master.

266
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:49,680
Master, Master.

267
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,800
Master, say something.

268
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,280
Why just those three words?

269
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,470
Master.

270
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:55,710
Master.

271
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:57,510
Master.

272
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:00,620
(Haoqi Tower)

273
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,400
Greetings, Lord Wei.

274
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:08,920
You're here.

275
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:11,070
Lord Wei,

276
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:14,590
I heard that His Majesty
was upset at the Bureau

277
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:16,230
after knowing I took the Elixir of Life.

278
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:18,360
His Majesty's asked for it
for three years,

279
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:20,030
but the Supervisor didn't give him.

280
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:21,960
Now,

281
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:24,080
you must keep a low profile

282
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,870
and conceal your talent.

283
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:31,830
Make good use of the Elixir of Life.

284
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:33,920
Pair it with this diagram,

285
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,380
and it will make your efforts

286
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:36,560
twice as effective.

287
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:39,920
Open it and see.

288
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:49,680
The Visualization Chart.

289
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:51,920
Do you know it?

290
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:53,550
I do.

291
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,040
I heard my uncle mention it.

292
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:58,110
This Visualization Chart is
the key for me to break through.

293
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:02,400
Consider it your reward
for going to Yunzhou.

294
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:05,800
This booklet

295
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,870
records the methods of visualization.

296
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:09,160
You must learn it exactly.

297
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:10,250
Remember.

298
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:12,000
(Visualization Method)
The visualized form

299
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,040
affects the Fighter's mindset.

300
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,000
This spiritual energy is imprinted
by the painter

301
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,710
into the painting.

302
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:20,660
(Spontaneously)
After careful consideration,

303
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,080
I think this is the best for you.

304
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:26,470
Thank you, Lord Wei.

305
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,520
Lord Wei,

306
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:30,910
can I visualize

307
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,600
this diagram with others?

308
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:37,550
You only need to return it to me
in three months.

309
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:38,400
Regarding

310
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:39,920
what you do with it

311
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,790
and who you visualize it with,

312
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,680
that's none of my business.

313
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:47,960
Do I need to return it?

314
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:49,160
Of course.

315
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,230
Every diagram is priceless.

316
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:54,070
If it's damaged,

317
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:57,070
you'll lose your salary
for the rest of your life.

318
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,280
Understood.

319
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:03,390
By the way, Lord Wei,

320
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:06,400
there's one more thing I need to report.

321
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:07,550
Tell me.

322
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,360
Do you still remember

323
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,900
the Battle of Linyuan Pass?

324
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:23,750
Honey,

325
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:26,160
are you on duty today?

326
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:27,640
It wasn't supposed to be,

327
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,550
but I just received news

328
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:31,470
that Duchess Zhenbei has gone missing.

329
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,840
On-duty and off-duty officials
have been sent to search for her.

330
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,550
Good luck with your work.

331
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,840
But don't forget

332
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:41,470
to ask someone
to inquire at Yunlu Academy.

333
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,470
That unfilial child.

334
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:46,070
Why worry about him?

335
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,480
Come back.

336
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,470
Logically,

337
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,840
Xinnian should have returned by now.

338
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:55,880
When we moved,

339
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:58,270
Ningyan did write to him, right?

340
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,960
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

341
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,000
Come back!

342
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,840
What do you mean by that?

343
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,100
Dear, he's grown up.

344
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,750
He has hands and feet. He won't be lost.

345
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:07,710
What if he's lost?

346
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:09,590
- Will you ask around?
- What are you doing?

347
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:11,360
What's the matter with you?

348
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,030
You're not worried at all.

349
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:14,920
That's roughly the situation.

350
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,550
At first, I didn't believe it either.

351
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:18,790
But that old man was very certain.

352
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:21,470
He said he participated
in the Battle of Linyuan Pass.

353
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:24,840
He even said he was standing
on the city wall at that time.

354
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,600
What's his name?

355
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,120
He's just an ordinary old man.

356
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,120
I didn't ask much.

357
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,520
By the way,

358
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:37,960
he also said that he was standing
right behind you.

359
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,640
There's no one like that.

360
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:48,990
Lord Wei, think again.

361
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:50,600
He was right behind you,

362
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,160
roughly at this distance.

363
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,570
There must be someone there.

364
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,160
I'm a bit tired.

365
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,600
I'll take my leave now.

366
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,520
Lord Wei,

367
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,440
I think that old man is quite pitiful.

368
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,510
He's alone, with no relatives.

369
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:36,920
I thought

370
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,510
if you remember him,

371
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:39,960
we could leave him a way out.

372
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,550
Maybe some retirement money.

373
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:44,960
Why are you so sure?

374
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:47,880
He looks like a good guy.

375
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:49,510
He doesn't look like a bad person.

376
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,790
Besides, who'd want
to deceive a Guardian?

377
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,520
Alright.

378
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,360
Bring him to me.

379
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:00,160
I'll ask him myself.

380
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:01,870
What's wrong?

381
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,000
I...

382
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,880
I met him while drinking on the street.

383
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:08,750
Where am I supposed to find him?

384
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:09,590
You can.

385
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:11,370
You can definitely find him.

386
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:17,070
Signature Whitening Cream.

387
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:18,990
Take a look. Give it a try.

388
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:20,880
It'll make your skin
look as white as snow.

389
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,720
You'll look stunning.

390
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,030
Who is this person?

391
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,030
Anyone who could stand behind Lord Wei

392
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,030
must be no ordinary person.

393
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,740
(Zhi)

394
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:48,160
This unlucky fellow again.

395
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,070
I didn't pick up any money in Yunzhou.

396
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,400
This could cover my loss.

397
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:56,550
It should have fallen around here.

398
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:57,400
Right.

399
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:59,310
I just searched along the way.

400
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:00,790
Where could it have gone?

401
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,920
It shouldn't be.

402
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,400
In the last three months,
I've never lost my purse.

403
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,360
Why is it gone again today?

404
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,790
They're gone.

405
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:20,710
Let's keep looking.

406
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:25,790
Where did it go?

407
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:40,710
I heard that Duchess Zhenbei

408
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:43,600
loved wandering through the streets
in search of treasures.

409
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,510
In these busy streets,

410
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,840
we must keep our eyes wide open
and search carefully.

411
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,040
Yes.

412
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,600
Xu is back.

413
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,440
Yeah.

414
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,750
- Long time no see.
- I'm back.

415
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,160
You all go ahead.

416
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:00,590
You guys,

417
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:01,810
take a look over there.

418
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:03,200
Yes.

419
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:09,700
(Xu Residence)

420
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,280
Who is it?

421
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:46,960
Who are you?

422
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:54,550
Xin...

423
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:56,680
Xinnian?

424
00:23:59,030 --> 00:23:59,870
You...

425
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:12,120
Ningyan didn't write to you.

426
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:15,360
When I heard about this,
I rushed over to pick you up.

427
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,840
Why didn't you stay at an inn?

428
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,070
I don't have any money.

429
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,920
You can stay in the house.

430
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:24,990
There's no bed.

431
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:28,170
Why didn't you go back to the Academy?

432
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:29,920
The city gates are closed.

433
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,070
I've come to pick you up.

434
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:34,680
Let's go home.

435
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,880
My Lord,

436
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:41,120
I have

437
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:43,880
no family.

438
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,400
Xinnian, you can't jump.

439
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,550
- You can't do this.
- Don't stop me.

440
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,790
- No.
- I'd rather die.

441
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:51,600
You can't do this, Xinnian.

442
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,710
I have no family.

443
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:53,680
You have a family.

444
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,670
- I'm here to pick you up.
- No one remembers me.

445
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,120
Xinnian, listen to me.

446
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,990
Your room is all tidied up.

447
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:02,200
Come home with me.

448
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,360
- Come here.
- Let me jump!

449
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,310
Hurry, hurry!

450
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:09,720
Master,

451
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:12,070
are you sure there was someone
behind Lord Wei?

452
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:13,510
I've asked Lord Wei.

453
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:15,600
He said he didn't remember this man.

454
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:18,270
Did you get the wrong info?

455
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:23,150
Master,

456
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:24,160
are you there?

457
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,790
If you're there, answer me.

458
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:28,230
Why are you so quiet?

459
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,740
(Looks like he's sleeping again.)

460
00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:35,690
(Maybe I should take this chance)

461
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:38,340
(to tell Lord Wei about this.)

462
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:39,980
(That way...)

463
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:42,790
Master, you're back.

464
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:45,880
Master, what's going on?

465
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,200
Master, I'm sorry.

466
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,440
I was just joking.
Don't take it seriously.

467
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,000
Master.

468
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,640
You don't understand.

469
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,710
The human heart is complex.

470
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,750
People don't always do what they think.

471
00:25:58,270 --> 00:25:59,710
I was just thinking.

472
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:00,640
I'll never tell anyone.

473
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,480
Don't worry.

474
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:02,990
Calm down.

475
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:05,070
Don't be angry.

476
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:10,710
That's more like it, Master.

477
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:15,550
Thank you for sparing my life.

478
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:16,600
Thank you.

479
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:20,230
You're going too far.

480
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:21,510
I only hit you once.

481
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:22,960
You're holding a grudge.

482
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,510
Master, I'm sorry.

483
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:26,830
Master.

484
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:28,600
Master, I'm really sorry.

485
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:30,360
I'm sorry, Master.

486
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:36,160
Ningyan.

487
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,550
Cijiu.

488
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,030
Ningyan.

489
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,310
Cijiu.

490
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,120
You scared me to death.

491
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,600
I thought you were dead.

492
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:56,680
It's fine now.

493
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,790
I'm fine.

494
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,360
I'm glad you're fine.

495
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:01,600
I really thought you were dead.

496
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,160
When did you wake up?

497
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,230
I have great luck.

498
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:07,270
I woke up long ago.

499
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:08,790
How long ago?

500
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:11,790
A few days ago.

501
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:17,720
What happened?

502
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:20,840
My Lord,

503
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:22,550
didn't you just say

504
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,960
he woke up two hours ago?

505
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:32,270
Yes, two hours ago.

506
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:34,470
Right, dear?

507
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,960
He woke up two hours ago.

508
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:42,070
Right?

509
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,360
I can testify.

510
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,640
It was two hours ago.

511
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,510
It was two hours ago.

512
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,520
Xinnian,

513
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:03,790
you must have heard it wrong.

514
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,480
I clearly...

515
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,710
It's clearly in the middle of the night.

516
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:23,110
Cijiu,

517
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:26,200
hurry back to bathe, change,
and rest early.

518
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,640
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

519
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,840
Yes, yes.

520
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:30,720
No.

521
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,070
I clearly...

522
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:32,960
Lingyue,

523
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:33,960
don't just stand there.

524
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,440
Hurry and take Xinnian back to rest.

525
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,680
Yes, yes.

526
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,280
Xinnian,

527
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:45,310
let's go.

528
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,000
Wait.

529
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,640
Is this our new home?

530
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:00,270
Wow.

531
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,310
Green tiles and red eaves.

532
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,270
Luxury and opulence.

533
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,550
I'm sure

534
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:08,510
my room

535
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:10,030
must be very nice too, right?

536
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:16,510
Right, sis?

537
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:20,070
Take me there now, sis.

538
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,470
Our home is so beautiful.

539
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:29,310
(Modest and Curious)

540
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:31,030
This pond is so big.

541
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:33,470
Such a beautiful garden.

542
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:35,360
Every step is a new view.

543
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:39,270
My room is this way.

544
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:44,990
Father,

545
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,160
where is

546
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,510
Xinnian's room?

547
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,790
- Ningyan.
- Uncle.

548
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:58,600
Let's have a match.

549
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:03,630
Mosquito.

550
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,280
Go away.

551
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,280
Go away, mosquito.

552
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:22,220
(Modest and Curious)

553
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:35,600
Don't be so petty.

554
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,990
You'll be a Prime Minister.

555
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:41,960
Don't act so bashfully

556
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:43,510
like a little girl.

557
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:50,400
We didn't mean to forget you.

558
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,790
We just forgot.

559
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,720
How about this?

560
00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:01,440
I'll pay for your new room tomorrow.

561
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,330
You can choose

562
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:04,270
whatever you want.

Why has your temper gotten bigger

565
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,510
in these months of studying?

566
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:11,120
I can't please you now, huh?

567
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,270
You're going too far.

568
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:13,840
It's late. Will you let me sleep?

569
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:14,990
I have to work tomorrow.

570
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:16,440
What's going on with you?

571
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:17,590

of Linyuan Pass?

606
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:21,550
Right, go find it for me.

607
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:24,370
My Lord, I'm afraid you'll have to go
to the Ministry of Personnel.

608
00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:25,880
The Manual Archive doesn't have it.

609
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,070
Are you kidding me?

610
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,200
Our Guardian's Archive

611
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,990
must have more comprehensive records.

612
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:32,790
My Lord, you don't understand.

613
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,270
For normal secrets,

614
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:36,280
the Archive is indeed more thorough.

615
00:33:36,290 --> 00:33:37,160
However,

616
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:39,710
our yamen was established
in Yuanjing Year 19,

617
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:41,600
which is two years after that battle.

618
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,860
So, our archives
about the Battle of Linyuan Pass

619
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:45,640
are indeed not very thorough.

620
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:49,930
I see. Get back to your work.

621
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:56,750
Why is it two years early?

622
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:04,470
The Ministry of Personnel is
under Wang Zhenwen's control.

623
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:07,400
He and the Guardians
have never been on good terms.

624
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:09,030
How do I get in there?

625
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,310
Should I break in?

626
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:14,630
My Lord,

627
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:16,990
is the food not to your liking?

628
00:34:16,990 --> 00:34:18,710
Shall I change your dishes?

629
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:20,630
No need.

630
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,440
Sir,

631
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,880
you hurt me.

632
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:56,110
Sir,

633
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,240
come with me.

634
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:01,350
Yes.

635
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:17,950
Come here.

636
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:19,310
Yes.

637
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,590
I have something to ask you.

638
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:27,240
Answer honestly.

639
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,080
Yes.

640
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,470
Is Song Changfu,
Commissioner of Yunzhou,

641
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:33,150
a member of the Witcher's Sect?

642
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:34,860
Yes.

643
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:36,590
Well.

644
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:39,070
What about Yang Chuannan,
Commander of Yunzhou?

645
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:41,150
Is he also a member
of the Witcher's Sect?

646
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:42,590
No.

647
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:44,800
He has nothing to do with the Sect.

648
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,670
The master is right.

649
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:49,920
Though Yang Chuannan is stubborn,

650
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,360
he wouldn't ally with traitors.

651
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,320
One last question.

652
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:11,190
What kind of person

653
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:13,510
is your younger brother?

654
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,240
Aren't you

655
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:17,470
the eldest brother of No. 3?

656
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,630
What kind of person

657
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:21,840
is he?

658
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:26,870
You...

659
00:36:26,990 --> 00:36:28,110
You're not No. 2.

660
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:31,920
You're so weak.

661
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:33,920
You're not Li Miaozhen.

662
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,320
Let go.

663
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:37,360
You're hurting me.

664
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:41,800
Why are you unaffected?

665
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:43,920
You fell under my Charm Spell.

666
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,800
Just a gimmick.

667
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:50,130
It's a trap!

668
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:53,740
(Brightness Spell)

669
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,030
A spell book from the Yunlu Academy?

670
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:58,070
Who exactly are you?

671
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,150
Miss,

672
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:01,830
it's my turn to ask.

673
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:04,670
Answer my questions

674
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,030
honestly.

675
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:06,870
Understand?

676
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,550
Where's No. 2,

677
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:11,550
Li Miaozhen?

678
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,550
Why isn't she back yet?

679
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,550
Is she coughing again?

680
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,240
I had you ask him a few questions.

681
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:36,400
What did you do?

682
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,630
What took you so long?

683
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,160
Where is he?

684
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:42,920
Watch out, Master!

685
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,110
Winged Woman, Li Miaozhen.

686
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,510
You deserve your reputation.

687
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:00,240
Are you Xu Qi'an?

688
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:01,560
I am.

689
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:05,840
What could a mere Fighter do for me?

690
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:08,190
No. 3 is so ignorant.

691
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:11,720
Did you know I was here?

692
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:13,720
Did you tell him?

693
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,070
He forced me to.

694
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:18,720
What else did you tell him?

695
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,070
Just a little.

696
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,070
How much did you tell him?

697
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:25,920
Just a little.

698
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,240
I didn't say much.

699
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:30,150
Just your identity, age, cultivation,

700
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:31,280
your worldly experience,

701
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,150
and your crush on your senior.

702
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:39,440
I'm warning you.

703
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,630
Don't tell No. 3 anything about me.

704
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:44,650
If there is even the slightest leak,
I'll guarantee your tragic death.

705
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:47,190
Xinnian told me

706
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:49,360
that you both came to the capital
with a mission

707
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,510
and needed his help.

708
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,360
This isn't helping.

709
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,760
It's something he owes me.

710
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:56,900
No. 3 told me
you were good at solving cases.

711
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:57,800
I'm just okay.

712
00:38:58,050 --> 00:38:59,240
Then help me with something.

713
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:00,960
Let's hear it. I'll consider it.

714
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:03,760
Do you think we should
wrap things up here?

715
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:05,250
It's up to you.

716
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:06,590
- Then let's wrap it up.
- Three.

717
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:07,510
- Two.
- One.

718
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:08,350
Wrap up.

719
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,070
- Su Su, close the door.
- Okay.

720
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,240
Close your eyes.

721
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,480
Steady your primordial spirit.

722
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:42,390
I...

723
00:39:43,010 --> 00:39:43,990
Where am I?

724
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,720
In my memories.

725
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:46,990
This is the Empathy Spell,

726
00:39:46,990 --> 00:39:48,110
a secret method of our sect

727
00:39:48,110 --> 00:39:50,190
that allows both sides
to merge their consciousness

728
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:51,070
and exchange memories.

729
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:54,760
Is there a way to make it one-sided?

730
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,840
I don't want my memories
to be pried into.

731
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,800
I'm not as despicable as you.

732
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,840
I'll only merge this portion
of memory with you.

733
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,470
Very good.

734
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:05,030
Master, if you want
to interrogate Xu Qi'an,

735
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:06,510
why not try my Charm Spell on him?

736
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:07,430
Okay.

737
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:08,360
Know when to stop.

738
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:09,440
Don't go overboard.

739
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:10,720
Don't worry, Master.

740
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,720
Knowing when to stop

741
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,150
is my expertise with men.

742
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,120
That...

743
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,070
Is that a man?

744
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,120
Xu Qi'an.

745
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:34,150
Can you tell who this man is?

746
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:35,760
This man should be from the north.

747
00:40:37,990 --> 00:40:38,840
How can you tell?

748
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,660
A person is shaped
by the land they live on.

749
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:44,240
From their appearance and skin,
you can tell where the victim is from.

750
00:40:44,590 --> 00:40:46,880
Also, he has calluses on their palms,

751
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:49,280
and there's a thick callus
on their index finger as well.

752
00:40:49,330 --> 00:40:50,610
People who use knives and swords

753
00:40:50,610 --> 00:40:51,960
don't develop such calluses.

754
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,150
So, what weapon did he use?

755
00:40:53,470 --> 00:40:54,630
Just tell us.

756
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,160
It was a bow.

757
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,010
Exactly.

758
00:40:57,110 --> 00:40:58,400
This man was good with a bow.

759
00:40:58,510 --> 00:41:00,110
How can you tell that he is

760
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:01,320
from the north based on that?

761
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:02,940
I think you're just making things up.

762
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:04,630
Many people are good with a bow.

763
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:06,280
Couldn't he be from the military?

764
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:08,180
He's definitely not
from the military.

765
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,980
He doesn't have calluses
around his thighs.

766
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:12,360
If he were a soldier
who rode horses for a long time,

767
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:14,070
he'd definitely have calluses there.

768
00:41:14,590 --> 00:41:15,880
He's not a soldier

769
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:16,860
but skilled with a bow,

770
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:18,980
which fits the profile
of northern people.

771
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:20,760
People from the underworld of the Dafeng

772
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:22,360
aren't known for their archery skills.

773
00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:24,550
Could he be a bowman?

774
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:28,470
Who'd send a bowman
to deliver a message?

775
00:41:28,990 --> 00:41:29,840
This is most likely

776
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,360
a person from the northern underworld.

777
00:41:31,470 --> 00:41:33,670
As for what he wanted to convey,

778
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:35,400
who he was sent by,

779
00:41:35,470 --> 00:41:36,920
and who killed them,

780
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:38,240
I don't know.

781
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:43,190
Blood shall be shed for 3,000 li.

782
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:44,720
Blood

783
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:46,450
shall be shed for 3,000 li.

784
00:41:47,110 --> 00:41:48,240
Troops

785
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:49,390
shall be sent

786
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:51,240
to suppress it.

787
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,280
Blood shall be shed for 3,000 li.

788
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:00,760
What did he mean
by "Blood shall be shed for 3,000 li"?

789
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:04,550
What you saw is exactly what I saw.

790
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,800
Blood shall be shed for 3,000 li.
