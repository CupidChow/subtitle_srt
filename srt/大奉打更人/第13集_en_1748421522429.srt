1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The only thing that I want to do is to turn back to the past

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I'm afraid that I'll have to change my mind

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I'm curious what I'm talking about

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I don't want to think about the future

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
The whole world in my mouth

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Letting this bowl of soup and a bowl of tea

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
It's not very solid

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
When you're here

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I'll give you the rules

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I'll keep you under my wing

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'll remove this big piece of Wanji

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
We're ordinary

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
We're like a step by step

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
We're ordinary

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
We're like a step by step

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
We're ordinary

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,600
We're endure

18
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,000
We're like a Chadd

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
You can feel everything

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,500
It's a lonely class

21
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,600
Just blame your困惑

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,320
Someone 하고

23
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,560
Unless you wanted me, I could take them

24
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,760
I'm so stupid

25
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,920
With my hands,but can't show my Church

26
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,000
Just look at my girl

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The thee.

28
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,500
The Lady from the Man's Church

29
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,500
and Temple of of Love

30
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,000
with some sort of eye Beauty

31
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,060
As I garlic

32
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:22,420
To put-in it

33
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:24,000
It's time for me

34
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,500
Milk for you

35
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:26,240
I'm not darling

36
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,160
But I canี mama

37
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,160
1, die for 5 wardrobe

38
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,360
2, summation the disregard

00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,900

41
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,080
4, no

42
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,600
5

43
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:41,220
Lizard

44
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:42,720
5

45
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,420
Zhaixi

46
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,740
3

47
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,460
For No. 6

48
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,760
You get it

49
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,880
Are you insane?

50
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,200
Just said 3

51
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:54,360
All the others do

52
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,460
Are you crazy?

53
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,120
Mom

54
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,600
It's clear

55
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,000
I should not be beaten by those people.

56
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,800
As the sixth classmate,

57
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,400
I should bear these responsibilities.

58
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,400
Don't worry.

59
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,400
I will not regret it

60
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,800
even if I die.

61
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:12,800
Good point.

62
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,400
The third classmate is a high-ranking man.

63
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,800
I'm the one who is being touched.

64
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,800
Unlike the fourth classmate,

65
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,200
he is always full of human thoughts.

66
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,800
When something really happened,

67
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,600
I don't know where he went.

68
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,800
You tell me.

69
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,400
I told you,

70
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,000
I was not in the capital last night.

71
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,800
What right do you have to say that?

72
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:33,200
Are you a flying woman?

73
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,800
Are you guys eating?

74
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,000
Go fly her.

75
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,200
Fly her?

76
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,800
If I fly to the capital,

77
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,400
the first one to go to the Linbao Pavilion will beat you.

78
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,800
I said I wouldn't do the home job.

79
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,200
I can wait for you, little flying woman.

80
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,200
Wait for me.

81
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,800
I don't want to see your head.

82
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,200
I want to fly over here again.

83
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:48,800
Wait for me.

84
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,600
I'm waiting for you.

85
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,400
Wait for me.

86
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,400
What are you thinking about?

87
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,400
I'm thinking about the girl.

88
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,400
You entered the building yesterday.

89
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,400
I heard you kicked out the boss Yang and the man in the south.

90
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,400
Who told you that?

91
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,400
The man in the south told you.

92
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
The man in the south went to find the boss.

93
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,400
He scolded you in the Spring Wind Hall.

94
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,000
I'm in the Spring Wind Hall.

95
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,400
I can't stay here anymore.

96
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,600
I'm going to get into trouble today.

97
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,400
No wonder the wind is strong.

98
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,200
I don't want to be a man in the Spring Wind Hall.

99
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,400
Huaiqing is a good girl.

100
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,400
She's a good girl.

101
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,800
She's a good girl.

102
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,200
Don't call me a princess.

103
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,200
I'm so shameless.

104
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,200
I'm so shameless.

105
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,200
Huaiqing, I'm...

106
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,800
I'm the one who's wronged.

107
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,600
I'm wronged.

108
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,200
Huaiqing, I'm...

109
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,400
I'm the one who's wronged.

110
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,600
I'm the one who's wronged.

111
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,400
I'm wronged.

112
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,400
Huaiqing, I'm...

113
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,200
Huaiqing, I'm...

114
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,200
Huaiqing, I'm...

115
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,400
Huaiqing?

116
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,600
One beggar,

117
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,400
one beggar,

118
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,200
one blind man.

119
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,200
Today, I'll show up in Xu Qian's eyes.

120
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,400
I'll make them suffer.

121
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,400
And there's only one reason for this.

122
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,200
Huaiqing.

123
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,800
And we've been in a good mood all day.

124
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,000
This matter will never be leaked.

125
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,800
But I'll let Lord Xu

126
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,800
believe in it.

127
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,000
Since then,

128
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,000
Xu Qian will be wronged

129
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,200
by hearing Huaiqing's name.

130
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:50,200
Actually, I'm a bright person.

131
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,600
I'm so bold.

132
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,200
If I can't remember the name,

133
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,000
he'll think I'm...

134
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
a bright person.

135
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,600
I'm grateful to you.

136
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,600
Your Highness, you're wise.

137
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,600
You're wise.

138
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,000
Your Highness,

139
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,400
I'm Xu Qian.

140
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,400
That's a lie.

141
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,600
You're blind.

142
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,400
Get out.

143
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
What's this?

144
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Princess Qi Bing.

145
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,600
This matter is a crime.

146
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,040
I'm the one who's been

147
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,200
trying to seduce

148
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,200
these evil-minded people.

149
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,400
I'm trying to seduce

150
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,600
the princess of Zhongxiang.

151
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,400
Qing You, Sili.

152
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,800
You're so stubborn.

153
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,000
Shunzi,

154
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,400
get rid of them.

155
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
What are you doing?

156
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Look who's behind the scenes.

157
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Hurry up.

158
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,600
Yes.

159
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,600
Stop it.

160
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,600
I've already told you

161
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,600
that you're a bad person.

162
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,600
I've already interrogated you.

163
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,000
These people

164
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,600
are not intentionally

165
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,800
doing evil.

166
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,400
They're trying to

167
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,800
destroy the princess

168
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,000
by trying to

169
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,200
destroy the princess.

170
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,400
Princess,

171
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,400
guess who's the prince.

172
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,400
You must not have thought that.

173
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,600
Sorry, I couldn't speak.

174
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,400
I have to leave first.

175
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,540
Princess of the足

176
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,980
Phoenix

177
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:29,060
Princess of Aджang

178
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,060
you won't need to tell me

179
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:32,460
It's because you are dead

180
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,000
Princess Ling'an

181
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,000
It's a rare experience

182
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,120
My aide-in-chief

183
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,120
is coming

184
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,320
Princess Ling'an

185
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:49,760
What are you thinking?

186
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,140
Princess Xiping,

187
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:52,880
no need to.

188
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:56,020
Although Lady Linan wants to年mưng me,

189
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:58,100
I'm afraid she would not know

190
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,040
my identity,

191
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,940
or would not talk about it.

192
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:01,820
I do not know

193
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:02,820
the task of the rider

194
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:05,000
who can ride along the middle reaches.

195
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,980
Stop talking about it.

196
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:11,540
Even If you try to look pretty,

197
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:14,220
you'd really be able to tank.

198
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:16,680
What do you even have to worry about?

199
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,520
I understand.

200
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:19,920
I understand.

201
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,280
You do?

202
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,640
The reason why you tried to test me

203
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,040
before?

204
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,400
I'm the princess.

205
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,800
I know the truth.

206
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,280
You knew

207
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,200
Ling'an's will and made me fall in love.

208
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,800
You tried to test me last time.

209
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,920
Will you be responsible for it?

210
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,120
You guessed it right.

211
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,880
Don't worry, Princess.

212
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,280
I'm willing to do my job

213
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,720
with my actions.

214
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,840
I'll make these thieves

215
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,200
go back to the house.

216
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,440
No, thanks.

217
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,720
I know your loyalty.

218
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,440
But it's not a coincidence.

219
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,760
I need to interrogate myself.

220
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,160
Xuanzi,

221
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,040
you take care of her.

222
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,600
You

223
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,960
go to work first.

224
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,560
Okay.

225
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,120
I'll leave now.

226
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,320
Xuanzi,

227
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:14,640
watch your mouth.

228
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,520
Don't hurt the princess.

229
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,080
Okay.

230
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,560
Take care.

231
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,280
Are you okay?

232
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,200
What's wrong with you?

233
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,400
You're being found out?

234
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,880
At first, we were

235
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,240
so close to death.

236
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,520
We were so close to death.

237
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,440
But who knows

238
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,200
that Lord Xu

239
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,760
knows the master of the Academy.

240
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,200
A man should be punished

241
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,800
for his evil deeds.

242
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,040
Before we see the master,

243
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,920
we're also a real iron valley.

244
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,000
Who would have thought

245
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,560
that we'd be attacked?

246
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,680
We're still being beaten.

247
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,520
We've been punished

248
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,760
for our evil deeds.

249
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:57,560
Princess,

250
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,320
I'm really sorry.

251
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,680
Okay, okay.

252
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,240
Xuanzi,

253
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,640
send them 20 people

254
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,760
and let them go home.

255
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,440
Okay.

256
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,960
Thank you, Princess.

257
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,560
Thank you, Princess.

258
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,480
Thank you.

259
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,040
Sorry.

260
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:11,440
Slow down.

261
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,480
I'm sorry.

262
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,000
I'm sorry.

263
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,640
What's the matter, princess?

264
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:15,840
Please come in.

265
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:17,480
Thank you.

266
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:17,880
Calm down.

267
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:22,800
Come in.

268
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,120
Beauty Yu,

269
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,680
you're配.

270
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,600
Give me 500g medicine.

271
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,320
Come on!

272
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:32,960
Cover yourself.

273
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,280
All right.

274
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,760
Thank you.

275
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,360
We were really close to death.

276
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,080
Don't say that she's the princess.

277
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:44,160
Even I was touched by her.

278
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:47,320
She was really a great man at that time.

279
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,640
Do you think Huaiqing

280
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,280
was kind to you?

281
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,320
No.

282
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,160
Before she did,

283
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,480
she was strict with me.

284
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,280
I was confused for a long time.

285
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,040
Who would have thought

286
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,800
that you'd come to me with your own hands?

287
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,880
I was just about to die.

288
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:02,920
I was so loyal.

289
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,760
Then, is the princess

290
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,040
not suspicious of you?

291
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,680
Not only the princess.

292
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,920
I lost my life

293
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,280
in front of Wei Gong yesterday.

294
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,360
She's a good man to me now.

295
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,800
You're so generous.

296
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:22,960
Ningye,

297
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,080
thank you.

298
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,160
Xu Jia is rich.

299
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,600
He's so kind.

300
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,760
Where do you get this from?

301
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,200
I'll ask Uncle to teach me more in the future.

302
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:35,920
After all,

303
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,520
you're more interesting

304
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,880
in terms of being a man.

305
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,400
No.

306
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,040
When I saw

307
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,360
how Years'路 Engaged Was Disturbed by crash smooth byн

308
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,640
IからShewight.

309
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
It's not a dance with me here.

310
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,440
Are you going to teach me?

311
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,600
No.

312
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,120
Brett supports you if you keep seeing him.

313
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:50,960
You're much Không in the future.

314
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,320
No.

315
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,440
We can live together forever.

316
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,160
Uncle Zhong!

317
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:54,800
No.

318
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,480
The world is

319
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,480
your future,

320
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,560
your future,

321
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,960
and we're the future!

322
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,760
Uncle,

323
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,520
we come here without you.

324
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,120
You can't keep Ningye away.

325
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,080
You can still love her.

326
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,080
I'll teach you a lesson.

327
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,320
Don't hug me.

328
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,720
Don't do anything.

329
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,560
I'm afraid of you.

330
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:26,720
Mr. Tao.

331
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,400
Mr. Tao.

332
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,240
Where's Xu Xia'an?

333
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,080
I don't know. He was here just now.

334
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,440
Mr. Li.

335
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,560
Where's Xu Xia'an?

336
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,520
You're here to see Xu Xia'an again?

337
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,160
I saw this comrade.

338
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,840
He asked me to report to the police.

339
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,440
What do you mean?

340
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,840
Jiang Jingluo saw him.

341
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,160
He asked me to help him.

342
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,480
What kind of dog is he?

343
00:11:59,120 --> 00:11:59,840
Don't touch him.

344
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,760
Go back and tell Mr. Jiang.

345
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,000
I don't agree.

346
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,720
How dare you reject Jiang Jingluo?

347
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:11,760
Listen.

348
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,160
I'm here to inform you.

349
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,080
The adults are waiting for you.

350
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,680
Even if Jiang Jingluo

351
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,640
kissed me today,

352
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,080
I still have that sentence.

353
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,600
I don't agree.

354
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,280
Are you crazy?

355
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,520
How dare you be against Jiang Jingluo?

356
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,320
I don't care about you.

357
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,560
Jiang Jingluo, Li Jingluo.

358
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,280
Let me tell you.

359
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,200
When I call him,

360
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,960
you'll call him Lin Zou.

361
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:31,800
No way.

362
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,960
Are you drunk?

363
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,320
You're drunk.

364
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,040
You're drunk, too.

365
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,360
You're so ugly.

366
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,760
Who's ugly?

367
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,440
Tell me.

368
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,680
It's you.

369
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,760
Jiang Jingluo is not a good man.

370
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:49,760
Fine.

371
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,000
I'm ugly.

372
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:51,600
Listen.

373
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,880
Don't talk to me.

374
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,160
Xu Xian.

375
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,920
He broke the bed sheet.

376
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,640
Chang Le County's little fast-talker.

377
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,680
That's the one who broke the bed sheet

378
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,920
after watching the drama.

379
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:10,720
That's right.

380
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,200
Pingyuan is in charge of the murder case.

381
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,400
Although Wei Gong took all the pressure

382
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,160
from the court,

383
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,400
I can't let him

384
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,920
question my ability.

385
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:26,040
This guy is a good detective.

386
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,800
He's the talent I need.

387
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,560
He's a good actor.

388
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,080
When Tao Yingluo opens the case,

389
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,200
he'll investigate Pingyuan's case.

390
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,160
I think he's not just

391
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,760
a good detective.

392
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,760
What is it?

393
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,920
He's in a relationship with Siyin.

394
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,720
If he can get to my place,

395
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,200
I can buy him a legal weapon

396
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:49,560
and give him a chance to win our war.

397
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,320
What's wrong?

398
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,040
Li Yuchen.

399
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,760
You sent me back.

400
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,080
What?

401
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,760
Father, I've made it clear.

402
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,520
I want Xu Qian'an to be my wife.

403
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,520
Why?

404
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,960
I've been investigating the case recently.

405
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,920
Xu Qian is a talented detective.

406
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,240
She can help me with the case.

407
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,440
I'll make sure she gets the best training.

408
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,520
Father,

409
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,440
I have a lot of cases.

410
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,160
Speaking of the case,

411
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,960
Xu Qian'an has improved a lot in my life.

412
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,320
She's a good example.

413
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:25,520
Yang Yan.

414
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,880
I'll give you the position of the wife.

415
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,200
I just want Xu Qian'an to be my wife.

416
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:31,720
What?

417
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,040
The position of the wife is mine.

418
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,360
Why do you want to be my wife?

419
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,360
Father,

420
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,920
I don't want the position of the wife.

421
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,120
I don't want the legal weapon

422
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,360
Siyin sent me.

423
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,160
I want Xu Qian'an.

424
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,200
I don't want the legal weapon.

425
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,080
I just want Xu Qian'an.

426
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,320
I want Xu Qian'an, Father.

427
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,520
I want Xu Qian'an.

428
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,840
It's your business.

429
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,440
I don't want to be the wife.

430
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:51,880
Okay.

431
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,000
Give me a clear answer.

432
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,440
How can you give me Xu Qian'an?

433
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,200
I'll give you a clear answer.

434
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,200
I won't give you any answer.

435
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:58,880
You...

436
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,360
You...

437
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,040
Yang Yan,

438
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,720
there's a key soldier in the back.

439
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,280
Say it.

440
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,920
Jiang Jingluo wants Xu Qian'an.

441
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:14,520
What?

442
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,440
Sir,

443
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,280
you're not a man who's so brave.

444
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,480
Why don't you go back first

445
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,800
and tell us?

446
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:32,680
No need.

447
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:34,920
Mr. Jiang.

448
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:35,520
Mr. Jiang.

449
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,240
Yang Jingluo is just in time.

450
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:45,800
Can Xu Qian'an fall to my back?

451
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,160
No.

452
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,840
I'm a liar.

453
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:00,640
Let me go back first.

454
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,680
Control the rules.

455
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,000
Did you hear?

456
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,080
Jiang Jingluo and Yang Jingluo are going to Yang Wuchang.

457
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,960
It seems they're rules of oneellow superiorship,

458
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:27,880
they're both using this rule, right?

459
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:28,920
Is this possible?

460
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,480
What's wrong with Liang Yan

461
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,600
and Jiang Luzhou?

462
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:51,320
The gold

463
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,760
You must minder daddy's temper that will make them cooperate.

464
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:13,780
Jiangобo,

465
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,440
why did they betray Mingping?

466
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:23,360
Where are the

467
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,920
l 카메라 eros?

468
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,920
It's a fake.

469
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:29,920
Fake?

470
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:44,920
Yang Yue,

471
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,920
your opponent is me.

472
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,920
I'll take it.

473
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:11,920
Think it over.

474
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,920
Yang Yue is better than me.

475
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,920
If Yang Yue doesn't come back,

476
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,920
who does he have a relationship with?

477
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,920
What did she just say?

478
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:22,920
She said that

479
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,920
Yang Yue is the same as me.

480
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,920
It's Jiang Shao.

481
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:29,920
Jia Shao.

482
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:31,920
Who is it?

483
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:35,920
It's Ye Shao.

484
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:36,920
It's Jia Shao.

485
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:41,920
Yang Yue.

486
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:43,920
Where are you going?

487
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:46,920
Hurry up.

488
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:47,920
Come on, hurry up.

489
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:49,920
Brother, where are you going?

490
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,920
He went to the Jinuo Village.

491
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:52,920
Hurry up.

492
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:53,920
Jinuo Village?

493
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:56,920
Wait a minute.

494
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:04,920
He's the best.

495
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,920
Brother, what did he say?

496
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,920
I heard that the Ya Men

497
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,920
have a fake-signal-signal.

498
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,920
Look at the Jinuo Village.

499
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,920
Since the establishment,

500
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,920
they've never been fake-signals.

501
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:17,920
So good.

502
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,920
This is the layer of human's gold.

503
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:24,920
By the way,

504
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,920
what's the name of that copper-glazed-signal?

505
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:27,920
Which one?

506
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,920
Why are you asking me?

507
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,920
Are you stupid?

508
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,920
The dead must be all dead.

509
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,920
It's still a small copper-glazed-signal.

510
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:35,920
We have a deal.

511
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:36,920
Let's have a look.

512
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,920
You're right.

513
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,920
Do you know who the copper-glazed-signal is?

514
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:44,920
It seems to be Chun Feng Tang.

515
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:45,920
It seems to be Xu.

516
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:46,920
It's still a copper-glazed-signal.

517
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,920
Yes.

518
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,920
Which one is the copper-glazed-signal of Chun Feng Tang?

519
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,920
It should be me.

520
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:01,920
It's Xu.

521
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:02,920
Please come with me.

522
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:06,920
Come with me.

523
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:10,920
Brother, it's inconvenient for me to see the copper-glazed-signal.

524
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:11,920
Help me to help.

525
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,920
I want to buy you a drink.

526
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:14,920
The copper-glazed-signal!

527
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:15,920
The Jinuo Village!

528
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:18,920
The Jinuo Village!

529
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,920
Master Wei,

530
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,920
you're looking for me?

531
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:34,920
Come here.

532
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,920
Yes.

533
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,920
Yang Yan has broken the mirror.

534
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,920
He has practiced very well.

535
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,920
If he continues to break the mirror,

536
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:51,920
he will break the three-pin mirror in less than ten years.

537
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:53,920
The law says that

538
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,920
the blood is full of the blood.

539
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,920
There is no one who can break the mirror.

540
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,920
If he can blend the five-pin mirror

541
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,920
with Yang Yan's half,

542
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,920
he will succeed in the whole-footed.

543
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,920
He will not be under the flag.

544
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,920
So,

545
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,920
have you thought about who you want to be with?

546
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,920
I don't dare.

547
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,920
And you don't dare?

548
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,920
The 6th of the Heavenly Emperor's meeting

549
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,920
was also a sudden incident.

550
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:30,920
I also...

551
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:31,920
Enough.

552
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,920
I didn't blame you.

553
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:34,920
Sit down.

554
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,920
It's all about your future.

555
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,920
So,

556
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,920
I want to hear your true thoughts.

557
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,920
Zhang Shangguan is Jin Luo.

558
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:11,920
The prime minister is the whole-footed.

559
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,920
If he is Jia Shangguan,

560
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,920
the two of them will be the emperor.

561
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:32,920
How is it?

562
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:33,920
Do I have the nerve to be the son-in-law?

563
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,920
To the wedding dress of the emperor?

564
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:43,920
You are so fake.

565
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:45,920
How is it?

566
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:46,920
What did Wei Kong tell you?

567
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,920
I just talked to you.

568
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,920
Which Jin Luo do you want to choose?

569
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:10,920
Xu Jia Shang, you are so mean.

570
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:12,920
Let's talk about it when we get back.

571
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:13,920
Let's have a look.

572
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:33,920
Go.

573
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:03,920
No.

574
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,920
Father, you are looking for me?

575
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:14,920
They are all here.

576
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:16,920
Why don't you come in?

577
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,920
I'm not interested.

578
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:21,920
Didn't you say

579
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:23,920
you want to take Xu Qian

580
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:24,920
to your wedding?

581
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:25,920
What's wrong?

582
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,920
You are a famous consultant.

583
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:29,920
This guy recently

584
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:30,920
doesn't want to put me in his eyes.

585
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:31,920
It's all because of Xu Qian.

586
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:33,920
So,

587
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,920
you just spread the fake thing out?

588
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:39,920
Why don't you think of

589
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:40,920
the Weifeng of Yang Yan?

590
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,920
All right.

591
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,920
Call them back.

592
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:47,920
Yes.

593
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,920
Xu Qian's matter has been settled.

594
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:52,920
Who did he choose?

595
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:54,920
You think about it.

596
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:56,920
If I choose Yang Jin Luo,

597
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,920
whether it's to kill Da Genren

598
00:24:58,920 --> 00:24:59,920
or the other Jin Luo,

599
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:01,920
how will I be in Da Genren

600
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:02,920
after I die?

601
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:03,920
Yes.

602
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:06,920
You think about Jiang Jin Luo.

603
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,920
Jiang Jin Luo is a man of character.

604
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:09,920
No one can bully you

605
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:10,920
if you follow him.

606
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:11,920
That's even more complicated.

607
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:13,920
Let's not talk about

608
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:14,920
the face of Yang Jin Luo.

609
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:16,920
In the future,

610
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:17,920
I will be a little man

611
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,920
who will be a good man.

612
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:20,920
After we get along,

613
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,920
we can have a good relationship.

614
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,920
It's more unreasonable to stay here.

615
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:26,920
It makes sense.

616
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,920
Then, who do you really want?

617
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:32,920
Of course, I want to choose.

618
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:34,920
But

619
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,920
I have to let others help me choose.

620
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:39,920
Choose?

621
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:40,920
Choose?

622
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:41,920
Choose?

623
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:42,920
What do you mean by choose?

624
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:49,920
Who won?

625
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:50,920
I won.

626
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:56,920
If I didn't

627
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:57,920
take the breath of my face,

628
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,920
you would have won the game.

629
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:00,920
If I use my gun,

630
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,920
you wouldn't lose your job.

631
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,920
You are so stubborn.

632
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:08,920
If you want to try it,

633
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:09,920
just try it.

634
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:10,920
Okay.

635
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:11,920
Yang Ye.

636
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:12,920
Here.

637
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:13,920
Have some tea.

638
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:16,920
Yes.

639
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:33,920
Xu Qian said that

640
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:36,920
she has her own idea

641
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,920
about the transfer of the paper.

642
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:41,920
What did she say?

643
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,920
With my knowledge of Jin Luo,

644
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,920
I can't make the most correct choice.

645
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:50,920
It's hard to

646
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,920
practice martial arts and Yang Yan.

647
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:55,920
If you want to practice physical sports,

648
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,920
the best choice is to win the game.

649
00:26:58,920 --> 00:26:59,920
I don't want to win.

650
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:01,920
I don't want to win.

651
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:02,920
Or I want to win

652
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:03,920
because I am a fighter.

653
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:04,920
I am not a perfect fighter

654
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,920
who is pursuing the game.

655
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:07,920
What is that?

656
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:10,920
Do you remember

657
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,920
why you are so good at it?

658
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:16,920
Our Xiao Dong Luo said

659
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:18,920
the winner

660
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:20,920
is his own idea.

661
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,920
You are so stupid.

662
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:25,920
That's right.

663
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:26,920
That's right.

664
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:28,920
Since it's all wrong,

665
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,920
you should shut up.

666
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,920
Give the choice to

667
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:34,920
Wei Gong.

668
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,920
Why did you do that poem?

669
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:40,920
Isn't it too much?

670
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,920
You don't understand.

671
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:45,920
If I were to mention Wei Gong,

672
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,920
I would be afraid of being timid

673
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,920
and not having a good impression.

674
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:51,920
But if I mention that poem,

675
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,920
I can show my talent

676
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,920
and show my talent.

677
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,920
I am a good fighter.

678
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,920
Second, I can be a good fighter.

679
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,920
I can pull Wei Gong and I back again.

680
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:03,920
After all,

681
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,920
he must have liked that poem

682
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:08,920
because he liked it.

683
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:25,920
Good.

684
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,920
Xu Ji, you are not a good fighter.

685
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,920
Xu Ji, let me see.

686
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,920
No, I will go there.

687
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:37,920
I will go there.

688
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:38,920
I will go there.

689
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,920
Are you a bad fighter?

690
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:41,920
That's right.

691
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:43,920
These are all little things.

692
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,920
The number of the top four

693
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,920
is the number of the top four.

694
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,920
That is the B-shape of every fighter.

695
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:52,920
Fight.

696
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:53,920
Fight with someone.

697
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:56,920
Good.

698
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:58,920
Wei Gong chose the record for you.

699
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,920
That must be the best record.

700
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:03,920
Well,

701
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:08,920
can I be a little bit timid?

702
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:10,920
You want to be timid.

703
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,920
I am not timid.

704
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:20,920
Xu Tong Luo,

705
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:21,920
Wei Gong's order has come.

706
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,920
Which one did Wei Gong give the record to?

707
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:25,920
I don't know.

708
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,920
Li Yun Luo asked you to go there.

709
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:31,920
Is it?

710
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:32,920
Let him go.

711
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:34,920
This is the last one.

712
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:35,920
Su Qing.

713
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:39,920
Master Xu, come out.

714
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:41,920
Come out.

715
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:54,920
That's enough.

716
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:55,440
Thank you.

717
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,500
Xiaow

718
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:11,220
Caoer

719
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,780
is it from your point of view?

720
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,080
It's

721
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:20,480
from the well-behaved man.

722
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:23,920
I heard you housing

723
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:25,880
It's not your choice.

724
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:27,120
Of course not.

725
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,640
I'm just a small fellow.

726
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,680
I have no right to choose.

727
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,320
But I'm still far away.

728
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,400
I'm afraid I'll be in trouble.

729
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,640
Can I stay in the Fengtang?

730
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:43,120
Can I stay in your arms?

731
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,760
Stay in my arms?

732
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,280
Taoyao.

733
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,480
To tell you the truth,

734
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,800
I wanted to stay here for the first time.

735
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,080
But after going through

736
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,240
the trouble in this time,

737
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,120
I've turned myself

738
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:21,400
into a

739
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:22,640
oldWeigiped hospital.

740
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,120
I also feel that

741
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,120
when I was out of the case.

742
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:44,840
Although

743
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,080
you still have some misunderstandings with me,

744
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,040
I really want to

745
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,840
stay in Chunfeng Hall.

746
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,640
What did Eunuch Wei say?

747
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,040
Eunuch Wei felt strange.

748
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,240
He didn't choose the Golden Dragon.

749
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,040
He thought that

750
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,640
I would feel strange

751
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,240
if I knew him.

752
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,440
He was biased.

753
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,640
What Golden Dragon is the Silver Dragon?

754
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,040
It's not a big deal.

755
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,840
It's all a matter of reason.

756
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,840
There's no such thing as a high and low price.

757
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,640
Do you really think so?

758
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,040
I always think so.

759
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,640
But I don't think it's useful to be alone.

760
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:37,840
Who am I?

761
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:41,040
I'm just a small fellow.

762
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,440
I'm a despicable person.

763
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,440
I didn't understand until the end.

764
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:52,640
Er'er,

765
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,240
I owe you this.

766
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,640
No need for me to be in the Hall.

767
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,040
I'll make a plan.

768
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,240
I'll make a plan.

769
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:01,240
I'll make a plan.

770
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,040
I'll make a plan.

771
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,040
No need to make a plan.

772
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,040
No, you have to.

773
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,640
You have to.

774
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:06,640
You have to.

775
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,240
Chunfeng Hall is the best place for me.

776
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,840
Chunfeng Hall is the best place for me.

777
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,840
No matter where I will be sent to,

778
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:18,040
my heart will always be in the head.

779
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:21,040
I'll stay in Chunfeng Hall forever.

780
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,040
With your words,

781
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,040
I'll be satisfied.

782
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:35,840
I'll get you the order.

783
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,040
I'll get you the order.

784
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:00,640
Diao Ling.

785
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,240
Is it inappropriate to be here?

786
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,240
I didn't expect that

787
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,440
you would be touched by me.

788
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,240
You...

789
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,040
You...

790
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,040
You...

791
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,040
You...

792
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,040
You...

793
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:40,040
You are a big brother.

794
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,440
I'm fine, brother.

795
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,240
I'm too excited.

796
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,040
I'm so excited.

797
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:56,040
Wei Gong really sent me to you.

798
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:57,640
Wei Gong wrote it himself.

799
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,040
No one can change it.

800
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,440
It can't be changed.

801
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:04,440
Don't worry.

802
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:05,640
You can't change it.

803
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,440
In order to make other people's mind,

804
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:10,240
Wei Gong made a special move.

805
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,440
Three years.

806
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:12,640
Three years later,

807
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:13,640
you will follow me all the time.

808
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,240
No one will follow me.

809
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:19,640
You...

810
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,440
Three years.

811
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:33,840
Li Yuchun?

812
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:36,040
Isn't that still under Yang Yan's command?

813
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:36,840
Wei Gong,

814
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,040
Yang Yan is your son.

815
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:41,240
You can't be so modest to him.

816
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:42,640
How dare you!

817
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:47,840
You are in the prison?

818
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:49,640
It's been a while.

819
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:51,840
It seems that

820
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,440
it's not easy to accept the head.

821
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,240
After all, it's a fake.

822
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,440
It must be in a bad mood

823
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:00,840
to have a head like this.

824
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:04,440
Let's change the tone.

825
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,440
And a little bit of a snake head.

826
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:11,440
People are high and low.

827
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:12,640
The water flow is low.

828
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:13,240
Right?

829
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,240
In the future,

830
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:16,640
I will send Jin Le.

831
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:17,640
You are...

832
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,040
Pay attention to the road.

833
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,440
That's right.

834
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,640
There is no bad Yuan Xi in the world.

835
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,640
Please treat him as a teacher.

836
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,240
Please run away.

837
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:32,840
You still sit here and do the dishes.

838
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:33,840
Come here.

839
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,440
Did I do it wrong?

840
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:36,440
Why is he smiling?

841
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,040
The last one is strong.

842
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,440
Then let's say it.

843
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,640
We will call each other brothers in the future.

844
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,240
If anyone dares to bully you,

845
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,040
it means that I will bully Chun Tongtang.

846
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,240
I will never forgive him.

847
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,040
Brother, Xiao Zhang.

848
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,240
The last bowl of beef.

849
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:54,840
Follow me and do well.

850
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,640
I will do my best to be with you.

851
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:57,440
No.

852
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:58,640
Do well.

853
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,040
The last one.

854
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,040
What are you two doing wrong?

855
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:05,840
Go to work.

856
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:06,640
Okay.

857
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:14,840
You can keep a place for a while.

858
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,640
We will drink a little.

859
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:17,440
I will treat you.

860
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,040
Yes.

861
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,240
You are good at fighting.

862
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:23,840
Brother Chun.

863
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:27,640
Success.

864
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,240
You are right.

865
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:35,440
Ying.

866
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:37,440
Ying.

867
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,640
What's the situation?

868
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:40,640
Did I hear wrong?

869
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,640
What's the situation?

870
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,440
I want to know what the situation is.

871
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:49,440
Let's go.

872
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:50,840
Send the money.

873
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:52,840
The money.

874
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,040
Actually, I think it's enough.

875
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,440
It's a little bit too much.

876
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:07,240
Do you want me to drink some?

877
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,440
I want to go in.

878
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,440
Today.

879
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,840
This is aTIA battle.

880
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:28,400
We are to take a stand.

881
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,240
Your Highness.

882
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:32,840
customsoly.

883
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,040
I apologize.

884
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,840
I will be your general official.

885
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:42,080
But do I know

886
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:45,640
why you choose Li Yuchun?

887
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:47,840
Carly compare with Link.

888
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,920
He needs a person with a character.

889
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:50,880
As a superior.

890
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,120
Li Yuchun is a man.

891
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:57,040
He has a sharp eye.

892
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,160
He will have a conflict

893
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,880
with anyone in the world.

894
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,360
That's the way it is.

895
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:06,880
But Li Yuchun is just a silver-gatherer.

896
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,000
How could Xu Qian'an serve him?

897
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,240
He will.

898
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:17,720
They...

899
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:19,800
are all human beings.

900
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,680
Since you chose me,

901
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,680
you must follow my way.

902
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,960
As a man,

903
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,360
you can't be a traitor.

904
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,080
You can't be a traitor.

905
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:37,080
You can't be a man.

906
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:38,840
Otherwise,

907
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,280
you will be a fake.

908
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,760
You will be standing on a higher position

909
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:44,920
than a fake.

910
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,880
I will never forgive you.

911
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,040
In your opinion,

912
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,680
Xu Qian'an is more than a man.

913
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,520
If that's the case,

914
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:57,920
don't worry about me.

915
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:01,880
Today,

916
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:05,040
we won't talk about the palace.

917
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,560
Let's go!

918
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:08,560
Let's go!

919
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:10,720
Come on, let's go!

920
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:11,720
Come on!

921
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:12,720
Let's go!

922
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:13,720
You will be in the Spring Palace.

923
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:14,720
I will take you there.

924
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:15,200
Come on!

925
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,200
You will be in the Spring Palace.

926
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,720
You will be in the Spring Palace.

927
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,400
What's the matter?

928
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,400
What's the matter?

929
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:28,520
Come here.

930
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,560
I just told you to follow me.

931
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,360
Go to work.

932
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,360
Yes.

933
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:48,720
I just told you to follow me.

934
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:49,720
Go to work.

935
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:50,720
Go to work.

936
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:51,720
Go to work.

937
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:52,720
Go to work.

938
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:53,720
Go to work.

939
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:54,720
Go to work.

940
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:55,720
Go to work.

941
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:56,720
Go to work.

942
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:57,720
Go to work.

943
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:58,720
Go to work.

944
00:43:58,720 --> 00:43:59,720
Go to work.

945
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:00,720
Go to work.

946
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:01,720
Go to work.

947
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:02,720
Go to work.

948
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:03,720
Go to work.

949
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:04,720
Go to work.

950
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:05,720
Go to work.

951
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:06,720
Go to work.

952
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:07,720
