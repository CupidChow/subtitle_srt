Do you

71
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,000
Yeah?

72
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,280
Do you

73
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,660
Who Am I

74
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:09,220
I have seen you

75
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:11,380
Are you a model of Sand lineage Holy spirit?

76
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,820
Because of

77
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,360
Fortress

78
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,480
Want to cheer thelait

00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,120
ofademically

80
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,840
into digging spMO

81
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,840
Why are you in Sangbo Lake?

82
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,800
Sangbo Lake?

83
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,120
Why am I in Sangbo Lake?

84
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Where did I come from?

85
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,200
Why am I here?

86
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,320
Who am I?

87
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,360
I can't remember.

88
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,440
Sangbo Lake.

89
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,320
Why am I in Sangbo?

90
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,440
Where did I come from?

91
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,440
I...

92
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,520
I'm here.

93
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,160
I'm a bike and a bin.

94
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,440
I owe it to a city court

95
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:58,960
Even I don't suffer,

96
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,200
your life is just meaningless.

97
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,360
Rain or thunder,

98
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,080
I have great origin.

99
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,080
I can't remember what happened.

100
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,160
I just know my number.

101
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,840
But I didn't know I came from the south.

102
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,320
What happened before?

103
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,480
Master, can you explain it more clearly?

104
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,960
I can't feel it.

105
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,240
I can't remember much more.

106
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,560
Who brought you here?

107
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,080
Go along.

108
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:14,240
That martial visibility was the one who sent me here.

109
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,160
I've那我們ized her

110
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,720
and she was able to leave a hold of her idea to me.

111
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,720
Who is that black robe man?

112
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,720
I don't know.

113
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,720
You and him have been together.

114
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,720
You and Heng Hui.

115
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,720
Like your wife,

116
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,720
there is a miracle behind you.

117
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,720
Is it because of the magic of the eye?

118
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,720
I'm not a magic.

119
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,720
I'm a god.

120
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,720
How can you hear what I said?

121
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,720
I've been with you.

122
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,720
I've been thinking about it.

123
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,720
You're so stupid.

124
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,720
Ninth.

125
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,720
One, two.

126
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,720
Twenty.

127
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:12,720
3.14159265597123457894321123456

128
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,720
Stop.

129
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,720
Don't worry.

130
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,720
I won't harm you.

131
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,720
Yes.

132
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,720
I want to be with you for a while.

133
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,720
But your body is much bigger than Heng Hui.

134
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,720
I won't swallow blood and kill innocent people.

135
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,720
You won't take it.

136
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,720
And you won't control it.

137
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,720
Okay, okay.

138
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,720
I know.

139
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,720
The big thing is the revenge in my stomach.

140
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,720
You know what I want.

141
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:44,720
I'll take care of it.

142
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,720
Thank you, master.

143
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,720
No, no, no.

144
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,720
Master, I'm just a small man.

145
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,720
I can't help you.

146
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,720
You'd better change your mind.

147
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,720
Master,

148
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,720
master's body is very big.

149
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,720
And I'm very comfortable in your body.

150
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,720
And you have something inside.

151
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,720
It can help me to take care of it.

152
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,720
Something?

153
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,720
What is it?

154
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,720
I don't know.

155
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,720
I just want to take it.

156
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,720
It's not in your body.

157
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,720
Someone deliberately put it here.

158
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,720
Okay, master.

159
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,720
You take it away.

160
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,720
I won't...

161
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,720
It's connected to you.

162
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,720
I know nothing about it.

163
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,720
I can't take it away.

164
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,720
You're just a small man.

165
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,720
Besides the warmth,

166
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,720
I want to ask you something.

167
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,720
You're too much.

168
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,720
Help me to find the memory.

169
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,720
In this process,

170
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,720
I'll give you a certain help.

171
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,720
Help?

172
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,720
In this world,

173
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,720
no one can defeat me.

174
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,720
The three Jinluos and the four Heavens

175
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,720
are not my opponents.

176
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,720
If I'm here,

177
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,720
you'll be more understanding.

178
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,720
Foreigner?

179
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,720
What's the foreign name?

180
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,720
My name is Shen Shu.

181
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,720
Oh, Shen Shu Foreigner.

182
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,720
No, it's Master Shen Shu.

183
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,720
Master Shen Shu.

184
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,720
Through my observation,

185
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,720
I know some information

186
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,720
about your arrival.

187
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,720
What?

188
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,720
You're from the Heavens.

189
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,720
How can I see it?

190
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,720
You're so mad.

191
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,720
I see.

192
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,720
I'm a man of the Heavens.

193
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,720
Okay.

194
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,720
I'll take care of you.

195
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,720
I'll take care of you.

196
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,720
Good.

197
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,720
From the bottom of the red boulders,

198
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,720
it's impossible to compare.

199
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,720
Come on.

200
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,720
Brother,

201
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,720
we've lost a lot of time today.

202
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,720
We can't compare with that.

203
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,720
I'm going to take a look.

204
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,720
You're so mad.

205
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,720
I'm so mad.

206
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,720
I can't compare with that.

207
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,720
I can't compare with that.

208
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,720
I'm so mad.

209
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,720
I can't compare with that.

210
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,720
I can't compare with that.

211
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,720
I can't compare with that.

212
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,880
Jin Shoushou is quite clever.

213
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:45,440
Plus the muday

I do not know

219
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,120
You do not know

220
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:57,840
We can do this together.

221
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,320
Four.

222
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:07,940
ERS?

223
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:14,700
You don't need to have this.

224
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:18,420
May you gain theكairy token.

225
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:21,540
You can påer up first.

00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:26,180
Wei'er.

227
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:28,160
Why do you order us to beation?

228
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,500
Disciple of clan Lan.

231
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:58,180
What should we do?

232
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:02,180
Should we tell them about this?

233
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:16,180
As a worker, you must take the responsibility.

234
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:18,180
Remember,

235
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:21,180
I'll protect you when the sky falls.

236
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:24,180
I'm very cautious.

237
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,180
If I can get this broken hand out for me,

238
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:31,180
it's not a big deal.

239
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:33,180
If I can't,

240
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:36,180
it's a dirty thing after all.

241
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:38,180
Will it cover me

242
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:41,180
or will it seal me with me?

243
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:42,180
It's a secret.

244
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:53,180
Qian Zheng?

245
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:56,180
With his ability,

246
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:59,180
he can definitely get me a broken hand.

247
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:02,180
Mr. Qian is so weird.

248
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:04,180
Although I haven't seen him,

249
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:07,180
he's always keeping an eye on me.

250
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,180
Will he help me?

251
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,180
Mr. Lin,

252
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,180
you've been working so hard

253
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:17,180
to release Feng Yingmu.

254
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:21,180
Why is he in my body?

255
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:28,180
Who is he?

256
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:30,180
What's his purpose?

257
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:34,180
Will he take the broken hand back?

258
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,180
I don't think so.

259
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:40,180
I think he's more important than me.

260
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:43,180
I've been working so hard,

261
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:46,180
I have to figure out his identity as soon as possible.

262
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:49,180
Okay, the problem is back.

263
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,180
How should I figure it out?

264
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,180
Don't beg others.

265
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:57,180
Keep it a secret.

266
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:07,180
Master.

267
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:09,180
Where are you?

268
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,180
Where are you?

269
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:15,180
Master.

270
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:17,180
Do you have the clue?

271
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:19,180
Give me some more.

272
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:21,180
Master.

273
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:24,180
You just said

274
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:26,180
you and I are the same kind of people.

275
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:28,180
What does that mean?

276
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:30,180
Do you lose money every day?

277
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:32,180
Or do you

278
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:33,180
spend a lot of money

279
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:35,180
to make money?

280
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:38,180
Master, you're so ridiculous.

281
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:41,180
Why don't you come out and we'll hang out?

282
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:43,180
I'll get you a cup of milk tea.

283
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:45,180
Master.

284
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:47,180
Master.

285
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,180
Master.

286
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:49,180
Master.

287
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:50,180
Master.

288
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:51,180
Master, you're so ridiculous.

289
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:53,180
You're just a fool.

290
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:54,180
Master.

291
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:55,180
Master.

292
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:56,180
Master.

293
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:57,180
Master.

294
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:06,180
I've got three more.

295
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,180
Hello, Master Wei.

296
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:08,180
Yes.

297
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:09,180
You're here.

298
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:11,180
Master Wei.

299
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:14,180
I heard that you got my talisman.

300
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:16,180
It's not bad for the Four Heavens.

301
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:18,180
His Majesty has been begging for three years.

302
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:20,180
He hasn't given it to you.

303
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:24,180
Now, you go and practice the seal.

304
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:26,180
You'll be more enlightened.

305
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:32,180
You should use the talisman well.

306
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:34,180
You should practice with this painting.

307
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:36,180
You'll be more enlightened.

308
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:39,180
Open it.

309
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:49,180
The Talisman of the View.

310
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:51,180
You know it?

311
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:53,180
Yes.

312
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,180
I heard from my uncle.

313
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:56,180
The Talisman of the View

314
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:57,180
is the miracle of my breakthrough.

315
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:01,180
This painting is your reward for going to Yunzhou.

316
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:08,180
This book records the magic door of the Talisman of the View.

317
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:09,180
You must learn it.

318
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:12,180
Remember, the magic door of the View

319
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:14,180
will affect the mind of the dancer.

320
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:18,180
This spirit will be the one who will paint the seal in the painting.

321
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:20,180
I chose the wine.

322
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:23,180
I think this one is the most suitable for you.

323
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:26,180
Thank you, Master Wei.

324
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:28,180
Master Wei.

325
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:31,180
Can I use this painting

326
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:33,180
to the other people's attention?

327
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:37,180
You just give it back to me after three months.

328
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:39,180
As for what you use it for,

329
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:43,180
it has nothing to do with me.

330
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:47,180
You still want to give it back?

331
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:49,180
Of course.

332
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:52,180
Every painting is worth the effort.

333
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:53,180
If it's damaged,

334
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:56,180
you'll have no way to live.

335
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:01,180
Yes.

336
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:03,180
By the way, Master Wei.

337
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:06,180
There's one more thing that needs your report.

338
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,180
Go ahead.

339
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:10,180
Do you still remember the Spirit Garden's official camp?

340
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:22,180
The Spirit Garden said that the magic door of the View

341
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:23,180
can be used to the people's eyes.

342
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:25,180
The Spirit Garden can create a great future.

343
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:27,180
The Spirit Garden...

344
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:29,180
The Spirit Garden has 60 times the speed of the Spirit Garden.

345
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:35,180
The child is the future of the people's eyes.

346
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:37,180
The Spirit Garden is the source of the energy.

347
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:39,180
The Spirit Garden is the source of the energy.

348
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:53,180
Master Wei.

349
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:56,180
You're in charge of the job today?

350
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:57,180
No.

351
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:59,180
I just received a message

352
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:01,180
that the Princess Consort of the North is leaving.

353
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:04,180
The people in the house are being taken away by the servants.

354
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:06,180
Thank you, Master.

355
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,180
But, Master.

356
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:09,180
Don't forget to ask the Spirit Garden

357
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:11,180
for help.

358
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:14,180
You're so unfilial.

359
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:15,180
You even miss her.

360
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:17,180
Come back.

361
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:21,180
Li Shuang,

362
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:23,180
the Second Master should be back.

363
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:26,180
Let's see if the First Master

364
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:27,180
has any news for her.

365
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:28,180
I don't know.

366
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:29,180
I don't know.

367
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:30,180
Come back.

368
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:33,180
What do you mean?

369
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:34,180
Madam, she's a grown-up.

370
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:35,180
She's a good girl.

371
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:36,180
She's even lost her temper.

372
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:37,180
Come back.

373
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:38,180
Come back.

374
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:39,180
Hurry up.

375
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:40,180
What a bad luck.

376
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:42,180
I'm not worried at all.

377
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:44,180
That's probably the case.

378
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:45,180
I didn't believe it at first.

379
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:47,180
But that old man was so wise.

380
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:50,180
He said he had participated in the Spirit Garden.

381
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:51,180
He also said

382
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:54,180
he was standing on the wall at that time.

383
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:56,180
What's his name?

384
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:58,180
He's an ordinary man.

385
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:59,180
I didn't ask him much.

386
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:01,180
By the way,

387
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:02,180
he also said

388
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:04,180
he was standing behind the Spirit Garden.

389
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:12,180
There's no one like him.

390
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:15,180
No.

391
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:16,180
Think about it.

392
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:17,180
He's right behind you.

393
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:19,180
Probably in this distance.

394
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:21,180
There must be.

395
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:23,180
I'm a little tired.

396
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:31,180
I'll take my leave.

397
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:52,180
Mr. Wei.

398
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:55,180
I think that old man is quite pitiful.

399
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:57,180
He's no match for any family.

400
00:20:58,180 --> 00:20:59,180
I think

401
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:00,180
if you can remember him,

402
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:02,180
you can leave a message

403
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:03,180
and give him some money.

404
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,180
Why are you so sure?

405
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:11,180
That old man looks like a bad guy.

406
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,180
Besides,

407
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:14,180
he's a bad guy.

408
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:16,180
He's a bad guy.

409
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:17,180
He's a bad guy.

410
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:18,180
He's a bad guy.

411
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:19,180
He's a bad guy.

412
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:20,180
Besides,

413
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:21,180
it's not like you're looking for death

414
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:22,180
when you're cheating on someone.

415
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:26,180
Fine.

416
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:27,180
You can find him.

417
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:29,180
I'll ask him in person.

418
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:31,180
What?

419
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:34,180
I...

420
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:36,180
I know him on the street.

421
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:38,180
I can't find him anywhere.

422
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:39,180
You?

423
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:40,180
You must be.

424
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:46,180
Zhao Pei, Yan Gong.

425
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,180
Look at him.

426
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:49,180
He's a good guy.

427
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:50,180
He's a good guy.

428
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:53,180
Who is he?

429
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,180
He must be

430
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,180
a good guy.

431
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:58,180
He's not a bad guy.

432
00:21:58,180 --> 00:21:59,180
I know him on the street.

433
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:00,180
He's a bad guy.

434
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:06,180
Fine.

435
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,180
It's not that bad.

436
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:21,180
I haven't seen him in a long time.

437
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:22,180
I'll go back.

438
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:25,180
I should have gone to the police station.

439
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:26,180
Yes.

440
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:28,180
I just found a way.

441
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,180
Where did he go?

442
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:31,180
I shouldn't have.

443
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:33,180
I haven't been to the river bank

444
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:35,180
for three months.

445
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:37,180
Why am I gone again?

446
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:48,180
Thank you.

447
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:49,180
Fine.

448
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:50,180
I'll go in.

449
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,180
Where are you going?

450
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:09,180
I heard that

451
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:10,180
the Princess of Zhenbei

452
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,180
likes to walk around

453
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:12,180
and wear a dress.

454
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:14,180
Look at the place.

455
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:15,180
The scene is so beautiful.

456
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:17,180
You should look at it carefully.

457
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:18,180
Yes.

458
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:20,180
Qin, you're back.

459
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:22,180
I'm back.

460
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:23,180
I'm back.

461
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:24,180
I'm back.

462
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:25,180
I'm back.

463
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:26,180
You guys play.

464
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:30,180
You guys.

465
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:31,180
Look over there.

466
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,180
Yes.

467
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:45,180
Who's there?

468
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:16,180
Who are you?

469
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:24,180
Erlang.

470
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:26,180
Erlang?

471
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:29,180
You...

472
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:41,180
Your brother didn't write you a letter.

473
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:44,180
I just came to pick you up.

474
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:47,180
Why didn't you go to the hotel?

475
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:49,180
I lost my money.

476
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:52,180
I was in the house.

477
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:54,180
I lost my bed.

478
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:57,180
Why did you go to the hospital?

479
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:59,180
I was locked up.

480
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:02,180
My father came to pick you up.

481
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:04,180
He's going home.

482
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:05,180
Sir.

483
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:07,180
I...

484
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:09,180
I...

485
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:12,180
I have no family.

486
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:15,180
Erlang, you can't jump.

487
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,180
You can't do this.

488
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:17,180
You're a fool.

489
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:18,180
Erlang, you can't do this.

490
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:19,180
You can't do this.

491
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:20,180
You can't do this.

492
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:21,180
You have family.

493
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:22,180
You have family.

494
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:24,180
You can't come to the hotel.

495
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:25,180
Erlang, listen to me.

496
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:26,180
Your room

497
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:28,180
is all cleaned up.

498
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:29,180
Uncle.

499
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:31,180
Go home.

500
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:32,180
Come home.

501
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:33,180
You can't jump.

502
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:34,180
You can't jump.

503
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:35,180
You can't jump.

504
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:36,180
You can't jump.

505
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:37,180
Erlang.

506
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:39,180
Sir.

507
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:41,180
Are you sure there's someone behind Wei Gong?

508
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:43,180
I've asked Wei Gong.

509
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:45,180
He said he doesn't remember who he is.

510
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:46,180
Is there any misunderstanding

511
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:48,180
between you and him?

512
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:52,180
Sir.

513
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:54,180
Are you here?

514
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:56,180
You're talking to yourself.

515
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:58,180
Don't talk.

516
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:02,180
It seems he's drunk again.

517
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:05,180
Why don't you tell Wei Gong

518
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:07,180
this matter

519
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:08,180
as a chance?

520
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:09,180
That's it.

521
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:11,180
Sir.

522
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:12,180
You're back.

523
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:15,180
What's wrong?

524
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:16,180
Wait.

525
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:17,180
Wait.

526
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:18,180
I'm sorry.

527
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:19,180
Don't be so serious.

528
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:20,180
Wait.

529
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:21,180
Sir.

530
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:23,180
You don't know what's wrong.

531
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:25,180
You're a complicated person.

532
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:26,180
You're not good at this.

533
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:27,180
You're a fool.

534
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:29,180
I'll think about it.

535
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:30,180
I won't tell you.

536
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:31,180
Don't worry.

537
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:32,180
Be careful.

538
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:34,180
Don't worry.

539
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:40,180
Don't be so serious.

540
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:44,180
Thank you, sir.

541
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:46,180
Thank you.

542
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:49,180
You're too much.

543
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:50,180
I'll hit you.

544
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:52,180
You're a little bit ugly.

545
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:54,180
Sir, I'm sorry.

546
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:55,180
Sir.

547
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,180
Sir.

548
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:57,180
I'm really sorry.

549
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:58,180
I'm sorry.

550
00:26:58,180 --> 00:26:59,180
Sir.

551
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:05,180
Sir.

552
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:08,180
Sir.

553
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:18,180
Sir.

554
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,180
Sir.

555
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:22,180
You scared me.

556
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:24,180
I thought you were dead.

557
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:25,180
It's okay.

558
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:26,180
Sir, it's okay.

559
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:28,180
It's okay.

560
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:30,180
I really thought you were dead.

561
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:31,180
You're dead.

562
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:33,180
When did you wake up?

563
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:35,180
Sir, I'm lucky.

564
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:36,180
I woke up early.

565
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:38,180
How early?

566
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:41,180
A few days ago.

567
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:46,180
What's wrong?

568
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:49,180
Sir.

569
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:51,180
Didn't you say

570
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:52,180
that you woke up

571
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:54,180
before an hour?

572
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:56,180
Sir.

573
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:02,180
Did you wake up before an hour?

574
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,180
Did you, madam?

575
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:10,180
Did you wake up before an hour?

576
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:12,180
Did you?

577
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:16,180
I'm just kidding.

578
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:19,180
I woke up before an hour.

579
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:25,180
Sir.

580
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:29,180
I woke up before an hour.

581
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:31,180
Sir.

582
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:33,180
Did you wake up before an hour?

583
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:49,180
I'm...

584
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:51,180
I've been awake for half a night.

585
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:53,180
I'll go back to the room.

586
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:55,180
I'll rest early.

587
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:58,180
I'll talk to you tomorrow morning.

588
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:00,180
Yes.

589
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:01,180
Mingming.

590
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:02,180
Mingming.

591
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:03,180
Don't be so nervous.

592
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:05,180
Take your brother back to his room.

593
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:06,180
Yes.

594
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:13,180
Sir.

595
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:14,180
Let's go.

596
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:18,180
Wait.

597
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:24,180
Is this

598
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:26,180
our new home?

599
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:29,180
It's really

600
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:31,180
a dream.

601
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:33,180
It's a real dream.

602
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:35,180
I think

603
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:37,180
my room

604
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:38,180
must be very nice.

605
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:45,180
Right, sister?

606
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:49,180
Take me there.

607
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:53,180
Right.

608
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:56,180
You're so beautiful.

609
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:00,180
The pool is so big.

610
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:03,180
It's full of spring colors.

611
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:05,180
I have to wake up.

612
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:09,180
My room is over here.

613
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:14,180
Dad.

614
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:18,180
Where is the second brother's room?

615
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:23,180
Mingming.

616
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:25,180
Mingming.

617
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:26,180
Don't touch it.

618
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:27,180
Don't touch it.

619
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:28,180
Don't touch it.

620
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:29,180
Don't touch it.

621
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:32,180
A mosquito.

622
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:34,180
Open it.

623
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:35,180
Open it.

624
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:54,180
Don't be so petty.

625
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:58,180
You're a man who has to be a man of his own.

626
00:30:58,180 --> 00:30:59,180
You're a little bit upset

627
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:02,180
with a little girl.

628
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:08,180
I didn't mean to

629
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:09,180
forget you.

630
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:11,180
It's really okay.

631
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:13,180
I'm not a man of my own.

632
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:15,180
I'm just a man of my own.

633
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:17,180
I'm just a man of my own.

634
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:19,180
I'm just a man of my own.

635
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:20,180
I forgot.

636
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:22,180
I really didn't think about it.

637
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:28,180
Well.

638
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:30,180
I'll give you a new one tomorrow.

639
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:31,180
Pick it yourself.

640
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,180
Whatever you want.

641
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:33,180
Whatever you want.

642
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:35,180
No, uncle.

643
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:36,180
You've been out for months.

644
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:37,180
You've been reading.

645
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:38,180
Why are you getting bigger?

646
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:40,180
You're not well, are you?

647
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:41,180
You're still young.

648
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:42,180
You're in the middle of the night.

649
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:43,180
Do you want me to let you sleep?

650
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:44,180
You're still in the middle of the night.

651
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:45,180
What's wrong with you?

652
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:47,180
Brother.

653
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:52,180
You're still alive.

654
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:20,180
I'm sorry.

655
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:52,180
Now you know you don't like me.

656
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:55,180
He's been out for months.

657
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:58,180
I want a good look.

658
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:03,180
Let's wait and see.

659
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:05,180
In the future,

660
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:08,180
I'll be able to help him.

661
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:13,180
I'll be able to help him.

662
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:17,180
I'll be able to help him.

663
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:21,180
Don't be too tired.

664
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:23,180
Look at you.

665
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:25,180
You're sweating.

666
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:29,180
I just don't think

667
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:31,180
you're too young.

668
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:49,180
You're a good fighter.

669
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:50,180
Yes.

670
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:51,180
Go get him.

671
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:52,180
Sir.

672
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:54,180
I'm afraid you're going to Li Bu.

673
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:55,180
We don't have a secret library.

674
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:56,180
Brother, you're kidding me.

675
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:58,180
We're in a secret library

676
00:33:58,180 --> 00:34:00,180
that's more than Li Bu.

677
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:02,180
Sir, you know what?

678
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:03,180
If it's a secret,

679
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:05,180
we'll have to have a secret library.

680
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:07,180
But we're in a secret library

681
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:09,180
that's been in Yuen Jing for 19 years.

682
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:11,180
That's the two years after the war.

683
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:13,180
So, the secret about the secret library

684
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:15,180
is not enough.

685
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:18,180
I know.

686
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:19,180
Go get busy.

687
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:26,180
Why are you still looking for it?

688
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:33,180
Li Bu is a place where there's no evidence.

689
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:36,180
If A Huo Da and I don't come here,

690
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:38,180
how can I get in?

691
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:39,180
Is it hard to get in?

692
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:44,180
Sir,

693
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:45,180
is this food

694
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:46,180
not for the stomach?

695
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:48,180
How about I ask someone to get you another one?

696
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:50,180
I'm hungry.

697
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:09,180
Sir,

698
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:11,180
you're hurting me.

699
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:17,180
Sir,

700
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:20,180
are you coming with me?

701
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:23,180
Yes.

702
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:47,180
Come here.

703
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:48,180
Yes.

704
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:54,180
I have something to ask you.

705
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:56,180
I'll answer it.

706
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:58,180
Yes.

707
00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:00,180
The person who was sent to Chang Fu by the Ministry of Yun Zhou

708
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:02,180
is the person who was called by the Wusheng.

709
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:04,180
Yes.

710
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:07,180
So, the person who was called by the Wusheng

711
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:08,180
is Yang Chuan Nan,

712
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:10,180
the person who was called by the Wusheng.

713
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:12,180
No.

714
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:14,180
He has nothing to do with the Wusheng.

715
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:16,180
You're right.

716
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:19,180
Although Yang Chuan Nan is a man of the past,

717
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:21,180
he doesn't have to rely on the wusheng.

718
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:27,180
The last question.

719
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:40,180
What is your brother

720
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:42,180
and what is he?

721
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:43,180
What is he?

722
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:46,180
Aren't you the third brother?

723
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:51,180
What kind of person is he?

724
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:57,180
You're not the second brother.

725
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:01,180
You're not the second brother.

726
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:03,180
You're not the second brother.

727
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:05,180
Let go of my hand.

728
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:06,180
You're hurting me.

729
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:11,180
Why are you doing this?

730
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:13,180
You've got my charm.

731
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:16,180
You're a coward.

732
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:19,180
You're a fraud.

733
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:25,180
The magic book of Yun Lu Academy.

734
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:27,180
Who are you?

735
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:28,180
Miss.

736
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:31,180
I'll ask you the next question.

737
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:34,180
I'll ask you what you want to answer.

738
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:35,180
Do you know?

739
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:40,180
Where is the second Li Miao Zhen?

740
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:43,180
I don't know.

741
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:45,180
I don't know.

742
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,180
I don't know.

743
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:50,180
I don't know.

744
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:54,180
Why did you go so long?

745
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:56,180
You're so annoying.

746
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:09,180
I'll ask you several questions.

747
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:10,180
Where is he?

748
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:12,180
Master, be careful.

749
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:25,180
The flying fox Li Miao Zhen

750
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:27,180
is indeed not Xu Qian An.

751
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:29,180
You're Xu Qian An?

752
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:30,180
Yes.

753
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:35,180
How could Qu Qu Wu Fu help me?

754
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:37,180
No.3 is really a monster.

755
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:41,180
You know the book?

756
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:43,180
You told him?

757
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:44,180
He's more than me.

758
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:48,180
What else did you tell him?

759
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:50,180
Just a little.

760
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:52,180
How much is a little?

761
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:55,180
A little is a little.

762
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:56,180
I didn't say anything.

763
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:58,180
I just said your identity, age,

764
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:00,180
your cultivation, your lower body.

765
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:02,180
And your brother.

766
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:03,180
What's wrong?

767
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:09,180
I warn you.

768
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,180
Don't tell Third Brother about my matter.

769
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:13,180
If you say anything, I'll kill you.

770
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:16,180
My second brother told me

771
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:18,180
that you two came to the capital for something important.

772
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:20,180
You need his help.

773
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:21,180
That's not help.

774
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:23,180
He actually owed me.

775
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:26,180
Third Brother said you're good at solving cases.

776
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:27,180
Not bad.

777
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:28,180
Then help me.

778
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:29,180
Tell me.

779
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:30,180
Think about it.

780
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:33,180
Can we take the value first?

781
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:34,180
You take it.

782
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:35,180
Then take it.

783
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:36,180
3, 2, 1.

784
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:37,180
Take it.

785
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:42,180
Close the door.

786
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:44,180
Close your eyes.

787
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:45,180
Hold on to the original spirit.

788
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:01,180
I...

789
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:03,180
Where is the truth?

790
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:04,180
In my memory.

791
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:07,180
The number of love is my secret method.

792
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:08,180
It can make both sides

793
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:10,180
have a short relationship and memory communication.

794
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:13,180
Is there a way to share your love?

795
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:16,180
I don't want my memory to be disliked.

796
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:17,180
I'm not as blind as you.

797
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:19,180
I just want this memory to be integrated with you.

798
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:22,180
I don't want to be disliked.

799
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:25,180
I don't want to be disliked.

800
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:28,180
I don't want to be disliked.

801
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:30,180
I just want this memory to be integrated with you.

802
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:31,180
I'm good.

803
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:34,180
If you want to interrogate Xu Xi'an,

804
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:35,180
I want him to try my art.

805
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:36,180
Okay.

806
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:37,180
Until the end,

807
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:38,180
see the result.

808
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:39,180
Don't worry.

809
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:41,180
I'm the most good at men.

810
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:43,180
Until the end.

811
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:47,180
Is that...

812
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:50,180
a man?

813
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:00,180
Xu Xi'an.

814
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:02,180
Can you see this man?

815
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:03,180
This man must be from the north.

816
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:07,180
Where is the ruins?

817
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:08,180
The one who raised the ruins.

818
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:10,180
From the appearance and skin.

819
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:12,180
The one who can see it is the man from the north.

820
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:15,180
Besides, this man has a thick sword

821
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:17,180
besides the sword with a new sword.

822
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:19,180
The sword with a knife and a stone sword

823
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:20,180
will not be this kind of sword.

824
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:21,180
What weapon did you use?

825
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:22,180
Don't sell the coffin.

826
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:24,180
It's a bow.

827
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:25,180
That's right.

828
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:26,180
This man is good at shooting.

829
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:28,180
How to judge this man?

830
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:29,180
He is from the north.

831
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:30,180
I suspect that he is from Huzhou.

832
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:32,180
There are many good people in the city.

833
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:34,180
He can't be a man from the army.

834
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:36,180
He is not from the army.

835
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:38,180
His leg is not loose.

836
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:40,180
If he is a man from the army,

837
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:42,180
he will be loose.

838
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:44,180
He is not from the army.

839
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:45,180
He is good at shooting.

840
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:47,180
This is the characteristic of the north.

841
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:48,180
The people from the north

842
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:50,180
are not good at shooting.

843
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:52,180
Is it possible that he is a soldier?

844
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:55,180
Who will send a message to the army?

845
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:58,180
Who will send a soldier to send a letter?

846
00:41:58,180 --> 00:42:00,180
This is the martial arts of the north.

847
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:02,180
As for what he wants to convey,

848
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:03,180
what does it mean?

849
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:04,180
Who sent him?

850
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:06,180
Who is the leader?

851
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:07,180
I don't know.

852
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:12,180
The capital is in the third floor.

853
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:15,180

854
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:18,180

The blood picture is 3,000 miles.

857
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:30,180
What does it mean?

858
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:34,180
Everything you see is what I see.

859
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:38,180

860
