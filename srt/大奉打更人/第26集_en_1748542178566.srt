1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm a little tired of the world

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm afraid I'll be a little bit tired

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm curious what I'm going to do next

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I don't want to think about the future

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Letting this bowl of soup and a drop of sugar

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
It's not too much

7
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
When you're here

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'll give you the rules

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Keep on being sick

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'll take this big piece of bowl

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
We're suddenly more like a step by step

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
We're suddenly more like a step by step

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
We're suddenly more like a step by step

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
We're suddenly more like a step by step

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
We're suddenly more like a step by step

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
This hand can't hold its touch

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Look at how many hearts there are in the middle of the night

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm afraid I'll be a little bit tired

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm afraid I'll be a little bit tired

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm afraid I won't want to think about the future

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
But I faint because of theuse

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I can't fail the evidence

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I won't make it

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
You put your mind at thedoor

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
It's my right

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Flying fish in thisто

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I'll forget about the past

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Qixing

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
The End

30
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
3000 Li of the Blood Map

31
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
What does it mean by 3000 Li of the Blood Map?

32
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Everything you see is what I see

33
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
3000 Li of the Blood Map

34
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
This person was killed by the Yellow Mountain in the distance from the capital

35
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
He was killed by the Eighth City

36
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
The north is a normal war

37
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
The wind has been blowing the barrier

38
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
3000 Li of the Blood Map

39
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I've never heard of such a big thing

40
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
No

41
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
It's important for the audience

42
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I have to report to the public

43
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Wait

44
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
The End

45
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Bring him here

46
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Thank you

47
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
The End

48
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Report

49
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
How dare you report to the public without permission?

50
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Report to the public with the key

51
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'll give you a piece of tea

52
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Yes, sir

53
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
The End

54
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
What's going on?

55
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
What's going on?

56
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
You're almost done

57
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
You've been in this place for three days

58
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
The whole family knows we've been in the city

59
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Let's go

60
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Do you feel any pain?

61
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
The art of the art is the best

62
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
But if we don't like it, it's not reasonable

63
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
The audience may think you're a good example

64
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
But he won't

65
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
3000 Li of the Blood Map

66
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
You suspect that the king of the land

67
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
of the town is lying to the military

68
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
It's not strange

69
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
What's strange is that

70
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
if the king of the town is lying to the military

71
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
why did the government not report to the police?

72
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
When I was in the beginning

73
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I transferred the case to the northeast

74
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
and stayed in the north

75
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
And the king of the town

76
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
was taken to the iron pit

77
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
in the capital

78
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
There's not much news in the ordinary

79
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
If he can hide it

80
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
the court will be in trouble

81
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
It's hard to get the news

82
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
The case is sent to the northeast

83
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
What does the court want?

84
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Then what do you think

85
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
should be handled?

86
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
You don't have to worry about it

87
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I want to enter the palace

88
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Xiaorou, take her with you

89
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
and I'll enter the palace

90
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Yes

91
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
The main purpose is to help the officials

92
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
behind Xu's back

93
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
But it's not a big deal

94
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
to use the black knife

95
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
And

96
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
he needs a silver bullet

97
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
to cover my gun

98
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
This case

99
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
is not that simple

100
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I want him to kill you

101
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
It's a dream

102
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Since the official is so powerful

103
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
the director told him about me

104
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
There's a clear answer

105
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Besides

106
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I don't want to talk to him

107
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
about you

108
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
The director is watching

109
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
his character

110
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
How is it?

111
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Please take a look

112
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Here we are

113
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Miss, who are you looking for?

114
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Xu Qianan

115
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I'm here

116
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Not to argue with you

117
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
The north is a small town

118
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
and the north is a small town

119
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
The army is too powerful

120
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I want you to ask for 300,000 taels of medicine

121
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
and 20,000 taels of food

122
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I don't have any other option

123
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Your Majesty

124
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
In the past 36 years

125
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Jiangzhou, Jinzhou, and the Great Khan

126
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
have been in the wild

127
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
The court has been in the wild

128
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Now there are two big and strong

129
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
and there are not many fish and fish

130
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
We can't get them

131
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Why don't we get them from different states?

132
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
No

133
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Your Majesty

134
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Even if there are grassy clouds

135
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
If we really want to get them from different states

136
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
we will have a lot of cars and horses

137
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
and many food

138
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I'm afraid we won't have enough

139
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
to send them to the border of Chuzhou

140
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
There are many ways to get them

141
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Your Majesty

142
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I have a plan

143
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
The court can add a medicine at once

144
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
called the pregnancy medicine

145
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,800
It will make the people

146
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,000
to suppress the cold grass

147
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
In this way

148
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
it will not only guarantee the cold grass

149
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
but also save the people

150
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
from the cold grass

151
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
from the cold grass

152
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Your Majesty

153
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
The country is in love with the people

154
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Shi Zhi Chun is a good man

155
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
People are not allowed to have the medicine again

156
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Moreover

157
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Last year, the weather was cold

158
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
and the people were not able to catch the fish and fish

159
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I was forced to go to the dead

160
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
by the fire and the oil

161
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
This is the country's people

162
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
The court is in charge of it

163
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Uncle Wang loves people like this

164
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I admire you

165
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
This is the people of Chuzhou

166
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Isn't it

167
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
the people of my Dafeng?

168
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Your Majesty

169
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
You have no idea

170
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
that the four-legged brothers

171
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
had already had a big battle

172
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
last year

173
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
The king was good at war

174
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
and used his army as a god

175
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Although he had a good battle

176
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
now

177
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
he is not afraid of it

178
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
So please

179
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
send the cold grass and the army as soon as possible

180
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I will find out what the general knows

181
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
The court

182
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
has not given up on their efforts

183
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Please

184
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
please allow me to explain

185
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
this matter as a general's memory

186
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Wei Qing

187
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
You are the general of the military law

188
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
What do you think?

189
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Thank you

190
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I think you are coming back soon

191
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I will wait for you here

192
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Sorry

193
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Ling Yue

194
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Ling Yue

195
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I was thinking about the prison

196
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I don't know where the big river is

197
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
You go back to your room first

198
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I will help you

199
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
There is a guest

200
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Miss, wait

201
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
That was your second brother

202
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Yes

203
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
He is a new year

204
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
He is a new year in the Tang Dynasty

205
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
The student of Yunlu Academy

206
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
is a new year

207
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
But I am not in a hurry

208
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I am in the Academy

209
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I am really good at it

210
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
How about this

211
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
You can ask my brother directly

212
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Miss

213
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Miss

214
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
It's okay

215
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
You can go back to your work

216
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
What are you talking about?

217
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
You don't want to see me

218
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
You are so hardworking

219
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
You are helping him

220
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Man

221
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Director

222
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Director

223
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
What are you doing?

224
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Sorry

225
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Where is Xu Xinnian?

226
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
The mask

227
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Thank you

228
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Who are you?

229
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
The mask

230
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Thank you

231
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Who are you?

232
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Ling Yue

233
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
You can put it on the table

234
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I will get it myself

235
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
So you go out

236
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I am not in a hurry

237
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,480
Look

238
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,320
The mask

239
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,000
is stuck

240
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Watch it

241
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,080
What are you圖

242
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,520
I didn't get a chance

243
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:37,040
lib

244
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,420
Why to the

245
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,440
Who are you

246
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Go out!

247
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Go out!

248
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Help!

249
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Shut up!

250
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
You're not qualified!

251
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
What do you mean?

252
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Your Majesty,

253
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
when we're not in the war,

254
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
we can help the military.

255
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
We can do it ourselves.

256
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Once we start the war,

257
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
we must make the court

258
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
clear the military needs.

259
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
That's our order.

260
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
But before that,

261
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I have something to say.

262
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
What is it?

263
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
The guards in Tongluo

264
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
found a fight in the capital

265
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
in the martial arts world

266
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
in the martial arts world.

267
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
They were so eager to fight.

268
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
But no one knew

269
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
that there was a group of people

270
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
who didn't stop.

271
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
They were so eager to fight

272
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
and then they fled.

273
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Before the death of the dead,

274
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
they were so eager to fight.

275
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
But the north had changed.

276
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
The north had changed.

277
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
The imperial clan was so eager to fight.

278
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
They were so eager to fight.

279
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
They were so eager to fight.

280
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
So they...

281
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
They fled to the north

282
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
and died in 3000 miles.

283
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
General Chu,

284
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
do you think

285
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
killing the bandits

286
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
would be a good idea?

287
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Wei Yuan,

288
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
why did you die in 3000 miles?

289
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Your Majesty,

290
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
this is a terrible thing.

291
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Shut up.

292
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Do you have any evidence?

293
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Your Majesty,

294
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
the person who was killed

295
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
had already brought it.

296
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
The corpse was in the palace gate.

297
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Your Majesty, you may go to the Yan City.

298
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
The dead person is the north's master.

299
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
According to a poem,

300
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
the north had changed.

301
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Wei Gong, you are really...

302
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Yan City.

303
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Yan City!

304
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Yes, Your Majesty.

305
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
The corpse was in the palace gate.

306
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
The rest are waiting outside the palace.

307
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
You, stay here.

308
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
What are you doing?

309
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Help!

310
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Shut up!

311
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Miss, who are you?

312
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I really don't know you.

313
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Can I put on my clothes first?

314
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Miss,

315
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
you still don't know me?

316
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I really don't know you.

317
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
You are so thoughtful.

318
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
You are so thoughtful.

319
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I really don't know you.

320
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
You are so thoughtful.

321
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I really don't know you.

322
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
You are so thoughtful.

323
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
You are so thoughtful.

324
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
You are not a witness, are you?

325
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Who are you?

326
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
What's going on?

327
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
It seems that

328
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Second Brother is like him.

329
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
He pretend not to know him.

330
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
It seems that Second Brother is really grown up.

331
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Congratulations, Second Uncle.

332
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
It's not certain.

333
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I heard that

334
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
this kid doesn't want to be a witness.

335
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
He is about to be executed.

336
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
But

337
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
this kid is really grown up.

338
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
But this is not right.

339
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
How can he not admit it?

340
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
He doesn't admit it.

341
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
He is a pervert.

342
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
You are so stupid.

343
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Why are you okay?

344
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Mr. Xu, you are back.

345
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I am back.

346
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I am back.

347
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I am back.

348
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Why are you like this?

349
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I will come to look for you with Mr. Xu.

350
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
It's not that inside.

351
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
It's over.

352
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
It's over?

353
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Wait.

354
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,600
Can't you stop looking around?

355
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,800
You even dared to lie to me?

356
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,400
That's just another tip!

357
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,600
What are you doing?

358
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,080
Here,

359
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,400
Health Minister Ma,

360
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,320
Mrs. Shang,

361
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,920
Do you think I'm joking?

362
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,520
No, no.

363
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,320
It's just that the blood is three thousand miles away.

364
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,320
If it's true,

365
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,520
how many people will die in Beijing?

366
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,520
I've been pressing the police for a long time.

367
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:52,320
How come there's no news about it?

368
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:53,920
Your Majesty.

369
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:07,320
Your Majesty, please go back to the imperial study.

370
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,920
Yes, Your Majesty.

371
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,320
Your Majesty.

372
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:23,320
Your Majesty, I've already checked with the忘記.

373
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:27,520
Chu Xianglong said the truth and didn't lie.

374
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,520
Thank you for your kind words.

375
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,320
Chu Xianglong.

376
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,120
I don't know where you got the news.

377
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,520
I've just misunderstood you.

378
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,920
I'm looking for it.

379
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:47,520
You didn't offend me before.

380
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,720
Your Majesty, it's important.

381
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,920
This person may be telling the truth.

382
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:55,720
But the situation in Beijing may not be like this.

383
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,920
Your Majesty, where did you get the word?

384
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:02,120
Your Majesty, I have a point.

385
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,520
The audience can't take it.

386
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,520
We must investigate it.

387
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,720
How?

388
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,320
Your Majesty, continue to fight against the cold and grass army.

389
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,520
Prince Yu is leaving the state.

390
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:21,920
At the same time, send a team of youth troops to investigate the case in Beijing.

391
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,720
I'm responsible.

392
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,320
I'm responsible.

393
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:28,320
I'm responsible.

394
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,720
He doesn't know you.

395
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,720
That's right.

396
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,120
You're lying to me.

397
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,720
You're going to pay more pain.

398
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,920
You know what?

399
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:46,720
My second brother is a student at the Yunlu Academy.

400
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,120
He's the most authentic scholar in the world.

401
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,120
At the same time, he's still...

402
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,520
Say something important.

403
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,320
Okay, okay.

404
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,520
Say something important.

405
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,920
The point is the map.

406
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:56,720
Map?

407
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,320
Yes.

408
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,120
Think about it.

409
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:00,120
As a student at the Yunlu Academy,

410
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,120
I'm a talented scholar.

411
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,320
I'm going to serve the people in the future.

412
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,520
If the people know that

413
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,720
he's connected with the sky in different ways,

414
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,920
and attacks my second brother,

415
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,920
how can I serve the people?

416
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:11,720
You know the audience.

417
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,720
You know it.

418
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,720
Then...

419
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,720
Then...

420
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,320
Even if that's the case, I'll help him.

421
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,720
You helped him, so he asked me to help you?

422
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,920
He's a scholar.

423
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,120
He's very unique.

424
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,720
What can you do to him?

425
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,520
You don't know how he's crying to me.

426
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,520
He said that he's a good man,

427
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,920
but he can't be trusted.

428
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,320
He can't help you anymore.

429
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,520
What else can he do?

430
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,320
Look.

431
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,520
He even gave me a jade stone.

432
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,920
He asked me to help you.

433
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,920
But you didn't tell me

434
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,320
that you hurt him.

435
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,320
I was so heartless.

436
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,120
I didn't expect

437
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,120
that he's like this.

438
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,920
Son, hold on.

439
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,320
The jade stone is here.

440
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,520
I didn't expect that.

441
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:16,720
I didn't think that you would know Tian Di well.

442
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,920
Of course.

443
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:21,720
I'm the one who takes care of the three things in the capital.

444
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,520
I can't help it.

445
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,520
My brother is like a man.

446
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,920
I should be more careful.

447
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,120
Okay, I understand what you mean.

448
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,320
Su Su.

449
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,720
Su Su.

450
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,920
You're here.

451
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,120
I'm here.

452
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,720
I'm here.

453
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,920
Su Su, you're playing in the bed again.

454
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,320
Pay the bill.

455
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:59,920
There's a lot of trouble in the new day.

456
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,120
I'll take my leave.

457
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,920
Take care.

458
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,720
Let's go.

459
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,120
I will definitely pass it to him.

460
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,520
You can only do what I have to do.

461
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,520
What should I do?

462
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,920
Although I helped him before,

463
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,920
he beat me up.

464
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,920
It's a relief.

465
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,720
How can I help him?

466
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,520
How about this?

467
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,320
I'll think of something else.

468
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,120
Okay?

469
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:26,520
But we're from the capital.

470
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:29,720
Who will we find to make tea for us?

471
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,720
No, we can't.

472
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:34,120
When the night comes, I'll take you to bed.

473
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,120
Master, don't be ridiculous.

474
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:40,720
This is a different shape of the capital, Yunzhou.

475
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,920
It's a different shape.

476
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,320
You can stop me.

477
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:46,320
Hey, why are you going to the shape?

478
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,600
You won.

479
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,240
Daddy.

480
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,200
Wake up.

481
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:40,040
Wake up, wake up.

482
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,440
Berth, you finally wake up.

483
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,160
So nice.

484
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,360
It's a medical lab.

485
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,640
The doctor has checked that

486
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,920
you still don't get to benefit.

487
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,040
Born straight from the freezing cold ice.

488
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:53,320
�

489
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:06,540
Great Angel!

490
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:13,280
Sister, when you sent me here,

491
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,960
did you wear any clothes?

492
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,000
I can't even keep my life.

493
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,400
I can't bear to wear that.

494
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,280
If I didn't send you here,

495
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,000
would you wake up so fast?

496
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,280
The wolf said,

497
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,000
you were just on your way here

498
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,520
and had a drink of soup.

499
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,160
Yes.

500
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:37,720
Did anyone see my face?

501
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,520
My face?

502
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,720
The doctor in the hospital

503
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,760
is not in the hospital.

504
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,000
We ran for a long time

505
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,840
and found this place.

506
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,760
I think

507
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,600
you must have seen it.

508
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,120
Come here.

509
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:00,440
Ning'er.

510
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:01,440
Brother.

511
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:02,920
Ning'er.

512
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:03,720
Brother.

513
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,560
Brother.

514
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,040
It's over again.

515
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,800
It's over again.

516
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,600
The team of the doctor went to Beijing

517
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,600
and investigated Xue Tu San.

518
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,080
It's not the same case.

519
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:20,040
His Majesty is looking for

520
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,680
the candidate for the Chief Officer.

521
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,000
Is it me?

522
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,680
You are just a silver wolf.

523
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:37,800
The Chief Officer needs to lead three joint projects.

524
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:41,000
You are not qualified enough now.

525
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:42,960
Yes.

526
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:47,720
Tell me.

527
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,800
How is Li Miaozhen?

528
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:50,680
He is good.

529
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,400
He is very used to the life of Jingchuan.

530
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:53,520
Remember.

531
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,520
His identity is special.

532
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,560
He is not a drunken man.

533
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,920
He can't send him out.

534
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,840
Well...

535
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,640
It may be a bit difficult.

536
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,080
Why?

537
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,640
You came to Jingchuan

538
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,240
to investigate something.

539
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,480
Before the incident happened,

540
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,960
he would not leave.

541
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:20,360
And I was worried about

542
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,840
Xue Tu San's case.

543
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,000
I have promised to help him.

544
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,720
What did you promise?

545
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:30,840
Sit down.

546
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:31,880
Yes.

547
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:34,600
We went to Li Bu

548
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,200
to investigate Su Su's father.

549
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:39,760
Why did you go to Li Bu?

550
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,320
Su Su's father is Su Hang.

551
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,560
He was a guard in the 29th year.

552
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,480
Then in 2014,

553
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,840
he was promoted to the emperor's candidate.

554
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,800
He has been missing since then.

555
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,280
He has never been alive.

556
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:00,440
He has no reason to be found in the 20th year.

557
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,880
So you think

558
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,000
since he has been promoted to the emperor's candidate,

559
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,040
Li Bu will have his information.

560
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,640
Go to Li Bu.

561
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,760
Please report to the minister.

562
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,000
Please punish him.

563
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,440
It's okay.

564
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,960
The news of Xue Tu San's death

565
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,840
is normal.

566
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,760
He is a great doctor.

567
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,520
But with my ability,

568
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:31,120
I can't go to Li Bu's grave.

569
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,080
But I have a job for you.

570
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,160
I will punish you

571
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,800
if you want to do it.

572
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,080
It's not hard.

573
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,040
Don't worry.

574
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,280
I will send him out of the city right away.

575
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,120
Li Bu is not a place

576
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,160
where workers can come in and out.

577
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,080
Besides,

578
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,040
it's a place of Wang Zhimun.

579
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,880
It's even harder to go up.

580
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:57,720
But if it's just a scroll,

581
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,160
and the workers don't have to face it personally,

582
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,720
I have a choice

583
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,080
to make.

584
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:05,880
Who?

585
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:09,000
Xu Jia Erlang and Xu Xinnian.

586
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,160
From what I heard,

587
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:32,280
you've managed to save me here.

588
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,480
I usually don't know

589
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,200
how to behave.

590
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,840
It's very environments-friendly.

591
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,840
Bai JC Soldier,

592
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,000
you can water it.

593
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:47,880
Stay here.

594
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,040
No.

595
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,320
It's this,

596
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,440
Peing meals.

597
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,840
Do you need some water?

598
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,440
Nope.

599
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,600
a long mountain.

600
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,880
It's the clouds and clouds you like.

601
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,320
How about

602
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:02,440
trying it?

603
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,200
Yes, yes.

604
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:03,920
Try it.

605
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:04,920
Try it.

606
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,160
Try it.

607
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:20,680
Erlang.

608
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:21,960
Erlang.

609
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:23,640
Erlang.

610
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,720
I told you to go to the clinic.

611
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,600
You're not feeling well?

612
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,200
I'm fine.

613
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,600
I'm fine.

614
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:32,440
Right?

615
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,000
Are you really okay?

616
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:36,000
Don't worry, mom.

617
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:38,440
I'm just looking at Wenru.

618
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,720
But I'm healthy.

619
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:43,000
It's just that I have a hard time studying.

620
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:45,360
Sometimes my skin is normal.

621
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:46,920
Am I right, Erlang?

622
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,440
Erlang, it's good that you're fine.

623
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,520
I made some lotus root for you.

624
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:58,960
Erlang, come.

625
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,920
You've thee minding your own business.

626
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:11,080
Your studies are not over yet.

627
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:17,920
I have an international historical role in practical liberation.

628
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:22,600
But aside from the field of science,

629
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,840
How about we go out today?

630
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,440
Let's rest.

631
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,640
Relax.

632
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:30,520
You haven't finished your kitchen work yet, right?

633
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,360
Hurry up.

634
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,360
Let's go.

635
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,680
Hurry up.

636
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,360
Look at her teeth.

637
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,480
She's so big.

638
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,720
Go and ask her.

639
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,680
Put it here.

640
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,760
Go and eat.

641
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,520
Erlan.

642
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,560
I suddenly remembered

643
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:46,360
that I heard a word on the street.

644
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:47,480
It's...

645
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:50,160
A young man

646
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,400
likes to talk.

647
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:53,640
It's...

648
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:57,800
A village girl.

649
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,080
She's so stubborn.

650
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,920
I heard that this face

651
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:06,200
is so disgusting.

652
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:06,880
I...

653
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:07,720
I beg you.

654
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,520
Please forgive me.

655
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,320
Please forgive me.

656
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:13,800
I'll be back

657
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,800
on the street again.

658
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:16,840
I think...

659
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,400
You're not shy.

660
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,400
I think...

661
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,840
I think...

662
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:24,840
I think...

663
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,360
I think...

664
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,320
I think...

665
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:34,320
Mother.

666
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,320
Don't get on the bus.

667
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,880
I... I got on the bus?

668
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,160
What do you mean?

669
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,160
How did I get on the bus?

670
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,280
Who did I get on the bus?

671
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,520
I didn't get on the bus.

672
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:43,160
Hey.

673
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:43,600
Honey.

674
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,440
I...

675
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,440
I...

676
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,440
I...

677
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,080
What did I get on the bus?

678
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,200
Uncle.

679
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,040
Uncle.

680
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,720
Da Gui is coming in.

681
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,160
Uncle.

682
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,440
Where is he?

683
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,240
He's not back yet.

684
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:19,920
Uncle.

685
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,480
Why are you here?

686
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,320
What for?

687
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,520
Hey.

688
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,000
The Mid-air Food Team.

689
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,760
I'm relieved.

690
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:29,480
The ingredients that

691
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:32,200
Da Gui specially got for you

692
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,640
are not bad.

693
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:37,800
Uncle.

694
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,960
Da Gui is busy.

695
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,280
I want to ask you to help him.

696
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,480
To make progress?

697
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,160
Yes.

698
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,400
To make progress?

699
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,640
You're a worker.

700
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,240
I can't make progress.

701
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,920
How can I help you?

702
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:55,000
I'm also asking about Wei Gong.

703
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:55,800
But he said

704
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:56,920
as long as I come to you,

705
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,440
I can share everything.

706
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,560
You're talking nonsense.

707
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,800
Wei Gong is a person.

708
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:01,800
How can he be trusted?

709
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:05,800
What's wrong?

710
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:06,800
What did you think?

711
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,200
Nothing.

712
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,080
Uncle.

713
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,200
Don't hide it from me.

714
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,560
If you really have any way,

715
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,600
then you really helped me a lot.

716
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:18,600
Think about it.

717
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,080
Mr. Chen.

718
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,640
I didn't mean to help you.

719
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,320
But...

720
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:28,080
I do have a friend

721
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,040
who can achieve this.

722
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,400
But...

723
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:34,040
But...

724
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,560
He may not see me.

725
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,880
Then try it.

726
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,160
How do you know if you don't try it?

727
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,200
Try it.

728
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,600
Try it.

729
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,920
I'll think about it.

730
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:44,240
Okay.

731
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,120
Think about it.

732
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:45,600
You rest a while.

733
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,520
He'll take care of you.

734
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,120
Okay.

735
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,080
This way.

736
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,040
Please.

737
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:51,880
Please.

738
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:56,040
So Lin An is on his way back?

739
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:56,920
Yes.

740
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,480
I heard that Xu Qian is dead.

741
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,680
Princess Lin An has settled down with Princess Yu.

742
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,280
She's going back to the horse.

743
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,160
But...

744
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,480
But what?

745
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:08,160
Princess Lin An is in a hurry.

746
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,120
She's on the wrong way.

747
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:12,960
She can go on the road for three days.

748
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,400
But she broke into the Black Wind Forest

749
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,960
in order to cross the road.

750
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,280
The Black Wind Forest is a fatal threat to the people.

751
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,560
To protect Princess's safety,

752
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,760
we contacted the local government in the dark.

753
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:24,280
We'll meet the bandits one by one.

754
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:29,120
Princess Lin An just went out of the Black Wind Forest

755
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,800
and broke into the mountain.

756
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,440
It's all desert all around.

757
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:35,920
Princess was in a coma for half a day.

758
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:36,840
She can't go on the road.

759
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,360
We can only go on the road.

760
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:40,960
We'll go to the mountain to beg for help.

761
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,600
You're asking us to protect her

762
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,960
and not to be a burden to her.

763
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,480
I'm incompetent.

764
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,800
Please punish me.

765
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,280
I'm sorry.

766
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,360
Where is she now?

767
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:18,200
The Yin trapped in the sediment.

768
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,880
When you started training the Fox Festival,

769
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,560
you 소리が空きて turn off the camera.

770
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,560
Yes, I heard.

771
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,280
The dark dream was born in the mansion.

772
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,200
Once you think of the piece.

773
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,760
Prince Qi band large sake...

774
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:32,440
Sure.

775
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,440
I can be the princess

776
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,440
in the future.

777
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:56,440
Cheng Jiang, please hurry up.

778
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:06,440
Xun Yiqiao Ximei?

779
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,440
What's the name of that?

780
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,440
Meixiqiao Yixu.

781
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,440
Ziqiu, what are you doing?

782
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,440
This is the number I made an appointment with her.

783
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:22,440
I'm using the light as my name.

784
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,440
If she has a purpose,

785
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,440
she will meet me in Meixiqiao.

786
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,440
The number?

787
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,440
So mysterious.

788
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,440
Who is she?

789
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:34,440
You can know her name.

790
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,440
Siqiao,

791
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,440
the time has passed.

792
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,440
I guess these people won't come.

793
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,440
Wait a minute.

794
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:13,440
There must be something to delay.

795
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,440
Are you hot?

796
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,440
Why don't you eat a melon?

797
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,440
I'm not good at it.

798
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,440
I'm not good at it.

799
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:22,440
I'll have another melon.

800
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,440
I'll have another one.

801
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,440
I'll have another one.

802
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,440
I'll wrap it all up.

803
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,440
Cheng Xia.

804
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,440
Thank you for your help.

805
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,440
If you need anything,

806
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,440
come to me at any time.

807
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,440
It's okay, miss.

808
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,440
Get your own business done.

809
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,440
Don't delay.

810
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,440
Thank you.

811
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,440
Guys, come out.

812
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,480
Water!

813
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:04,880
Water!

814
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,360
Water!

815
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,160
Water!

816
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:19,320
Water!

817
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,040
Water!

818
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:23,440
Water!

819
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,280
Water!

820
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:52,320
한

821
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:58,600
Well.

822
00:37:59,000 --> 00:37:59,400
Okay.

823
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:00,720
I will clear the restaurant.

824
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:01,720
How's the food?

825
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:03,600
Are you happy?

826
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,160
Where are we going today?

827
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,000
We've lost it.

828
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:06,720
Sir,

829
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,120
we haven't paid the money yet.

830
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:08,720
No!

831
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:10,440
Let's go.

832
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,840
Did you forget something?

833
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,080
Chief.

834
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,680
Who are you?

835
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:22,720
You're a scoundrel.

836
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,520
Stay away.

837
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:24,720
Chief.

838
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:27,960
Chief.

839
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,240
Let's go to the street first.

840
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:31,840
Forget it.

841
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:32,680
Miss,

842
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,120
I don't want the money.

843
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:35,120
I don't want it.

844
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,400
Let me say it again.

845
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,400
I'll pay you back.

846
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:44,920
You're a scoundrel.

847
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:03,640
Put him down.

848
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,280
Guards,

849
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,840
along with him,

850
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,360
They charge for the roast pork rice,

851
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:32,600
kill them!

852
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:33,080
Got it?

853
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:34,560
I won't.

854
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:47,120
Those that argue can never be busy,

855
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,280
swearing, andkea,

856
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,240
kill us all.

857
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,280
Go away...

858
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:58,480
Gu支蒙画儿!

859
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:01,520
Go.

860
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:03,920
Help.

861
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:07,920
Get out.

862
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:20,120
I broke something.

863
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,320
Is this enough?

864
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:23,120
Yes.

865
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:23,920
Yes.

866
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,120
Thank you, Miss.

867
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,120
Thank you, Sir.

868
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:26,920
Thank you.

869
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:28,720
Thank you.

870
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:32,120
Good hand.

871
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:34,920
You're not here, either.

872
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,720
It's a pity that these furniture

873
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,520
are almost finished.

874
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:53,520
Zhijiao,

875
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,120
you've been with me for three hours.

876
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,120
We can't wait.

877
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:58,920
Wait.

878
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:00,920
Sir, I want some melon.

879
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:01,520
Okay.

880
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:09,120
Don't you eat it?

881
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,120
It's a good melon.

882
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:11,120
This is your melon.

883
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:12,720
I'm not a good person.

884
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:14,520
Sir,

885
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:15,720
I want some melon.

886
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:26,120
Is it hot?

887
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:29,920
It's hot.

888
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:34,320
Don't worry.

889
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:34,920
Take your time.

890
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:36,720
Two more words.

891
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:51,120
Zhijiao,

892
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:52,920
there are only two hours left.

893
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:54,520
We can't wait any longer.

894
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:55,720
If we wait any longer,

895
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:56,920
we'll have to pay for Brother's belly.

896
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,320
I think your friend won't come.

897
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:02,120
He really doesn't want to lose me.

898
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:08,720
Who is he?

899
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:13,320
I used to play the game at home.

900
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:14,720
But he will show up.

901
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:16,520
I've never done anything wrong.

902
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,520
But now,

903
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:21,920
I have a heart of grass.

904
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:23,520
I have a heart of human.

905
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:25,520
I'm not like grass.

906
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:28,120
Yes.

907
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:29,920
People who don't come here

908
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:30,920
will tell the doctor.

909
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,320
That's right.

910
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:35,920
Wait.

911
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:39,920
Which family do you mean?

912
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:45,320
Yes.

913
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:46,520
Fang Wei has changed.

914
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:51,120
So he doesn't want to see me.

915
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:52,720
He doesn't want to see me.

916
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:54,120
Let's go.

917
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:55,920
Let's go.

918
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:58,920
Princess,

919
00:42:58,920 --> 00:42:59,920
the mountain is far away.

920
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,920
It's too dangerous to go back alone.

921
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:04,120
Xu Jian is dead.

922
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:05,520
He's dead.

923
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:07,520
No matter what,

924
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,320
I must meet him for the last time.

925
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:12,120
Xu Jian, wait for me.

926
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,120
I order you to wait for me.

927
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:20,920
Miss,

928
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:21,920
who are you looking for?

929
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:23,720
The old lady has moved away.

930
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:25,120
What's wrong?

931
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:26,520
She moved away this morning.

932
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:42,720
Senior,

933
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:44,720
is it too exaggerated?

934
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:46,120
It's a big night.

935
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:48,120
It's so ridiculous.

936
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:53,920
Brother, hold the line.

937
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:54,720
Don't let go of your hand.

938
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:55,720
I'll be right back.

939
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:57,120
You don't trust me

940
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:58,120
when you do something big.

941
00:43:58,320 --> 00:43:59,720
So you're the one who's worried.

942
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:00,320
Don't worry.

943
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:01,520
Go find your dad.

944
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:06,920
Xu Jian.

945
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:12,920
The day is over.

946
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:13,920
Happy birthday.

947
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,120
Come to the New Year's Day

948
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:16,920
and open a new year's full of love.

949
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:18,520
Change your life and live a happy life.

950
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:20,320
The atmosphere in the legend.

951
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:22,520
He wants to blame.

952
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:23,520
It's all good brands.

953
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:25,520
If you like it, bring it home.

954
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:28,920
The brand you like is all popular in the world.

955
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:31,120
