00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm afraid I'll be a little bit late

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm curious what I'll be like

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I don't want to be a little bit late

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm afraid I'll be a little bit late

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm afraid I'll be a little bit late

I'm afraid I'll be a little bit late

I'm afraid I'll be a little bit late

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm parted in the rumor

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
многие

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'll feel that it remains

33
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
My mind is too troubled by tears

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
to join in the past

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
We're just right

is more advanced.

43
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
TCL is looking at the high light moment.

44
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
A good story for a good job.

45
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
It's not a bad script.

46
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
It's a script.

47
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
It's for the audience.

48
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I'll do it now.

49
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Si Mo.

50
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Xie Lang.

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Xie Lang.

The Good Ping Pai Good Series

53
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I'm just...

54
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I'm just passing by.

55
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Look.

56
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I'm fine.

57
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
You have something to do.

58
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
You go first.

59
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I don't need to worry about it.

60
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'll wait for a while.

61
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Why don't you close the door?

62
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I'm done.

63
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Madam.

64
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I have something to do.

65
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I'll go first.

66
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Xie Lang.

67
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I'm here to give you something.

68
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Really?

69
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I got this from my grandmother.

70
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It's from my grandmother.

71
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
It's from my daughter-in-law.

72
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Thank you, madam.

73
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I'll take it for Miss Wang.

74
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
It's not appropriate.

75
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
It's appropriate.

76
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
It's perfect.

77
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
It's time to be patient.

78
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Be patient.

79
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
It's late.

80
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
It's appropriate.

81
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
It's perfect.

82
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
It's appropriate.

83
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
It's perfect.

84
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
It's perfect.

85
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
It's perfect.

86
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
You two

87
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
are busy with this matter.

88
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I think about it.

89
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I must be a little upset.

90
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I'm sorry.

91
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Darling.

92
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
You go first.

93
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Go first.

94
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Darling.

95
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
So after I killed my senior brother,

96
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I decided to go down the mountain.

97
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Down the mountain.

98
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I thought it was justice in the palace.

99
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Justice.

100
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I didn't expect to be so brazen.

101
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Many people told me

102
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
this is the time to be patient.

103
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I don't believe it.

104
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I want to be a judge

105
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
and be a judge.

106
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
You are too stupid.

107
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
What's wrong with being stupid?

108
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
What's wrong with being stupid?

109
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Good.

110
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I've been a few years.

111
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I'm a good man.

112
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I'm a good man.

113
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I'm a good man.

114
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Darling.

115
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
You are a good girl.

116
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
You are a good girl.

117
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I'm not good at pretending.

118
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I'm not good at pretending.

119
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Brother.

120
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Why are you here?

121
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
This is a road in the world.

122
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Why am I here?

123
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I'm a teacher at four.

124
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I'm a 12-year-old.

125
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I'm 18 years old.

126
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I'm a teacher at Dongling.

127
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
What's wrong with your master?

128
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Where is he?

129
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
My master is always kind-hearted.

130
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
He might be hot at the moment.

131
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
It's almost dark.

132
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
No.

133
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
It's dark.

134
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Hurry up.

135
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Wu Chi.

136
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
He's a good man.

137
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
He's a good man.

138
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
He's a good man.

139
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
He might be hot at the moment.

140
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
He's a good man.

141
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
My master is always kind-hearted.

142
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
He's a good man.

143
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
He's a good man.

144
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
He's a good man.

145
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
He's a good man.

146
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I'm a good man.

147
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I'm a good man.

148
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
He wants me to stay away from the coffin.

149
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Don't learn it.

150
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I thought I'd report to the government

151
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
and want to resign.

152
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
But who would think

153
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
he appeared

154
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
to teach me a lesson

155
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
and make me report to the government again.

156
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Okay.

157
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Lady Zeyu.

158
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
That's the fate of Chu.

159
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
It's better to have a friend like you

160
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
who's a good friend.

161
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
And I, Li Mozhi,

162
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
have a good life.

163
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
You're right.

164
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
You and I

165
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
are good friends.

166
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Cheers.

167
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Cheers.

168
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Soxiu.

169
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Since we're close,

170
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I have a question.

171
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Today is the festival.

172
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I dare not to say anything.

173
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
But I'm so sorry

174
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
that I didn't recognize you.

175
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Brother.

176
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I, Chu Yuanzhen.

177
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Li Miaozhen.

178
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Let's have a good day today.

179
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Let's not beg for the same age and the same life.

180
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Let's beg for the same age and the same life.

181
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Li.

182
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Li.

183
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Miaozhen.

184
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Chu Yuanzhen.

185
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
The second place in the world.

186
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
The last place in the world.

187
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
The fourth place in the world.

188
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
The last place in the world.

189
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
What a pity.

190
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
What a pity.

191
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
What a pity.

192
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
What a pity.

193
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Thank you for this Guanyin.

194
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
No problem.

195
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Miss Song Su is wearing a blue dress.

196
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
The document is here.

197
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Please take care.

198
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
If you need anything,

199
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
please tell me.

200
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Thank you.

201
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
So many.

202
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Since the Great Feng Empire,

203
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
all the official documents

204
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
are here.

205
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Let's start.

206
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
As long as you find the name tag,

207
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
you can't know the person

208
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
who passed the rule.

209
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
You can't know the person

210
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
who passed the rule.

211
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
You can't know who

212
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
passed the rule.

213
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
In the same person,

214
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
on the throne,

215
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
send a official to the capital.

216
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Go to the capital.

217
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Official?

218
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Follow me.

219
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
It's him.

220
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Where's the name tag?

221
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
What's wrong?

222
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
What's wrong?

223
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Miss Song Su.

224
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
My sister...

225
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
My sister died.

226
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
She's still alive.

227
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
She's still alive.

228
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
For the past ten years,

229
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Miss Song Su's heart

230
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
should be healed.

231
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
She's still alive.

232
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Besides, your master and your master

233
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
are all concerned about you.

234
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
What's wrong?

235
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I don't understand.

236
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Although I'm not well,

237
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I remember that

238
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
when I was in the music school,

239
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
my parents were still in love.

240
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
They were all in love.

241
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I don't understand.

242
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Why did I

243
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
apologize to others?

244
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
We were in love.

245
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Sister.

246
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I'm sorry.

247
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I'm willing to help you.

248
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
If you want to be a cook,

249
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I'll help you.

250
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
It's not like that.

251
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I said

252
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I want to be a cook,

253
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
but I won't use your father's name.

254
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
This way,

255
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
he'll be more careful.

256
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Si Mo.

257
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Don't worry.

258
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
What I said today

259
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
is true.

260
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I've always been loyal to you.

261
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
But I'm so kind.

262
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I'm so mean.

263
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I'll never let you down.

264
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Xu Lang.

265
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Si Mo.

266
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Miss.

267
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
We're here.

268
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
We're here so soon.

269
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Then...

270
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Then...

271
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
That's all for today.

272
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Xu Lang.

273
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Go back and rest.

274
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I'm sorry.

275
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Kind of deeds will kill you.

276
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
You should punish me

277
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
before me.

278
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Anyone else who wants to help Aku

279
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
can leave now.

280
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Sister.

281
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I suddenly remember

282
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I think I left something at your place.

283
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
What should we do?

284
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Or I'll send it to you tomorrow.

285
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
No, we need to use it tomorrow morning.

286
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Or...

287
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Or...

288
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Or we can go back to the wedding house together.

289
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Since that's the case,

290
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
we can do that.

291
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Mom.

292
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Daoqian.

293
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
What? You left again?

294
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I did. Seven or eight times every time.

295
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Every time, the secretary has to walk to the entrance.

296
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Why? And then she goes back to the wedding house.

297
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Cheng He raised them.

298
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,240
and keep the company out of the way.

299
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:06,720
What does it look like?

300
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,160
Okay.

301
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,280
Tomorrow,

302
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,080
let him stay at his house.

303
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,320
I won't go out.

304
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,120
I can't go out.

305
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:13,880
Yes.

306
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,360
How are the two people behind?

307
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,040
They've been reviewing the documents.

308
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:25,400
I don't know what they found.

309
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:26,920
But they've been investigating it secretly.

310
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:27,680
The day after tomorrow,

311
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,080
they'll take the documents to the warehouse

312
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,320
and send them away.

313
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,240
That's good.

314
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,040
The one who fought with me

315
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,880
is not like the past.

316
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,320
It's a human nature

317
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,000
to give them a new way.

318
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,680
Sir, I understand.

319
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,680
After Si Mu comes back,

320
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,440
tell him to wait for me inside.

321
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,080
Yes.

322
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:50,680
Mr. Xu.

323
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,160
I'm here to confess.

324
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,200
Thank you.

325
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,240
Mr. Xu, look.

326
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,160
Take it yourself.

327
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,440
Thank you, Mr. Xu.

328
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,520
Mr. Xu.

329
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:01,880
The Prime Minister of Huangtai

330
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:02,560
is looking for me.

331
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,440
I've been looking for you for a while.

332
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,880
I found the scroll before.

333
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:05,960
See if I can kill him.

334
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:06,760
Yes, yes.

335
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,520
Then...

336
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,400
Take it yourself.

337
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:09,520
Thank you.

338
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,120
Sir, I'll use it.

339
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:12,920
Okay.

340
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,360
Everyone,

341
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,760
bring the blanks

342
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:16,720
you found.

343
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,720
The blanks will be 10 taels.

344
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:22,400
Sir.

345
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:26,640
Sir.

346
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:33,880
To this day,

347
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,800
all blanks are open

348
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:36,920
in time.

349
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,720
They are not repeated

350
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,040
because they are low and high.

351
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,040
That's true.

352
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:45,760
These blanks

353
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,320
belong to the same person.

354
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:48,960
And these scrolls

355
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:49,960
are clearly recorded

356
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,560
in the scroll of this person.

357
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,280
But I don't know

358
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,280
why his name is passed down.

359
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,360
Who is this person?

360
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,020
I tookdropped

361
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,160
the bell...

362
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,800
you forgot?

363
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,520
So he nossaeth?

364
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,700
But...

365
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,180
I never know

366
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,440
that he is here again...

367
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:29,180
Then

368
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:31,280
am I going back?

369
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,560
What's going on?

370
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Something happened.

371
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,480
It's so beautiful.

372
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:01,080
I didn't expect it to be 15 tonight.

373
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,120
I hope we can be friends.

374
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,480
I don't want you to be like this.

375
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,560
You're still not out of school?

376
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,240
It's the time.

377
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,240
Three years later,

378
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,520
you'll be punished

379
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:10,920
for this sword

380
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,160
with your blood.

381
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,720
Then you have to live to that day.

382
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:20,800
Come again.

383
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:21,840
Come again.

384
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:24,960
Come again.

385
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:28,880
How dare you

386
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,000
to do such a thing in my capital?

387
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,520
Let's fight today.

388
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:35,720
Come again next time.

389
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,040
Come again.

390
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,120
You still want to run away?

391
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:53,760
It's you again.

392
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,200
No matter how much you don't shoot,

393
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,680
you'll be punished for your shameless sword.

394
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,200
I'm going to be a great soldier today.

395
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,720
I'll give you a shot.

396
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:02,600
Stay off me.

397
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,880
Stay off me.

398
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,540
algochallenge

399
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:06,420
Kab attention on the God and science?

400
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:07,920
Xue Mi,

401
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:08,600
keep it down.

402
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,360
Qiu Zhi,

403
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,520
how many shots you have got?

404
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,880
99 %

405
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,920
love all with it.

406
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,420
The nose from

407
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,180
said they were full of vitality,

408
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:20,320
see something件 and

409
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,720
これは

410
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:24,800
시

411
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,420
Light state

412
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,520
love all with it.

413
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,340
Hope you can

414
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:32,900
The new year is a good sign.

415
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,100
The tragedy has finally come to an end.

416
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:47,380
Yuan Jing has been a great speaker for ten years.

417
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:49,100
He was a new member of the same year.

418
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:50,620
In the 12th year,

419
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,180
he was appointed as the head of the Du Chanyuan Prefecture.

420
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:53,700
In the 15th year,

421
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:55,660
he was appointed as the deputy minister of the Du Chanyuan War.

422
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:58,100
In the same year,

423
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:00,220
he was supposed to be the deputy minister of the Du War.

424
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:01,820
But the situation has changed.

425
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:03,340
He didn't only get involved in the case,

426
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:04,300
but also was sentenced to death.

427
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:05,660
The Su Heng and others

428
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:06,820
were also sent to the same prison.

429
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:08,700
This is the last time he appeared.

430
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:11,540
Who is this person?

431
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:13,140
Why is his name Kong Bai?

432
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:16,220
Dada Han!

433
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:25,700
Tell me,

434
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:27,900
tell me.

435
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:29,820
Why did I scold you?

436
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:32,020
Why did you scold me?

437
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:35,960
Tell me,

438
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:40,540
why did you say something

439
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:42,180
that is over看看?

440
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:44,940
What if outside understood?

441
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:45,980
Tell me quickly,

442
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:50,060
would you have missed the court?

443
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:50,980
Yes.

444
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,860
Go open the court!

445
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:54,180
Wang Dai, your letter.

446
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,340
You're so brave.

447
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:56,500
My whole body's gone mad.

448
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:57,020
Why is my letter gone mad?

449
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:57,740
The truth is,

450
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:59,020
my case of cases

451
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:00,100
is too urgent.

452
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:01,420
Nonsense!

453
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:03,980
Naughty!

454
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:14,580
Nonsense, do you know what you are doing here?

455
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:16,260
Dear Sun Xiaobo.

456
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,860
Pinkie does such a thing!

457
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:23,240
How am I supposed to appreciate him?

458
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:24,940
It's all up to you.

459
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:27,420
Well,

460
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:29,580
don't think about hands with hands.

461
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:30,720
To myela,

462
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,600
I found the looming clue in this case.

463
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,300
The clue is on the books in Libu.

464
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:38,200
That's why I have the case.

465
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,880
Why the probes on this info?

466
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,640
Don't you believe the 好闲颖啰子?

467
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,480
I'm lying on your honor.

468
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,500
Mr. Wen.

469
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,760
Libu bribed with the ocarina in the government as fate.

470
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:54,240
Should we do it by all means.

471
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:55,800
Or not?

472
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,560
Of course.

473
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,440
Every Ol秋節 has professional ideologies,

474
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,580
there is a small issue and we will discuss it at any time.

475
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:06,380
OK, I dare to ask can this transplant

476
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,020
be reported in this ring?

477
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,900
What is it?

478
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:11,580
лет

479
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,840
I'm here to make the case.

480
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:33,240
I'm not going to be a member of the Ministry of Rites.

481
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:37,240
These points are really important.

482
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,240
If you can point it out,

483
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,240
I'll make it clear.

484
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,240
Sit down.

485
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,240
Miss.

486
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,040
Sit down.

487
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,240
Miss.

488
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,240
Miss.

489
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,240
Miss.

490
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,240
Miss.

491
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,240
Miss.

492
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,040
Sit down.

493
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:00,640
No, no, no.

494
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:01,640
Stand still.

495
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:02,840
I told you to sit down.

496
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:03,840
Okay, sit down.

497
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:04,840
Sit down.

498
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,640
Did you check it out for the Eunuch Wei?

499
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:13,840
No.

500
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,040
It's my fault.

501
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,240
You?

502
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,040
How's the tea?

503
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,440
Go back and wash your hands.

504
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,640
That's so nice of you, Noise.

505
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,840
What is the matter, brother?

506
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,340
Sir.

507
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:46,240
It's too late now.

508
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,640
What's going on after we come here?

509
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,640
Some aso- consisted Beschelождia were imported.

510
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:51,040
They still use Met Astra disease.

511
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,640
Pat Astra?

512
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,880
I don't know if the hero is Hertz' friend.

513
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,040
The other party is a man and a woman.

514
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,720
We have both the assassin and the killer.

515
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:01,880
Do you have any new awards?

516
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,720
The sky is red, but we don't have any feelings.

517
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,120
But one of them is a bandit.

518
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,880
He has a pair of short armor and a pair of silver guns.

519
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:08,600
Silver guns?

520
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:11,720
I got it.

521
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:12,360
Keep looking.

522
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:12,880
Yes.

523
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,160
I think...

524
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,680
It's not him.

525
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,080
It's him.

526
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,440
That boy...

527
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,160
Did you see Mr. Chu's sumo?

528
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:38,920
He is�ojing Bay Village.

529
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,160
It's fine.

530
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,800
In the future,

531
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,640
you will be totally fine.

532
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,520
How about the second?

533
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,600
Where are you?

534
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,200
Don't bother.

535
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,880
I saw you again last time,

536
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,080
I won't let you go.

537
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:38,920
Sorry to bother you.

538
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:41,120
Si Mo.

539
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,880
Let me see you off.

540
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,520
I think it's time to go.

541
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,840
But you can't be too gentle.

542
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,720
Wu Shanshan just found a good craftsman.

543
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:53,880
He hasn't been in the West for two days.

544
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,320
He's been like that because of you.

545
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,880
Cut the crap.

546
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,480
I'll be with you.

547
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,760
Why are you so loud?

548
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:07,960
What happened?

549
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,400
I met number four.

550
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,080
Number four?

551
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:27,880
It's me.

552
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,600
Chu Xiong.

553
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,760
Why do you look like this?

554
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,520
Dressed up by someone.

555
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:51,920
잡 distinguishing the person.

556
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,680
When they were poisoned,

557
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,920
they were killed by number two.

558
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:00,320
I have fought with him for a long time.

559
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,040
But I didn't get to accept him.

560
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,560
He ran away this time.

561
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,800
Next time, let me meet him again.

562
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:11,560
I will beat him to death.

563
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:12,640
Kneel and beg for mercy.

564
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:19,080
Mother.

565
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,200
Oh no.

566
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:26,360
I told him about my brother.

567
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:30,000
What should I do?

568
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,520
What should I do?

569
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:34,800
Why are you talking so much?

570
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,000
You come to my house.

571
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:36,960
You can beat my family.

572
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,080
Or my family.

573
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,280
How can I explain it?

574
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:40,240
I don't need to.

575
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,200
You wait.

576
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:41,600
Wait.

577
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,320
Don't move.

578
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,320
Luckily,

579
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,880
I didn't talk too much about master.

580
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:51,200
I will stay here for the next two days.

581
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,240
Good.

582
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,520
I will stay here for a long time.

583
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,960
I'm afraid I'm in trouble.

584
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,720
If I pursue master,

585
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:02,760
I don't know how to respond.

586
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:06,400
Maybe I can find my brother.

587
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:07,840
He is a man.

588
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,440
You mean Xu Qian?

589
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,120
Yes.

590
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,000
Xu Qian.

591
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:17,760
I need to talk to you.

592
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,680
I will be back soon.

593
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,400
Who is it?

594
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:29,840
It's okay.

595
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,640
Let's continue.

596
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,400
This man's map is clear.

597
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,200
Su Hang is his body.

598
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,160
Because of something is leaked,

599
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,440
so as long as we find this man's identity,

600
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:43,280
we can know the meaning behind Su Hang's death.

601
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,360
Who is this man?

602
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,280
I'm not sure yet.

603
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,560
But I guess

604
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:51,640
they are the people who have been tortured and tortured.

605
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:54,480
I think they are the people who have been tortured and tortured.

606
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,240
Orm maybe because of this man.

607
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:01,000
Im...

608
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,400
Bao Tai!

609
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:18,960
All the fake

610
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,080
can be statement.

611
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:22,080
However,

612
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:26,080
I found a way

613
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:30,080
to get the first order

614
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:32,080
from the former director of the investigation.

615
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,080
I changed my mind

616
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:38,080
and looked for the time to find it.

617
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,080
I found it.

618
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,080
17 years ago.

619
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,080
That's right.

620
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:47,080
The last time I got the order was 17 years ago.

621
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:50,080
I was a genius.

622
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:53,080
I found a secret

623
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:56,080
in the secret passage of the Dali Temple.

624
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:58,080
In the 17 years of Yuanjing,

625
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:01,080
there was a secret treasure in the palace.

626
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,080
The secret treasure was a harem.

627
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,080
No.

628
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:06,080
The secret treasure in the palace was not a small thing.

629
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,080
But not only me,

630
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:10,080
the important thing about this matter

631
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,080
had no effect.

632
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:14,080
No effect again?

633
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:18,080
There was another big thing

634
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,080
in the 17 years of Yuanjing.

635
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,080
The secret treasure in the palace.

636
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,080
Follow me.

637
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,080
You mean

638
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,080
this person is taking the secret treasure

639
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,080
while the secret treasure

640
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:39,080
is in the palace.

641
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:41,080
Did you steal the secret treasure?

642
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,080
I don't know

643
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:44,080
if it's related to this.

644
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:47,080
Maybe it's a coincidence.

645
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,080
At that time,

646
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,080
I already knew it.

647
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:53,080
Someone deliberately hid it.

648
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:55,080
It was a secret treasure

649
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,080
that was not a secret treasure.

650
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,080
People around me

651
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,080
didn't know about it.

652
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,080
It's a secret treasure.

653
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,080
I'm not

654
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:04,080
a person who can control

655
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:06,080
everything.

656
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:10,080
If it's not for the imperial harem,

657
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,080
I advise you

658
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,080
not to be mad.

659
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:17,080
The clue is broken.

660
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:19,080
The identity of this person

661
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,080
and the secret treasure

662
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,080
of the lost person

663
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,080
are not clear.

664
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:27,080
What is there in the palace?

665
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,080
Who is this person

666
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:30,080
without a name?

667
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:43,080
All names are erased.

668
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:45,080
Even if it's a book,

669
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:47,080
if it's a poem,

670
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,080
it's not a problem

671
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:51,080
to have all the clues.

672
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:03,080
Could it be

673
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:06,080
someone used a secret treasure

674
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:08,080
to deliberately erase this person's name?

675
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,080
I understand.

676
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:19,080
This person is a soul mate, Su Hao.

677
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:21,080
He stole the secret treasure in the palace

678
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,080
and then used a magic trick

679
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,080
in the imperial harem

680
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,080
to chase after him

681
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:28,080
to use his own

682
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,080
traces to hide

683
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,080
the secret treasure

684
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,080
in order to escape.

685
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,080
It's my key

686
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:38,080
when it comes to

687
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,080
the origin of the magic

688
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:41,080
or the secret treasure.

689
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,080
It's strange.

690
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:47,080
This person has stolen the secret treasure

691
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:49,080
and has lost his mind to erase it.

692
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:51,080
Why do you still have to take out the secret treasure

693
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:53,080
and keep it in the danger that others find?

694
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,080
You first took out the treasure

695
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:57,080
and put the book in your body.

696
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:01,080
I'm just a small person

697
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:03,080
who has nothing to do

698
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,080
with what he did.

699
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,080
Wait.

700
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:12,080
Or is it related?

701
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:14,080
There is something in your body

702
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:16,080
that can help me to recuperate.

703
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,080
What is it?

704
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:19,080
I just want to

705
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:21,080
keep it in the secret treasure

706
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:23,080
so that someone can

707
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:25,080
put it here on purpose.

708
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,080
Is it

709
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:30,080
the secret treasure in the palace?

710
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,080
Or is it something

711
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:34,080
that can be put in your body?

712
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,080
Why don't you stop investigating?

713
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,080
I know my father is dead.

714
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:42,080
He is willing to die.

715
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:44,080
If you continue investigating,

716
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,080
you will be in trouble.

717
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:47,080
How can this work?

718
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,080
Don't worry.

719
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:50,080
There must be a hidden reason for this.

720
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:52,080
Xu Qian, you are right.

721
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:03,080
I can't taste it today.

722
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:05,080
I just want to see you.

723
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:07,080
I know a lot about you.

724
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:15,080
It's okay.

725
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,080
Don't be afraid.

726
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:20,080
Is it the secret treasure?

727
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:44,080
I'm afraid.

728
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:14,080
Who is it?

729
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,080
Stop!

730
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,080
Tian Yuren!

731
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:23,080
I have a hard time.

732
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:24,080
This time,

733
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:25,080
I just want to meet you,

734
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,080
Master Jianzhen.

735
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,080
Master Jianzhen doesn't welcome you.

736
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:29,080
Dafeng doesn't welcome you.

737
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,080
Tian Yuren!

738
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,080
You are really a man.

739
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:34,080
Why do you bring me here?

740
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:38,080
The truth is,

741
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,080
you're an immortal.

742
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:42,480
I do not welcome you will you

743
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:51,880
This is Da Feng's treat

744
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:54,320
Shall I meet you secretly?

745
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,720
Send those bandits attention

746
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:00,680
If they find someone

747
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,920
Don't come even if it's caught

748
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:07,760
Leave

749
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,600
Greetings

750
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:12,880
Without food,

751
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:17,500
these two have met each other

752
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,660
They are fated as befits

753
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:22,800
It seems that you are the reason why the rent Dakota property was lifted

754
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:23,900
Father

755
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,800
I am asking for Niek's help

756
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:28,040
And for those who agree to wait for the 10 dead

757
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:32,880
Father

758
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:43,600
That goddamn boredom

759
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,280
I'll catch you

760
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:47,960
What if they try to get free

761
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:58,600
Yes!

762
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:03,600

The wind is blowing, there will be a stone.

765
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:13,600
Is the wind worth it today?

766
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:14,600
Welcome to the wind-seeing observation room.

767
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:17,600

Lower your voice.

769
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:19,600
Song Shisheng.

770
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:20,600
Hello, everyone.

771
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:22,600
There is a news from the nationality recently.

772
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:24,600
The weather forecast is like a reality.

773
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:25,600
Nianye, what do you think?

774
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:26,600
What do I think?

775
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:27,600
I'm looking at the stage.

776
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:28,600
How can I look at it?

777
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:29,600
You're thinking so much now.

778
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:31,600
You're not in a hurry.

779
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:32,600
Wait a minute.

780
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:33,600
What's going on?

781
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:34,600
You just went over there.

782
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:35,600
When you were still waiting,

783
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,600
someone had already rushed to eat the first line.

784
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:39,600
No, no, I have to go too.

785
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,600
No, wait for me, I have a melon.

786
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:44,600
What melon?

787
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:47,600
Is it a mature and moral security case?

788
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:51,600
A big跟勇 is coming to a big fire.

789
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:52,600
What big fire?

790
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:54,600
Look, this is a complicated answer.

791
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:56,600
If I want to go to the stage one by one,

792
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:59,600
I'm afraid I have to change four horses in a day.

793
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:01,600
I only need one horse.

794
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:02,600
What?

795
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:03,600
The champion body.

796
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:04,600
The champion body?

797
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:05,600
You can do thousands of things.

798
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:06,600
You can do thousands of things.

799
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:08,600
You can make it as far as you can.

800
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:10,600
Unfortunately, sometimes,

801
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:12,600
it's not the path.

802
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:13,600
It's the human heart.

803
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:14,600
Look.

804
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:17,600
How can you make the words sound so serious?

805
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:19,600
Miss Wang is here.

806
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:20,600
Look at her.

807
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:21,600
The path is no longer far.

808
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:23,600
She will come to see her again.

809
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:25,600
You should persuade her.

810
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:27,600
My mouth is almost dry.

811
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:29,600
Isn't this the typical beauty of the eyes?

812
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:31,600
One doesn't talk, one is a little bit of a blur.

813
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:33,600
Why don't you find a surprise?

814
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:35,600
You can express your feelings for the words.

815
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:38,600
You can also let Miss Wang face the path.

816
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:40,600
The words are brilliant.

817
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:42,600
Brother Song, why do you say that?

818
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:43,600
Why do you love me?

819
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:46,600
Ningye, do you remember my human horse experiment?

820
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:48,600
I finally developed a reliable,

821
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:51,600
original, new, and powerful car.

822
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:53,600
No wonder.

823
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:55,600
The first line of the melon-scented feeling.

824
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:56,600
The road is long and short.

825
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:58,600
Song Li wants to be high-end.

826
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:00,600
The Yadi electric car can be satisfied.

827
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:04,600
There will be a time when the wind blows.

828
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:07,600
Watch the wind with Yadi.

829
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:08,600
It must be worth it.

830
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:23,600
Time to dress up.

831
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:25,600
Let me enjoy the view.

832
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:26,600
Yes, I treat you.

833
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:28,600

His Chinese name isビادμε.

837
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:40,600
At the end, another mobile phone can be found on the first floor.

838
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:42,600
Let me look for SubDream's message.

839
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:43,600
I don't know it,

840
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:44,600
