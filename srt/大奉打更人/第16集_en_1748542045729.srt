1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:02,720
Where's my manor?

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:04,600
I'm happy!

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:06,180
We should go to Yong geme.

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,620
Let's go, my manor!

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:10,860
Let's go!

6
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,620
What if it is someone who was born to solve the problems?

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,140
Why do we have to have my family checked on?

8
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,280
What's wrong with my family?

9
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:28,140
It's not right.

10
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:32,020
let's go to drink fruit

11
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:35,780
is you going to pick me up?

12
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:57,140
Brother Cheng.

13
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:57,980
Let's go.

14
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:15,900
I've called you up.

15
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:17,700
I want you to be in the detective's office.

16
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:19,460
But there's only half a hour.

17
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:21,460
Is that enough?

18
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:22,260
Yes.

19
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:24,100
Of course.

20
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:26,740
Qian Di can wake him up.

21
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:27,980
You're awake?

22
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:29,980
That's it.

23
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:31,220
You've been sleeping for a few days.

24
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:38,900
It's normal.

25
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:39,940
It's all like this.

26
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:41,380
That's how my father's dream is.

27
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:42,460
Thank you.

28
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,060
Brother.

29
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:50,660
Demon.

30
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,900
Brother, when was this?

31
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,060
He科我在讷工.

32
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:10,580
leer

33
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:15,000
Work

34
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:16,780
Glrid

35
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,020
Originated

36
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:19,900
Really?

37
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:25,140
I've been working for a few days

38
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:26,660
and I've been so nervous.

39
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:29,860
By the way, why are you here?

40
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,460
Your colleagues came to the mansion to send a message.

41
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,060
They told us about your encounter.

42
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:35,460
When Lian Yue left the city,

43
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:36,860
she told me about the school.

44
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:38,460
I heard that you were in trouble.

45
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:39,660
So I went back to the city.

46
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:41,060
When the dawn comes,

47
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:42,900
the gate of the city opens.

48
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:46,660
How's the family?

49
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,660
I didn't sleep for a night.

50
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,860
Lian Yue asked for help from colleagues.

51
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:52,860
I went to the temple of the temple.

52
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:54,060
I went to the place of the jade sword.

53
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:57,460
Lian Yue was crying a lot.

54
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:58,860
When I saw her,

55
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,660
she was even talking.

56
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:03,660
Lian Yue was worried about you.

57
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:05,860
She drank a lot this morning.

58
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:08,860
Did you see her?

59
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:12,260
I've looked for the teachers.

60
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:13,860
But...

61
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,660
Fei Yuan and the teacher have a bad relationship.

62
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:19,660
The dean said you were here to find the princess.

63
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,060
Only she could save you.

64
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:24,260
What a pity.

65
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:26,460
The princess is not in the palace.

66
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:27,460
It's okay.

67
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:31,060
Your colleagues told me

68
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,460
that you could help me get the letter.

69
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:33,460
I'll go to her in the palace.

70
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:37,860
Si Jin.

71
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:40,860
Don't you blame them?

72
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:42,060
Of course I do.

73
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:46,260
Brother Gui's studies have been bad.

74
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:52,260
You're a scholar indeed.

75
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:56,260
I'm sorry.

76
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:00,660
I'll get you out.

77
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,060
Don't worry.

78
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:08,260
I'll take care of your brother.

79
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:13,060
I'm a good man.

80
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:15,460
Plus, you're protecting me.

81
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:16,460
You're a good man.

82
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:18,860
I hope so.

83
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:25,060
Did you bring the silver?

84
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:25,860
Yes.

85
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,260
You went to find the fish head.

86
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:30,460
You said you'd get my item.

87
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:32,460
It's the jade seal.

88
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:33,860
If he's still around,

89
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:36,060
take him to the Anji Temple in the east.

90
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:37,860
It's a distant place.

91
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:39,260
Tell him to send it to No. 1.

92
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:42,060
He said No. 3 was locked up by a big man.

93
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,060
Please tell him to go.

94
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,460
If he's not around,

95
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:48,260
forget it.

96
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:51,260
You don't need to go

97
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:54,060
to the princess.

98
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:02,660
The bronze wheel, the waistband, the knife, and the uniform.

99
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,660
You can't take the other things.

100
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:13,660
Okay.

101
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:14,860
I'll report it to you.

102
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:24,660
I'm a student at Yunlu Academy.

103
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:26,260
I have a job to meet the princess.

104
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,460
Please let me know.

105
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:29,060
Wait here.

106
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,660
We can only send you here.

107
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:36,860
The fish head is in the way.

108
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:37,860
Thank you.

109
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:39,660
I'll go.

110
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:40,660
Don't be so hard on me.

111
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:41,660
Thank you.

112
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,260
Brother Song, please help me.

113
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:44,460
As long as you can save me,

114
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:45,460
I'll do everything I can.

115
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,460
Your Highness, the guest is here.

116
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,860
I'm Xu Xinian from Yunlu Academy.

117
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:54,060
I've met the princess.

118
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:55,660
What's the matter with me?

119
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,260
I'm Xu Qian'an from Tang.

120
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:58,260
I'm in trouble.

121
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:00,060
I'd like to ask you to help me.

122
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,260
Xu Qian'an?

123
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:02,860
What's wrong with him?

124
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,260
A copper wheel

125
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:08,460
cuts the silver wheel to the heavy wound.

126
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,460
It must be a dead body.

127
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:11,860
It's said that

128
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,660
it's called killing and killing.

129
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,860
Brother Tang is impulsive.

130
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:17,860
But if he doesn't do anything,

131
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:19,460
the poor girl

132
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:20,860
will be punished by Zhu Yunluo.

133
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:22,260
She's been

134
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:24,460
doing nothing but trying to save her life.

135
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,260
Brother Tang is not a gambling person.

136
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:29,260
But he knows the meaning of life and death.

137
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:33,460
What about the punishment of Wei?

138
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:37,060
Zhu Yunluo is not useful.

139
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,060
Brother Tang

140
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:41,460
is in the drugstore after seven days.

141
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:56,660
This is a treatment

142
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:59,460
for Mu Bai and Yuping.

143
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,460
Please help me.

144
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,660
I understand.

145
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:10,460
But

146
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:13,060
it's only a person who belongs to the royal family.

147
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,660
Only a father and a woman.

148
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:17,260
I can only do my best.

149
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:22,660
Thank you, Princess.

150
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:30,060
You can't put the horse in Princess's body.

151
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,060
She still did this.

152
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:33,860
But she's willing to go out and live in the palace.

153
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,060
It's not worth it.

154
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,060
Xu Sijiu.

155
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:43,060
What have you been doing these years?

156
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:46,060
I must take care of you

157
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:47,660
in the next year.

158
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:02,060
Chief of the military police,

159
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:03,460
you must find out

160
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:05,860
what Xu Xinyan said and refuse to do it.

161
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:09,660
Xu Xinyan and Zhu Yunluo

162
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,260
do you have any complaints?

163
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:13,060
They are not here to see me.

164
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:14,660
But Zhu Yunluo

165
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:16,260
did express his anger and anger

166
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:18,460
to Xu Xinyan in private.

167
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:20,860
Is the family in Taikang County

168
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,260
in a mess?

169
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,660
Is it a mess?

170
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:24,660
No.

171
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,260
In fact, these years,

172
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:27,660
Zhu Yunluo did the thing

173
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,460
about the criminal girl in the criminal case.

174
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,260
But no one is willing to

175
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,860
be the chief of the girl's case.

176
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:35,060
I also found out

177
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:36,460
that Zhu Yunluo

178
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:38,860
did have a way to get rid of Xu Xinyan.

179
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:39,660
But...

180
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:43,260
But I didn't expect a little fellow

181
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:46,060
to have such a strong power.

182
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,460
I see.

183
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:49,660
Leave.

184
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:50,860
Yes.

185
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:36,460
No.

186
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:50,660
Your Majesty.

187
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:52,460
You are awake.

188
00:09:58,660 --> 00:09:59,860
What time is it?

189
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:01,460
Your Majesty.

190
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:03,660

now

366
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:11,020
Your father was suspicious

367
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:13,800
which caused creating troubles for the king

368
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:18,780
This is what Wagging is

369
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:20,420
I didn't expect it

370
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:21,300
Your Highness,

371
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:22,740
the master is not well.

372
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,020
What's wrong, Your Highness?

373
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:25,900
I heard someone say

374
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:28,940
Xu Tengluo was imprisoned by the officials.

375
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:30,460
What?

376
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:32,100
The servants asked him

377
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,700
if he was involved in the murder of Yin Luo

378
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:35,740
and turned into a big trick.

379
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:38,340
I was afraid that he would be killed.

380
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:39,300
I'm afraid

381
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,460
he's not as good as Xu Tengluo.

382
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:42,900
Xu Jia.

383
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:45,260
Xu Jia.

384
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,220
What's wrong?

385
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,260
Brother, please save him.

386
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:50,220
Please save Xu Jia.

387
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:51,260
Please save him.

388
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:52,340
Don't worry. Who is Xu Jia?

389
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:53,060
Xu Jia.

390
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,580
He's my guest.

391
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:56,180
Your guest is a person who is a person.

392
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:57,660
No.

393
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:58,860
I can't go.

394
00:20:58,940 --> 00:20:59,300
Li Yan.

395
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,020
My little brother.

396
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:00,620
Li Yan.

397
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:02,340
Don't run, Li Yan.

398
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:09,980
As you expected,

399
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:11,460
Princess Ling'an

400
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:12,900
indeed went to the imperial study.

401
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,420
Xu Jia is a law-abiding man

402
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,820
and a man of the Wei Palace.

403
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:18,940
His father wouldn't lie to him.

404
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:20,380
But I didn't expect

405
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,700
that Princess Ling'an was so eager to marry him.

406
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:23,620
In the end,

407
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:26,260
Xu Jia is his man.

408
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:29,620
He's my man?

409
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:31,420
He's so ridiculous.

410
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:32,700
But

411
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:34,500
he's right.

412
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:35,940
His Majesty is furious.

413
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,100
He's already killed

414
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:38,500
and married Noble Consort Chen.

415
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:41,580
His Majesty is just a play.

416
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:43,060
Everyone knows

417
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:45,180
Ling'an won't do anything serious.

418
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:47,980
Do he know what a man is?

419
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:51,500
Ling'an really doesn't know

420
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,180
what a man is.

421
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:53,780
Mother.

422
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:57,260
Those servants in my palace

423
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:58,860
taught me how to speak.

424
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,220
They're the ones who brought me here.

425
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:02,100
They said

426
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:03,420
a man is a man.

427
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:04,540
A man is a man.

428
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:06,860
That's what a man is.

429
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:08,460
Mother, believe me.

430
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:09,500
Shut up.

431
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:10,980
Get lost.

432
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,420
Your Majesty.

433
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,700
Although Ling'an's pretty late,

434
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:25,180
she has yet to do

435
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:26,740
such ridiculous thing.

436
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:29,540
Please今日は你.

437
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:35,780
Father.

438
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:37,660
Ling'an just saved everyone's mood.

439
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:38,860
It must be a misunderstanding today.

440
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:39,940
Please face my ideas.

441
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:44,460
Keep your word, your Majesty.

442
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:47,660
Prince Chen.

443
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:50,500
you areads the one who made me.

444
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:04,860
You want to die

445
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:08,100
at the same time as me.

446
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:11,820
I did it

447
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:13,900
because I felt so scared.

448
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:17,220
You really want to save him.

449
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:18,460
Are youTeryu?

450
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:22,660
Do stay here.

451
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:24,580
Shall we go?

452
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:25,940
Ask Renee for me to handle them.

453
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:32,100
See.

454
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:33,660
Move.

455
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:44,420
You said he'll the helping of the poison.

456
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:45,820
He's most powerful.

457
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:48,940
Since you're so fond of him,

458
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:51,140
I'll give him a chance

459
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:55,260
to make him pay for his crimes.

460
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:58,820
Thank you, Father.

461
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,940
If he can't be released within half a month,

462
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:03,380
I'll kill him.

463
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:18,540
Therefore,

464
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,500
please set the date.

465
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:27,100
Перang.

466
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:28,220
What can we do?

467
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:29,740
You're forthcoming?

468
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:30,740
No.

469
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:32,140
Are you它的oral?

470
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:33,260
Yes.

471
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:34,900
Will you decide

472
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:36,060
if a few seniors

473
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:39,700
are coming today or not?

474
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:49,220
I'm not a fool.

475
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:50,220
I'm a fool.

476
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:53,220
We talked about it when we had a drink yesterday.

477
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:55,220
No one came today.

478
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:57,220
I'm not as good as I am.

479
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:07,220
Ming Nian.

480
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:11,220
I promised your father

481
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,220
to protect you.

482
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,220
I'll protect you.

483
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:17,220
I can't stand it.

484
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:20,220
But I'll do it.

485
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:40,220
Your face.

486
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:46,220
I said I won't let you put the coriander.

487
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:48,220
Why did you put the coriander again?

488
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:49,220
Come here and count.

489
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:50,220
There's a lot.

490
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:55,220
It's half of the taste of noodles.

491
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:01,220
You have to be positive

492
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:03,220
when you eat.

Hello?

525
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,640
Xu Qian is such an ambitious man.

526
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,720
She's risked herolics for the roof to go down.

527
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,720
Are you really a second-husband?

528
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:56,960
Why did you scold me?

00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:57,920
Do you think

00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:00,000
why did Father say that to Princess?

Father especially

532
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,680
hinted at Princess in the study.

533
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:04,800
I think Princess

534
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,280
would give the sword to His Majesty

535
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,960
and let Xu Qian take the punishment.

536
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,920

00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,480
I'll kill you.

576
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,480
I'll kill you.

577
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,480
I'm not going to die because of you.

578
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,480
Go away.

579
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,480
Go away.

580
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,480
Today.

581
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,960
What?

582
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:15,100
Have you heard from kin?

583
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,400
Think about it

584
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:24,600
Sword Han led by Qi Qing

585
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,800
Leave us alone here.

586
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:09,020
Two minutes later

587
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:14,260
I got a boy

588
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:19,940
Who exposed them to the wrong man?

589
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:27,600
Who pressed him?

590
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:32,840
My lord

591
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,840
It's just a road.

592
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:41,840
If there's nothing else, I'll go first.

593
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,840
Stop!

594
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,840
What are you doing with the knife?

595
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,840
The knife is too tight.

596
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,840
You can't untie it as soon as you're anxious.

597
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,840
I'll go first.

598
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,840
Brother, help me untie it.

599
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,840
Sang Bo's revenge.

600
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,840
His Majesty asked me to take Li Guo away and investigate this case.

601
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,840
This time, you're a lucky man.

602
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,840
You've lost your life.

603
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:28,840
How did His Majesty know about this?

604
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,840
We only know that Wei Gong is a good man.

605
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,840
He's going to leave this morning.

606
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,840
Wei Gong.

607
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:38,840
Don't stay here.

608
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:39,840
Go back.

609
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:41,840
Let's go.

610
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:42,840
Okay.

611
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:58,840
You're out.

612
00:32:58,840 --> 00:32:59,840
Mr. Jiang.

613
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:08,840
They told me that you'd be here tomorrow night.

614
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,840
Forget it.

615
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,840
Besides, you're right.

616
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,840
We're all standing here.

617
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,840
Good boy.

618
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,840
I'll go to Yang Yan and compete with him.

619
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,840
I'll get you.

620
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:30,840
My lord, please.

621
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:33,840
This is...

622
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,840
This thief has sent a heart-to-heart message.

623
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,840
He's threatening us with a knife.

624
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:42,840
He's trying to frame me.

625
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:45,840
Are you crazy?

626
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:46,840
Yes.

627
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,840
I'll tell you the truth.

628
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:54,840
He's trying to frame us.

629
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,840
Maybe he has something to do with it.

630
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,840
I think we should go to the prison.

631
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,840
He won't be afraid of being threatened.

632
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:01,840
That makes sense.

633
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:03,840
My lord.

634
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,840
Don't go to the prison now.

635
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:08,840
Just go.

636
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:09,840
Okay.

637
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:11,840
My lord, I'll get back to work.

638
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,840
Okay.

639
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:14,840
Come again.

640
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:15,840
Okay.

641
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:16,840
Come again.

642
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:17,840
Come again.

643
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:18,840
Okay.

644
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:19,840
Let's go.

645
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:28,840
My lord.

646
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:31,840
What's wrong?

647
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,840
I think someone called me.

648
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,840
Are you out of your mind?

649
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:38,840
You're out of your mind.

650
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:39,840
You'll be in trouble again.

651
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,840
My lord, don't worry.

652
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,840
We'll definitely help you out.

653
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,840
We'll keep you safe.

654
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:48,840
My lord.

655
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:49,840
My lord.

656
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:57,840
Lord Chengokong.

657
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:08,840
Siqiang.

658
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:10,840
The adopted princess...

659
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,840
Her Highness sees and wants to see me.

660
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:14,840
I'm sure she'll do anything.

661
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:20,940
Mother.

662
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:21,840
Second brother.

663
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:22,840
Take a bite.

664
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:23,840
You'll have some strength.

665
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:24,840
Come over later.

666
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,760
I don't know if Ning Yan

667
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,720
can eat well.

668
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:33,240
Mom,

669
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:34,920
Wu Yue is right.

670
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:36,680
She has strength after eating.

671
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:37,720
She can eat whatever she wants.

672
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,080
Ling Yue,

673
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,480
how many meals have you eaten these days?

674
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:45,880
How many?

675
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:46,980
Own two oranges.

676
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:49,340
I want this one.

677
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:50,560
Why didn't you take a bite?

678
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:55,540
If Number one

679
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:56,500
came,

680
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,100
she wouldn't have gotten a tiny bite.

681
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,600
Or even

682
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:00,760
nom nom nom nom nom.

683
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,800
This kind of humbleness

684
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:11,800
makes

685
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,300
parents hate me.

686
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:15,140
No.

687
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:20,020
If it was not for theorist Ning Yan's father,

688
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:21,740
who saved your father,

689
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:24,300
he could have respirated theting

690
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:27,100
for our family.

691
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:35,940
What's the matter, mother?

692
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:37,020
I'm fine.

693
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:40,580
It has such grassland roots.

694
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:43,780
Eat more food.

695
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:45,220
I'm not impulsive.

696
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:47,220
Why do you think I'm good at eating?

697
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:50,820
Brother, you're so...

698
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:51,980
Wait.

699
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:52,780
Brother, hug me.

700
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:54,460
Do you want to eat?

701
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:56,460
I want to eat.

702
00:36:58,060 --> 00:36:58,540
Come on.

703
00:36:58,540 --> 00:36:59,260
What's good about eating?

704
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:00,380
I'm starving these days.

705
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:01,700
What's good about it?

706
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:03,300
You're a loser.

707
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:04,620
You're not the one.

708
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:08,100
What's wrong?

709
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,580
I've heard from you.

710
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:11,940
When I'm not here these days,

711
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:13,060
I can't eat anything.

712
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:15,300
I can't eat.

713
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,700
I'm starving.

714
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:22,460
Where's your sister?

715
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:27,620
Brother.

716
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:32,300
Brother, I thought...

717
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:33,380
What?

718
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:35,140
I heard you're not eating, either.

719
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:37,020
Yes.

720
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:40,460
I want to help my beloved sister.

721
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:42,940
You're so good.

722
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:45,300
Just come in.

723
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:48,940
Okay, Brother.

724
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:49,780
Sit down, have a meal.

725
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:50,700
I'll make you another meal.

726
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,220
Don't be avoids, sister.

727
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:54,420
I'll go get the water.

728
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:55,580
Hurry and have the food.

729
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:57,460
Don't Beautyereggio.

730
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:58,900
With which one?

731
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:00,440
it is Good

732
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,340

Please call over

735
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,440
In front of Sha arms

736
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,320
I heard a hundred words

737
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,480

738
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:17,260

from a fortnight

745
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
when getting on the boat,

746
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,440
worn around a witches' hut,

747
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:48,660

Right, where did the five apples go yesterday?

754
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:24,300
I noticedToday, you said that hormon407 bought grilled pork chicken.

755
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:26,300
My dad gave me this yesterday.

756
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:28,140
He said the monthly salary

757
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:28,220
that he paid for the previous month

758
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:29,260
was all here.

759
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:30,540
What did he ask us to do?

760
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:31,540
Miao,

761
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:34,020
didn't you give that bracelet to the king?

762
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:34,980
Your dad said

763
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:37,180
I brought it when I married him.

764
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:39,700
He kept it when he was pregnant.

765
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:40,860
