Are you alright?

46
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:53,110
He deserves

47
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,390
to be my opponent.

48
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,040
Master, why are you stopping me again?

49
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,080
Xu Qi'an is a mere Silver Gong.

50
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,920
He wouldn't last ten moves against me.

51
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,590
Only I am capable

52
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:20,320
of cleaving apart the Dharma.

53
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:21,430
You

54
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,760
are not worthy.

55
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:30,480
This is so unfair.

56
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,390
Supervisor, I warn you.

57
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:35,480
Do not let your old eyes fail you

58
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:39,870
and become an obstacle to my fame.

59
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:43,390
The Supervisor is holding me back.

60
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:46,080
I'll eventually reemerge in the world,

61
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,150
and no one can suppress me.

62
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,860
(Xu Mansion)

63
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:55,740
(Supervisor)

64
00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:01,540
(Sangbo, Palace treasure, demonic hand,
Tianyu Dharma, Yunzhou, Elixir of Life)

65
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:09,100
(Supervisor)

66
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:25,780
(On the day of cleaving the Dharma)

67
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,960
This is even livelier
than the Spring Fete.

68
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:32,910
If not for your vindication

69
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:34,130
and regaining imperial favor,

70
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:35,570
we wouldn't have had the chance

71
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:38,520
to watch such a duel up close

72
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,590
and to see so many noble officials

73
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:43,030
and imperial family members.

74
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:44,790
Indeed.

75
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:45,680
It's wonderful.

76
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,640
Excuse me, where is the viewing area?

77
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,830
Why is she here?

78
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:51,630
Ru.

79
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:52,990
Ru.

80
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,150
Ru, you're here too.

81
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:56,760
Xiuhe.

82
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,200
This is a grand event for the nation.

83
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,640
Everyone in the capital
wants to join in the excitement.

84
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,590
So, my family came to take a look.

85
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:05,830
You may not know this.

86
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,000
Commoners must stand.

87
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,680
For officials and nobility,

88
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,910
their seats are prearranged.

89
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,150
We have seats

90
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:14,390
with excellent views.

91
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:16,150
If you want a better view,

92
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,200
I can take you with us.

93
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,760
My husband

94
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
still holds some influence

95
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,710
and reserving a few seats is easy.

96
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:25,710
No need.

97
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:26,960
No need to trouble you.

98
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,710
But we're friends after all.

99
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:30,070
Besides,

100
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,150
with your modest family background,

101
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:35,320
you've probably never seen
such a grand occasion.

102
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:37,200
It's only right for me to help.

103
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,200
Yes, indeed.

104
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:39,960
Dear,

105
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,680
I've found our seats.

106
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,390
They're over here. Come on.

107
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,710
- Greetings, My Lord.
- Xiuhe.

108
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:47,440
I have to go now.

109
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:55,800
Honey.

110
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,320
Do you know

111
00:06:58,470 --> 00:06:59,560
who's seated up front?

112
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:01,560
That's the resting platform
for imperial members.

113
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,960
Only imperial members

114
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,560
and 1st Rank officials sit there.

115
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,200
Xiuhe,

116
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,160
this...

117
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:08,790
This is spacious.

118
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:10,030
Honey,

119
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:11,120
this place is so spacious.

120
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:11,960
Should we

121
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,440
invite Xiuhe to join us?

122
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,710
It's a rare opportunity.

123
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,880
Let her broaden her horizons

124
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,640
and introduce us
to some prominent figures.

125
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:21,630
Alright.

126
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,280
Come on.

127
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,280
No need.

128
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,640
There are seats.

129
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,560
Thank you.

130
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:42,760
I never imagined in my dreams

131
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:47,120
that we would sit among the capital's
distinguished officials.

132
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,760
Right, honey?

133
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:54,470
Where's your father?

134
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:59,590
If not for Lord Wei's guidance,

135
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:03,000
my nephew Ningyan
wouldn't have achieved today's success.

136
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,960
I am deeply grateful

137
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,520
and have been meaning
to thank you in person.

138
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,200
You are too kind.

139
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,200
Then it's settled.

140
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,320
I'll visit you

141
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,830
with Ningyan another day.

142
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:25,960
Lord Wei,

143
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,560
I won't disturb you any further.

144
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,470
I'll take my leave.

145
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:30,920
Wait.

146
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:32,310
What's wrong?

147
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,520
Lord Wei's purple clay teapot.

148
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:39,680
Look what I did.

149
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:41,550
My apologies.

150
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,520
I'll be going now.

151
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:48,590
He looks familiar.

152
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:51,270
Have I seen him somewhere before?

153
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,520
Not hiding below anymore?

154
00:08:58,270 --> 00:08:59,520
Come on, sit on my lap.

155
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,720
Where did this kid come from?

156
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:01,760
Uncle,

157
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:04,640
can I have some of your food?

158
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,480
Of course.

159
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,040
This girl

160
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:09,560
seems to be Xu Qi'an's younger sister.

161
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:10,870
She's quite bold.

162
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:12,590
Wait a minute.

163
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:16,710
How did you get up here?

164
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:18,320
- Come down.
- It's fine.

165
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,040
Lord Wei is just playing with her.

166
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,830
The longer you keep this in your mouth,

167
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:25,230
the longer its sweetness will last.

168
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:28,920
Alright.

169
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,550
- Understand?
- When the sweetness fades,

170
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:32,510
none of the candied treats will be left.

171
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:33,560
As long as I keep eating,

172
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,110
the sweetness will never disappear.

173
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,960
Can you eat all of it?

174
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,400
Eat.

175
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,260
If you finish it,

176
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:40,320
I have more.

177
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,680
What a pity.

178
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:57,510
What's wrong, Father?

179
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,160
This kid has robust bones and qi

180
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:02,320
and a naturally deep foundation.

181
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,440
Unfortunately,

182
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,680
her tendons and bones lack flexibility,

183
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,910
making her unsuitable for martial arts.

184
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,710
No wonder she has such a big appetite.

185
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,870
This little girl must be a glutton.

186
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:16,080
You're mean.

187
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,830
You called me a glutton.

188
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:20,440
Xu Qi'an is so clever.

189
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,750
Why does he have such a sister?

190
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,680
Be careful, or she might eat you up.

191
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:32,920
Have you seen Xu Ningyan?

192
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:33,980
I haven't.

193
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:35,160
Could it be

194
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,350
he's too scared to show up?

195
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:39,130
Xu Qi'an is just a Fighter.

196
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:40,830
How could he duel
against the Tianyu Sect?

197
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:41,800
Besides,

198
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:43,230
with his meager cultivation,

199
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,440
can he really handle it?

200
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:45,310
Unless

201
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,560
they compete in poetry.

202
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,800
Are you enjoying his failure?

203
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,710
Go then if you can.

204
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:53,880
Lin'an.

205
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:55,590
They're just talking.

206
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:56,430
Don't get angry.

207
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,320
In a duel of the Three Sects,

208
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:14,590
the stronger side

209
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,200
surely wins.

210
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,080
The same goes for other paths.

211
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,800
But the Tianyu Sect is different.

212
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,040
It values enlightenment of the heart

213
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,800
and clarity of the mind.

214
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:27,830
Countless people are stronger
than Xu Qi'an in cultivation,

215
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:30,320
but so what?

216
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:31,350
Are they stronger

217
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:33,680
than Tianyu monks?

218
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:58,160
Father, don't worry.

219
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,510
Lord Wei is a great figure.

220
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:02,160
He wouldn't quarrel
with a kid like Lingyin.

221
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,510
Besides, Lord Wei has always
taken care of our family.

222
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:05,350
It'll be fine.

223
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,870
That makes sense.

224
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:11,920
With so many
distinguished figures here today,

225
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,350
as the head of the Xu Family,

226
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:15,920
I must maintain my dignity.

227
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:33,630
- We'll go get some food.
- Go back.

228
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:34,470
Alright.

229
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:41,080
Isn't that my father
and Prime Minister Wang?

230
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,590
Who arranged for them to sit together?

231
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:44,680
This must be

232
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,920
fate.

233
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:48,560
(Who could it be?)

234
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:49,760
(Aside from me,)

235
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:52,320
(who else would care
about their relationship?)

236
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,990
Isn't this...

237
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:58,080
Isn't this inappropriate?

238
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:01,110
I heard Ningyan mention before

239
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,510
that he wanted to introduce
my father to your father.

240
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,440
Perhaps

241
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,710
this was his arrangement.

242
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:10,320
Thank him very much.

243
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:13,550
(Father,)

244
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:14,920
(I beg you.)

245
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:16,960
(Please don't talk
to Prime Minister Wang.)

246
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,000
(Don't say a word.)

247
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:22,190
Hello.

248
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,000
I am Xu Pingzhi,

249
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:30,510
Baihu of the Imperial Guards.

250
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,080
You must be

251
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:36,510
a high-ranking official in the court.

252
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:39,200
You must be wondering

253
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:42,350
why an obscure officer like me

254
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:43,990
is seated

255
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,470
alongside you.

256
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,320
To tell you the truth,

257
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,550
the one who'll cleave the Dharma

258
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:53,560
is my nephew.

259
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,400
Xu Qi'an?

260
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,750
Yes, yes.

261
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,200
The Silver Gong, Xu Qi'an.

262
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,560
He solved the Tax Silver Case,

263
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:14,630
uncovered the method
of forging fake silver,

264
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:16,230
and even revealed

265
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,560
the long-hidden truth

266
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,830
behind Princess Pingyang's murder.

267
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:20,960
And the Sangbo Case too.

268
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,560
Is Xu Xinnian

269
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,350
your son?

270
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:26,320
Yes, yes.

271
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,590
He's my son.

272
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,470
I didn't expect my son to be so famous.

273
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,320
I've just heard a little about him.

274
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:37,400
Where

275
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:38,750
did you hear about him?

276
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,630
From whom?

277
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:44,510
I only heard

278
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:48,110
he's well-read

279
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,870
and ambitious.

280
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:54,510
My family has two talents.

281
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,630
Ningyan is still young,

282
00:14:56,650 --> 00:14:58,200
yet he's earned Lord Wei's recognition.

283
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,230
His future is boundless.

284
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:00,630
Xinnian also has

285
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,330
the bearing of a future Prime Minister.

286
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,400
When my time comes,

287
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,960
I'll have a worthy answer
to my family's ancestors.

288
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,710
My Lord,

289
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:17,590
may I ask you something?

290
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,830
Do you know

291
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:22,590
where the Prime Minister Wang Zhenwen

292
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:24,830
is seated?

293
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,440
Could you kindly

294
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,350
point him out to me?

295
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,110
Why are you asking about him?

296
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,200
To be honest,

297
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:39,230
Prime Minister Wang

298
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:41,920
is my future in-law.

299
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:45,760
What's wrong?

300
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:47,800
Drink slower, or you'll choke.

301
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:50,560
Look at those two,

302
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,710
getting along so well.

303
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,280
Really?

304
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:56,920
- Enough.
- Feeling better now?

305
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:02,280
Have some melon seeds
to soothe yourself.

306
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:04,800
The Prime Minister's daughter

307
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,510
and my son

308
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,510
are truly a match

309
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:09,920
made in heaven

310
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,320
and destined by the gods.

311
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:13,080
But the kids are grown now.

312
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,800
I can't interfere with their choices.

313
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:19,920
Wait a moment.

314
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:22,640
You brought this.

315
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:24,400
Come on.

316
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,640
Put this on for me.

317
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:28,820
(Xu Qi'an Will Win)

318
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:32,950
He'll win!

319
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,640
My Lord.

320
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:40,510
(Xu Qi'an Will Win)
With this on,

321
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:41,870
I look invincible now, right?

322
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,460
Yes, yes.

323
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,160
Supervisor.

324
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,230
The time has come.

325
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:49,640
A Buddhist phenomenon.

326
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:53,360
This Dharma is called Sumeru Seed.

327
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:56,160
As they say, Sumeru hides in a seed,

328
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,710
and a seed contains Sumeru.

329
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,990
It's amazing.

330
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,070
What's this Sumeru Seed?

331
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,790
Between heaven and earth lies a world;

332
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:05,790
beyond the world, one travels very fast.

333
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:08,960
Exactly.

334
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,230
The formation breaker

335
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:12,510
will enter their own independent world.

336
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,120
Only by breaking the formation

337
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,030
can they escape.

338
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,200
Failing to break it

339
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,680
will shatter their mind,

340
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,280
leaving them lost in illusions forever.

341
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,680
This formation...

342
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,030
It's extremely hard.

343
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:27,750
- Miss.
- Sir.

344
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:31,510
What a gimmick.

345
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,880
Reach the heavens.

346
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,600
Change everything.

347
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:19,230
Ascend

348
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,160
to the sky.

349
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:40,440
Dafeng will win!

350
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,550
Xu Qi'an will win!

351
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,840
Dafeng will win!

352
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,120
Ningyan, you've got this!

353
00:19:46,840 --> 00:20:00,600
Dafeng will win!

354
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,440
Dafeng...

355
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:18,790
Dafeng will win!

356
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:25,360
(Given how hyped the atmosphere is,)

357
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:32,960
(how can I end this)

358
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,030
(without cleaving the Dharma?)

359
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:41,590
Xu Qi'an,

360
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:44,640
here's some osmanthus cake.

361
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,320
You can eat it
while climbing the ladder.

362
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,480
I'm not hungry.

363
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,990
Just take it.

364
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:51,070
It's delicious.

365
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:52,310
And here's water too.

366
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,400
I wish you success.

367
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,680
I don't really understand
why the Supervisor chose you,

368
00:20:58,990 --> 00:20:59,830
but since he did,

369
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,680
he must have his reasons.

370
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:04,360
Don't be nervous.

371
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:07,550
Me?

372
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:08,470
I'm not nervous.

373
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:10,070
Why would I be nervous?
I'm not nervous.

374
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,240
Then why are you shaking?

375
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:18,960
I'm just

376
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:21,310
warming up

377
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,550
to get my body ready.

378
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:28,510
Dafeng will win!

379
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,230
Mr. Xu, are you heading up now?

380
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,360
Mr. Xu, you must return victorious.

381
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:35,920
We'll celebrate your success

382
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,230
for three days at Star Tower.

383
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:39,880
Wait, don't talk yet.

384
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:40,720
Take a break.

385
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,280
Xu Qi'an,

386
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,680
I was looking for you.

387
00:21:56,990 --> 00:21:57,830
What's this?

388
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,300
(Poems by Xu Qi'an)
They're poems you wrote for me.

389
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,990
When you're climbing the ladder,

390
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:03,270
you can recite them aloud.

391
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,440
That's so pretentious...

392
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:06,680
So precious.

393
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:08,990
This is a great chance to show off.

394
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:11,920
You are my guest adviser.

395
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:13,230
You can't lose in momentum.

396
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,200
Well...

397
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,360
I'm going.

398
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:27,350
Wait.

399
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,600
Are you going like this?

400
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:32,830
What's wrong?

401
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:34,310
Change your outfit.

402
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,710

What a great poem.

00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:12,170
How shameless.

453
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:13,600
He plagiarized my poem.

454
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,440
And he's basking

455
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:15,790
in all this attention

456
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:16,680
and admiration.

457
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:17,640
It's fine.

458
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,550
You're so talented.

459
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,990
No need to be bothered by this.

460
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:25,470
- Well said.
- Great poem.

461
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:26,880
Did you hear that?

462
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:28,440
He's enjoying the attention.

463
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:31,640
Only by aiming high

464
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,840
can one rise again.

465
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,790
- That's true.
- Right?

466
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:37,160
I wasn't exaggerating, right?

467
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,200
Isn't my nephew amazing?

468
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,680
He's amazing.

469
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,790
He is my nephew too,

470
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:43,200
a Silver Gong of the Guardians.

471
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:44,840
He's still unmarried.

472
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:45,880
Yes, yes.

473
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,940
He truly knows
how to attract the limelight.

474
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:51,360
It's unprecedented in history.

475
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:53,550
Even when I became a top scholar,

476
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,880
I couldn't compare
to half of his brilliance.

477
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:57,360
Such ideas

478
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,960
are beyond someone as mediocre as you.

479
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,840
Ningyan, go for it!

480
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:12,920
I'm Xu Qi'an, a Fighter from the Dafeng.

481
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,920
I came to break the formation.

482
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:20,550
This duel

483
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,120
is called Illusory.

484
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:25,400
One day in the world

485
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,750
equals to a thousand years

486
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,200
in the formation.

487
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,710
I've heard of this formation.

488
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:40,800
Supervisor,

489
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:43,120
what kind of power

490
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,710
does the Illusory hold?

491
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,750
It's not about power.

492
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:50,400
It's a formation that grinds you down.

493
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:53,710
(No flow of Qi force.)

494
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:56,200
(No immediate danger.)

495
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:58,920
(This formation probably
won't attack me.)

496
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,120
The enlightened

497
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:03,920
gain clarity,

498
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,920
but the obsessed

499
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:08,640
cannot reincarnate.

500
00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:15,640
The formation wears down
the entrant's mind

501
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:19,470
with the suffering
they've witnessed in life.

502
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,310
It's not only that.

503
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:25,030
It can also manifest an illusory future,

504
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:28,750
trapping one

505
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:30,640
in endless cycles of despair.

506
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,840
The more hardships someone has endured,

507
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:36,020
the heavier their karmic burden,

508
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:38,120
and the harder it is to break free.

509
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:54,940
Where is this?

510
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,640
I must reach the top of Mount Tai,

511
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,960
overlooking the mountains with pride.

512
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:07,230
From now on,

513
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:08,680
your name is Yang Ling.

514
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:10,440
Mom?

515
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,070
Give it to me. Give it to me to play.

516
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,880
Give it to me to play.

517
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:16,960
Give it to me.

518
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:20,540
(Little Yang Ling)

519
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:22,270
I bought a new car.

520
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:24,120
Everyone, come and see.

521
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:27,310
Come over.

522
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,070
Hurry.

523
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:31,230
You didn't come home all night.

524
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:32,070
Where were you?

525
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:33,640
It was just a work meeting,

526
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:34,840
drinking with the boss.

527
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,230
Why are you making such a fuss?

528
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:37,390
Drinking?

529
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:38,680
Then what's this?

530
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:40,680
And who's this in your phone?

531
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,680
I'm sorry. I...

532
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,550
Get out. Get out of my sight.

533
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:53,400
One, two, one.

534
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:55,790
You finally passed the exam.

535
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:57,920
Don't give up because of my illness.

536
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,270
Mom, it's okay.

537
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:02,710
(Admissions Pamphlet)
I can enter the workforce early.

538
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:25,900

542
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:42,640
Lighting.

543
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:48,300
(Why didn't I notice before?
The scenery on the road is beautiful.)

544
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:54,860
(Sept. 8. I saw her again.)

545
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:10,340
(Next time, I need to be cooler.)

546
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:13,980
Patterns.

547
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:16,640
(Sept. 15. I'll take the initiative.)
Patterns.

548
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,510
Patterns.

549
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:27,990
(With all the courage I have,)

550
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,220
(I still missed by one second.
I'm such a fool.)

551
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:38,260
(The last day of September.
An unexpected encounter.)

552
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:44,640
Excuse me.

553
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,160
I dropped my bag.

554
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,480
Hi.

555

00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:05,960
We've met.

558
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:18,910
Hi.

559
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,440
I'm Ke Ke.

560
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,480
Hello.

561
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:25,990
Your coffee's here.

562
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:28,900
(Our second year together)
Where is she?

563
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:29,760
Dummy.

564
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:32,630

(I worked hard.)

579
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:36,550
Mr. Wang,

580
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,840
is that house still available?

581
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,360
Sure, let me show you around.

582
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:42,470
Step aside.

583
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:44,640
- That's my client.
- What are you saying?

584
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,710
Mr. Li, Mrs. Li, come on.

585
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:46,790
Sorry. This way.

586
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,790
Sis, it's the layout I like, right?

587
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:50,750
Yes, the same one you saw last time.

588
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:51,880
Only two left now.

589
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,070
They're selling fast. Look.

590
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:54,710
This one gets great natural light.

591
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:56,400
(I thought I could give her a home.)
Good.

592
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,990
Come here. I've found this.

593
00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:00,650
It's the perfect place for you.

594
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:01,500
Come here. Look.

595
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:02,710
Let me point it out for you.

596
00:34:02,770 --> 00:34:04,540
Do you like villas
or spacious apartments?

597
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:06,470
I'll make enough money
to buy you a house here.

598
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:08,360
Look. That's the one I want.

599
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:09,480
That one.

600
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:12,390
Wait here.

601
00:34:12,990 --> 00:34:14,030
Hey, bro.

602
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:15,860
Can I borrow your laser pointer?

603
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:18,680
Thanks.

604
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:20,760
See?

605
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,360
This one's amazing.

606
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,710
It's right by the lake.

607
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,920
We'll have a home with a lake view.

608
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,310
Let's come back

609
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:28,400

610
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,550
I got accepted

611
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:51,800
So?

612
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:22,630
Alright, both of you.

613
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:25,030
Smile. Perfect.

614
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:26,780

and Dad's medical expenses.

618
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,280
Check how much is left.

619
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:44,720
(Current Deposit)
It's here.

620
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:58,720
I...

621
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,320
I'll think of another way.

622
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:41,070
I must reach the top of Mount Tai,

623
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,220
overlooking the mountains with pride.

624
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:44,440
From now on,

625
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,960
your name is Yang Ling.

626
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:48,030
Do you like it?

627
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:58,320
I must reach the top of Mount Tai,

628
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:00,470
overlooking the mountains with pride.

629
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:03,440
From now on,
your name is Yang Ling.

633
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:17,310
is Yang Ling.

634
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,110
We've met.

635
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:25,240
Sorry, this way, please.

636
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:27,190
Yes, the same one you saw last time.

637
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:28,280
Only two left now.

638
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,280
They're selling fast.

639
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,240
This one's amazing.

640
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,720
Look, it's right by the lake.

641
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,720
We'll have a home with a lake view.

642
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:36,320
Let's come back when we can afford it.

643
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,160
Wait.

647

overlooking the mountains with pride.

649
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:03,720
From now on,

650
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,360
your name is Yang Ling.

651
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,440
What's going on?

652
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:08,030
Yeah, why isn't he moving?

653
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:08,960
What's wrong with him?

654
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,960
- I don't know.
- Is he losing?

655
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,720
- Can he do this?
- Is he just a pretty boy?

656
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,920
Uncle, why isn't my brother moving?

657
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,160
It's okay.

658
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,200
Just wait.

659
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,760
It's been more than an hour.

660
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:27,720
If we lose this battle,

661
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:30,150
the balance of power

662
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:34,150
between us and Tianyu will shift.

663
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:35,510
You'd better

664
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:36,990
have a backup plan.

665
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,550
- Otherwise...
- Your Majesty,

666
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:42,440
haven't you felt anything?

667
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:44,990
Ningyan,

668
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:46,880
draw your saber.

669
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,760
Why is he frozen?

670
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:51,720
Only by seeing through the illusion

671
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:53,320
can one break the formation.

672
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:54,960
If he fails to break it,

673
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,960
his mind will shatter.

674
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,510
Then he'll be ruined.

675
00:38:58,510 --> 00:38:59,350
No.

676
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,440
What do we do now?

677
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:09,880
Mr. Xu is trapped in the formation,

678
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:12,440
unable to fight back.

679
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:14,400
This duel seems hopeless.

680
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,630
I must reach the top of Mount Tai,

681
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,030
overlooking the mountains with pride.

682
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,800
From now on,
your name is Yang Ling.

683
00:39:37,470 --> 00:39:39,030
Your life

684
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:42,440
has truly broadened my horizons.

685
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,400
In the end,

686
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:48,840
you've accomplished nothing.

687
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:51,720
All is void.

688
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:53,880
You've been trapped

689
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:56,920
by life,

690
00:39:58,030 --> 00:39:59,190
love,

691
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,550
and your own mind,

692
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:04,110
day after day.

693
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:07,840
So, tell me:

694
00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:10,590
What's the meaning

695
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,470
of your life?

696
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:21,030
The meaning of life?

697
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,630
An ordinary background,

698
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,360
a childhood of scarcity,

699
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,550
failed love,

700
00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:35,720
and hopeless dreams.

701
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,920
Day after day,

702
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:40,880
year after year,

703
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:45,110
until I die like an ant.

704
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:48,670
Right.

705
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,320
By your standards,

706
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:57,070
I'm a complete failure.

707
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:08,920
However,

708
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,590
does a failed life

709
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,440
have no meaning?

710
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:26,030
There are many meanings

711
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:27,280
in one's life.

712
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:31,670
Living itself is meaningful.

713
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:34,190
I've been here.

714
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:36,240
I've done it.

715
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:37,720
I once had it.

716
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:42,030
Whether I succeed or fail,

717
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,720
the experience itself

718
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:48,400
is meaningful enough.
