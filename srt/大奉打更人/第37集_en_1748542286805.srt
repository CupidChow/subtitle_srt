give the statement to the Kui tribe.

192
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:25,260
But he told me later

193
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,260
that he hadn't come to the Kui tribe yet.

194
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:29,260
So I asked you to go to Chu Zhou.

195
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:30,260
It's time.

196
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:32,260
I can't wait for him.

197
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,260
Wei, you knew that

198
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:38,260
Prince of Zhenbei was a Chu Chai.

199
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:41,260
How did you know?

200
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:43,260
I guessed it.

201
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,260
I guessed it.

202
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:47,260
Before the delegation left,

203
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:48,260
Prince of Zhenbei

204
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:50,260
took the Zhenguo Sword to the court.

205
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:53,260
Why did he take the Zhenguo Sword?

206
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:55,260
In order to prevent the rebellion in the north,

207
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:58,260
the rebellion in the north has always been there.

208
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:00,260
He was worried that the Jin Dynasty

209
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:02,260
would be suppressed by the Kui tribe.

210
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:04,260
At that time, he couldn't control the situation.

211
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:06,260
So he took the Zhenguo Sword

212
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:07,260
to suppress the Kui tribe.

213
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:09,260
Prince of Zhenbei

214
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:12,260
is really a good man.

215
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:14,260
But he didn't

216
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:17,260
win a mysterious master

217
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:18,260
and he was a general.

218
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:21,260
He turned the situation around

219
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:23,260
and made him lose.

220
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:26,260
He asked you to marry him

221
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:30,260
and he was willing to do so.

222
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:31,260
But Wei,

223
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:33,260
the situation was like this.

224
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:34,260
You're right.

225
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:37,260
Prince of Zhenbei

226
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:40,260
didn't have to die in Chu Zhou.

227
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:42,260
Prince of Zhenbei was the second one to be defeated.

228
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,260
If he was the second one,

229
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:45,260
who would have been able to defeat him?

230
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:47,260
He couldn't defeat the second one.

231
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,260
Princess Consort

232
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:50,260
has been taken care of by you.

233
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:52,260
You...

234
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:54,260
You know everything.

235
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:57,260
Prince of Zhenbei, if you become the winner

236
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:58,260
and the golden burden,

237
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:01,260
you'll be the third one to be the original one.

238
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:03,260
The next one will be the Kui tribe

239
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:04,260
and even the Wusheng Sect.

240
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:07,260
Let them and Prince of Zhenbei

241
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:10,260
make the two of them the same.

242
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:12,260
It's also true that the Wusheng Sect

243
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,260
can punish them

244
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:15,260
on the battlefield.

245
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:17,260
There are too many ways to punish them.

246
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:19,260
After they're all used up,

247
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:21,260
they'll be removed.

248
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:23,260
But, Wei,

249
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:25,260
if it's the time

250
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:27,260
to pursue Prince of Zhenbei,

251
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:30,260
does that make any difference?

252
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:32,260
It does.

253
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:35,260
But the risk is small.

254
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:38,260
The result is different.

255
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:41,260
It's all a fair share

256
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:43,260
between the people of Chu and the people.

257
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,260
Xu Qian,

258
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:50,260
remember,

259
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:53,260
the kind-hearted person needs to be patient.

260
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:58,260
You didn't expose yourself this time.

261
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:00,260
If you keep

262
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:02,260
being a good person,

263
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:04,260
and you're happy,

264
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:08,260
you'll lose more.

265
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:15,260
I understand.

266
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:26,260
You brought Prince of Zhenbei's corpse

267
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:28,260
back to the capital.

268
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:31,260
What are you going to do in the future?

269
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:35,260
Give Prince of Zhenbei a sentence

270
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:37,260
to pay for the justice of the people of Chu.

271
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:38,260
I understand.

272
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:40,260
Don't worry about the court.

273
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:42,260
You're not in the office.

274
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:43,260
Don't bother about it.

275
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:45,260
What do you mean?

276
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:34,220
The

277
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,440
açıkrariiptus

278
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,460
OK

279
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:41,360
Princess

280
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:43,700
this's just a little bit of a exaggeration

281
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,720
It was only 10 trillion

282
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,600
now, turning around, that's the real deal

283
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:50,040
There is just over poundu

284
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:53,360
we have very few people in the whole world

285
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,740
What is it about?

286
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:57,080
I have a vacation

287
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,080
post the post about plant balance

288
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,200
But if it's large

289
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,260
Of course it's more popular

290
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:03,980
But I have to take the responsibility.

291
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:06,460
It's too much.

292
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,500
How can I help him without exaggeration?

293
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,060
Think about it.

294
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:12,260
He went to the kitchen to make tea.

295
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:13,860
He must be in trouble.

296
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:15,260
Besides,

297
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:16,940
he's just a son.

298
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:20,220
We helped him in the back.

299
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:21,700
In the first place,

300
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:23,900
we can reduce the money in the ancestral house.

301
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:25,380
Second,

302
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:29,180
even if he can't find anything,

303
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:30,660
he can be a monster.

304
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:34,220
People all over the world will help him.

305
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:37,260
Your Highness,

306
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:41,140
you really have to do your best.

307
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:44,780
Because he's my good friend.

308
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:48,380
Besides,

309
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:49,980
he gave me a gift

310
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:52,220
for a thousand miles.

311
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,380
I will definitely give it to him.

312
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,300
It's just a piece of butter.

313
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:58,740
How much did you give to his family?

314
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,300
It's a love letter.

315
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:02,900
Do you know what it is?

316
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:06,420
By the way,

317
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:08,980
remember to record the master of Xu Qian'an.

318
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:09,780
Then,

319
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:11,700
find someone who is in love with you,

320
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:13,980
and send him to the city's small station.

321
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:15,140
Yes.

322
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:17,500
Your Highness.

323
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:18,580
Your Highness.

324
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:19,420
Your Highness.

325
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:20,860
Why are you running so fast?

326
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:22,820
The group is back.

327
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:24,060
Really?

328
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:24,900
Your Highness.

329
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:29,500
Why didn't you get the news?

330
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,220
I...

331
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:32,740
It's impossible.

332
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,380
I've called all the places.

333
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:35,260
Once they come back,

334
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:37,060
I'll get the news for the first time.

335
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:38,980
Xiaoquanzi,

336
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:39,820
what's going on?

337
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:41,140
When did they come back?

338
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,700
I don't know.

339
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:43,420
I just know that

340
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:44,540
the first time they came back,

341
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,500
they met His Majesty.

342
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,700
His Majesty was furious.

343
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,140
He couldn't go back to the imperial study.

344
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:49,500
Noble Consort Gui and His Highness

345
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,620
had gone to visit the crown prince.

346
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,300
What happened?

347
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:54,940
I'm so confused.

348
00:18:58,460 --> 00:18:59,180
I have a way.

349
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:00,740
You can use the coffee egg.

350
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:01,980
You can change the shape immediately.

351
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:03,620
The candy.

352
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:04,780
The sugar.

353
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:08,140
Are you awake now?

354
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:09,420
Yes.

355
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:10,380
You can use the coffee egg.

356
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:12,300
You can change the shape anytime.

357
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:23,260
May 5th,

358
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:25,100
you long live in the east.

359
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:26,980
You will become

360
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:28,620
the Prince of Shouullah.

361
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:32,300
Wanderer One of the thousands

362
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:35,420
disappoints me in all the good deeds.

363
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:39,100
What about now?

364
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:41,900
Please steep the steps, Generals dash forward.

365
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:50,820
No, I don't.

366
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:56,060
I'm afraid that

367
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:59,060
the long wind will blow.

368
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:04,060
I only care about Yun Fan and Ji Cang Hai.

369
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:08,060
How about this?

370
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:10,060
Please teach me.

371
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:12,060
Master Shou Fu is here.

372
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:20,060
Greetings, Master Shou Fu.

373
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:26,060
No need to bow.

374
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,060
Master Shou Fu didn't come.

375
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:41,060
Looks like Master Shou Fu still

376
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:43,060
cares about me.

377
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:45,060
He's willing to meet me.

378
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:47,060
I don't care.

379
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:49,060
You're just not here.

380
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,060
I'm just here to see you.

381
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:53,060
I'm not willing to meet you.

382

388
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:06,060
The group is back.

389
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:09,060
But why didn't you

390
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:11,060
send someone to inform me?

391
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:15,060
Something happened.

392
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:18,060

Just say whatever you want.

400
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,060
Although the death sentence

401
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,060
will offend Your Majesty,

402
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:38,060
it's a good chance

403
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:39,060
to kill someone else.

404
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:41,060

We will kill all the people!

433
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:25,020
Who is it?

434
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:25,860
The King of the North!

435
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:26,540

There are so many people in the world.

00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:43,660
If there is no one,

441
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:44,660
we will die.

442
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:45,660
No.

443
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:50,140

452
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:10,780

Charming lord, let's take care of her.

458
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:29,960
Are we being sold by Squash?

463
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,420
since we were called a mess.

464
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:45,100
Don't talk to me, Eunuch.

465
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:47,940
I'm a useless man.

466
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:51,940
You...

00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:53,220

00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:00,260
What?

472
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:02,260
Are you going to take me down?

473
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:06,260
Greetings, Minister.

474
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:08,900

00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:09,340
Yes.

476
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,820
Your Majesty wishes to see you.

477
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:13,340

478
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:14,580
is only to see you.

479
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:17,340
The rest of you should go back quickly.

480
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:19,700
Don't let the filial piety go to the palace.

481
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:26,820
Your Majesty.

482
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:29,060

00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:31,220
until there's something the Second Lord can say.

491
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,340
Don't make a move.

492
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:36,500
Take your time.

493
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:37,860
Your fault.

494
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:39,820
Lord Xu Feng is her privilte.

495
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,100
Since you were little

496
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:43,860
the feelings of Prince Huai.

497
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:48,060
Prince Huai has left now.

498
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:50,580
You mean His Majesty...

499
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:51,260

00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:54,980
I got it.

501
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:09,740
Lord Shoufu.

502
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:14,300
I have to trouble you

503
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:16,500
to clear the way for the officials.

504
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:26,980
Your Majesty.

505
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:29,260
I...

506
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:32,220
I'm leaving.

507
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,260
Lord Shoufu.

508
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:56,580
Your Majesty.

509
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:58,940
Lord Shoufu is back.

510
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:07,900
Who are the officials

511
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:09,460
of the palace?

512
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:11,100
Your Majesty.

513
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:14,260
All the officials did come.

514
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:21,540
You niche

515
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:25,540
customary whis Batman

516
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:28,140
as scourge

517
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:30,660
because ofign yourねぇ

518
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:35,420
to do her a record.

519
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:36,220
Your Majesty.

520
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:38,460
Please forgive me.

521
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:44,100
Wei Yuan is here?

522
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:47,100
Your Majesty, I didn't see him.

523
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:54,100
Remember all the people who didn't come.

524
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:59,100
In the future, you will be like this.

525
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:01,100
Yes.

526
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:02,100
Yes.

527
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,100
Mr. Zheng,

528
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:14,100
you really want to go to the doctor's office?

529
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,100
Don't worry, brother.

530
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:18,100
The Prince of Zhenbei has been in the city for a long time.

531
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:20,100
Mr. Zheng has been sent to the prison.

532
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,100
Even if His Majesty

533
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:24,100
doesn't know how to behave at this time,

534
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:25,100
he will be angry.

535
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:29,100
I know that the big thing is not reliable.

536
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:31,100
Xu Yun Luo,

537
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:34,100
you are so kind to the emperor.

538
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:38,100
With the funds that are not enough,

539
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:42,100
you will be a great leader in the future.

540
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:47,100
He reminds me of the style of Wei's past.

541
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:52,100
Don't worry.

542
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:55,100
You are in the battle.

543
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,100
You understand.

544
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:01,100
I will tell you.

545
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:13,100
Mr. Zheng is a pitiful person.

546
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:16,100
Yuan Jing's 19th year of prison.

547
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:19,100
The teachers said that this man's father died early.

548
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:22,100
His mother was still in the heart and raised him.

549
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:24,100
It was not easy to send him to the Imperial College.

550
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:25,100
He was in the prison.

551
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:26,100
But he died.

552
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:29,100
He died because of his heart attack.

553
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,100
He was injured.

554
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:34,100
He didn't wait until his son died.

555
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:38,100
He was raised by the people.

556
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:40,100
He wanted to be the leader of the people.

557
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:42,100
He went to Chuzhou for the initiative.

558
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:45,100
He has been in Chuzhou for 20 years.

559
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:47,100
Most of his life is left there.

560
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:51,100
He died overnight.

561
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:54,100
20 years of prison.

562
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:56,100
He died overnight.

563
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:58,100
He said he was in the prison.

564
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,100
I don't want to talk about this.

565
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,100
How is it?

566
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:09,100
Where is Miss Wang?

567
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,100
Brother is self-centered.

568
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:13,100
He is very friendly.

569
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:15,100
I don't want to talk about this.

570
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:17,100
Tell me.

571
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:18,100
Brother has missed you.

572
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:19,100
It's been a long time.

573
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:21,100
I don't miss you.

574
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:22,100
I don't miss you.

575
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:23,100
I don't have money.

576
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:24,100
You don't have money.

577
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:25,100
I don't have money.

578
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:27,100
I haven't been angry with your mother for a while.

579
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:30,100
I haven't been angry with her.

580
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:33,100
She is more easy to be angry with.

581
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,100
You are so stupid.

582
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:38,100
You should have told me earlier.

583
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:39,100
I am busy.

584
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:40,100
I need to make a few dishes.

585
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:41,100
Okay.

586
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:43,100
Brother is back.

587
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:44,100
Hurry up.

588
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,100
Brother.

589
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:46,100
Here.

590
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:47,100
Aunt.

591
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,100
I need to make some more dishes.

592
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:50,100
I need to make some more dishes.

593
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,100
Don't be busy.

594
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,100
Lin Ye.

595
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:55,100
How do you feel that

596
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:56,100
you have changed a little bit

597
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:58,100
after coming back?

598
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,100
What do you mean?

599
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:01,100
The coordination of the group

600
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:03,100
and the way of the law

601
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:05,100
have improved.

602
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:07,100
Do you have any high-ranking points?

603
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,100
My dear.

604
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:10,100
Talk to me.

605
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:11,100
You should eat well.

606
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,100
Okay.

607
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:15,100
Aunt.

608
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:16,100
I haven't been here for a long time.

609
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:18,100
I treat you well.

610
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:19,100
I can't even open my eyes

611
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:21,100
when I see this bracelet.

612
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:23,100
You are still like Xu Pingzhi.

613
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:25,100
Do you have that feeling?

614
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:26,100
Food.

615
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:27,100
Food.

616
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:29,100
I will send it to you.

617
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:30,100
Okay.

618
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,100
I am done, uncle.

619
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:32,100
Look.

620
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,100
There is a love letter.

621
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,100
What are you talking about?

622
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:41,100
This is my future wife.

623
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:43,100
This is my future wife.

624
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:45,100
Your wife?

625
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:46,100
No.

626
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:47,100
Wait.

627
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:48,100
Your wife?

628
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:49,100
How come I don't know?

629
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:51,100
It's your wife.

630
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:53,100
Your wife is the best.

631
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:54,100
She always buys us

632
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:55,100
a lot of food.

633
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:56,100
She is so happy.

634
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,100
I am going to eat.

635
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:01,100
Look.

636
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:02,100
My brother didn't bring any gifts

637
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:03,100
for the gift

638
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:06,100
of the three-star princess of Lin'an.

639
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:07,100
My dad gave me

640
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:08,100
the gold knife

641
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:10,100
that the princess of Lin'an sent me yesterday.

642
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:13,100
I told you, baby.

643
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,100
I was just lying on her bed

644
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,100
last night.

645
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,100
I was sleeping.

646
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,100
I was not lying on her bed.

647
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:22,100
It seems that

648
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:23,100
the princess of Lin'an

649
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,100
sent people to ask

650
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,100
if you are coming today.

651
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:26,100
Why didn't you come today?

652
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:27,100
Yes.

653
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:29,100
Your wife must have hidden it.

654
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:30,100
Come out.

655
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:31,100
No, right?

656
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:35,100
Brother Zhou,

657
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:36,100
your food is ready.

658
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:42,100
It's all right.

659
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:49,100
It's noodles again.

660
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:51,100
You can't eat anything else.

661
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:54,100
You eat, drink and

662
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:56,100
keep picking and picking the food.

663
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:05,100
It's not good.

664
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:11,140
Jin Zi Putting She?

665
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:17,740
Didn't I entrust you

666
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:19,700
to say that

667
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,660
if not for單獨 看 roaring

668
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:23,960
and將 me

669
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:24,840
his security

670
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,300
put you back in the capital

671
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:28,920
You made your me

672
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,160
Truth

673
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:34,320
Take it once

674
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:35,280
I will pay for old slander

675
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,280
On that day

676
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:37,000
I will create you

677
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:37,720
a gas engine

678
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,720
Your Majesty won't see you.

679
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:40,720
If my father doesn't see me,

680
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:42,720
I'll kneel and beg for my life.

681
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:49,720
Li An.

682
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:57,720
Doctor Li,

683
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,720
come with me first.

684
00:33:58,720 --> 00:33:59,720
Listen to me.

685
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:01,720
Oifei,

686
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:03,720
you've been looking after me since I was a child.

687
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:05,720
You're not a man,

688
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:06,720
you're not a woman.

689
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:09,720
Although I'm not sincere,

690
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:11,720
I still have a lot of time.

691
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:15,720
Today, the imperial uncle has a big regret.

692
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:17,720
He's so useless.

693
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:19,720
He's so stubborn.

694
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:21,720
But my father is not.

695
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:24,720
As a queen,

696
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:26,720
I can't be a criminal.

697
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:27,720
Shut up.

698
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:36,720
I'll take you to the Young Master Palace.

699
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:39,720
I can find a place to stay.

700
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:40,720
I don't want to hear about this.

701
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:41,720
I don't want to hear about this.

702
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:42,720
Listen to me.

703
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:46,720
Bring the princess here.

704
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:48,720
Oifei.

705
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:49,720
Princess.

706
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:51,720
Princess, I miss you so much.

707
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:53,720
I'm so happy to see you.

708
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:54,720
I'm so happy to see you.

709
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:55,720
I'm so happy to see you.

710
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:56,720
Hurry up.

711
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:57,720
Send her back to the palace.

712
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,720
Chu Zhu has a big problem.

713
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,720
Today, the officials are making trouble in the imperial city.

714
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:07,720
They're making trouble.

715
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:10,720
Master Chu.

716
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:13,720
What's wrong with him?

717
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:16,720
You're so stubborn.

718
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:17,720
You're asking for so much.

719
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:21,720
Since you're so stubborn,

720
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:22,720
let's go in.

721
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:25,720
No wonder.

722
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,720
No wonder you're so sudden.

723
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:29,720
Master Zheng won't allow it.

724
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,720
Prince Zhenbei has been killed as a king.

725
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:33,720
He won't allow it either.

726
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:34,720
He won't allow it.

727
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,720
He'll send the people to the imperial city.

728
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:42,720
Brother.

729
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:44,720
Something's wrong.

730
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,720
His Majesty has been in a state of displeasure for many years.

731
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:51,720
His Majesty has been in a state of displeasure for many years.

732
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,720
Since you're so stubborn,

733
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:55,720
you're so stubborn.

734
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:57,720
It's our Majesty.

735
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,720
You're going to kill him now.

736
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:01,720
You're going to kill him.

737
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:02,720
You're going to kill him.

738
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:05,720
Prince Zhenbei has been killed as a king.

739
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:07,720
He's really...

740
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:08,720
Don't forget.

741
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:10,720
He's a good man.

742
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:13,720
Prince Zhenbei's secret investigation has been done.

743
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,720
Will these people

744
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,720
bring back the news of Prince Zhenbei's daughter?

745
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,720
Maybe when you're in a state of displeasure,

746
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,720
His Majesty has already secretly planned

747
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:23,720
how to deal with this.

748
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,720
Will the so-called one-sided loss

749
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,720
be just a loss to others?

750
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,720
If it's true,

751
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:35,720
the使 group has a plan that's not too urgent.

752
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:37,720
It's a failure from the start.

753
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:43,720
Even if it's just my guess,

754
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:45,720
I still have to remind you.

755
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,720
His Majesty has been playing the book for many years.

756
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,720
If he really gets up,

757
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:54,720
I'm afraid no one will be his opponent.

758
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:56,720
I think

759
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,720
we should be able to deal with this.

760
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,720
Since I can think of it,

761
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,720
I'm sure those big people

762
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:05,720
have some sort of idea.

763
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:08,720
Tomorrow,

764
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,720
I'll continue to call the horse in front of the palace

765
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:11,720
to check on His Majesty's intentions.

766
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:13,720
If His Majesty really gets into our plan,

767
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:15,720
we'll surely have a lot of trouble in three days.

768
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,720
I think

769
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,720
we should be able to deal with this.

770
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:22,720
There must be a lot of trouble.

771
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:27,720
But I'm young now.

772
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:28,720
I can't go to court.

773
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,720
But I can still be outside the court.

774
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,720
But the real main battlefield

775
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,720
is to hand over the Wei Palace to the government.

776
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,720
And those unknown and unknown forces

777
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:42,720
may be the right Chinese army in the heart.

778
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:43,720
Do you understand?

779
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,720
I heard Prince of Zhenbei died in Beijing.

780
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,720
It's a great opportunity.

781
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:55,720
But you locked me up.

782
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:57,720
I should be the one

783
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:58,720
who's going to avenge the people

784
00:37:58,720 --> 00:37:59,720
and chase after them

785
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:01,720
to kill the people.

786
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:03,720
When I think of it,

787
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:05,720
my whole hair

788
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,720
is going to be blown away.

789
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:09,720
Why?

790
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,720
Why is that mysterious master?

791
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:12,720
Why?

792
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,720
I'm the witness.

793
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:22,720
But

794
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,720
I don't think Xu Ningyan

795
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,720
has a clue.

796
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,720
I'm very disappointed.

797
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:32,720
He's very strict.

798
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,720
I'm sure he's watching

799
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,720
the mysterious master

800
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:37,720
in Chuzhou.

801
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:40,720
He's jealous.

802
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,720
Did you feel ashamed?

803
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,720
What's wrong with you?

804
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,720
Chuan Shenzhen, stop!

805
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,720
Yes.

806
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:56,720
Go on.

807
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:57,720
I'm done.

808
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:07,720
I'm so happy to see you

809
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,720
and see you.

810
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,720
You're so thoughtful.

811
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:13,720
You're so smart.

812
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:15,720
You're filial to the princess.

813
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,720
The royal family is in the capital.

814
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:18,720
Father is furious.

815
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,720
The situation is not as good as it is.

816
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,720
It's not as good as it is.

817
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,720
I wonder how it will end.

818
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,720
Everything is in the hands of the emperor.

819
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:29,720
Don't worry, princess.

820
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,720
But

821
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:33,720
the more things happen,

822
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:35,720
the more interesting things will be.

823
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:37,720
Prince of Zhenbei is in chaos.

824
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:39,720
Some people

825
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:41,720
only dream of it.

826
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,720
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

827
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,720
The great palace is in the capital.

828
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:13,720
The time has come.

829
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,720
The fifth day of the ceremony.

830
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:23,720
The world is in the hands of the emperor.

831
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:27,720
Qi Pao.

832
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:29,720
There are assassins in the palace.

833
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:30,720
Pass the order.

834
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,720
The imperial guards can enter the palace in an instant.

835
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:33,720
The emperor is in the palace.

836
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:35,720
The emperor is in the palace.

837
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:36,720
Protect the empress.

838
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:37,720
Yes.

839
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:41,720
The emperor has the order to send the things to the palace.

840
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:44,720
The emperor will respond to the emperor's orders.

841
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:47,720
The words and the information are recorded.

842
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:48,720
Yes.

843
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:49,720
The emperor said

844
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:51,720
he is not going to do anything for the emperor.

845
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:54,720
He is just a student of the Yunlu Academy.

846
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,720
How can he know the emperor's words?

847
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,720
He has the ability to do anything.

848
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:04,720
Go.

849
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,720
Who am I?

850
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:41,720
You want to date the emperor.

851
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:43,720
What is the attitude of a palaceroom?

852
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:44,840
You know

853
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:46,720
who I am.

854
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:47,720
Chief Qi will be Change in the imperial guard in the future.

855
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:48,720
Yes.

856
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,720
The emperor is a super attracting commander.

857
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:53,720
The emperor will come.

858
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:57,720
Well.

859
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:58,520
What about the court?

860
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,320
I heard that the political affairs

861
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:01,920
are being expanded day by day,

862
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:03,920
and the four places are connected.

863
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:08,520
But the witness is in a hurry.

864
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:19,720
The court

865
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:20,920
is just a little interesting

866
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:22,720
for Wei Yuan and Wang Zhenwen.

867
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,520
Other people are bad.

868
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:29,720
The court

869
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,920
is just a little interesting for Wei Yuan and Wang Zhenwen.

870
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:33,120
The court

871
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:36,320
is just a little interesting for Wei Yuan and Wang Zhenwen.

872
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:37,320
Yes.

873
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:59,720
I'm a man of my word.

874
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:07,120
The heart of the world is in danger.

875
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:11,720
But the past is a traitor.

876
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:15,120
I'm angry and angry.

877
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:19,120
I have no merit.

878
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:21,720
I'm a man of my word.

879
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:23,920
I've seen the world alone.

880
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:24,920
I'm not a man of my word.

881
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:26,320
I'm a man of my word.

882
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:28,320
I'm a man of my word.

883
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:31,120
The heart of the world is in danger.

884
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:32,720
I'm angry and angry.

885
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:35,520
I have no merit.

886
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:40,120
I'm a man of my word.

887
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:43,920
I'm a man of my word.

888
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:47,120
I'm a man of my word.

889
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:50,320
I'm a man of my word.

890
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:58,520
The heart of the world is in danger.

891
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:01,120
The heart of the world is in danger.

892
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:02,920
I'm a man of my word.

893
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:08,520
I'm angry and angry.

894
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:11,320
I have no merit.

895
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:14,720
I'm a man of my word.

896
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:17,720
I'm not a man of my word.

897
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:21,720
I'm a man of my word.

898
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,720
I'm a man of my word.

899
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:26,720
I'm afraid I'll be able to see you again.

900
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:28,720
I'm afraid I'll be able to see you again.
