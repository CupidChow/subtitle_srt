1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm afraid I'll be a little bit late

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm curious what I'm going to do

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I don't want to think about the future

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Let's make this night a little bit more quiet

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm not very strict

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
When you're here

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'll tell you the rules

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'll give you the order

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'll keep my mouth shut

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'll tell you this big piece of shit

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
We're all one

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
We're all one

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
We're all one

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
We're all one

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
We're all one

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
We're all one

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
We're all one

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
We're all one

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
We're all one

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
We're all one

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
We're all one

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
We're all one

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm afraid I'll be a little bit late

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm not very strict

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
When you're here

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'll tell you the rules

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'll give you the order

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'll give you the order

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,780
My idol

30
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:28,980
Your greatestership

31
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,400
Our great stubbornness

32
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,220
Ouch

33
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:31,880
Organize

34
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:32,700
Ten Bo�

35
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:33,740
I will surely win

36
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:34,720
For the Huanyi

37
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:36,040
Our valuable

38
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:36,800
The beautiful

39
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:38,520
The MOSQI

40
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:45,520
The great

41
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,800
Theundredth anniversary

42
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,220
Where are the ten times?

43
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:52,020
Aいた

44
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,740
All troubles

45
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:24,940
Where did he go?

46
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:25,740
I don't know.

47
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:26,740
This little bastard.

48
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:28,740
He went to find him with two chiefs.

49
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:29,740
Xu Qi.

50
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:34,740
Mingyi.

51
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:37,740
Where is he?

52
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:48,740
Mingyi.

53
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:50,740
Mingyi.

54
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:51,740
Mingyi.

55
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:53,740
Mingyi.

56
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:54,740
Mingyi.

57
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:56,740
Mingyi.

58
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:57,740
Where is he?

59
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:58,740
Mingyi.

60
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:11,740
Mingyi.

61
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:17,740
Mingyi.

62
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:20,740
Mingyi.

63
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:23,740
Mingyi.

64
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:27,740
Mingyi.

65
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:32,740
Now, we have found out

66
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:33,740
that the Imperial Court of State of Yun

67
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:35,740
has colluded with the God of Wusheng Sect

68
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,740
to steal the silver and silver

69
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:38,740
to raise the rebels.

70
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:40,740
Xu Qi'an, the silver-gray man,

71
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:41,740
has been able to kill the rebels

72
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:42,740
by himself.

73
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:44,740
He has led the rebels

74
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:46,740
to chase the silver and silver

75
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:47,740
for 15,000 taels of silver.

76
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:49,740
He has colluded with the God of Wusheng Sect

77
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,740
to take the rebels

78
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,740
and the rebels.

79
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:56,740
I, Nianqi, am bold and brave

80
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:57,740
to take the lead.

81
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:58,740
I am bold and brave

82
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,740
to seek the throne of Xu Qi'an.

83
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,740
I, Wei Yuan,

84
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,740
am bold and brave.

85
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:07,740
Xu Qi'an is indeed a talent.

86
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,740
What a pity.

87
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:13,740
Wei Qing wants to seek the throne of Xu Qi'an.

88
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:14,740
Wei Yuan.

89
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:16,740
What does Zhong Qing think?

90
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:17,740
Your Majesty.

91
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:20,740
Xu Qi'an is the head of the imperial court.

92
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:21,740
I think

93
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:23,740
he should take the throne.

94
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:24,740
Your Majesty.

95
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:25,740
I object.

96
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:28,740
Xu Qi'an is a good man.

97
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:29,740
But don't forget.

98
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,740
He is the first one to be born.

99
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,740
He should be given more gold.

100
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:36,740
He should have the right to be generous.

101
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:37,740
Your Majesty.

102
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:38,740
Please think twice.

103
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:39,740
Your Majesty.

104
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:41,740
Xu Qi'an is wise.

105
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:44,740
Xu Qi'an is just a little silver.

106
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:46,740
He is also a good man.

107
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:50,740
If he is qualified to be the head of the imperial court,

108
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:53,740
then he can be the head of the imperial court

109
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:55,740
and be the head of the imperial court.

110
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,740
I think he is a good man.

111
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:59,740
Your Majesty.

112
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:00,740
Do you think so?

113
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:01,740
Yes.

114
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,740
He is a good man.

115
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:04,740
Yes.

116
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:05,740
He is a good man.

117
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:06,740
Yes.

118
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,740
How can he be a good man?

119
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:09,740
Xu Qi'an is a good man.

120
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:11,740
He is a good man.

121
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:12,740
He is a good man.

122
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:13,740
Yes.

123
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,740
He is a good man.

124
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:18,740
Your Majesty.

125
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:21,740
Xu Qi'an is just a little silver.

126
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:23,740
He should be given more gold.

127
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:25,740
You.

128
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:28,740
You.

129
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:29,740
You.

130
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:30,740
You.

131
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:41,740
Your Majesty.

132
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:43,740
I am the general of the imperial court.

133
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,740
I am the general of the imperial court.

134
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:46,740
I am the general of the imperial court.

135
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:47,740
Please give me the order.

136
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:48,740
I will give you the order.

137
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:06,740
Why are you laughing?

138
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:11,740
Your Majesty.

139
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:14,740
I am laughing because I saw you laughing.

140
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:26,740
Father.

141
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:29,740
Father.

142
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,740
The body of Xu Yingluo has been sent back.

143
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:33,740
According to your order,

144
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:34,740
it has been sent to the Xu family.

145
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:37,740
Xiaorou.

146
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:42,740
I will get the transformation map of the Wusheng Sect

147
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,740
in the three days.

148
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,740
After the autumn harvest,

149
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:51,740
I will fight the Wusheng Sect.

150
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:55,740
I will pay all the price.

151
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:11,740

Xiaorou 26th.

175
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:33,740
And one present.

176
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:35,740
You've been away for so long.

177
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:39,340
You must be tired.

178
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,340
You should thank me.

179
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:57,820
Jingjing.

180
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:01,420
Help your mother to rest.

181
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:04,220
I'll stay here and wake up.

182
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:06,420
No.

183
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:09,020
I'll stay here with my brother.

184
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:21,620
Yang Ze.

185
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:26,020
You've been blind for days.

186
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,220
I'll help you go back to your room.

187
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:33,620
I'll go back to my room.

188
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:03,620
You're so beautiful.

189
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:07,620
Are you playing with us again?

190
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:09,620
Right?

191
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:18,820
I'm telling you.

192
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:21,820
Don't pretend to be dead.

193
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:24,820

You didn't say anything.

202
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:47,220
Jingjing.

00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:00,020

when he was in Renzhou.

216
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,740
He said that when Shuyin comes back,

217
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,300
I don't need to go to Jingzhao's house.

218
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:14,700
I didn't expect

219
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:17,500
Shuyin would come back.

220
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,180
He's gone.

221
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:32,660
No, the day is over.

387
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:49,340
You are my life partner.

388
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:53,340
Wait for the exchange.

389
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:55,340
You owe me one.

390
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:01,340
Good.

391
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:02,340
Of course.

392
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:05,340
By the way,

393
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:06,740
have you seen the second Li Miaozhen

394
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:08,740
in the Yundou?

395
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:10,340
He is not in Yundou.

396
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:11,340
I asked him.

397
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:14,340
He said he was on the way to the capital.

398
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:16,340
I wanted to ask him

399
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:18,340
to take his power.

400
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:20,340
If he is in the town,

401
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:22,340
I wouldn't be in a hurry.

402
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:29,340
It seems that you are destined to be in a difficult situation.

403
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:32,340
No need to see him off.

404
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:35,540
By the way,

405
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:37,540
what's wrong?

406
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:41,940
You are not in a good health.

407
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:51,540
Send Xu Yunruo to the capital.

408
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:58,340
You are a real person.

409
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:01,340
I thought that you are a man with a name.

410
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:02,540
Then why didn't you let me?

411
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:04,540
Why didn't you die in Yundou?

412
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:16,540
He is gone.

413
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:18,940
Maybe...

414
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:21,140
Wei Gong!

415
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:25,540
I have seen Wei Gong.

416
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:34,540
Come.

417
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:40,540
I have seen the report from Song Dingfeng.

418
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:42,540
He said after you finished the investigation,

419
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:43,540
you disappeared.

420
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:45,540
The detective killed you.

421
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:46,540
But I know that

422
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:49,540
you are not a murderer.

423
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:52,540
I am not sure what it is.

424
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:54,540
But it is not a detective.

425
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:00,540
Xu Qibao.

426
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:04,540
Xu Qian.

427
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:07,540
I have one more thing to say.

428
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:17,540
Wei Gong,

429
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:19,540
I don't understand.

430
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:21,540
Did Zhu Yang kill me?

431
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:23,540
Zhu Yang is busy in the ice department.

432
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:24,540
He is the most serious one in the ice department.

433
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:25,540
How to kill you?

434
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:28,540
Doctor,

435
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,540
His Majesty is in a hurry to get you into the palace.

436
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:32,540
In the ice department?

437
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:33,540
Zhu Yang?

438
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:34,540
Yes.

439
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:36,540
In the three months of Yundou,

440
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:37,540
Zhu Yang went to the ice department.

441
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:39,540
He used Jin Luo's identity

442
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:40,540
to investigate the internal corruption of the person

443
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:41,540
who was involved in the investigation.

444
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:43,540
His Majesty ordered to investigate the person.

445
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:45,540
Two Jin Luo and a dozen Pengluo were killed.

446
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:47,540
They were all locked up in the Ministry of Justice.

447
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:50,540
It is just to revenge.

448
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:54,540
Wei Gong is a murderer.

449
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:55,540
No.

450
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:58,540
Then don't worry about it.

451
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:02,540
Father Yi pushed Zhu Yang out of the water.

452
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:04,540
Then Zhu Yang was in a difficult situation.

453
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:06,540
He was clearly beaten up by a man.

454
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:08,540
If Zhu Yang is not the one,

455
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:11,540
what is the real reason?

456
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:12,540
Illusion.

457
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:13,540
Illusion?

458
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:16,540
The God of God, San Ping,

459
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:18,540
Lin Huishi,

460
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:20,540
is a kind and wise murderer.

461
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:22,540
Once he is caught,

462
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:24,540
the thoughts,

463
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:25,540
the words,

464
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:26,540
the words,

465
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:28,540
will become the hallucinations.

466
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:29,540
He will be killed.

467
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:35,540
Lin Huishi?

468
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:38,540
Wei Gong,

469
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:40,540
I am just a small character.

470
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:43,540
Why did San Ping Lin Huishi

471
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:45,540
use his identity to kill me?

472
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:47,540
If he really wanted to kill you,

473
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:50,540
would you still be sitting here?

474
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:00,540
Wei Gong,

475
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:02,540
I still don't understand.

476
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:04,540
Don't bother yourself.

477
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:05,540
As a murderer,

478
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:07,540
you must be taught a lesson.

479
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:10,540
Remember,

480
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:11,540
when the sky falls,

481
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:13,540
I will protect you.

482
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:15,540
Yes.

483
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:17,540
By the way,

484
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:19,540
how did you live?

485
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:22,540
It was the year of the Tianjin Assembly.

486
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:23,540
It was the Teotai Bay.

487
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:26,540
You used the Teotai Bay in the Four Heavens.

488
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:28,540
If someone asks you,

489
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:29,540
you will answer them.

490
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:31,540
Do you understand?

491
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:34,540
Yes.

492
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:39,540
Mr. Gong.

493
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:42,540
Wei Gong,

494
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:43,540
the lake is in a mess.

495
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:45,540
Xu Ji'an is back from the war.

496
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:46,540
How could he be

497
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:48,540
playing the Teotai Bay?

498
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:49,540
The Teotai Bay is a city.

499
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:50,540
Even His Majesty

500
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:51,540
can't afford it.

501
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:53,540
The Four Heavens

502
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:54,540
are the best.

503
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:55,540
If you don't want to play,

504
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:56,540
the Four Heavens

505
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:57,540
will not give you to anyone.

506
00:30:58,540 --> 00:30:59,540
It's true.

507
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:01,540
His Majesty can ask

508
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:02,540
the people to the Four Heavens

509
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:03,540
to ask.

510
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:06,540
Okay.

511
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:09,540
Then let's go to the Four Heavens.

512
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:11,540
Besides,

513
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:13,540
we will take the seal back.

514
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:15,540
We will wait for the time to come.

515
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:27,540
Where are they going?

516
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:29,540
They are going to the place

517
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:30,540
where Brother Li is.

518
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:31,540
I didn't say

519
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:32,540
I would send them off.

520
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:34,540
After work, drink some wine.

521
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:36,540
Drink some wine.

522
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:37,540
Xu Ji'an is coming.

523
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:38,540
Didn't you hear that?

524
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:40,540
Someone just saw Xu Ji'an.

525
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:41,540
Xu Ji'an?

526
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:42,540
No way.

527
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:43,540
He is going out today.

528
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:46,540
We can't be Xu Ji'an's ghost.

529
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:48,540
Ghost can't get in the sheep.

530
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:49,540
Xu Ji'an, what's the matter?

531
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:50,540
I didn't finish talking.

532
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:51,540
I'm telling you.

533
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:53,540
I don't like Xu Ji'an at all.

534
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:54,540
You don't like this group.

535
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:56,540
We can't finish this.

536
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:57,540
We can't drink wine.

537
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:59,540
We can't even have a son.

538
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:00,540
He is dead.

539
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:01,540
Yes.

540
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:08,540
Who is this?

541
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:09,540
Who is this?

542
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:10,540
Who is this?

543
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:17,540
Xu Ji'an.

544
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:18,540
Xu Ji'an.

545
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:24,540
Xu Ji'an.

546
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:48,540
Who said I was dead?

547
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:55,540
Xu Ji'an.

548
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:05,540
Sorry.

549
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:07,540
Sorry.

550
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:09,540
Master Xu.

551
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:11,540
Didn't you sleep?

552
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:12,540
Are you dead?

553
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:14,540
Yes.

554
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:18,540
I've introduced myself.

555
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:20,540
I'm Xu Ji'an's brother, Xu Ba'an.

556
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:22,540
I'm Xu Ba'an's brother.

557
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:23,540
I'm Xu Ba'an's brother.

558
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:25,540
I want to ask you something.

559
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:27,540
Where are the people of Chunfeng?

560
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:30,540
They seem to go to Yunzhou.

561
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:31,540
Yunzhou?

562
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:33,540
Why go to Yunzhou?

563
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:35,540
Yang Jinluo and Li Yunluo

564
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:37,540
heard your brother died in Yunzhou.

565
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:39,540
They were sad and blame themselves.

566
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:41,540
So Tian Meinao

567
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:43,540
went to the village to meet all of them.

568
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:44,540
To stay in Yunzhou.

569
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:46,540
So he asked your brother

570
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:48,540
to be a big judge.

571
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:49,540
To be killed.

572
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:50,540
Godless?

573
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:56,540
All ready.

574
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:01,540
Yin Yan.

575
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:02,540
Give up.

576
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:03,540
Go to Yunzhou.

577
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:06,540
We must send the Godless to Yunyue.

578
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:10,540
You are the best.

579
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:12,540
Master Jia.

580
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:13,540
All ready.

581
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:21,540
Let's go.

582
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:52,540
Perfect Every One

583
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:11,540
Everybody will be happy.

584
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:15,540
I will be happy.

585
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:16,540
Xu Ba'an,

586
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:18,540
You're a man and a woman, aren't you?

587
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:20,540
I'm telling you.

588
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:22,540
If you continue to do this,

589
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:24,540
you'll break your legs.

590
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:25,540
I won't.

591
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:26,540
I won't.

592
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:27,540
Let's just let the women go.

593
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:29,540
Get out.

594
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:30,540
Okay.

595
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:34,540
You're quite big.

596
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:36,540
You dare to play with me?

597
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:37,540
No.

598
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:38,540
No.

599
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:39,540
No.

600
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:44,540
Zhu Yan.

601
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:45,540
You're so good.

602
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:47,540
Let's go.

603
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:56,540
The master of the palace is the 88th Lu Jian Buping.

604
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:58,540
A little bit more serious.

605
00:35:58,540 --> 00:35:59,540
It's the 89th time.

606
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:02,540
I've played the game twice in the Wushan.

607
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:04,540
You're still good.

608
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:07,540
But, master.

609
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:08,540
You're playing all the way.

610
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:10,540
When can we get to the Grand Palace?

611
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:12,540
The flag is flying.

612
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:13,540
It's a big day.

613
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:14,540
Now, it's good.

614
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:15,540
The ancestors wasted three months.

615
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:17,540
Wasted?

616
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:18,540
How can it be wasted?

617
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:20,540
This time, Xia Shanan

618
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:21,540
was doing this for Lu Shili.

619
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:22,540
Lu Shili?

620
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:25,540
I thought it was for my own good.

621
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:28,540
It's also for your own good.

622
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:30,540
Okay.

623
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:33,540
Of course, it's for your own good.

624
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:37,540
No. 3.

625
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:39,540
Yes.

626
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:40,540
My four friends

627
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:41,540
have gone to Yunzhou.

628
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:43,540
Please help me keep an eye on them.

629
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:45,540
I'll tell them

630
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:46,540
their appearance and characteristics.

631
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:48,540
Yunzhou is not very good recently.

632
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:49,540
No way.

633
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:51,540
They're going to attack the Wushan Sect.

634
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:53,540
What are you thinking about?

635
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:55,540
If you find them,

636
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:57,540
tell them that

637
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:58,540
Xu Qian is dead.

638
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:01,540
Tell them to not rush back to the capital.

639
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:05,540
But I'm going to the capital soon.

640
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:07,540
But it's okay.

641
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:08,540
I can fly back to the capital for your business.

642
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:10,540
Okay.

643
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:12,540
By the way,

644
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:14,540
I have something to ask you to help me.

645
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:15,540
How can I help you?

646
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:16,540
You want to see me?

647
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:19,540
What? You don't want to?

648
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:21,540
Don't forget.

649
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:22,540
You owe me a favor.

650
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:29,540
I know.

651
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:32,540
But I'm not in a hurry.

652
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:34,540
I'm in the academy

653
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:36,540
and I'm really good at studying.

654
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:38,540
How about this?

655
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:39,540
You can ask my brother directly.

656
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:40,540
Your brother?

657
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:43,540
My brother Xu Qian is a Dagener.

658
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:45,540
He's much better than me.

659
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:46,540
He's a talented man.

660
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:47,540
He's a good man.

661
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:49,540
And he's a handsome man.

662
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:50,540
He's a handsome man.

663
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:51,540
He's a good man.

664
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:53,540
Then how can I find him?

665
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:55,540
Go to Dagener directly.

666
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:57,540
Brother,

667
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:58,540
Miss Taiwei is here to see you.

668
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:00,540
I have something to tell you.

669
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:01,540
Please remember it.

670
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:05,540
No. 3.

671
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:06,540
No. 3.

672
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:09,540
No. 3 is not reliable.

673
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:11,540
We need to help him.

674
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:12,540
He's good.

675
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:13,540
He's helping us.

676
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:16,540
I'm so convinced.

677
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:18,540
Xu Qian, right?

678
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:20,540
He's good at teaching me.

679
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:21,540
Go.

680
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:23,540
Find some scumbags.

681
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:24,540
Okay.

682
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:25,540
No. 9.

683
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:28,540
Taiwei,

684
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:30,540
why are you here?

685
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:31,540
Here.

686
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:38,540
I have two things to tell you.

687
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:40,540
The first thing is,

688
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:42,540
don't go to Sitenjian today.

689
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:44,540
After hearing that you're alive,

690
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:45,540
the whole Sitenjian is gone.

691
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:46,540
Sun Fei is coming to the police.

692
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:48,540
Fortunately, I'm staying here.

693
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:51,540
So,

694
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:53,540
how did you live?

695
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:59,540
Because...

696
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:03,540
Because I used a toilet.

697
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:06,540
A toilet?

698
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:08,540
What's that?

699
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:10,540
Sitenjian is a fake.

700
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:12,540
He can't even breathe.

701
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:13,540
If you're dead,

702
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:15,540
you'll be the one to die.

703
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:17,540
After you're dead,

704
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:19,540
you'll be dead.

705
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:21,540
You're a small person.

706
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:24,540
Why do you want to live?

707
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:30,540
Because...

708
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:31,540
I...

709
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:33,540
Because I...

710
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:34,540
Because I...

711
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:37,540
I gave you a gift.

712
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:40,540
This is the gift I gave you

713
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:42,540
when I saw you in Sitenjian.

714
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:44,540
It's been in my bag for ten years.

715
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:50,540
So, it's you.

716
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:55,540
So, the second thing is,

717
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:59,540
this is your gift.

718
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:03,540
I don't know why.

719
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:04,540
I'll take care of it

720
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:06,540
if you keep asking me to give you the gift.

721
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:09,540
Remember my kindness.

722
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:10,540
When you're in the future,

723
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:11,540
you'll be able to tell me

724
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:12,540
what's good like a chicken.

725
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:13,540
You can exchange it for me.

726
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:14,540
I'll do it.

727
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:15,540
Thank you.

728
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:21,540
This is so good.

729
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:22,540
Send me the gift later.

730
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:23,540
Okay.

731
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:24,540
I'm leaving.

732
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:28,540
Oh, right.

733
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:35,540
What's this?

734
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:37,540
After you take off your clothes,

735
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:40,540
your body will have some small changes.

736
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:42,540
Remember to take this medicine.

737
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:44,540
It's good for you to cut it.

738
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:46,540
I'm leaving.

739
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:51,540
No need to play.

740
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:52,540
I can still cut my small legs.

741
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:53,540
What else?

742
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:02,540
I'm serious about the emperor.

743
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:04,540
Xu Qian took off his clothes.

744
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:07,540
This is his teacher.

745
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:10,540
It's okay.

746
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:14,540
He'll give her the change.

747
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:16,540
Xu Qian is back to life.

748
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:18,540
I need to take this.

749
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:21,540
After the funeral,

750
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:23,540
the teacher was unwell.

751
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:26,540
The next person was sent to Yunzhou.

752
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:27,540
There are many things.

753
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:29,540
I think Wei Gong has already

754
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:31,540
broken the teacher's plan.

755
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:33,540
It's okay.

756
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:37,540
He is waiting for someone.

757
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:40,540
It seems that

758
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:43,540
he saw the end of the plan.

759
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:50,540
But today,

760
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:53,540
I saw Xu Qian and Dong Wen taking off.

761
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:56,540
It seems that he doesn't remember anything.

762
00:41:57,540 --> 00:42:00,540
He will remember.

763
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:11,540
Deadly���َmooth

764
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:12,540
Doctor

765
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:17,540
32

766
