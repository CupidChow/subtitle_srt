1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm afraid I'll be a little bit late

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm curious what I'm going to do

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I don't want to think about the future

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Let's make this night a little bit more complicated

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm not very strict

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
When you're here

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'll keep the rules to myself

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'll keep my fingers crossed

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'll take out this big piece of bowl

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
We're all one

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000

We're all one

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
We're un transitioning

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,500
We have noasse

18
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,000
Like a monster

19
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,500
It strikes me with adventure

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,340
This handshake doesn't stop

21
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,000
Look at how far the world moves

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
And from the start Runing into the blue

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm about to throw the heart of the hide

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Today, me

If we fire in really strong sum ghosts,

we'll never have our reputation established.

68
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:33,420
Back to the rope scraping business.

69
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:34,580

Through the world calamity

74
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:47,660
In this so-called conclusion

75
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:50,320
Let's bathe in theエスキャル

If I do not speak,

00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,980
Take it to the back door.

89
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,340
This calling is not correct.

90
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:25,900
I am a man of color.

91
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:28,020
According to the Phoenix law,

00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,540
myодism will disappear.

93

You used long hair to make this little kid run.

109
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:26,620
You scared the people who killed you.

110

00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:54,520
I will never forget you.

188
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:01,520
The stars are coming, if the wind blows,

189
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:06,520
I will never forget you.

190
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:10,520
The life is in the hot weather.

191
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:15,520
I will be the sun.

192
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:18,520
The miracle of this world.

193
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,520
I only wish to learn to be used.

194
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:24,520
I will never forget you.

195
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:28,520
The flowers are falling, the wind is blowing.

196
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:35,520
I will never forget you.

197
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:40,520
The life is in the hot weather.

198
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:53,520
The life is in the hot weather.

199
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:58,520
I will never forget you.

200
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:03,520
The life is in the hot weather.

201
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:08,520
I will never forget you.

202
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:23,520
The life is in the hot weather.

203
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:28,520
I will never forget you.

204
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:33,520
The life is in the hot weather.

205
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:38,520
I will never forget you.

206
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:44,520
I will never forget you.

207
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:50,520
Little old man.

208
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:11,520
The miracle of this world.

209
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:18,520
The miracle of this world.

210
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:34,520
The sky and the earth.

211
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,520
The world.

212
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,520
The world.

213
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,520
The world.

214
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:43,520
The world.

215
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,520
The world.

216
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,520
The world.

217
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,520
Duke Cao has gone to repair the beads.

218
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,520
Who did it?

219
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,520
The world.

220
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,520
The world.

221
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:14,520
The world.

222
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:17,520
Episode 13

223
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,520
Everyone.

224
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:24,920
This is the mission of Prince of Zhenbei's

225
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:27,520
What is the effect of the demon light?

226
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,520
Why is it so impressive?

227
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:32,520
Is it really the sky?

228
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,520
Who is it?

229
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,520
No one knows.

230
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:39,520
Only know that from now on,

231
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:42,520
Chu Zhou'an will be in the same situation.

232
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,520
He can't leave.

233
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:46,520
He will be in the same situation.

234
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,520
His Majesty is so strict.

235
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,520
He is hiding it.

236
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,520
Why is he suddenly willing to take care of the world?

237
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:57,520
All of this is going to be done by the palace.

238
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,520
Don't be careless.

239
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,520
Tomorrow morning,

240
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:11,520
the central palace will be in charge of

241
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,520
the new one.

242
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,520
Wei Yuan.

243
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:35,520
You are really a good person.

244
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,520
I asked you to have it today.

245
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:42,520
Do you think you can cure me now?

246
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:47,520
And you.

247
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,520
You two have fought for decades.

248
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:55,520
Now you are in the same situation to deal with me.

249
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,520
You are really good at it.

250
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:01,520
You can make any move.

251
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,520
But now,

252
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:08,520
you will be in the same situation.

253
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:12,520
And you will stand out with the two of you.

254
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:15,520
Let me have a look.

255
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,520
You are really good at it.

256
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,520
You are also standing out.

257
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,520
You are really good at it.

258
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,520
I am the emperor of the Feng Dynasty.

259
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,520
The King of the Yi Dynasty.

260
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,520
Please forgive me.

261
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,520
You are educated people.

262
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,520
You don't know.

263
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,520
Are you a martial art master?

264
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,520
You are a criminal.

265
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,520
You are a criminal.

266
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,520
You are really good at it.

267
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,520
Your Majesty.

268
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,520
You are really good at it.

269
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:12,520
I am willing to give you my blessing.

270
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,520
I am willing to give you my blessing.

271
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,520
You are a good person.

272
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,520
You are really good at it.

273
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,520
Your Majesty.

274
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:27,520
Please forgive me.

275
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,520
Your Majesty.

276
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,520
Please forgive me.

277
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,520
I didn't make a mistake.

278
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,520
I didn't make a mistake.

279
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,520
I didn't make a mistake.

280
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,520
No one except you has ever told me

281
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,640
In the secret room of Nordica

282
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:31,120
she wanted to me narrow the bayonet

283
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,360
to find the identity of Companies and Judhmages of the Qi School.

284
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,040
It sounds fine.

285
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,280
What authority do I have

286
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,720
to dial SUN stand up?

287
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,120
That's right.

288
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,920
The company did come up with this plan.

289
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:41,840
Of course.

290
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,800
私给奏效

291
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,760
I'll take care of this task first.

292
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,080
If trabalr lyrics complain every single time

293
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,800
I'll finelyenciesinspire the Japanese official.

294
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,160
What happens next?

295
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,880
In the future the government will be moved

296
00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:00,740
The Crouch King was eager to move and his支 is commissioned to appointSE.

297
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:04,920
After he's taken the Report to Jiangbo before the Coast Guard,

298
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:12,240
he got a transfer death in the top three branch of the Cuneiform Joint of Napoleon.

299
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:16,960
And they should bid goodbye.

300
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,060
Woah.

301
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:50,740
After Wei Gong died,

302
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:54,060
your front guardım was completelyulk.

303
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:57,080
Just a few days ofwent it and has been punished.

304
00:21:57,380 --> 00:22:05,880
Luckily, He

305
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:11,620
can onlyウ感覺

306
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:14,260
th'

307
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:21,900
Lτο

308
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:22,640
who's He

309
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:26,660
Father, mother, you're back.

310
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:29,860
Father, mother, I'm back.

311
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:30,860
You're back.

312
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:31,860
My son, you're back.

313
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:34,260
Why did you come back in advance?

314
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:35,860
Wan Zhou is not in the right time.

315
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:36,660
She's not well.

316
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:37,460
The evidence is clear.

317
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:40,060
The case is much easier than I thought.

318
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:42,460
My son is not leaving this time, right?

319
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:43,060
Yes.

320
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:44,260
On the way back to the capital,

321
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:45,860
the court ordered

322
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:47,660
that Jianzhou would be flooded with water.

323
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:48,860
It's a rainy day.

324
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:50,460
The people are homeless.

325
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,660
The crown prince asked me to go to the city for water.

326
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:54,060
The government is in the capital.

327
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:55,460
We'll have to go there tomorrow.

328
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:56,860
Tomorrow?

329
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:58,860
Tomorrow?

330
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:05,860
You're so stupid to go to the temple.

331
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:09,660
But now the court is in a bad situation.

332
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:12,060
It's not a good thing.

333
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:13,860
Of course it's a good thing.

334
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,060
For the people,

335
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,260
it's a big thing.

336
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:18,660
You're right.

337
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:20,660
The country is in a big mess.

338
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:21,860
The wind and rain are falling.

339
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:23,460
As a scholar,

340
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:25,060
I'm not mad at the big thing.

341
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:27,060
I'll be a big fan of the wind.

342
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:29,060
I know.

343
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:31,460
You're not a fan of the wind.

344
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,860
The wind is as strong as a long leaf.

345
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:36,260
Okay, okay.

346
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:37,060
Come back soon.

347
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:38,460
Go to the palace and rest.

348
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:40,460
I'll call you for dinner later.

349
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:42,060
By the way, where's Lingying?

350
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:43,660
I brought her the green bean cake from Wan Zhou.

351
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:45,460
I think she's almost full of green bean cake.

352
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:46,060
Lingying.

353
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:46,860
Lingying.

354
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:49,260
Where are you going?

355
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:50,460
I brought the green bean cake.

356
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:52,060
I brought the green bean cake.

357
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:54,660
Your sugar carrot.

358
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:56,260
Where did you get it?

359
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:57,860
You bought it for her.

360
00:23:58,260 --> 00:23:59,260
I've been in the back of the house.

361
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:00,860
I have no time to buy sugar carrots.

362
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:03,860
I've paid for it.

363
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:05,860
How can I buy sugar carrots for her?

364
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:12,260
Then where did you get the sugar carrot?

365
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:13,260
Where did you get it?

366
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:18,060
You bought her sugar carrots?

367
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:21,260
No.

368
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:27,260
She asked me to buy it with my leg.

369
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:30,260
I didn't ask you to buy it.

370
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,460
You're rich.

371
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:33,860
You're still a mute.

372
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:35,460
I'm not a mute.

373
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:36,460
I'm not a mute.

374
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:37,460
I'm not a mute.

375
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:38,260
I'm not a mute.

376
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:39,460
I'm a baby.

377
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:40,860
You're so rude.

378
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:42,260
You're spoiled by your family.

379
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:43,860
Please forgive me.

380
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,060
Live or Die?

381
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:57,460
She doesn't know me.

382
00:24:58,460 --> 00:24:59,560
When she's dead,

383
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:01,460
do still remember your family?

384
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:07,660
I suddenly...

385
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:19,960
What's wrong?

386
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:24,460
I don't know why he doesn't want these things.

387
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,460
He really is a monster.

388
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:47,460
Gui Gui, you are already 48 years old.

389
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:48,460
These video attempted to rape ....

390
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:50,460
I think your Roon can opens its mouth faster.

391
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:51,460
Who is he?

392
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:54,460
So..

393
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:02,460
Would you be able to have a girl like us?

394
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:03,460
That is the second thing to me?

395
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:05,460
Boom.

396
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:10,420
In other words,

397
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:14,460
there has been a problem with Mr. Sheng,

398
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:16,340
Moreover, they have a promotion ceremony.

399
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:18,020
Promotion ceremony?

400
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:22,620
The promotion ceremony

401
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:24,460
is between different species.

402
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:25,940
They always have...

403
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:28,300
Always have what?

404
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:29,460
Yes.

405
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:32,180
What?

406
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:37,380
What promotion ceremony?

407
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,660
What promotion ceremony?

408
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:42,780
What promotion ceremony?

409
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:44,020
Brother Song.

410
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:46,340
Someone is looking for you outside.

411
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:49,460
It's a promotion ceremony outside.

412
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,380
It's okay outside.

413
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:55,180
I told them that

414
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:57,180
they must send the dead thing

415
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:59,380
to your hand in the carriage.

416
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:04,220
Brother Song.

417
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:15,980
The price of exchange

418
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:17,820
is the principle of the practice.

419
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:20,420
The price of exchange?

420
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:22,300
Yes.

421
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:23,660
The teacher told me

422
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:24,700
that the nature of the practice

423
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:25,740
is not change,

424
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:26,780
but change.

425
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:27,740
Change?

426
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:29,420
The magic force and the operation

427
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:30,540
are because of energy.

428
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:31,900
The life is because of existence.

429
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,260
Because of energy.

430
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:34,500
Life is also energy.

431
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,140
Brother Song, is that right?

432
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:38,220
Don't interrupt.

433
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:40,460
The nature of the practice

434
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:41,620
is the price of exchange.

435
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:42,940
People with the magic force and the energy

436
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:43,940
can exchange the soul and the soul.

437
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:44,700
If they get the operation,

438
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:45,820
they can return to the body

439
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:46,860
and make a life.

440
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:49,660
How to make a life?

441
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:50,860
Such a bad luck.

442
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:52,220
I see the people living here.

443
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:53,660
They must be kicked out.

444
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:54,740
Go ask him.

445
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:55,940
Who gave this book to him?

446
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:56,860
Oh, okay.

447
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:59,340
Who gave this book to you?

448
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:02,860
Why am I so shocked?

449
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:04,260
But so familiar?

450
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:11,980
Three, two, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

451
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:13,780
Eight.

452
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,100
How did the house turn out like this?

453
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:33,100
Take off your bag.

454
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:34,220
Xiao Kun,

455
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:36,020
your uncle didn't tie the sugar.

456
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:38,060
He put soy sauce, green onion and garlic.

457
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:39,620
Don't come over.

458
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:40,740
I'll go and see.

459
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:41,940
Five people are dead.

460
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:43,220
You dare to hit me.

461
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:45,140
Do you know who my father is?

462
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,700
Who cares about you?

463
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:49,020
Take the name and law.

464
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:51,340
The most powerful person in the house.

465
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:52,460
Take him away.

466
00:28:58,300 --> 00:28:59,060
Hurry up.

467
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:00,100
It's not over yet.

468
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:01,060
Get out of the house.

469
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:02,140
I'll go and see.

470
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:03,220
I'll go and see.

471
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:04,220
I'll go and see.

472
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:05,220
I'll go and see.

473
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:06,220
I'll go and see.

474
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:07,220
I'll go and see.

475
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:08,060
Let go of me.

476
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:09,860
Let go of me.

477
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:12,380
Let go of me.

478
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:13,180
What's wrong, Fang Xiao?

479
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:14,980
Nothing.

480
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:18,180
This place is so familiar.

481
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:20,140
Have we ever been here before?

482
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:31,260
I hope everyone will be happy

483
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:33,620
when you visit Jianzhou.

484
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:35,220
I'll be here for sure.

485
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:35,980
Nice.

486
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:38,340
You should go down.

487
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:39,620
Fan mentality will be good.

488
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:48,780
All right.

489
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:49,780
Shall I ask your face?

490
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:51,460
Don't worry about it yesterday.

491
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:52,580
I'm scared, too.

492
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:54,100
I'm thankful for experiencing it.

493
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:57,380
The story ofEnd Neptune's falling to the water.

494
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:59,220
Can we break it and hop on down?

495
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,220
2

496
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:11,300
Lights on.

497
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:30,480
They're

498
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:33,840
working here in various neighborhood cities.

499
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:34,880
And these people.

500
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,020
What would you call them?

501
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:37,340
I didn't go home.

502
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:39,740
All right, I got it.

503
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:42,020
I'll take you to the palace later.

504
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:46,580
I'm so happy.

505
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:47,980
I'm so happy.

506
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:49,140
Come on, come on.

507
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:49,940
Come on.

508
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:52,060
Thank you.

509
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:53,900
Thank you.

510
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:55,580
So handsome.

511
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:00,620
Your Highness,

512
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:02,940
why do you suddenly want to go back to Linghu?

513
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:04,660
I don't know either.

514
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:07,380
I suddenly want to go back.

515
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:08,860
Besides,

516
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:10,780
I can also find a place to stay.

517
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:12,900
It's weird.

518
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:15,060
As soon as I go back to Linghu,

519
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:17,140
you will be in a bad mood.

520
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:18,380
You will have a long life.

521
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:20,420
But Your Highness,

522
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,740
I have to remind you.

523
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:23,620
As long as you go back from the little house,

524
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:25,420
you will be unwell.

525
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:26,660
You won't be able to eat or drink.

526
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:28,300
You won't be unwell either.

527
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:32,020
I don't know why.

528
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:36,660
Your Highness, you are here.

529
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:37,820
Who blocked the way?

530
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:41,860
Who blocked the way?

531
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:43,940
How dare you!

532
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:44,580
How dare you!

533
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:45,540
How dare you!

534
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:46,500
How dare you!

535
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:01,860
You are in a bad mood, Your Highness.

536
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:03,060
Please forgive me.

537
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:05,460
Your Highness,

538
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:12,020
won't you've stoppedument for the whole day?

539
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:13,620
After today's next visit,

540
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:15,380
please prepare some dressing.

541
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:17,700
The or fonts.

542
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:19,460
You areaha nonsense.

543
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:21,180
You don't even remember the date

544
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:22,620
yet you lay your hands on them.

545
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:26,340
Is it strange?

546
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:27,380
Yes.

547
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:28,220
He is妳.

548
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:29,700
This Catherine here

549
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,580
looks beautiful in her own way.

550
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:32,660
Is it?

551
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:33,660
Do you see this?

552
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,460
I'll go and take a look.

553
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:36,460
This way.

554
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:37,460
This way.

555
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:38,460
This way.

556
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:39,460
This way.

557
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:40,460
This way.

558
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:41,460
This way.

559
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,460
This way.

560
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:45,060
There was a young man who was given this chance.

561
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:46,860
He had to leave it to you.

562
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:54,260
The emperor is a young man who is a young man.

563
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:56,860
The emperor is a young man who is a young man.

564
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:58,860
It's good that

565
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:02,060
he killed the emperor on the bed.

566
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:04,660
The golden house is empty.

567
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:07,060
The sea is clear.

568
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:08,460
The pig is tired.

569
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:11,260
The blue sky is warm.

570
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:13,860
The rain is deep.

571
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:17,660
I like this sentence.

572
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:22,660
Enough.

573
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:23,660
Here you are, princess.

574
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:29,260
Where is the next half?

575
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:30,460
What is the next half?

576
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:32,060
Since it's the next half,

577
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:33,260
it's the next half.

578
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:34,660
Good, princess.

579
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:36,060
You're thinking about the next half.

580
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:36,660
Yes.

581
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:38,660
I'll give all of them to you.

582
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:40,660
I'll give you two more to go to the next half.

583
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:43,060
This is the kitchen.

584
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:44,060
The flower.

585
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:45,060
The flower.

586
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:47,860
The kitchen.

587
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:48,860
It's hot.

588
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:49,260
It's hot.

589
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:50,460
Princess, wait for me.

590
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:51,460
I'll go to the next half.

591
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:53,860
I'll give you a whole book of time.

592
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:54,460
I don't believe it.

593
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:55,460
I'll give you some money.

594
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:56,660
I don't have time today.

595
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:57,860
I don't have time today.

596
00:33:57,860 --> 00:33:59,860
I'll go to the next half to drink.

597
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:00,860
What are you talking about?

598
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:01,860
I'll go to the next half.

599
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:11,260
The love is a promise.

600
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:14,260
The meaning of the promise is only

601
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:15,860
to be with you forever.

602
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:17,860
The people who do this

603
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:19,260
are now in the same boat.

604
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:21,060
They said

605
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:22,460
they'd better go to that side.

606
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:27,060
Princess.

607
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:28,860
Slow down.

608
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:30,860
I'll go to the next half.

609
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:01,860
I'll go to the next half.

610
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:04,860
Princess, you can't go out.

611
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:06,860
I can be the princess

612
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:09,860
in the future.

613
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:13,860
Don't be afraid. I'm here.

614
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:16,860
Wait for me to come back.

615
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:20,860
Princess.

616
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:23,860
Princess, what's wrong?

617
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:28,860
I think

618
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:31,860
I forgot something.

619
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:32,860
I forgot something.

620
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:43,860
Here.

621
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:44,860
Here.

622
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:46,860
Eat more.

623
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:47,860
Eat more.

624
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:50,860
What day is it today?

625
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:51,860
There's a crab.

626
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:54,860
Here.

627
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:55,860
Here.

628
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:56,860
Here's your food.

629
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:58,860
Thank you.

630
00:35:58,860 --> 00:35:59,860
This is mine.

631
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:00,860
Who else?

632
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:02,860
Why is there one more?

633
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:05,860
I'm sorry.

634
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:08,860
Go ahead.

635
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:09,860
Eat some meat.

636
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:10,860
You can't just eat fish.

637
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:11,860
Here.

638
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:13,860
What's wrong?

639
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:14,860
Mom,

640
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:15,860
the fish is too salty.

641
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:16,860
It's salty.

642
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:17,860
Really?

643
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:18,860
I'll try it.

644
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:26,860
Dad.

645
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:28,860
I...

646
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:32,860
Dad.

647
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:34,860
Eat some meat.

648
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:36,860
Eat.

649
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:47,860
Eat.

650
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:48,860
Eat.

651
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:51,860
This fish is not salty.

652
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:52,860
It's not salty.

653
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:53,860
You can't even turn it over.

654
00:36:57,860 --> 00:36:58,860
Eat.

655
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:12,860
Run!

656
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:13,860
Run!

657
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:14,860
Don't run too far.

658
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:17,860
Here.

659
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:20,860
Mom, come here.

660
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:22,860
I want to go back to my mom's house.

661
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:23,860
My father lost his weight

662
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:24,860
a few days later.

663
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:25,860
Don't lose your weight.

664
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:26,860
That's a good thing.

665
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:27,860
I'll go with you.

666
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:29,860
Let's go together.

667
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:30,860
Okay.

668
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:31,860
Go.

669
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:33,860
Dad, I'll go up the stairs.

670
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:34,860
No, no.

671
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:56,860
Let's go.

672
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:57,860
Come on.

673
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:08,860
Mr. Xu,

674
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:10,860
how many cities should we go?

675
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:25,860
Let's go.

676
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:27,860
I'll take you to the capital.

677
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:45,860
Your Majesty,

678
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:46,860
Mr. Xu is here.

679
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:49,860
I know

680
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:51,860
the word,

681
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:52,860
I'm not good at it.

682
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:57,860
Is it all your fault?

683
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:01,860
I allowed you to send people back.

684
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:03,860
When the price is changed,

685
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:05,860
how will you pay me back?

686
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:08,220
travelling

687
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,860
The Luck is hard to adapt.

688
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:26,860
It's a reflection of you.

689
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:30,860
If you need medical qiкра in your body,

690
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:32,860
you can take it.

691
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:34,060
Up to now,

692
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:40,060
I'm not the one who will get the energy from you.

693
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:47,060
Do you know why I sent you to the Palace of Black Mirror Sword?

694
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:49,060
Do you have any idea?

695
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:55,060
I want to break the foundation of the country.

696
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:58,060
And you are pregnant.

697
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:01,060
You need to have a good life.

698
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:05,060
You are the best person in the Palace of Black Mirror.

699
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:09,060
When you become a concubine and a concubine,

700
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:14,060
she will take you as her wife.

701
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:20,060
You will be the one who will die in the future.

702
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:24,060
You are saving me?

703
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:28,060
Don't you think it's similar?

704
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:33,060
We tried our best to find the only way.

705
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:37,060
Only by avoiding the sky and the earth can we avoid the sword.

706
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:42,060
In this way, you can really get rid of the sword and re-enact the freedom.

707
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:47,060
I am the only one you can trust.

708
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:51,060
Who are you?

709
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:03,480
The

710
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:13,560
daughter of Kris

711
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:21,060
Son

712
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:27,100
You are named in Da Bu

713
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:30,060
I wish you can stay here for three days

714
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:35,060
and have a peaceful life.

715
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:39,060
So,

716
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:41,060
I'll name you

717
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:44,060
Mingye.

718
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:53,060
Mingye,

719
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:55,060
do you know

720
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:57,060
that the Great Feng State Law

721
00:41:58,060 --> 00:42:00,060
was originally ours.

722
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:27,060
Mingye.

723
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:56,060
Mingye.

724
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:26,060
Mingye.

725
00:43:55,060 --> 00:43:56,060
Mingye.

726
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:27,060
I wish you can stay here for three days

727
00:44:55,060 --> 00:45:13,060
and have a peaceful life.

728
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:16,060
The story of the Great Feng State Law

729
00:45:16,060 --> 00:45:19,060
ends here.

730
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:21,060
Who said it's over?

731
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:23,060
How about we do it again?

732
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:24,060
Let's do it again.

733
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:25,060
Let's do it again.

734
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:28,060
No, boss.

735
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:29,060
Let's do it again.

736
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:33,060
Why is Mr. He so dead?

737
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:36,060
Yes, I feel like Mr. He didn't want to do it.

738
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:38,060
That's the second level of the power.

739
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:39,060
The one in Linzhou is also that level.

740
00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:41,060
That's great.

741
00:45:41,060 --> 00:45:42,060
Let's play again next time.

742
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:43,060
Okay.

743
00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:45,060
Let's go.

744
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:58,060
Mingye can't do it again.

745
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:11,260
Yangliang.

746
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:13,060
Yangliang.

747
00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:15,060
What are you doing?

748
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:15,860
Let's go.

749
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:39,060
The end of the story, what does it mean to run away from the human world?

750
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:41,060
Do you know?

751
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:46,060
I don't know.

752
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:47,060
I don't know.

753
