1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The future is a world full of tears

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Time has taken me to a new world

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I'm curious what I'm going to do next time

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I don't want to be in the middle of the world

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
The whole world is in my mouth

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I don't want to be in the middle of the world

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I don't want to be in the middle of the world

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
When you're here

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'll keep the rules

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I'll keep my mouth shut

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'll keep this big piece of Wanji

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
We're ordinary

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
We're like a step by step

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
We're ordinary

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
We're like a step by step

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
We're ordinary

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
We're like a step by step

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
We're ordinary

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
In65 which has been an idler

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,580
I call my own

21
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,000
There's someone who wants to revere my heart

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The eternalriz

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Look at the building outro

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,500
When

25
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I mistake you for who you are

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,040
Never give up

27
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,520
We can go on

28
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,240
He let us go

29
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,680
I will never let others catch up

30
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,800
Talked, watched, did not pay attention

31
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,080
I'm going to shine

32
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,600
Let us look at nice stretch

33
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,640
We will become one

34
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,080
Slowly

35
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,040
What wrong with dulling the mud?

36
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,800
It's 6 a.m.

37
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,200
We haven't reached the road yet

38
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,200
Maybe something is happening.

39
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,200
Slow down.

40
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,200
Listen to me.

41
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,200
Where are you?

42
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,200
Where are you?

43
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,200
Answer me.

44
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,200
What are you doing?

45
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,200
Sorry.

46
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,200
I heard it wrong.

47
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,200
Wait.

48
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,200
Shi Huiyan?

49
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,200
Shi Huiyan.

50
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,200
He is indeed a disappear.

51
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,200
Disappear?

52
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,200
He's a different person.

53
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,200
He's a smoker.

54
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,200
The main ingredient of the fire is the fire.

55
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,200
There are so many fire in the fire.

56
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,200
Only people can open fire.

57
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,200
I have to be careful with the trouble.

58
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,200
I'll be careful.

59
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,200
Be careful.

60
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,200
Be careful.

61
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,200
Shi Huiyan.

62
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,200
Hurry up.

63
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,200
Go.

64
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,200
Hurry up.

65
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,200
Hurry up.

66
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,200
Go.

67
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,200
Where's Yu Jia?

68
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,200
He's not in a good mood.

69
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,200
At least he's a master of the magic.

70
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,200
I'll go first.

71
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,200
Go.

72
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,200
Go.

73
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,200
Go.

74
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,200
You're a monster.

75
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,200
No wonder I can't forget the demon.

76
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,200
Go.

77
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,200
Go.

78
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,200
This is a beast with a solid bone.

79
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,200
Eyes, lower body, mouth, and body.

80
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,200
I see.

81
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,200
Go.

82
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,200
Go.

83
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,200
Go.

84
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,200
It's so good, Shi Huiyan.

85
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,200
You're not dead.

86
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,200
Almost.

87
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,200
This beast has a solid bone.

88
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,200
Be careful.

89
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,200
Just like a knife.

90
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,200
Go.

91
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,200
Go.

92
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,200
Go.

93
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,200
Go.

94
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,200
Go.

95
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,200
Go.

96
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,200
Go.

97
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,200
Go.

98
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,200
Go.

99
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,200
Go.

100
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,200
Hi.

101
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,200
Hi.

102
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,200
Yay.

103
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,200
Go.

104
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,200
Why are you looking at the solid bone?

105
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,200
We're not good friends.

106
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,200
We're just friends.

107
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,200
We're just friends.

108
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,200
We have a misunderstanding.

109
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,200
I think

110
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,200
if I have any trouble,

111
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,200
I can be your memory.

112
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,200
You're like a tiger.

113
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,200
You're like a tiger.

114
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,200
You're like a tiger.

115
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,200
I'll give you a good life.

116
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,200
What are you doing?

117
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,200
Stop working.

118
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,200
I'll use this to get the sheep's head.

119
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,200
No, old pig.

120
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,200
I'll help you to get the head.

121
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,200
Why are you on the stage?

122
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,200
I said.

123
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,200
Give it to me.

124
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,200
You can do it yourself.

125
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,200
Xu Xia.

126
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,200
This is...

127
00:12:49,200 --> 00:13:01,720
This is the

128
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,200
Thank you.

129
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,200
Brother.

130
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,200
This is the medicine

131
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,200
that the four-leaf sword

132
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,200
made by the eight of us.

133
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,200
How is it?

134
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,200
Have a try.

135
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,200
I...

136
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,200
Here.

137
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,200
I...

138
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,200
I'm so brave.

139
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,200
It's so delicious.

140
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,200
I've seen the medicine for four days.

141
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,200
I'm so tired.

142
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,200
I'm hurt because of the injury.

143
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,200
Who?

144
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,200
The medicine.

145
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,200
I said,

146
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,200
the one who eats the ball is the one who eats it.

147
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,200
Huang Xiao.

148
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,200
We're also

149
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,200
good friends who were born and die.

150
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,200
What kind of friends are we?

151
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,200
We're just friends.

152
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,200
Thank you, good friends.

153
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,200
You...

154
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,200
Don't waste it.

155
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,200
Don't waste it.

156
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,200
Don't waste it.

157
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,200
Have you eaten it?

158
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,200
I can't eat it.

159
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,200
I'm so hungry.

160
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,200
The medicine for four days

161
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,200
is a treasure.

162
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,200
You're so brave.

163
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,200
It's delicious.

164
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,200
It's delicious.

165
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,200
It's delicious.

166
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,200
You're so smart.

167
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,200
By the way, Xu Xia.

168
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,200
I've been thinking about asking you.

169
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,200
You're not as good as the sword.

170
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,200
You're not like the one in the Ya Men.

171
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,200
You're a magic weapon.

172
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,200
Of course not.

173
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,200
My uncle

174
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,200
asked someone to fight for me.

175
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,200
Of course.

176
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,200
Bring me the sword.

177
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,200
My surname is Zhang.

178
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,200
I'm the leader of the imperial family in the imperial palace.

179
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,200
When you stand up,

180
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,200
I won't dare to.

181
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,200
I told you to stand up.

182
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,200
You just stand up.

183
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,200
You don't understand.

184
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,200
Mr. Tao.

185
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,200
We're just asking you a question.

186
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,200
Stand up.

187
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,200
Come on.

188
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,200
May I ask

189
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,200
when did this bandit start?

190
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,200
It's the bandit who used to stay here.

191
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,200
The ruins here

192
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,200
are almost demolished.

193
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,200
It's gone.

194
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,200
I heard

195
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,200
that the last three people

196
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,200
went to the south.

197
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,200
Is there any soil there?

198
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,200
There are also

199
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,200
some abandoned soil.

200
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,200
But

201
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,200
there are more than this.

202
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,200
Sir.

203
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,200
Sir.

204
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,200
You two are

205
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,200
looking forward to your new work.

206
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,200
You're leaving yourself to eat.

207
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,200
I'm leaving.

208
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,200
I'm leaving.

209
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,200
I've received it.

210
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,200
I'm leaving.

211
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,200
I'll let you go.

212
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,200
I'm leaving.

213
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,200
Sir.

214
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,200
Go back.

215
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,200
Please stay.

216
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,200
Please stay.

217
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,200
This is our little heart.

218
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,200
Please don't.

219
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,200
It's okay.

220
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,200
We can't go there.

221
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,200
This guy is not mouth-watering.

222
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,200
How can he talk?

223
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,200
Have a good look.

224
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,200
From yesterday,

225
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,200
I've been hearing

226
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,200
strange sounds.

227
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,200
I thought I heard the wrong one.

228
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,200
When we were on the mountain,

229
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,200
I confirmed

230
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,200
the strange sound that the mirror made.

231
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,200
Sorry.

232
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,200
I'm just a windbreaker.

233
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,200
What's the problem?

234
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,200
You should ask Mr. Song.

235
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,200
You're so selfish.

236
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:17,200
I wanted to go to Sister Siten personally.

237
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,200
But you're here.

238
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,200
You want to help me?

239
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,200
So you're going to let me

240
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,200
turn the teaching, right?

241
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,200
Why?

242
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,200
I'm here to pay for it.

243
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,200
Dong Jinning,

244
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,200
take it away.

245
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,200
I'm begging you.

246
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,200
I'm begging you.

247
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,200
I have no choice.

248
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,200
Mr. Song,

249
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,200
come here for me.

250
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,200
One more.

251
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,200
In a while,

252
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,200
you'll be in trouble.

253
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,200
What?

254
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,200
Siten,

255
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,200
the school of finance,

256
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,200
is here.

257
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,200
How can you win?

258
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,200
Right, Caiwei?

259
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,200
Caiwei, go.

260
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,200
Mr. Chu said

261
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,200
he didn't want to go back to report the case.

262
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,200
So he went first.

263
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,200
He's still a bit fast.

264
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,200
Mingyi,

265
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,200
Tinggong is right.

266
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,200
He'll see you later.

267
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,200
Just tell him the case.

268
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,200
Nothing else matters.

269
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,200
I got it.

270
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,200
I'm not going to hit one.

271
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,200
Chu Shenzhu and Chu Ji Dan,

272
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,200
you're going to hit one again.

273
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,200
You don't know what a hit is.

274
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,200
Give me one.

275
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,200
Here.

276
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,200
You're so mad.

277
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,200
Aren't you familiar with it?

278
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,200
You're so young.

279
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,200
You can't bully me, either.

280
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,200
Go.

281
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,200
You're really a bastard.

282
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,200
What do you think?

283
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,200
The Kui Clan

284
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,200
is conscious of the return of the past.

285
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,200
After our investigation,

286
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,200
the消息 found in the mountains

287
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,200
is definitely not a coincidence.

288
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,200
Is there any more detailed

289
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,200
and more powerful analysis result?

290
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,200
Tao,

291
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,200
I'm doing something else.

292
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,200
Dad,

293
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,200
let me make up for it.

294
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,200
Now we can confirm

295
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,200
that the Kui Clan came here for the消息,

296
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,200
and the main ingredients of the medicine are made.

297
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,200
Tao,

298
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,200
what kind of meeting or celebration

299
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,200
has been going on in the capital recently?

300
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,200
It's a big deal.

301
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,200
I can make a report.

302
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,200
Wait.

303
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,200
Look.

304
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,200
There's another thing.

305
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,200
You need to report it.

306
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,200
What is it?

307
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,200
Kui Clan.

308
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,200
How many people are here?

309
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,200
Not yet.

310
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,200
But Xu Qian asked the local leader

311
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,200
about the difficulties in the Great Wall.

312
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,200
There are many abandoned caves.

313
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,200
They're not lonely.

314
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,200
There are few people.

315
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,200
Liang Yan,

316
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,200
take them to see it.

317
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,200
Yes.

318
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,200
Xiaorou,

319
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,200
ask the Chuzhou people

320
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,200
if there's any movement in the Kui Clan.

321
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,200
Yes.

322
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,200
What else do you have?

323
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,200
There's one thing.

324
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,200
According to Xu Qian's report,

325
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,200
Kui Clan was punished.

326
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,200
The government will seal the cave.

327
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,200
And the Great Wall is under the control of the Kui Clan.

328
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,200
Once the government seal the cave,

329
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,200
the land will be broken.

330
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,200
According to the villagers,

331
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,200
the government will buy the land.

332
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,200
The law is not an exception.

333
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,200
The government will buy the land.

334
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,200
That's why the report is not published.

335
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,200
The law is not an exception.

336
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,200
Please contact the police.

337
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,200
Please re-enact the case.

338
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,200
Yes, Madam.

339
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,200
The wealth is not enough.

340
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,200
The law is like a mountain.

341
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,200
It's like a river.

342
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,200
Yes.

343
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,200
You all understand.

344
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,200
But you still agree with her.

345
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,200
Yes.

346
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,200
How did you answer her?

347
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,200
I'm jealous of her.

348
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,200
What?

349
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,200
You don't agree with her.

350
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,200
I agree with her.

351
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,200
But I think it's not her true heart.

352
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,200
He Jian.

353
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,200
According to my observation,

354
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,200
she is kind and sincere.

355
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,200
She is kind and sincere.

356
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,200
She is not good at acting.

357
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,200
She is not kind to me.

358
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,200
So I let her down.

359
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,200
Time to go to work.

360
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,200
Yes.

361
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,200
Brother.

362
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,200
You should take care of the child.

363
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,200
I'll treat them to a drink.

364
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,200
We can talk about the child.

365
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,200
I can also do the head-to-head.

366
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,200
You are a little bit arrogant.

367
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,200
But the fact of the big hill

368
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,200
is true.

369
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,200
So I

370
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,200
will go to the top of the top.

371
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,200
I see.

372
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,200
I have my own opinion about the big hill.

373
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,200
As for you and Xu Qian.

374
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,200
You know that

375
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,200
I gave her a fake one.

376
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,200
The top of the top

377
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,200
has its own reason.

378
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,200
This is what Xu Qian

379
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,200
did to Wenxingguan.

380
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,200
Take a look.

381
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,200
The top of the top

382
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,200
is the top of the top.

383
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,200
The top is the top.

384
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,200
The top is the top.

385
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,200
It's hard to guess.

386
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,200
It's like a case.

387
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,200
You can't

388
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,200
make a conclusion.

389
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,200
What are you doing?

390
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,200
I didn't take the ball.

391
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,200
What are you looking at?

392
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,200
Hurry up.

393
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,200
Let's go.

394
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,200
This is

395
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,200
a high-ranking man.

396
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,200
Do you have any rules?

397
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,200
It's been a while.

398
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,200
It's just a hair salon.

399
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,200
I dare not ask you.

400
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,200
Hair salon is

401
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,200
a dirty business.

402
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,200
It's not a bad thing.

403
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,200
You are a good man.

404
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,200
You know that

405
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,200
you don't wear a hairpin.

406
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,200
You don't care about the hairpin.

407
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,200
You have to

408
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,200
make a request for it.

409
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,200
You are good now.

410
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,200
You don't care about the hairpin.

411
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,200
You have enough hairpin.

412
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,200
I have a lot of people.

413
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,200
I will give it back to them.

414
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,200
Anyway, I don't wear a hairpin.

415
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,200
I'm not afraid of it.

416
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,200
Don't talk nonsense. Hurry up.

417
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,200
You are waiting for a price to exchange.

418
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,200
What's the price to exchange

419
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,200
when you have a basket of eggs?

420
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,200
Just be happy.

421
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,200
If you had been like this before,

422
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,200
your hair would have been chasing you.

423
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,200
You.

424
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,200
You.

425
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,200
You talk nonsense.

426
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,200
Is it okay?

427
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,200
No.

428
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,200
I didn't say it.

429
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,200
You are so useless.

430
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,200
The minimum salary is 50 taels.

431
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,200
The salary is three days.

432
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,200
The salary of your national treasure is the largest.

433
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,200
The maximum salary is 50 taels.

434
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,200
The rest is the average.

435
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,200
No need.

436
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,200
The average is the same.

437
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,200
The minimum salary is

438
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,200
30 taels.

439
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,200
The maximum salary is 30 taels.

440
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,200
How many?

441
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,200
We have time and money.

442
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,200
Now we are almost

443
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,200
in a place where we can drink.

444
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,200
Please.

445
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,200
What should I ask?

446
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,200
Isn't this the minimum salary?

447
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,200
It's a price to exchange.

448
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,200
What are you talking about?

449
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,200
My family.

450
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,200
We are almost

451
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,200
in the same place.

452
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,200
Why are you and me

453
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,200
decided like this?

454
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,200
Ding Yan, you said you were going to change.

455
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,200
Let's not go to the party tonight.

456
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,200
I'm not going.

457
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,200
I haven't finished the work yet.

458
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,200
I will have a tea later.

459
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,200
Have fun.

460
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,200
Have fun.

461
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,200
I have a friend in the kitchen.

462
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,200
You can go find her.

463
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,200
Take your foot off.

464
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,200
Come on.

465
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,200
Let me go.

466
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,200
I heard that

467
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,200
the new house in Chengqi

468
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,200
is open.

469
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,200
How about it?

470
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,200
It's not bad.

471
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,200
You are so much.

472
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,200
Ming Yan, you say.

473
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,200
You decide the decision.

474
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,200
Good.

475
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,200
So good.

476
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,200
That's it.

477
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,200
Tonight

478
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,200
I will show you the market.

479
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,200
Two people in the white dress.

480
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,200
One floor tea.

481
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,200
Two people in the white dress.

482
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,200
Go.

483
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,200
How is it?

484
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,200
Is it good?

485
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,200
It's good.

486
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,200
Where are you going?

487
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,200
To the school in Yunlu?

488
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,200
Why don't you listen to me?

489
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,200
The school is

490
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,200
in the middle of the park.

491
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,200
Why do you have to go to the other side?

492
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,200
Xiao Hong.

493
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,200
Little Z.

494
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,200
Brother Z is also a good boy.

495
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,200
Let's talk about the distance.

496
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,200
Z is a little bit stubborn.

497
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,200
You mean?

498
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,200
You don't know Brother Lun, do you?

499
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,200
Yes.

500
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,200
How did you guess it?

501
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,200
It's very serious.

502
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,200
This is my first time.

503
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,200
OK.

504
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,200
I can't teach you two.

505
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,200
What are the three of you doing today?

506
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,200
It's my first time.

507
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,200
I'm going to arrange it.

508
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,200
The age is 32.

509
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,200
Send three of you to the first floor.

510
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,200
Three tables.

511
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,200
Yes.

512
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,200
Three tables.

513
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,200
You are so pitiful.

514
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,200
One piece.

515
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,200
Two people in the first floor.

516
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,200
I want to take you to the second floor.

517
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,200
It's a pity.

518
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,200
I'm a little bit nervous.

519
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,200
The most famous painting in Yunmei.

520
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,200
It's also called the Buddha's incense.

521
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,200
Today is not the first class.

522
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,200
It's early in the morning.

523
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,200
How do you know that people don't see the guests?

524
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,200
I don't understand.

525
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,200
There is a limit to the time difference.

526
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,200
Usually,

527
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,200
most of the guests are in the first floor.

528
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,200
You can take a rest.

529
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,200
Or you can just

530
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,200
play with the fish you want to go to the hotel.

531
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,200
You have to go to the first floor.

532
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,200
We have a special order today.

533
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,200
Miss Fu Xiang will not appear.

534
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,200
You come here the first day.

535
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,200
You want to take Zegun and Lun to play with you.

536
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,200
It's a pity.

537
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,200
Yes.

538
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,200
The three of you are the students of Yunlu Academy.

539
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,200
Mr. Zhang.

540
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,200
Mr. He.

541
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,200
Great.

542
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,200
Do you know Mr. Yang Ling?

543
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,200
I don't know him.

544
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,200
Who is he?

545
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,200
Mr. Zhang.

546
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,200
Mr. Zhang.

547
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,200
Mr. Yang.

548
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,200
Mr. Zhang.

549
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,200
Mr. Zhang.

550
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,200
Mr. Zhang.

551
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,200
Mr. Yang.

552
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,200
Who's the leader?

553
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,200
How dare he dare to lead the princess?

554
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,200
It's him?

555
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,200
Why do he act like this?

556
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,200
What does that mean?

557
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,200
Of course Yang Ling is a題 topic.

558
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,200
I have to recognize him.

559
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,200
Shuyinggengoxie Shuiqingqian.

560
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:17,800
and got the

561
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:23,760
welcome harem from her hometown.

562
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,560
She won't live long

563
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,040
to tell the story.

564
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:32,160
It got now because of Liang L céu.

565
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,360
Poor Ning Yan.

566
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:38,440
Jie Shi is going to be terrible.

567
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,760
and his nonsense.

568
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:40,360
Ning Yan.

569
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,200
What are you doing?

570
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:44,360
Okay.

571
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,200
I'll see if I can see

572
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,120
the girl from Fu Xiang.

573
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:47,760
No.

574
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,760
Bai Fei, we've analyzed it.

575
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:51,960
Is Miss Fu Xiang

576
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:54,160
waiting for Yang Ming?

577
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,960
She'll be on the road when she comes.

578
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,160
You can't get out.

579
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,760
Miss Fu Xiang is coming out.

580
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,760
She's from Fu Xiang.

581
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,520
Miss Fu Xiang is looking at me.

582
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,560
She's looking at me.

583
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:28,360
What's going on?

584
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:29,200
Why are you here?

585
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:30,760
No.

586
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:34,800
Is Guang Xiao Shi here?

587
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,200
No.

588
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:35,960
He's here to see you.

589
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:36,760
I'm on my way.

590
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,560
I'm here to see you.

591
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,160
I'm here to see you.

592
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:40,760
I'm here to see you.

593
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:43,520
I'm sure you're looking for you.

594
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:43,920
No.

595
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:44,520
I'm sure you're looking for you.

596
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,200
I'm looking for you.

597
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:45,800
I don't know him.

598
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:46,800
I just want to know him.

599
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,360
Are you looking for me?

600
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,160
Are you looking for me?

601
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:04,800
Sir.

602
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,360
Why are you here?

603
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,560
Why didn't you tell me in advance?

604
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,760
I'm here to make people prepare in advance.

605
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,320
I'm here to treat you.

606
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,120
I was passing by.

607
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:16,120
I thought I'd come in and have a drink.

608
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,320
I don't need to treat you.

609
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,320
You can have it.

610
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,320
Mr. Yang, please.

611
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,120
It's yours.

612
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,080
It's Mr. Yang.

613
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,320
Mr. Yang?

614
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,120
Are you Mr. Yang?

615
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,600
He's the one.

616
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,160
Sir, it's on the го.

617
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:08,400
Before all of you came to me,

618
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,720
I wrote forth a letter

619
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,880
to us.

620
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,280
Good.

621
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,960
The big name is Hu.

622
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,480
The big name is Hu.

623
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,880
There are lotus flowers in the big name.

624
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,480
There are lotus leaves on the lotus.

625
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,640
A bunch of them.

626
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,240
Who wrote it?

627
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,480
I did.

628
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,080
What are you talking about?

629
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,280
Please forgive me.

630
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:50,320
If you want to sleep and laugh enjoyably

631
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,640
then you can go to sleep.

632
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,440
You can even ask me to laugh

633
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,440
and go back to sleep with no end.

634
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,520
Who wrote it?

635
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,960
Princess, I did.

636
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:05,880
I will go to bed too.

637
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,160
You were thinking of this for three remote nights.

638
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:11,760
I'll make you a good wife.

639
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:12,840
Get out of here!

640
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,080
Let's go.

641
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,280
Let's go.

642
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:19,520
Your Highness.

643
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,160
Did you find Yang Ling?

644
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:23,800
Your Highness, look.

645
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,280
This is Yang Ling's new work.

646
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,840
The world loves Mudan.

647
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:32,640
It's not easy to be in love with a girl

648
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,240
who loves to be alone.

649
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:37,120
It's hard to be in love with a girl.

650
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,000
The word…

651
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,200
it's popular.

652
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,040
After geliyor to Aaron,

653
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:49,440
who stops at the teachers' office

654
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:53,080
without knowing each other,

655
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,520
who goes out with eyes wide open.

656
00:31:58,880 --> 00:31:59,900
She's very innocent

657
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:03,000
and almost까지 is completely innocent.

658
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:07,280
Zhou Wednesday.

659
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,120
Wait.

660
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:13,760
You know.

661
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,480
Yes, if you like it,

662
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,640
please don't put on a joke

663
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,920
in front of bike seller.

664
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,160
Right?

665
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:23,200
Cruise.

666
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,160
Of course I like it.

667
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,720
Sister Yang is beautiful.

668
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,560
Once she wrote F по Me,

669
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:36,720
I can't put her slb on the乾 mold.

670
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:40,720
He Chou can't be suppressed by that Princess Huaiqing.

671
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,720
Where is she now?

672
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,720
Did you tell her that I want to recruit her?

673
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,720
I originally wanted to say it.

674
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,720
But...

675
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,720
But what?

676
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,720
Princess, look at that...

677
00:32:58,720 --> 00:32:59,720
The deposit.

678
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,720
Princess Huaiqing?

679
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,720
Huaiqing?

680
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,720
Brother, you must be mistaken.

681
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:11,720
Princess is very noble.

682
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,720
How could she be in the school?

683
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,720
Not Huaiqing.

684
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,720
She's his maid.

685
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,720
She's in the school.

686
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:21,720
Besides the school,

687
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:23,720
where else did Yang Ling come from?

688
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,720
She's a minor.

689
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:27,720
Keep waiting.

690
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:28,720
If you can't recruit her,

691
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:30,720
we can't do anything about it.

692
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,720
So Princess will recruit me

693
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,720
and let me write a poem for her.

694
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:38,720
I see.

695
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:40,720
So you wrote a poem

696
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:42,720
and finally got the title

697
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,720
Princess Huaiqing.

698
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:45,720
You're so kind.

699
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:47,720
But...

700
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:51,720
Brother's poem is about the new season.

701
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:52,720
It's about the seasons.

702
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:54,720
Sometimes,

703
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:55,720
I really don't understand

704
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,720
whether you're the previous brother.

705
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:00,720
The seasons?

706
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:01,720
What are the seasons?

707
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,720
It's just a book.

708
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:05,720
Father, you don't understand.

709
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,720
It's not a simple book.

710
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:11,720
Princess has a famous title.

711
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:13,720
She has a good relationship with him.

712
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:15,720
It's one of the best.

713
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:17,720
Then,

714
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:18,720
she added

715
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:19,720
the title

716
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:20,720
Princess Huaiqing.

717
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:22,720
It's the second title.

718
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:23,720
What do you mean?

719
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:25,720
She's the maid

720
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:26,720
recommended by Princess.

721
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:28,720
She's so kind.

722
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:29,720
Why didn't she

723
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:30,720
kill someone?

724
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:33,720
It means...

725
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:34,720
It means

726
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:36,720
even though Princess knows

727
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:37,720
the title,

728
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:38,720
she doesn't know much.

729
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,720
At least,

730
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:40,720
she doesn't know

731
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:41,720
the title of the maid

732
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:42,720
recommended by the teacher.

733
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:43,720
It's the title.

734
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:46,720
That's what I think.

735
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:48,720
So,

736
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:49,720
the title

737
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:51,720
Princess Huaiqing

738
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:53,720
is a good example.

739
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:55,720
Whether you really respect her

740
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:56,720
or not,

741
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:57,720
at least,

742
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:58,720
she'll be useful.

743
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,720
Because she's standing at the princess' side.

744
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,720
It's not a personal title.

745
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:03,720
It's a title.

746
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:05,720
It's a personal concern.

747
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:08,720
So,

748
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:09,720
you're the one

749
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:10,720
who got the title of the maid.

750
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:12,720
Is it her?

751
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:17,720
No.

752
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:18,720
Why?

753
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:19,720
Yes.

754
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:20,720
According to the truth,

755
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,720
the maid should say

756
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,720
that she's a good example.

757
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:24,720
You can say it

758
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:25,720
as you wish.

759
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:28,720
I'm also very confused.

760
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,720
We're far away.

761
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:34,720
Give up longitudinal俱俱

762
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:35,720
but don't be too much.

763
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,720
Alright.

764
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:40,720
Good.

765
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:43,720
Great.

766
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:44,720
It's nice.

767
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:45,720
She's quite funny.

768
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:46,720
She's Whenever I See You

769
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,160
The table topón

770
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,660
matches with the ladies on the table.

771
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:50,720
I'm a bit worried

772
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:51,960
about

773
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:52,720

Cuizna that I need after she is exited.

775
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:54,620
But if she nags

776
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:56,120

777
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,120

It is so simple

784
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:12,060
How could a person give in

785
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:13,800
Take a bite

786
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:18,800
This is the one we can work under

787
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,680
Seấn's maid

788
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:23,520

789
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,280

00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,440

Say it.

797
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,400
It shouldn't be.

798
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,360
Is it because...

799
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:50,120
What's it?

800
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,040

801
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,040

Right.

809
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:18,800
This should be reduced.

810
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:22,840
Suckily.

811
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,160

812
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:25,840

I met you in the classroom.

819
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,680
It's a pity that you were so arrogant.

820
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,520
I sent someone to follow you.

821
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,680
I was waiting for someone to go to the classroom.

822
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,680

823
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:57,840
