The Story of the Phoenix

00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Episode 1

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Episode 1

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Okay, brother. Don't worry. See you tomorrow.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Okay, bye.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
How did you guess? You just sent the client.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Mr. Chu, how about some water?

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Okay, bye.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Mr. Zhao, thank you for coming.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I'm so sorry. I just sent the client.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'll punish myself later.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Okay, sit.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Today, I will announce

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
that the mountain goat is the manager of the north.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Mr. Chu and Mr. Chu, I hope you two can work together

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
and get better.

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The snowman that Mr. Wang gave me recently

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
was also the one who gave him the snowman.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
He's also the manager of the new shop this year.

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Thank you for giving me this opportunity.

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I... I will not let you down.

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Keep working hard.

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Bye.

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Is that Xiaoyang?

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The sheep's wool.

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I've heard about your name.

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Brother Zhu, you've said it.

28
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
You're the senior.

29
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
We need to be senior in the back.

30
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm not the senior.

31
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm just a former.

32
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
You'll die on the beach if you're the former.

33
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Mr. Chu, Xiaoyang is also a half-dead.

34
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
He's been a police officer.

35
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
He's been thinking about it.

36
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
He's been a police officer?

37
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Why don't you go and be a police officer?

38
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Why do you sell houses here?

39
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I'm not a high school student.

40
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
But the industry is different.

41
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
It's reasonable.

42
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Isn't it all for the living?

43
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Yes.

44
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Mr. Chu, I'll keep an eye on you.

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I'm sorry, sir.

46
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Today we just had a talk.

47
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
In the north community,

48
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,600
there's nothing special about

49
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:40,000
what the police officer does.

50
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
You have to get it ready with the convenience.

51
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
This is all convenient.

52
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
You're worth a lot of practice.

53
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Your commonly foundness in computer",

54
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
you're not smartphone excellent.

55
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Why should you张 in the pink brother and claim the decent?

56
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Mr. Zhao,

57
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,840
I was right.

58
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,600
Mr. Chu, it's hot.

59
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,360
Is it?

60
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,040
Come on.

61
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Yes, yes, yes.

62
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,000
Mr. Zhu, you're right.

63
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,000
I'll definitely train my emotions

64
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,000
and change my mind completely.

65
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,000
I'll give you this bottle.

66
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,000
Thank you for your point of view.

67
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,000
Let me realize my own flaws.

68
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,600
Mr. Zhu,

69
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,000
let's drink together

70
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,600
and have a toast to Mr. Zhao.

71
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,200
What do you think?

72
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,800
Yes, Mr. Zhu.

73
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,800
You're thirsty, right?

74
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,600
Come on.

75
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,800
Come on, Mr. Zhu.

76
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Let me introduce you.

77
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:01,800
Mr. Zhu,

78
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,800
let's toast to the brothers and sisters.

79
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,200
Come on, come on.

80
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,000
Let's toast to you.

81
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,800
Later,

82
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I'll treat you to a second cup of wine

83
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,200
and a cup of beer.

84
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Cheers.

85
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,200
Come on, come on.

86
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,000
Cheers.

87
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,200
Come on, cheers.

88
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,000
Cheers.

89
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:22,600
Come on.

90
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,600
Cheers.

91
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,800
Cheers.

92
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,600
Cheers.

93
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,800
Cheers.

94
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,800
Cheers.

95
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,800
Cheers.

96
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,800
Cheers.

97
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,800
Cheers.

98
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,800
Cheers.

99
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,800
Cheers.

100
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,800
Cheers.

101
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,800
Cheers.

102
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,600
Cheers.

103
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,400
Cheers.

104
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:37,600
Cheers.

105
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,000
Mr. Zhu, are you okay?

106
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,600
We're doing a good job.

107
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,000
You're not good at drinking.

108
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,400
You're not professional.

109
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,800
Yes.

110
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,200
You scared me just now.

111
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,000
I brought you a bottle of wine.

112
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,400
I also brought a new bottle.

113
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,400
You don't know how to use it.

114
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,400
Of course, it's illegal.

115
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,800
I only used the car to send it back.

116
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,800
He's the leader and the senior.

117
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
We have to be more respectful.

118
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,200
We're here.

119
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,200
Let's go.

120
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,200
Let's go.

121
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,000
This place is nice.

122
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,000
Really good.

123
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,300
Welcome to the world of Daftсomnos.

124
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,000
Let's sit down.

125
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,000
slippery

126
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,960
Alice, where's the board.

127
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,200
Hurry and come.

128
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,400
Come, come.

129
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,440
Good.

130
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,800
Let's team up.

131
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,720
Detective Deng.

132
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,560
Everyone.

133
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,880
I'm Dian.

134
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,240
Please open the first page.

135
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:13,240
This world has a Academy,

136
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,880
a gate,

137
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,360
a heaven,

138
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,520
and a monster.

139
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:22,000
No matter how much time we have,

140
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,840
we can't stop the rules.

141
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:28,320
We can't stop the love.

142
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,240
The future is not a map.

143
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,120
Are you Yang Ling or Xu Qi'an?

144
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:43,320
Welcome to the world of Phoenix.

145
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,800
One, two, three, four.

146
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,920
One, two, three, four.

147
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:27,120
One, two, three, four.

148
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,120
One, two, three, four.

149
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,400
One, two, three, four.

150
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,280
One, two, three, four.

151
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:40,280
One, two, three, four.

152
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:44,560
One, two, three, four.

153
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,560
One, two, three, four.

154
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,560
One, two, three, four.

155
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,320
I'm Wei Yu.

156
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,480
I'm the king.

157
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,760
I'm the king.

158
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,920
I'm the king.

159
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,640
I'm the king.

160
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,960
I'm the king.

161
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:56,960
I'm the king.

162
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:58,960
Where am I?

163
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,280
Am I drunk?

164
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,160
The script is too real.

165
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:25,360
The End

166
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,360
The End

167
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,360
The End

168
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,360
The End

169
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,920
The world has changed.

170
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:38,960
You know many things,

171
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,920
but you don't exist.

172
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:40,920
Right?

173
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:41,920
No, no, no.

174
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:42,960
Don't go.

175
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,920
I'm so blind.

176
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,960
I don't know how I got to this place.

177
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,840
But these days,

178
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:49,000
I've been thinking about it very clearly.

179
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,280
Do you know that

180
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,560
the travel of time and space is peaceful?

181
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,000
No, no, no.

182
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,960
I know these things

183
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,000
are also white.

184
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,800
Because this has surpassed

185
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,880
your understanding of the crime.

186
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,920
But don't be nervous.

187
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,680
Don't be nervous.

188
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,680
Yes, yes, don't be nervous.

189
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,000
Look at this.

190
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,880
In short, you just need to be careful.

191
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,800
I, Yang Lin,

192
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,240
definitely not the drunkard

193
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,080
you mentioned in your mouth.

194
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,200
Xu Qian.

195
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Do you understand?

196
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,400
Do you eat or not?

197
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,280
I'm not a dog.

198
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:16,800
No, no.

199
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,400
Brother.

200
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,880
Brother, come back and talk to us.

201
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:19,800
No, I'm wrong.

202
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,320
I didn't say you're stupid.

203
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,160
No, you can understand.

204
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,320
I can explain it clearly right away.

205
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,320
You will understand very soon.

206
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,040
You have to believe me.

207
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,640
You have to believe yourself.

208
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,320
You...

209
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,880
Am I not clear enough?

210
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,880
The nine-star conch.

211
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,880
So he should be able to understand.

212
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,880
The nine-star conch.

213
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,880
The nine-star conch.

214
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:08,880
I can't believe it.

215
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,880
The nine-star conch.

216
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:12,880
I can't believe it.

217
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,880
I can't believe it.

218
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:16,880
I can't believe it.

219
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,880
The nine-star conch.

220
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,880
The sky is clear.

221
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:20,880
There is a chance.

222
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,880
Our Chinese saying is

223
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,880
the force is out of the machine.

224
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:26,880
The wave is stable and the wave is moving.

225
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,880
The time and space ripples are caused by this wave.

226
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,880
I'm just sucked by this wave.

227
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,880
I just

228
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,880
pass through the wave.

229
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,880
I can't understand.

230
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:42,880
What's going on?

231
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,880
Xu Qian, someone wants to see you.

232
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,880
You have to hold on for a while.

233
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,880
Gao Jingxi.

234
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,880
You are...

235
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,880
It's me.

236
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,880
Gao Jingxi, time is running out.

237
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,880
The four-star conch in the lake

238
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,880
has taken me 300 taels.

239
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:12,880
This is our Jin Sheng's silver.

240
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:14,880
Go without worry.

241
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:16,880
Don't panic.

242
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,880
I can only help you here.

243
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,880
If you escape,

244
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:30,880
you will be in the north all the way

245
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:34,880
and you will be in the north all your life.

246
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,880
You...

247
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,880
Who are you?

248
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:43,880
What are you talking about?

249
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:44,880
Brother.

250
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:47,880
The sky is not deep.

251
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,880
Xu Xin is the dream.

252
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:52,880
The wind is like a long night.

253
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,880
Xu Xin is the dream.

254
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,880
Brother, this is the Zhao Mansion of the Great Fengjing.

255
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,880
It's a common thing to sell a silly set of things.

256
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:02,880
The wind?

257
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:03,880
Where is the wind?

258
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:05,880
What are you talking about?

259
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,880
Forget it.

260
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:08,880
Just tell me what I did.

261
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,880
How much more do I have to be pardoned?

262
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,880
It's not you.

263
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:15,880
It's my father.

264
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,880
Three days ago,

265
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,880
my father sent the courtiers to protect the silver.

266
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,880
He was in an accident.

267
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,880
It was only 15,000 taels of silver.

268
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:32,880
There is a monster.

269
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:33,880
The courtiers are very active.

270
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,880
His Majesty ordered

271
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,880
the Bo Ran anger himself.

272
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:37,880
He killed my father

273
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:38,880
five days later.

274
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:40,880
The three families were in a wrong.

275
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:42,880
The Nan Ding and the Bian Jiang

276
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,880
were sent to me by the female courtiers.

277
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,880
It's just a hell.

278
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:58,880
What's wrong?

279
00:12:58,880 --> 00:12:59,880
I'm getting tired.

280
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,880
Wait a minute.

281
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:02,880
Isn't your father

282
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,880
the one who let me go?

283
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,880
What about you?

284
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,880
I have a teacher of the Yunlu Academy.

285
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,880
Of course, I don't need to be punished.

286
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,880
But even so,

287
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,880
I was sent to the Palace of the Deceased.

288
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,880
I was sent to the Sword Bureau.

289
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:21,880
You are right.

290
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:24,880
The Xu Xia of this moment

291
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,880
is in the dark.

292
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,880
I really have to go.

293
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,880
If I can't escape,

294
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:39,880
I will live for a year.

295
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,880
I will try for a year.

296
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:43,880
Wait.

297
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,880
What's wrong?

298
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:46,880
Come here.

299
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:50,880
Can you get the scroll?

300
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:52,880
The scroll of the scroll

301
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,880
is the scroll of the scroll of the scroll of the lost.

302
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:55,880
Brother,

303
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,880
why do you want to scroll?

304
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,880
I have no way to escape.

305
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,880
Why do you

306
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,880
just want to die

307
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:02,880
if you want to die?

308
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:03,880
Otherwise, I won't be happy.

309
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:06,880
Fine.

310
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:07,880
I've seen the scroll.

311
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:08,880
I'll tell you.

312
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,880
Who are you going to?

313
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:10,880
You're a wu fu.

314
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:11,880
Don't be ridiculous.

315
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:12,880
I'm going to go.

316
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,880
Brother.

317
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:15,880
Let him go.

318
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:16,880
Okay.

319
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,880
Go.

320
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:42,880
Go.

321
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:08,880
Brother.

322
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:09,880
Don't say

323
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:10,880
I'll give you the scroll.

324
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:11,880
Okay.

325
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:12,880
I will.

326
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,880
I really have to go this time.

327
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,880
Take care.

328
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:28,880
Give me your hand.

329
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,880
Give me your hand.

330
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:30,880
Give it to me.

331
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:37,880
Go back to life.

332
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:42,880
I'm going.

333
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:51,880
It's time to die.

334
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:52,880
Let's go in.

335
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,880
The demon is broken.

336
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,880
Go home.

337
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:15,880
It's broken by the demon.

338
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,680
Li Lian 수가,

339
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:23,880
do you believe that

340
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,280
the demon came from bronze screen?

341
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:27,880
I grew up in the temple.

342
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,780
It's fallen very yarn Republican NPC

343
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:36,880
who died with the demon咳.

344
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:40,380
So,

345
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:42,820
It's strange that the cause of this case is wrong.

346
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:45,420
Maybe we're wrong.

347
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:46,340
Well...

348
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:51,540
Why don't we go to the Academy of Clouds

349
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:52,820
and find someone to ask us?

350
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,980
Lord Fu Yin, what do you mean?

351
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:57,700
Can't you see the number of forgets of the Four Heavens?

352
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:58,860
Miss Caiwei,

353
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,540
I'm just in a hurry.

354
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:02,340
I have no trouble with the Four Heavens.

355
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:04,060
There are only two days left.

356
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:05,580
His Majesty ordered us

357
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:07,820
to catch the Nightingale before the execution of Xu Pingzhi.

358
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:09,660
You must be in a hurry.

359
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:11,980
But Greeves...

360
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:14,500
I have a great leave these days.

361
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,340
So I have to find him at dirt roads and selectiverevives.

362
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:27,780
It's written that

363
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:31,500
there is a military ash in theines

364
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,380
where hots and fields would grow

365
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:36,580
in heat.

366
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:38,420
It has been known to have

367
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:39,980
a great storm in宿的人 state.

368
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:41,300
I'm telling you the truth.

369
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:42,780
This case

370
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:44,180
is also a test

371
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:45,380
for me.

372
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:45,980
No.

373
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:49,180
What's new about Xu Pingzhi?

374
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:50,980
It's just a misunderstanding.

375
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:51,980
It's just a misunderstanding.

376
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:52,980
It's just a misunderstanding.

377
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:53,980
It's just a misunderstanding.

378
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:54,980
How could Shuyin

379
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:55,980
lose her mind?

380
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:56,980
I've already forgotten

381
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:57,980
what happened to Xu Pingzhi.

382
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:58,980
I've already forgotten

383
00:17:58,980 --> 00:17:59,980
what happened to Xu Pingzhi.

384
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:00,980
No.

385
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:01,980
No?

386
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:02,980
Yes.

387
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:03,980
Xu Pingzhi

388
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:04,980
made the decision

389
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:05,980
to kill Shuyin

390
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:08,980
on the way to the prison.

391
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:10,980
And I've already

392
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:11,980
forgotten about it.

393
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:12,980
The prison

394
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:13,980
followed by the prison.

395
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:15,980
What's the reason

396
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:17,980
for the monster?

397
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:18,980
It can avoid

398
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:19,980
the forgotten tree in our private room.

399
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:20,980
The monster is too powerful.

400
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:24,980
No.

401
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:25,980
It's impossible.

402
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:26,980
There's no monster.

403
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,980
The monster is just a guess.

404
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:29,980
It's to take care of

405
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:30,980
our own guess.

406
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:31,980
I can't be influenced by them.

407
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:33,980
I can't be influenced by them.

408
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:35,980
I can't be influenced by them.

409
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:36,980
I can't be influenced by them.

410
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:41,980
Why did the monster

411
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:42,980
cut off Shuyin?

412
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:44,980
Didn't he use silver?

413
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:45,980
No.

414
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:47,980
The monster

415
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:48,980
is a animal.

416
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:49,980
The monster is a dog.

417
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:50,980
It's not a dog.

418
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:52,980
It's a dog.

419
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:53,980
It's a dog.

420
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:54,980
It's a dog.

421
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:55,980
It's a dog.

422
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:57,980
The silver

423
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:58,980
is a bomb.

424
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:01,980
A bomb.

425
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:04,980
A bomb.

426
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:05,980
Why is the silver a bomb?

427
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:07,980
Why is the silver a bomb?

428
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:15,980
A bomb.

429
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:16,980
A bomb.

430
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:20,980
Someone's coming.

431
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:21,980
Someone's coming.

432
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:22,980
Is there anyone?

433
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:23,980
What are you doing?

434
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:24,980
What are you doing?

435
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:25,980
What are you doing?

436
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:26,980
You're not alive.

437
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:27,980
Bro, I want to see your leader.

438
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:29,980
I want to see your master.

439
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:30,980
Our master?

440
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:32,980
You want to see the monster

441
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:33,980
and I want to see him, right?

442
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:34,980
You don't even have to call me.

443
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:35,980
What are you doing?

444
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:37,980
You're hiding?

445
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:38,980
I'll beat you up.

446
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:40,980
I have a key clue for Shuyin to lose.

447
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:41,980
Wait for me to find you.

448
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:46,980
Sir,

449
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:47,980
the suspect Xu Qian is here.

450
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,980
I've seen a few masters.

451
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:05,980
Xu Qian,

452
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:06,980
three days ago,

453
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:07,980
when it rained,

454
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,980
you didn't say

455
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:11,980
you had any clues.

456
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:14,980
Where did you get the clues today?

457
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:16,980
Don't tell me

458
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:17,980
I gave you the key.

459
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:19,980
Okay, I will.

460
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:21,980
Xu Jia Erlang came to me just now.

461
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:23,980
He gave me the key.

462
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,980
Xu Xin Nian.

463
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:26,980
Yes.

464
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:28,980
First, we need to be honest.

465
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,980
We can let others

466
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,980
hear what I say.

467
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:34,980
Then?

468
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:36,980
Sir, go back.

469
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:38,980
Who told you to get up?

470
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:39,980
I've solved the case.

471
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:41,980
Get up and talk.

472
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:42,980
Okay.

473
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:46,980
You go ahead and talk.

474
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,980
Shuyin was arrested.

475
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:50,980
It's not a monster.

476
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:52,980
It's a hand of a monster.

477
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:53,980
It's a human.

478
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:05,980
You need to tell me clearly.

479
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:08,980
Actually, this case is not complicated.

480
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:10,980
It's a hand of a monster.

481
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,980
My uncle is in the middle of the city.

482
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,980
He's from Guangnan.

483
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:19,980
There's a thought at this time.

484
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,980
A monster appears.

485
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:34,980
There's a situation ahead.

486
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:35,980
Go.

487
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:36,980
Go.

488
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:04,980
Go.

489
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:11,980
Sir,

490
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:13,980
did you find any clues?

491
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:16,980
What clues?

492
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:17,980
I'd like to ask you.

493
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:21,980
How much is this 15,000 taels of silver?

494
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:22,980
Don't waste it.

495
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:24,980
Tell me.

496
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:26,980
One kilo is 16 taels.

497
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,980
15,000 taels of silver is

498
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:31,980
9,375 taels.

499
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:34,980
You're really smart.

500
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:36,980
You're good at math.

501
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:37,980
I admire you.

502
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:38,980
So?

503
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:39,980
What does this mean?

504
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:41,980
It means that time is right.

505
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:46,980
You mean 9,375 taels of silver

506
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:49,980
can't be found in Guangnan?

507
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:50,980
That's right.

508
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:53,980
There are 30 taels of silver in Guangnan.

509
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:55,980
Four of them are used to make trouble.

510
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:56,980
With the skill of a slave,

511
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:59,980
9,375 taels of silver is enough.

512
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:01,980
There are 12 taels of silver.

513
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,980
How can you get to Guangnan

514
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:05,980
in the moment of truth?

515
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:20,980
But the silver is indeed

516
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:22,980
in the moment of truth.

517
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:26,980
That's because the silver is fake.

518
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:32,980
It's ridiculous.

519
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:34,980
The money is in the public's account.

520
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,980
The carriage is in the river.

521
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:38,980
The silver is in the water.

522
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:39,980
How can it be fake?

523
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:41,980
The silver is not a fact.

524
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:42,980
As far as I know,

525
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:45,980
there is one thing that is different from the silver.

526
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,980
But the weight is different.

527
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:48,980
What is it?

528
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:50,980
What is gold?

529
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:53,980
Gold?

530
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:55,980
Give it to me.

531
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:56,980
Give it to me.

532
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:57,980
Give it to me.

533
00:23:58,980 --> 00:23:59,980
I've never seen this.

534
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,980
Why don't you let me show you today?

535
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:05,980
Take out the gold and silver.

536
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:07,980
Gold and silver are extremely difficult to practice.

537
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,980
I'll give it to you.

538
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:10,980
Difficult?

539
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:13,980
What's difficult?

540
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:14,980
You need to use electricity.

541
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:17,980
You need to be extremely warm.

542
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:18,980
You need to be patient.

543
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:19,980
You need to be patient.

544
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:20,980
You need to be patient.

545
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:22,980
I'll take care of the rest.

546
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:30,980
I'll take care of the rest.

547
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:01,980
Wait a minute, sir.

548
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:02,980
You need some time.

549
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:18,980
Wait a minute, sir.

550
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:20,980
You need some time.

551
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:32,980
Sir, this is fire.

552
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:49,980
The next step is to change the system.

553
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:51,980
This step will release some poisonous qi.

554
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:53,980
We need to take care of the rest.

555
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:01,980
You need to take care of the rest.

556
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:04,980
The next step is to change the system.

557
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:30,980
This thing is very similar to the white silver and the appearance.

558
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:31,980
But it's heavier.

559
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:33,980
It's lighter than the silver.

560
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:35,980
If someone uses this thing to take the white silver,

561
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:37,980
can it be a fake?

562
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:39,980
If this thing is sent by the transport,

563
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:41,980
it will be more reasonable.

564
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:44,980
Even if the silver is exchanged,

565
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:45,980
what's the problem?

566
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:49,980
Then why would the silver explode?

567
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:52,980
Sir, please step back.

568
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:55,980
Not enough.

569
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:56,980
Step back a little more.

570
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:58,980
Not enough.

571
00:26:58,980 --> 00:26:59,980
Be bold.

572
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:01,980
Step back.

573
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:04,980
Okay, good.

574
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:24,980
Sir.

575
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:26,980
This metal is very hard to break.

576
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:28,980
It will explode if it's water.

577
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:29,980
No wonder.

578
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:32,980
Even the forgotten number of the four-day sword can't be observed.

579
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:34,980
The master of this wood is putting the silver on the top of the mouth.

580
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:36,980
And the eyes are closed.

581
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:38,980
And the bottom is metal.

582
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:44,980
You are Xu Qi'an?

583
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:47,980
Yes.

584
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:49,980
You are very good.

585
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:52,980
Even if the silver is fake,

586
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:54,980
what's the real silver?

587
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:56,980
This metal has another feature.

588
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:58,980
It's that it's easy to change the time.

589
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:00,980
So there's only one possibility.

590
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:03,980
The silver was sent by the receptionist.

591
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:05,980
In this way,

592
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:07,980
we can find out where the silver is.

593
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:08,980
Come on.

594
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:09,980
Let's go.

595
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:10,980
Sir, please.

596
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:13,980
I want to make a contribution.

597
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:15,980
Sir, don't bother.

598
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:17,980
I'll go with you to change the time.

599
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:18,980
No, no, no.

600
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:19,980
I'm not in trouble.

601
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:20,980
Stand still.

602
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:24,980
Sir.

603
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:25,980
Sir.

604
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:28,980
Don't forget the promise to the people of the capital.

605
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:32,980
But the ghost wind can still fly.

606
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:52,980
I'll wait here.

607
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:56,980
I'm afraid that the master won't be able to find me.

608
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:58,980
Don't stand there.

609
00:28:58,980 --> 00:28:59,980
Sit down.

610
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:03,980
It's been hard on the few of you these days.

611
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:07,980
How about some tea?

612
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:08,980
No, no, no.

613
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:09,980
Have some tea.

614
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:10,980
You see,

615
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:13,980
I'm about to sleep.

616
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:14,980
When I go out,

617
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:16,980
I'll treat you to a drink.

618
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:19,980
Okay.

619
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:20,980
You can go back and wait.

620
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:22,980
I can't go anywhere.

621
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:32,980
Here.

622
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:33,980
I'll eat it for you.

623
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:35,980
Thank you.

624
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:38,980
Why can you become a gold-fired man?

625
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:42,980
I saw in an ancient book

626
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:46,980
that Yan becomes a golden-fired man.

627
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:47,980
What kind of ancient book?

628
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:48,980
High school.

629
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:51,980
It's from the book of the People's Education.

630
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:55,980
But the secret period has long been lost.

631
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:58,980
But...

632
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:02,980
I still remember the content of the ancient period.

633
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:03,980
Come on, tell me.

634
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:09,980
I'm just worried that

635
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:11,980
I can't remember it.

636
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:13,980
You're quite a smooth person.

637
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:16,980
I'm not interested in taking my family here.

638
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:20,980
I'll ask you in detail what should I do.

639
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:23,980
You should look for a calleol해주oi with a nice name.

640
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:25,980
It suits you.

641
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:29,980
We really don't need to need a calleol.

642
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:30,980
Yeah.

643
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:33,980
But looking for a calleol makes us jealous.

644
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:34,980
You...

645
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:41,980
Let me help you with your gesagt next.

646
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:44,000
because of how I usually dream.

647
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:46,000
I really envy

648
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:48,000
your pride-resisting highように.

649
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,960
Tell me about your secret entire scheming technique.

650
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,960
I know very well

651
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,840
about the secret.

652
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,080
But I'm afraid she doesn't understand

653
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,240
theéntess walls.

654
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,160
Bullshit!

655
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:02,160
We Plan J J.</i淫金術

656
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:03,360
will be filled

657
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,680
as loss.

658
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:05,540
Qin Haili is a miserable neighbor

659
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:06,000
in厲u Datang Bridge.

660
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:06,480
A young lawyer

661
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,500
would be afraid of nothing.

662
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:08,880
Are you kidding me?

663
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:09,380
Yeah.

664
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:10,880
It's very smart.

665
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:13,980
You're still trying to give me back?

666
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:15,980
I'm just trying to bite you.

667
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:18,980
Hey, Mr. Jin, are you trying to think of me?

668
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:21,980
We only get the same thing when we meet.

669
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,980
How do you know I'm not?

670
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:26,980
It's a birthday party, big brother.

671
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:28,980
I just drank a little.

672
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:29,980
I didn't do anything to you.

673
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:30,980
I just wanted you to come.

674
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:31,980
Don't.

675
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:32,980
What's the matter with Jia Li?

676
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:33,980
Right.

677
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:34,980
It's just a matter of time.

678
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:35,980
What's the matter?

679
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:36,980
What's the matter with you?

680
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:37,980
Thank you for your concern.

681
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:39,980
Don't ask too much.

682
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:40,980
What's the matter with you?

683
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:41,980
What's the matter with you?

684
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:42,980
Are you out of your mind?

685
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:43,980
No.

686
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:44,980
Look, he's not telling us.

687
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:45,980
Are you okay?

688
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:47,980
I'm fine.

689
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:48,980
I'm sure he won't see you.

690
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:49,980
Xu Qin.

691
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:51,980
Please help me to sleep on your back.

692
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:52,980
We can leave now.

693
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:54,980
Thank you, Mr. Fu Yin.

694
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:55,980
You're so nice.

695
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:57,980

Get out of the way.

697
00:31:58,980 --> 00:31:59,980
Don't be so greedy.

698
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:00,980
I'm not going to let you stay here.

699
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:01,980
I'm just going to cook for you.

700
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:02,980
Let's go.

701
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:03,980

I'm really sorry.

712
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:18,700
What's wrong?

713
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:26,460
No.

714
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:28,180
Why do you call me alone?

715
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:30,460
I have a family.

716
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:35,780
My lord, where is my son?

717
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:44,220

00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:06,800
Who is your second uncle?

760
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:07,600
Go away!

761
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,300
I'm sorry!

762
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:12,920
in the building house of� Half-

763
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:19,020
Mum

764
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:23,080
einen

765
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:24,520
Zhen

766
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:26,640
There is no one

767
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:27,700
he with cap of

768
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:33,080
b

769
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:35,060
wrong

770
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:41,300
What does Second Uncle look like?

771
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:50,300
You can leave now.

772
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:52,300
I'm leaving.

773
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:06,300
Is this really the case?

774
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:07,300
Yes.

775
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:09,300
This is my first time.

776
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,300
Xia Guoheng.

777
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:20,300
Are they lying to us?

778
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:25,300
It's strange that Su Su is still far away.

779
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:27,300
Wait.

780
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:30,300
Sir.

781
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:32,300
What can I do for you?

782
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:33,300
What's wrong?

783
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:38,300
Sir.

784
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:40,300
This is your official uniform.

785
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:41,300
Please take it.

786
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:48,300
You want to be the official?

787
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:49,300
Sir.

788
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:51,300
Do you want to be the official?

789
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:53,300
Sir, please.

790
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:55,300
As the law says,

791
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:58,300
the elder in the family is the legal owner.

792
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:59,300
The wife of the childe,

793
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,300
can be charged for the crime.

794
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:04,300
I'm sorry.

795
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:05,300
I'm sorry.

796
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:06,300

I'm sorry.

799
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:09,300
I'm sorry.

800
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:10,300
I'm sorry.

801
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:11,300
I'm sorry.

802
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:12,300
I'm sorry.

803
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:13,300
I'm sorry.

804
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:14,300
I'm sorry.

805
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:15,300
I'm sorry.

806
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:16,300
I'm sorry.

807
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:17,300
I'm sorry.

808
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:18,300
I'm sorry.

809
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:21,300
You...

810
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:22,300
You...

811
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:23,300
You...

812
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:25,300
You're our good son.

813
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:28,300
He's your nephew.

814
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:29,300
Xu Qian.

815
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:30,300
He just broke the sleep case

816
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:32,300
and released it.

817
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:34,300
He should be at the door now.

818
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:36,300
Go to talk to him.

819
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:39,300
Sir.

820
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:42,300
Mr. Xu, goodbye.

821
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:45,300
Xu...

822
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:46,300
Xu Qian.

823
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:50,300
What's my nephew doing?

824
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:54,300
You haven't been here yet?

825
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:55,300
Hurry up.

826
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:56,300
Don't be so nervous.

827
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:59,300
Sir, goodbye.

828
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:10,300
The drum is so hot.

829
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:11,300
Lin Yu.

830
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:16,300
Lin Yu.

831
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:31,300
Lin Yu.

832
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:46,300
Lin Yu.

833
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:56,300
What a good look!

834
00:38:58,300 --> 00:38:59,300
I forgot.

835
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:01,300
You're practicing the essence now.

836
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:02,300
I'm so moved.

837
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:03,300
So moved?

838
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,300
I'm so moved?

839
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:08,300
You said it's good.

840
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:09,300
I'll buy you something delicious.

841
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:10,300
Don't tell Shen Zhen.

842
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:12,300
I have a private room.

843
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:13,300
Take it.

844
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:17,300
Brother.

845
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:22,300
Brother.

846
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:25,300
Did you bring me candy?

847
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:26,300
Brother just came out.

848
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:27,300
Where did he give you candy?

849
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:29,300
I brought you candy.

850
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:32,300
Brother.

851
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:34,300
You haven't taught me the music yet.

852
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:36,300
You're a little bit naughty.

853
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:38,300
Miss Xu Jia.

854
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:39,300
Xu Lin Yue.

855
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:42,300
Lin Yu.

856
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:43,300
Lin Yu.

857
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:45,300
This time.

858
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:48,300
Thank you.

859
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:50,300
You bastard.

860
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:51,300
From now on,

861
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:53,300
you're the music.

862
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:54,300
You're not allowed to be my guest.

863
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:56,300
You're not allowed to be Xu Jia's fan.

864
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:57,300
Fan.

865
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:58,300
Do you understand?

866
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:02,300
Mo Qi, Shao Ningqiong.

867
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:05,300
He Dong, He Xi in the 30s.

868
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:07,300
Don't regret it.

869
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:08,300
You idiot.

870
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:09,300
You...

871
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:10,300
You can't say that.

872
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:11,300
You coward.

873
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:12,300
You're a coward.

874
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:18,300
Shen Yan, thank you.

875
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,300
This is the flower garden.

876
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:30,300
You're really a couple.

877
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:31,300
We're family.

878
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:34,300
Today I'm the master.

879
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:43,300
You...

880
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:45,300
You're still eating with us.

881
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:47,300
You're getting close to us anyway.

882
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:48,300
It's just a couple.

883
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:50,300
Do you think so?

884
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:57,300
You're really a couple.

885
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:00,300
You're really a couple.

886
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:03,300
Look.

887
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:05,300
Thank you.

888
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:07,300
You're also a couple.

889
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:10,300
I'll be the master today.

890
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:12,300
Let's eat together

891
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:14,300
after we get married.

892
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:16,300
Okay.

893
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:17,300
Let's go home.

894
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:19,300
It's hard to eat, Shen.

895
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:20,300
Okay.

896
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:21,300
Let's go.

897
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:42,300
I'm not afraid of him.

898
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:44,300
I'm not afraid of anyone.

899
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:46,300
I'm not afraid of anyone.

900
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:48,300
I'm not afraid of anyone.

901
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:50,300
I'm not afraid of anyone.

902
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:52,300
I'm not afraid of anyone.

903
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:54,300
I'm not afraid of anyone.

904
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:56,300
I'm not afraid of anyone.

905
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:58,300
I'm not afraid of anyone.

906
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:00,300
I'm not afraid of anyone.

907
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:02,300
I'm not afraid of anyone.

908
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:04,300
I'm not afraid of anyone.

909
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:06,300
I'm not afraid of anyone.

910
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:08,300
I'm not afraid of anyone.

911
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:10,300
The young man will be born.

912
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:24,300
Lu,

913
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:26,300
my family is not rich.

914
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:29,300
But your family is still here.

915
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:32,300
I hope you and Xiaoyunji brothers

916
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:35,300
can be a good family.

917
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:37,300
Go.

918
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:40,300
Go.

919
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:44,300
Go.

920
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:45,300
Put down your shoes.

921
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:54,300
I start to think of you.

922
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:59,300
I will go back to what I did

923
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:03,000
after the happiness you caused me.

924
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:06,200
I will start from

925
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:07,300
theASS

926
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:09,300
I will not let you go.

927
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:13,300
Ye,

928
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:16,300
mother,

929
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:21,300
I am not filial.

930
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:26,300
I am already happy.

931
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:31,300
Le, Le, Le.

932
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:33,300
It's okay. It's okay.

00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:35,300
It's okay. It's okay.

936
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:44,300
Xu Tian.

937
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:46,300
I am calling you.

938
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:47,300
What are you doing?

939
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:48,300
Thank you.

940
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:50,300
Is this Xiao Yun Xiao Lu?

941
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:51,300
Yes.

942
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:53,300
How do you open the door?

943
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:54,300
Ni'er.

944
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:56,300
It's Ni'er.

945
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:57,300
I am Ni'er.

946
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:58,300
She will not care about us.

947
00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:00,300
She will care about us.

948
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:01,300
Ni'er.

949
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:06,300
The sky is not deep.

950
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:09,300
The new year

951
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:13,300
