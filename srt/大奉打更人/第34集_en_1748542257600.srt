1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm a little tired of the world

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I'm afraid I'll be a little tired

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm curious what I'm going to do next

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I don't want to think about the future

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
The whole book in my mouth

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Let this bowl of soup and a little bit of soup

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
It's not very solid

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
When you're here

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I'll keep the rules

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'll keep it to myself

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Keep on being sick

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'll take this big piece of bowl

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
We're suddenly

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
We're going to step by step

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
We're suddenly

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
We're suddenly going to grow

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
We're suddenly

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
We're going to stop the music

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
We're going to sing

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
We're going to get drunk from the beginning

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm afraid I'll be lonely

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in my heart

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
This hand can't hold the glass

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
See how much I love the world

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'll turn back and forth

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'll turn back and forth

27
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'll turn back and forth

28
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm afraid I'll be a little tired

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in my heart

30
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Hiding the consequences of both

31
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
And what's left is Behind

32
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Looking at it grows more and more

33
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It's never exceeding

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
The meaning is meaningless

35
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
As time drove on

36
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:46,600
I've learned a lesson

37
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,720
The mother-child care unit wants you to watch Da Feng fight with someone.

38
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,480
Let's eat well.

39
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,320
Let's eat quickly.

40
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:11,920
Let's go.

41
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,920
Let's go.

42
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,480
Da Feng is not worth it.

43
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,760
Platoon Commander !

44
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,440
The Crown Prince Seoultendee sent a letter

45
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,880
to prevent the case of Chujiumi.

46
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,640
Now, he is leading his feet.

47
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,520
amen.

48
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,760
Where is high-ranking Japs?

49
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,040
Infants who come to greet you every day,

50
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:47,180
Lord Xu!

51
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,760
Lord Xu!

52
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,880
Xu Qingyang!

53
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,360
Xu Qingyang!

54
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,480
Where are you going?

55
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,480
Mr. Xu.

56
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,040
Look there.

57
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,160
Is he calling you?

58
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,920
Xu Qingyang!

59
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:12,760
Princess.

60
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,800
Xu Qingyang!

61
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,200
Princess!

62
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,920
Xu Qingyang!

63
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,240
I'm here!

64
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,240
I'm here!

65
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,040
Why are you here?

66
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,800
What did you say?

67
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,080
What did you say? I can't hear you!

68
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,480
I can't hear you!

69
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,760
Please be quiet!

70
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,560
Turn your head away!

71
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,440
Turn your head away! Go back!

72
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,000
I'll go!

73
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,840
Okay! I'll come back to you!

74
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,360
Wait for me!

75
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,720
Mr. Xu, the wind is blowing. It's hard to turn your head away.

76
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,680
What are you doing?

77
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,560
Don't move! Wait for me!

78
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,120
Get off!

79
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,200
Don't move!

80
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,680
Xu Qingyang!

81
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,440
Wu Youalao!

82
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,760
You��로head!

83
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,920
00000000

84
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,080
Where we go?

85
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,240
Where we go?

86
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:57,680
I will fight with you for the rest of my life.

87
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,680
Hurry up!

88
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,480
Don't leave, wait for me!

89
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,520
All of you, please wear my clothes!

90
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,520
Yes!

91
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,440
Get out of the way!

92
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,960
Yes!

93
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,240
Get out!

94
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,240
Get out!

95
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,240
Get out!

96
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,240
Get out!

97
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,240
You're so stupid!

98
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,240
What do you want to say? Say it!

99
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,240
Didn't you say something to me?

100
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,240
Didn't you just say something to me on the bed?

101
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,240
I thought you wanted to say something to me.

102
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,240
No, you asked me to come here!

103
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,240
Shouldn't you have said something to me?

104
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:44,240
You didn't say anything, you just said something to me!

105
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,240
You didn't say anything, you just said something to me!

106
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,240
You have already said something to me!

107
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,240
You...

108
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,240
You didn't say anything to me.

109
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,240
I've thought about it.

110
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:02,240
I... I'm also a little bit clumsy.

111
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,240
Then I'll go back first.

112
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,240
I have to go back too.

113
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,240
Then you go back first.

114
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,240
I'll go back first.

115
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,240
Shen Hao.

116
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,240
The main office has ordered that the staff should be suspended.

117
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,240
Attention!

118
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,240
Yes!

119
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,240
Get off the bus!

120
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:49,240
My princess, I just scared the first officer as the main office.

121
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,240
Then let's fight together for a while.

122
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,240
Okay.

123
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,240
Come on.

124
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,240
Wait a minute.

125
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,240
Let's guess.

126
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,240
Thank you.

127
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,240
Princess.

128
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:28,240
Are you feeling much thinner these days?

129
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,240
No, I'm fine.

130
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,240
You're so considerate.

131
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,240
You've been so free these days.

132
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,240
How come?

133
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,240
I'm so upset that I can't see you.

134
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,240
Mother.

135
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,240
Mother, I'm sorry.

136
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,240
How is that possible?

137
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,240
I'm also a main office officer.

138
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,240
You should give me a high and low position.

139
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,240
Are you stupid?

140
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,240
You know I'm in the group.

141
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,240
Why do you have to come to me?

142
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,240
I can't see you.

143
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,240
Why should I be the main officer?

144
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,240
I don't understand.

145
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,240
What do you mean?

146
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:24,240
I actually have something to say to you.

147
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,240
Say it.

148
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,240
I mean...

149
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,240
Actually...

150
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,240
Actually what?

151
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,240
Actually, do you remember that time?

152
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,240
Which time?

153
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,240
The time when you were a little pig.

154
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,240
A little pig?

155
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,240
Say it now.

156
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,240
If you don't mind,

157
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,240
I can be your wife in the future.

158
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,240
I don't want to be your wife.

159
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,240
I don't want to be your wife.

160
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,240
Princess.

161
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:48,240
I don't want to be your wife either.

162
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,240
I'll wait for you.

163
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,240
I'll wait for you.

164
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,240
I'll wait for you.

165
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,240
The Master of the Mirror

166
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,240
Episode 24

167
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:04,240
The Master of the Mirror is too serious to be exposed.

168
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,240
Several months ago,

169
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,240
Tianyu came to the Grand Palace

170
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,240
to take care of Xu Qian.

171
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:12,240
At the same time, I completely lost contact with that person.

172
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,240
It turned out that everything that happened in the Three Kingdoms was a lie.

173
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,240
Everything was a lie.

174
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,240
It was all because of him

175
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,240
who took the blame for the death of Xu Qian.

176
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,240
We knew that

177
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:26,240
from the beginning, we were a joke.

178
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,240
It was also a conspiracy that he had been trying for a long time.

179
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,240
Fortunately,

180
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,240
his conspiracy didn't work.

181
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:36,240
The witness and Tianyu's respect

182
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,240
seemed to have reached some kind of tacit understanding.

183
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,240
The two of them were close friends.

184
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,240
They became a subtle balance.

185
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,240
I guess

186
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,240
the person who was close to the person at this moment

187
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,240
should have been from the South.

188
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,240
He has already found out that Xu Qian is in the state.

189
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,240
But he can't get along with him.

190
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,240
He can't get rid of Xu Qian without knowing.

191
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,240
He took out the nationality.

192
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,240
It seems that

193
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,240
Xu Qian is safe in a short period of time.

194
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:04,240
The Master of the Mirror will be safe too.

195
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,240
The most unexpected thing was that

196
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,240
after the Great Feng's three main points were lost in Yunzhou,

197
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,240
the Great Feng's four people were severely injured.

198
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:16,240
The Great Feng's all forces were in the air.

199
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,240
As for that person,

200
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,240
what does he want to do in the state?

201
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,240
What should be done next?

202
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,240
I don't understand.

203
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,240
But so far,

204
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,240
the only thing that can be confirmed is

205
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:32,240
that the person will definitely not be afraid of being imprisoned.

206
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,240
I think that

207
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,240
he will definitely not be afraid of being imprisoned.

208
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,240
Search carefully.

209
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,240
Don't let anyone go anywhere.

210
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,240
Yes.

211
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,240
What are you doing?

212
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,240
Let's go.

213
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,240
How dare you!

214
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,240
You are a three-dimensional meeting warehouse.

215
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,240
What do you want to do?

216
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,240
The Minister Xu said that there is no way to get in.

217
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,240
Xu Qian,

218
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,240
do you know where this is?

219
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,240
The Master of the Mirror,

220
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,240
the Three-dimensional Meeting Warehouse.

221
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,240
Who dares to do this?

222
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,240
The Minister Xu said that.

223
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,240
But it's okay.

224
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:28,240
Xu Qian is so unique.

225
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,240
He is not afraid that we will go back and take a look.

226
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,240
The Minister Xu said that he was afraid.

227
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,240
Afraid?

228
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,240
Afraid?

229
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,240
He is not going back!

230
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,240
The Minister Xu said that he was afraid.

231
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,240
But he is not here.

232
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,240
You...

233
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:48,240
Master, please stand up.

234
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,240
Please.

235
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,240
Excuse me, everyone.

236
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,240
You two, stay here.

237
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,240
Yes.

238
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,240
The Minister Xu.

239
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:12,240
What the hell is he doing?

240
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,240
Master, the team has been searched.

241
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,240
No evidence.

242
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,240
No?

243
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,240
Search carefully.

244
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,240
Don't let anyone in the office go anywhere.

245
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,240
Yes.

246
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,240
It's not right.

247
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:32,240
Xu Qian, don't be too much.

248
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,240
I've told you.

249
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,240
This time, we will go to Chuzhou.

250
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,240
I will go with you.

251
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,240
It's impossible.

252
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,240
Master Wei told me that

253
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,240
he sent 12 gold-gates to escort you.

254
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,240
Why did he send you here?

255
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,240
I see.

256
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,240
I was wondering how to make Yifu

257
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,240
follow you.

258
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,240
Let's go.

259
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,240
I forgot to bring you the kamuotake.

260
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,240
It's ok.

261
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,240
Happy 100 Yifu!

262
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,240
Great!

263
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:16,240
Happy 100 Yifu!

264
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,240
He won't be away.

265
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:22,240
How can you hire aind't your goddess?

266
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,240
Just take it.

267
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,240
Hello?

268
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,000
I've never heard such a woman bloodoff Sun Lianjing.

269
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,200
But that's really awful.

270
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,240
I thought machinery-shoptor

271
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,720
isus would be б alcohol-threatening.

272
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,280
Moreover,

273
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:55,680
it's supposed to be

274
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,960
A- dumping your knowledge.

275
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,000
We are in therounded area.

276
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,600
I'm going to move into the National Jail.

277
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:00,680
Yes, sir.

278
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,360
Got my order.

279
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,360
pave up the trail demonstration.

280
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,360
Yes, sir.

281
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,360
Mr. Cheng.

282
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,840
Why so close?

283
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:16,960
OK, but jun...

284
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:18,000
Let's delay it.

285
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,160
There was one or two days

286
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,240
just for the radiation.

287
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,040
Free miles and miles and miles a day.

288
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:28,000
It's on the top.

289
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,720
You should look carefully.

290
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:41,600
Really?

291
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,360
The thief?

292
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,280
Why are you here?

293
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,040
Why are you here?

294
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,400
To play with me.

295
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,520
To play with you?

296
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,480
You're so mean.

297
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,520
You're actually a worker.

298
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,320
I didn't expect

299
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,880
you would be so kind and generous.

300
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,400
You're from the Mansion of the King of the Wild.

301
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,640
How did you know?

302
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:16,680
Of course.

303
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,720
You're kidding me.

304
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,720
Can you use it?

305
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,440
You're not the one we're playing with.

306
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,680
As for the three silk,

307
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,880
the silk is in the women's town.

308
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,120
They're more than this.

309
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,040
You're the only one

310
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,320
who can take the Prime Minister.

311
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,080
And he can take the women

312
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,600
from the Mansion of the King of the Wild

313
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:31,960
to the Mansion of the King of the Wild.

314
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,600
To be honest,

315
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,880
you're the one who's going to marry the Princess Consort.

316
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,400
I've heard that

317
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,960
the Princess Consort is the first person

318
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,600
to marry the Princess Consort.

319
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,000
Is she in the family?

320
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,520
Yes, she is.

321
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,440
You're a little silver wolf.

322
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,840
You want to see the Princess Consort?

323
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,920
You're so rude.

324
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:53,880
Be careful.

325
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,040
I'll sue you in front of the Prime Minister.

326
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:57,680
What a coincidence.

327
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,280
I'm Xu Qi'an.

328
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,240
I'm the Prime Minister.

329
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,400
You're the Prime Minister?

330
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,920
I'm not happy to see you.

331
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,160
You're making me angry.

332
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,040
In the mansion of the King of the Wild,

333
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,480
someone made me angry.

334
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:24,920
Who?

335
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,800
The guy who met me before.

336
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,520
He's the Prime Minister.

337
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,360
Xu Qi'an?

338
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,640
You know him?

339
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,000
He's not only a man

340
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,680
who's been in love with Sang Bo,

341
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,480
but also a man who's been in love with Tian Yu.

342
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,680
His Majesty has sealed him.

343
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,640
That's why he's the Prime Minister of the Group.

344
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,360
What's wrong with him?

345
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,800
He's insulting me.

346
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,520
He wants me to be on the fake board.

347
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,840
He said this word over and over again.

348
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,360
The lord knows his mistake.

349
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,840
Are you Prime Minister Xiao?

350
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,600
Look,

351
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,000
It's my fault

352
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,840
that I don't give this young woman such mistrust.

353
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:07,520
Chief Master

354
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,960
Chief General

355
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:12,720
You said you couldn't go out to have fun.

356
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,600
Your anguish has begun to subside.

357
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,800
I could catch a cold.

358
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,640
It's fine.

359
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,440
Use the term 099 to catch kids for medicines.

360
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,280
How important to catch kids is to caught computer basic.

361
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,320
Go.

362
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,520
Clap for your sister at this hour,

363
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,320
999, Xiao'er, Dainou.

364
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,800
New Year's Day, Ke'er, Wang Laojie.

365
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,200
Wang Laojie wants you to continue watching

366
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,960
Da Feng, Da Genren.

367
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:36,280
Who is it?

368
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:36,960
It's me.

369
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,440
Are you asleep?

370
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,120
Yes.

371
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:41,800
It's fine if you're not asleep.

372
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,640
What's the matter?

373
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,120
What do you get to do residence want?

374
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,440
Wish.

375
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,840
He was sent to a好的 place.

376
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,240
Prince Cheng.

377
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,920
Prince Zheng is present.

378
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:06,000
Sh τu version can be sold in my house respectively.

379
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,880
I'd like to know how it works,

380
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,760
as well asные people.

381
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,760
Prince dime in

382
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,760
our family.

383
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:15,560
What's this?

384
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,520
The title of the princess is noble.

385
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,720
It's a low-key title to borrow to Beijing.

386
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,200
What's so strange?

387
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,080
Since the title of the princess is noble,

388
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,200
why didn't she send the army to escort her?

389
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,600
She didn't tell us.

390
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,320
Even if she wants to borrow,

391
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,200
why didn't she prepare a boat for her

392
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,040
to sail the fish cage?

393
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,560
Instead, she asked her to stay in the boat.

394
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,280
You mean...

395
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,120
What's more,

396
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,200
Chu Xiangrong just ordered a trip.

397
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,920
If it's not a temporary situation,

398
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,800
it's her time to

399
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,560
send the princess for real.

400
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,680
What do you mean?

401
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:48,120
The princess is in danger.

402
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,440
So the group will be in danger.

403
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:54,160
They will fight for the princess.

404
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,480
Take the boat!

405
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,000
Take the boat!

406
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,600
Take the boat!

407
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,560
Bravo!

408
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,800
FREEDOM, go!

409
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,640
Protect the guest.

410
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,840
Okay, go on.

411
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,720
Go on.

412
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,280
Be slow.

413
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,080
Be slow.

414
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,080
I looks weird to Wan Di,

415
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,880
but I managed to save her life there.

416
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:51,040
My integrating injury is not so serious

417
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,320
that will take a lot of effort.

418
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,640
Let's change the knife.

419
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,640
Go to Lu Lu.

420
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,640
Find a nearby doctor

421
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,640
to treat the wounded soldiers.

422
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,640
Good idea.

423
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,640
Xu Qian has a saying.

424
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,640
The princess is in the city hall.

425
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,640
She has no intention to act.

426
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,640
There must be a chance.

427
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,640
Let Sansi prepare for the defense.

428
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,640
Who knows

429
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,640
she's still under a special situation.

430
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,640
Enough.

431
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,640
I know you're selling me the hospital.

432
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,640
I

433
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,640
took back the suggestion she changed.

434
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,640
Otherwise, the situation will be terrible.

435
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,640
Now you're saying these things are all lies.

436
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,640
Chu Xianglong, the commander of the war,

437
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,640
is in the city hall with the princess

438
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,640
to avoid the bandits.

439
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,640
Xu Qian went to the far side of the road

440
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,640
to take the horse.

441
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,640
He's not back yet.

442
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,640
We're wrong.

443
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,640
The bandits are dangerous.

444
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,640
I don't know if Xun Luo can save the princess.

445
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,640
Let's go.

446
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,640
Xun Luo.

447
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,640
General Chu,

448
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,640
long time no see.

449
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,640
Xun Luo.

450
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,640
General Chu,

451
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,640
tell me who the princess is.

452
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,640
I'll give you a quick answer.

453
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:02,640
Who told you that the princess is here?

454
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,640
You're angry.

455
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,640
If I kill the princess wrongly,

456
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,640
the north king will know it.

457
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,640
I'll say you're dead.

458
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,640
Why didn't you save her?

459
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,640
How many girls

460
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:26,640
can die for the princess?

461
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:30,640
They'll die for her.

462
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,640
Bad news.

463
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,640
She wants to see the princess kill us.

464
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,640
What's the use of keeping you?

465
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,640
Princess,

466
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,640
you're so brave.

467
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,640
You're so smart.

468
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,640
You must be

469
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,640
a weapon of the phoenix.

470
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,640
Good.

471
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,640
Take them away.

472
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,640
Finally, I'm dead.

473
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,640
It's too late.

474
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:34,640
The Academy of Art and Art

475
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,640
is the most important thing.

476
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,640
I'm not afraid of the phoenix.

477
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,640
I'm afraid of the phoenix.

478
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,640
I'm afraid of the phoenix.

479
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,640
I'm afraid of the phoenix.

480
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,640
I'm afraid of the phoenix.

481
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,640
I'm afraid of the phoenix.

482
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,640
Qi, you can't hurt me.

483
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,640
Who said I can hurt you?

484
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,640
Now,

485
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,640
it's your turn.

486
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,640
Go.

487
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,640
Go.

488
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,640
Who are you?

489
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,640
Who are you?

490
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,640
Who are you?

491
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,640
Qi.

492
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,640
Qi.

493
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,640
Qi.

494
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,640
Qi.

495
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,640
Who can drink

496
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,640
by your side?

497
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,640
Minister Xu,

498
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,640
you saved me.

499
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,640
Yes.

500
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,640
Impossible.

501
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,640
Xu Xia is not your real face.

502
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,640
Tell me.

503
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,640
Who are you?

504
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,640
Why did you take her?

505
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,640
I'm not stupid.

506
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:44,640
I just

507
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,640
was too slow.

508
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,640
I have this.

509
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,640
There are 20 gold bars inside.

510
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,640
And the queen is the winner.

511
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,640
When I was in the capital,

512
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,640
I had to pick up the box.

513
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,640
Until now,

514
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,640
I have 36 in my drawer.

515
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,640
Now you should believe me.

516
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,640
The queen of Zhenbei.

517
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,640
What did you say?

518
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,640
What queen?

519
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,640
The gold bars are almost gone.

520
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,640
It's hard to pretend to be sick.

521
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,640
I can't bear to see you suffer.

522
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,640
But your house is interesting.

523
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,640
You can still change the glory

524
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,640
by your luck.

525
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,640
But you forgot

526
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,640
who won for you.

527
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,640
Six hundred taels.

528
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,640
Thanks.

529
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:44,640
You are the one who was in the capital.

530
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,640
I saw you

531
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,640
in the capital.

532
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,640
If I did that again,

533
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,640
I will spare you.

534
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,640
I thought you were

535
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,640
a normal high-ranking servant.

536
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,640
Until you appeared on the ship that day,

537
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,640
you were the maid of the queen.

538
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,640
The queen may be rich,

539
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,640
but she doesn't care about the six hundred taels.

540
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,640
But you are a maid.

541
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,640
What do you want to do

542
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,640
to the capital?

543
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,640
Change the air?

544
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,640
Change the glory?

545
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,640
You can't say anything?

546
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,640
The only possibility is

547
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,640
you are the real queen of Zhenbei.

548
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,640
And the so-called queen of Zhenbei

549
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,640
is just a prince.

550
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,640
I'm telling you this.

551
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,640
I just want to tell you.

552
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:34,640
There is still a long way to go.

553
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,640
I hope you can cooperate well.

554
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,640
I'll wait for you.

555
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,640
I'll go.

556
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,640
I'll wait for you.

557
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,640
Let's go.

558
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,640
Let's go.

559
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,640
Let's go.

560
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,640
Let's go.

561
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,640
Let's go.

562
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,640
Let's go.

563
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,640
Why didn't you go with the queen?

564
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,640
She was in the dark.

565
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,640
So her orientation

566
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,640
is that if someone asks you later,

567
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,640
please cooperate with them.

568
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,640
Slow down.

569
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:34,640
Xu Qian.

570
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,640
All right.

571
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,640
I'll drink it myself

572
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,640
when I'm with you.

573
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,640
Oh, right.

574
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,640
To prevent you from doing anything too extreme,

575
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,640
I put it on you last night.

576
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,640
How is it?

577
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,640
Are you still running?

578
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,640
It's weird.

579
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,640
Eat some.

580
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,640
Xun Yuan?

581
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,640
Is it net Hallo?

582
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,640
Yes.

583
00:32:40,640 --> 00:33:02,640
Otherwise people will museums

584
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,200
plaque your face.

585
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,640
Pack your things.

586
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,640
You're done?

587
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,640
Where are your things?

588
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,640
Here.

589
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,640
The road is so long.

590
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,640
You think you don't deserve it?

591
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,640
You can only suffer for a while.

592
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,640
Shou!

593
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,640
Shou!

594
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,640
Shou!

595
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:32,640
Shou!

596
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,640
What?

597
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,640
Did you come out first?

598
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,640
It's you.

599
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,640
It's not broken.

600
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:09,640
Xu Ji'an, are you in Chuzhou?

601
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:10,640
Not yet.

602
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:11,640
I met some situation on the way.

603
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:13,640
I'll be there later.

604
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:14,640
How's your side?

605
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:17,640
I've been exploring the border of Chuzhou for three days and three nights.

606
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:20,640
I haven't found the location of the snow mountain yet.

607
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:23,640
But there's something strange.

608
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:26,640
I met a small rock-monger who was riding a horse.

609
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:28,640
I checked the information with the public.

610
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:31,640
I found that they don't know about the snow mountain.

611
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:33,640
I know.

612
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:35,640
It's not that simple.

613
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:36,640
How do you know?

614
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:40,640
I've chosen a leader of the Kui Clan on the way.

615
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:43,640
The holy man is the one.

616
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:44,640
He's a man of skin.

617
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:48,640
Tell me.

618
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:49,640
What's the secret behind the princess?

619
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:51,640
Why did you arrest her?

620
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:52,640
I don't know.

621
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:56,640
My master asked me to come.

622
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,640
Who's your master?

623
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:00,640
The Kui Clan's first robber.

624
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,640
The robber.

625
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:03,640
The most powerful.

626
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:04,640
The last question.

627
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:06,640
The snow mountain is 3,000 miles away.

628
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,640
Is it the Kui Clan?

629
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,640
It's not related to the Kui Clan.

630
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:14,640
The snow mountain is 3,000 miles away.

631
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,640
It's not related to the Kui Clan.

632
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,640
What?

633
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,640
If it's not related to the Kui Clan,

634
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:22,640
who else can do this?

635
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,640
You haven't found anything else?

636
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:26,640
There's another question.

637
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:29,640
According to the theory,

638
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,640
if there's a war in a place,

639
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:34,640
the price of food will be high, right?

640
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,640
But I've checked the food price

641
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:40,640
in Chuzhou and several counties around.

642
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:43,640
I found that although there are changes,

643
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:45,640
the population is not big.

644
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:46,640
I know that.

645
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:48,640
Then,

646
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,640
I haven't found anything else for the time being.

647
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:53,640
Xu Qian, I...

648
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,640
I'm a little suspicious now.

649
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:00,640
Is it true that the snow mountain is 3,000 miles away?

650
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:03,640
I don't know how to find out.

651
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:06,640
By the way,

652
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,640
how is the arrangement?

653
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:11,640
You asked me to look for the tentacle

654
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,640
and illuminate the Kui Clan.

655
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:14,640
Now...

656
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,640
At least there are hundreds of people.

657
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:23,640
Hundreds?

658
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,640
It's nothing.

659
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:28,640
I don't know what to do.

660
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,640
I really don't know the name.

661
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:31,640
In the capital,

662
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:33,640
I'm really low on information.

663
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:35,640
When you arrive in Chuzhou,

664
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,640
you'll be a white fox.

665
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:39,640
That's too little.

666
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,640
You're too much.

667
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,640
Do you think it's serious?

668
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:45,640
You don't even have enough friends to respect.

669
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,640
Xu Qian, what are you doing?

670
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:49,640
Xu Qian.

671
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:52,640
Xu Qian.

672
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:53,640
Master,

673
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,640
what should we do now?

674
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,640
He didn't say it clearly.

675
00:36:58,640 --> 00:36:59,640
Forget it.

676
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,640
Continue to act loudly.

677
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:02,640
I'll go to the guest room.

678
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,640
Everyone,

679
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:11,640
the Kui Clan is in danger.

680
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,640
They're bullying our people.

681
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:15,640
Please take the tentacle together

682
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:17,640
and save the people.

683
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:18,640
Save the people.

684
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,640
Save the people.

685
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,640
Save the people.

686
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,640
Save the people.

687
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,640
Save the people.

688
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:42,640
Prince of Zhenbei

689
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,640
has come to the camp to attend the ceremony.

690
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:45,640
Prince of Fenghuai's order

691
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:47,640
comes to welcome the group.

692
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,640
Please lead the official to

693
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:50,640
speak out.

694
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,640
The group was killed by the Kui Clan

695
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,640
by the Yellow River Line.

696
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,640
The people were shocked.

697
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,640
Where is the princess?

698
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:04,640
In the secret department,

699
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,640
the princess was attacked by the Kui Clan.

700
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:07,640
It's unknown.

701
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:09,640
Why didn't you search the princess?

702
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:12,640
Our mission is to investigate the blood of the three thousand miles.

703
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,640
It's not to protect the princess.

704
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:19,640
Where's the Chuxia Dragon?

705
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:21,640
I need to confirm it.

706
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:22,640
He's dead.

707
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,640
I'll go check it out.

708
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:27,640
Go check it out.

709
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:46,640
Xu Ci.

710
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,640
Wait for me to get the rain.

711
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:56,640
Go.

712
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:58,640
Let me go.

713
00:38:58,640 --> 00:38:59,640
I'll let you see it today.

714
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:00,640
I'll let you see it.

715
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:02,640
You can't go.

716
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,640
Go and look for her.

717
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:05,640
I'll go check for the princess.

718
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:06,640
Master Xu said you didn't get any sleep.

719
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,640
Let me come over and take a look.

720
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:10,640
I'll take my leave.

721
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,640
Doctor, are you alright?

722
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:15,640
I'm really sorry.

723
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:16,640
Doctor, are you okay?

724
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,640
How about I find a doctor for you?

725
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,640
I'm a doctor.

726
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,640
I'm sorry.

727
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:24,720
I'm sorry.

728
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,320
That woman really loves to hit people.

729
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,320
I'm sorry.

730
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:36,240
Xu Qian.

731
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:37,800
Where are you?

732
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,560
In the capital,

733
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:42,800
Sanhuang County.

734
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:46,000
You brought me here.

735
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,320
Sanhuang?

736
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:51,160
Of course, I'm here to investigate the case.

737
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:53,120
You're here to investigate your case?

738
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,640
Why did you bring me here?

739
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,760
I left you here.

740
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,440
What can I do for you?

741
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,160
Why did you bring me here?

742
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,600
How did I know?

743
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,080
You didn't know?

744
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,520
You didn't know what you were hiding

745
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:14,000
in our city group?

746
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,200
Who secretly took the initiative?

747
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,040
I'm a public official.

748
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:20,840
I'm the chief officer of the city.

749
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:23,440
I can't be too close to you.

750
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:26,160
Xi Xi didn't change.

751
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:29,040
It seems she didn't lie.

752
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,960
She's really not a good person.

753
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,200
Xi Xi.

754
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:37,440
What are you doing?

755
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:39,560
I told you to release me as soon as possible.

756
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,160
When we arrive in Chuzhou,

757
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,760
I can hide from Prince Zhenbei

758
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:46,040
and save you from the house.

759
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:48,000
This is a fake news.

760
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:49,760
Sorry.

761
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,320
I can't release you now.

762
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,560
But I won't hurt you.

763
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:56,240
You're in a very dangerous situation.

764
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,840
I don't know why.

765
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,400
But the four of us are looking for you.

766
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,480
It's true.

767
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
I'm going to investigate the case.

768
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,360
I don't have time to look after you.

769
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,360
So,

770
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,160
I'll give you two choices.

771
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:08,160
First,

772
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:11,000
you'll be tied up and waiting for me to come back.

773
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,240
Second,

774
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,560
you can eat up all the food.

775
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,920
You'll have to wash the trees and grow trees.

776
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:18,760
You'll wait for me to come back.

777
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:20,880
Next time.

778
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:37,600
Today, today.

779
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:38,760
Do you have another?

780
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:40,040
What's the matter?

781
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,760
I think so.

782
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,640
I can imagine a powerful đã.

783
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:50,960
in my life

784
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:52,640
I have no way

785
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,120
to live in peace.

786
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:57,000
All right.

787
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,000
Got it.

788
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:58,640
Well?

789
00:41:58,760 --> 00:41:59,720
Cheers for wine.

790
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,240
We're getting drunk.

791
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,160
Outsider

792
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,120
Notですか?

793
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,500

794
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:22,440
by Xie Guo

795
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:25,900
Episode 35

796
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:39,460
This is Xu��ian from Canary Road Cemetery.

797
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:42,300
You made a outstanding painting.

798
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:44,180
Mr. Canary,

799
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:45,700
mind when I give you some tea?

800
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:52,940
You will make avail of Beam University's college entrance students' income and performance today?

801
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:54,280
It's impressive.

802
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:55,700
Where do you think it is?

803
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:01,560
There are tens of thousands of copies in each book Bathing off your head and�� amaze you!

804
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:03,660
You know,

805
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:06,580
I'll have a cover for 여�osepan to have a look at.

806
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:10,080
A simple poem...

807
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:14,580
celestial size无悔.

808
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,880
Why are you looking at me?

809
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:30,080
Are you Xu Su'an or Xu Yilu?

810
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:32,180
You recognize me?

811
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:34,800
Of course I recognize you.

812
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,400
Not only are you nature,

813
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:37,240
and you are the Heroes of Grand Le monasteries,

814
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:37,840
plus you are very humble

815
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:38,480
and a man of great looks.

816
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:41,720
A man of hua di dung.

817
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:42,560
kıphendon.

818
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:45,360
Who are you pushing me?

819
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:48,320
We can discuss.

820
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:49,280
We can talk together.

821
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:52,760
I didn't hear about it.

822
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:55,760
But I thought of something.

823
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:56,760
It's strange.

824
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:57,760
What is it?

825
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:58,760
I have been a business partner

826
00:43:58,760 --> 00:43:59,760
with a businessman

827
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:01,760
for a while.

828
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:04,760
He is a businessman in Shuzhou.

829
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:06,760
He has been in the West

830
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:08,760
and Xiaxia three lines

831
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:11,760
since he was young.

832
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:17,760
Is it too late?

833
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:20,760
Mr. Xu,

834
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:22,760
you are always looking out the window.

835
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:25,760
Aren't you a slave?

836
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:27,760
I am a new maid.

837
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:31,760
I have no regrets.

838
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,760
I am asking you.

839
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,760
When did you come here?

840
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:36,760
My lord,

841
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:39,760
the West has never been closed.

842
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,760
Why did you come here?

843
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:48,760
Today is the day of happiness.

844
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:50,760
I came to see the new-age

845
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:52,760
and open the new-age

846
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:54,760
and change the old-age.

847
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:56,760
The atmosphere in the legend.

848
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:58,760
He is a good brand.

849
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:00,760
He likes to bring home everything.

850
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:01,760
The top brand

851
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:03,760
is the brand you want.

852
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:04,760
The price you like

853
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:06,760
is all in the brand.

854
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,760
The world is so beautiful.

855
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,760
I am a new maid.

856
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:25,760
I have no regrets.

857
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:27,760
I am a new maid.

858
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,760

00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:41,760
I am a new maid.

865
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,760
I am a new maid.

866
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:45,760
I am a new maid.

867
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:47,760
I am a new maid.

868
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:49,760
The price you like

869
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:52,760
is all in the brand.

870
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:54,760
The top brand

871
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:55,760
is the brand you want.

872
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:57,760
The화 is your first dress.

873
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:00,480
Only the herald for life will be the best for me

874
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:02,180
неque� speed

875
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:02,760

876
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,760
Про של

877
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:05,760
How

878
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:07,760
to

879
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:09,760
He was

880
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:10,680
no

881
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:11,760
competing

882
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:12,760
to say fans

883
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:13,740
He is

884
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:14,760
not what it is.

885
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:15,760
Oh,

886
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:16,760
he is a good brand.

887
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:18,360
I don't want to think about the show

888
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:19,360
The whole book in my mouth

889
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:20,360
Let's get out of here

890
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:21,760
He's not too stubborn

891
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:22,960
I'm waiting for you here

892
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:23,960
The rules I want to say

893
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:25,160
I'll give you a point

894
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:26,360
Just keep it up

895
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:28,560
I'll get this big piece of shit

896
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:31,760
We're all like a step by step

897
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:35,160
We're all from the top to the bottom

898
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:37,760
We're all from the bottom to the bottom

899
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:39,560
The whole world is full of loneliness

900
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:42,560
It's just our story

901
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:45,960
This year's feeling is the end of the world

902
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:46,960
I'm a simple person

903
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:49,360
I'm feeling like I'm a plan

904
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:50,760
There's someone who can help me

905
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:53,560
I'm a little bit different

906
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:54,960
This hands-on

907
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:55,960
I'm not able to hold back

908
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:59,360
I see how many hearts there are

909
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:00,160
I'm back to the past

910
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:00,960
I'm back to the past

911
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:02,960
I'm back to the past

912
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:06,360
I'm afraid I'll have a different view

913
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:08,360
Oh

914
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:09,560
This is a trip

915
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:10,360
But I have to follow the rules

916
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:11,160
My chessboard

917
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:11,960
This is a piece of shit

918
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:13,760
But I'm not afraid of losing it

919
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:14,360
But I regret it

920
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:15,360
What's the point of it

921
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:16,760
There's a lot of lies and lies

922
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:18,760
I can't bear to see the end

923
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:19,960
I'll die for the day

924
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:21,960
I'll be there no matter what

925
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:23,960
Just keep it up

926
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:25,960
I'm a simple person

927
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:26,960
I'm a simple person

928
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:28,960
I'm a little bit different

929
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:30,960
This hands-on

930
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:32,960
I'm a little bit different

931
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:35,960
This hands-on

932
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:38,960
I'm a simple person

933
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:40,960
I'm a simple person

934
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,960
I'm a simple person

935
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,960
I'm a simple person

936
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:45,960
My chess board

937
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:47,960
This hands-on

938
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:48,960
I'm a simple person

939
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:49,960
I'm a simple person

940
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:51,760
I'm living a difficult life

941
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:53,960
I'm just performing this

942
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:55,080
I'm lonely

943
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:56,600
I'm lonely

944
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:58,160
My chessboard

945
00:47:58,160 --> 00:47:59,360
This is a piece of shit

946
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:02,160
But I'm not afraid of losing it

947
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:02,760
I'm not afraid of losing it

948
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,160
I'm a simple person

949
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:06,760
I'm a simple person

950
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:07,760
I'm a simple person

951
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:09,000
I'm a simple person

952
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:09,960
I'm so confused

953
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:10,960
Although I'm just a player

954
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:12,560
Because I'm a standard player
