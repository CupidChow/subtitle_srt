1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,400
Plus, we'd like you to watch D reacting to the next episode.

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,860
Zizang!

3
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:28,880
Xiaorou!

4
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,940
Are you uncomfortable that it is hard to destroy them?

5
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,880
Well...

6
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:39,860
As the situation is,

7
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:43,100
Shen Xiaoxi

8
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:45,440
is struggling to poz this dispositive after death firt you.

9
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,240
We only can catch this guy if he does not die,

10
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,240
but I don't really residue him if I can catch him.

11
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,900
I would definitely Hailu kill Zmu yam.

12
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,200
Right.

13
00:02:59,240 --> 00:02:59,940
Right, Zmu yam.

14
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I said it was that arm.

15
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Arm?

16
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
As far as I know,

17
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
that arm is not hers.

18
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
It's a powerful model.

19
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I'm very cautious.

20
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Cheng Qianhua,

21
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
you look very sad.

22
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I peeked at you before she left.

23
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Can you turn around and talk?

24
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You used to be not like this.

25
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
No.

26
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
If I refuse,

27
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I, Yang Qianhua,

28
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
do whatever I want to do.

29
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I don't care about anyone's opinion.

30
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I've looked closely at Wei Yuan and Mr. Jian Zheng.

31
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Didn't you find out?

32
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
What do you mean?

33
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
They stand on the platform,

34
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
and stand against you.

35
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
One sitting on the gossip platform,

36
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
and the other against us.

37
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
And we all think that Wei Yuan

38
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
and Mr. Jian Zheng have a high-ranking background.

39
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
All right, all right, all right.

40
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Let's talk about the business.

41
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
According to the situation that we've already had,

42
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
that arm must be the seal under Sang Bo.

43
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
That's right.

44
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
The one who was running around was Hu Yipao.

45
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
As long as we can catch him,

46
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
we can know the whereabouts of Princess Ping'an.

47
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Sang Bo case happened only a few days ago.

48
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
You guys have been investigating the case

49
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
with someone else.

50
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
No.

51
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
How come I didn't hear

52
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
the body of my private spy

53
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
mention this case with me?

54
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Didn't you find them to help you?

55
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
You guys have been working on the case.

56
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
But you don't have such a great ability.

57
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
We haven't even touched the gold螺 yet.

58
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
The case is just a common thing.

59
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Common thing?

60
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Which one?

61
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
You should have heard of him.

62
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
He's very famous in the private spy.

63
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
His name is Xu Qi'an.

64
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Xu Qi'an?

65
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I heard of this guy when I just came back from the private spy.

66
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
He's a genius.

67
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
But I didn't expect that

68
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Sang Bo case was also him.

69
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
He's a genius.

70
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
He's a genius.

71
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
What's going on with that demon?

72
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I don't know.

73
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I'm not interested in these strange things.

74
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I'm not interested in these strange things either.

75
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Listen up.

76
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Today's battle,

77
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I, Yang Qianhuan, will lead the first attack.

78
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Okay.

79
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
The death of a dead person is getting worse.

80
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Why don't you find another doctor for him?

81
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Don't worry about him.

82
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
He's dead.

83
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Siqing.

84
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Feiскиеم.

85
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Professor Xu.

86
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I was always the one who suffered heavy yid.

87
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
But this time, I'm the one who suffer severe yid.

88
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I'll...

89
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,240
be safe розing it again.

90
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,880
Are you not Powers?

91
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,220
I'm quick

92
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,300
if you bad

93
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:33,220
Smith

94
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:34,980
You're a gangster

95
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:47,340
Set up the ladder

96
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:51,980
It's me

97
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:54,460
This way

98
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I was six years old and went to Qinglong Hall.

99
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I've been following you.

100
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
You taught me to be young.

101
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
You taught me to be a doctor.

102
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
You took care of my consciousness.

103
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
You raised me up.

104
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
You brought me to the school.

105
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
You convinced me.

106
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Don't say that.

107
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Erqing.

108
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
There's something I want to ask you.

109
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,280
I beg you

110
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:54,980
Please

111
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,820
Please

112
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:05,320
Obedience

113
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,140
Obedience

114
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,720
Go to bed.

115
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,120
OK, your bedgedon.

116
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:25,960
Come!

117
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,000
Hurry up…

118
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,480
Go…

119
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,040
My fat boss is also a各街line agent.

120
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,760
Two hours off.

121
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,960
It has been our day off,

122
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,700
Go!

123
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,160
Why are you laughing?

124
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,520
I'm not.

125
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,800
No, you're not.

126
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,760
I was about to fight.

127
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,440
Where are you now?

128
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,520
The tricks 1920s

129
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:19,080
The situation is very bad.

130
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,280
The light is out.

131
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,400
I went to help you

132
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,280
and helped you

133
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,320
to get rid of the trouble.

134
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,920
You're just afraid of death.

135
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:27,680
Absolutely not.

136
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,440
All right.

137
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,200
There was a meeting

138
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,080
at the Ministry of War last night.

139
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,880
Of course, the few doctors

140
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,480
were hurt by the meeting.

141
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,520
Last night,

142
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,480
the servants of the Ministry of War

143
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,240
and the Ministry of Revenue

144
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,080
set up a bureau.

145
00:10:45,400 --> 00:11:08,640
Three någon-ce γ-1

146
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:12,840
and two cheese-warriors.

147
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,960
What is this mess?

148
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,480
Is it related to Tianyu?

149
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,280
This is

150
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,160
a very secret matter.

151
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,880
I don't know

152
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,640
what exactly is going on.

153
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,320
The only thing I know

154
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,560
is that Henghui was seriously injured.

155
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,320
She is still in the city.

156
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,640
I have already told His Majesty

157
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,120
to search the whole city.

158
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:41,680
You

159
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,000
continue to investigate.

160
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,360
Yes.

161
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,920
Where is the Ministry of War?

162
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,520
The name of the body is

163
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,200
in the Qifu.

164
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,840
I will go and investigate.

165
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,120
Wait.

166
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,560
The second-ranked officer of the Minister of War

167
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,760
needs to be careful.

168
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,760
The four-ranked officer can't

169
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,440
use the forgotten tree.

170
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,680
This is the rule.

171
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:04,760
Okay.

172
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:06,800
Yes.

173
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,160
But

174
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,320
you can bring the tree.

175
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:13,800
What?

176
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:15,920
I understand.

177
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,280
Then I will ask Miss Caiwei

178
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,160
to accompany me.

179
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:20,920
No need.

180
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,560
A stronger tree

181
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,480
has been waiting for you

182
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,000
for the whole night in the Yamen.

183
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,600
Wait for me?

184
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:51,160
PLAN

185
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,000
Should we sticky the matter

186
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,600
to snacks to add brightness to the ezals?

187
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,160
But it is silly.

188
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:12,560
Speaking of pocket

189
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:16,840
Yang Qian Huan

190
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,840
I think you must know me

191
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:27,840
Huan Qian Yang

192
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,840
It's Yang Qian Huan

193
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,840
My senior

194
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:33,840
The only master in the Fengjing

195
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,840
Four-piece master

196
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,840
Yang Shishou

197
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,840
The famous master of the Jiuyang

198
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,840
Jiuyang

199
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,840
Yang Shishou

200
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:56,840
Why are you a backer?

201
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,840
Back to the main voice

202
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,840
The risk is high

203
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,840
What do you think?

204
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:07,840
It turns out to be a second-in-law

205
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:29,840
I am such a good�

206
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,860
the

207
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,480
Spider Yang brother

208
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,960
you a ownership

209
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:52,240
what did you call me

210
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,300
This is good

211
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,240
this is

212
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:00,980
My faulty

213
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:02,160
Retrict

214
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,940
Yesterday I helped everyone

215
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:06,660
behind the collapse of a Kowtown

216
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,600
Friendly

217
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:12,400
The three Jin Luo are not his opponents.

218
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,800
Fortunately, I was the one who fought.

219
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,800
I was a man of nature.

220
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,200
I was a killer.

221
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,200
I was a man of nature.

222
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,800
I was the leader of Yang Qian Huan.

223
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,600
I have written the details of the night.

224
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:31,800
Take your time.

225
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,200
It's time to report to the world.

226
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,200
I'm done.

227
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,200
Go.

228
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,200
Yang.

229
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,600
Why don't you directly look for Wei Gong?

230
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,800
I'm just a little Tong Ru.

231
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,200
I asked him.

232
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,000
I don't know how to think about this.

233
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,000
He said you are the chief officer of Sangbo.

234
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,800
You have to do everything you can to find out.

235
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,200
Wei Gong.

236
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I'm not a man of nature.

237
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,600
I'm not a man of nature.

238
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,200
I'm just a man of nature.

239
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:11,200
Wei Gong is really a man of nature.

240
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,400
Yang.

241
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,200
I'll report these to the world after I finish this case.

242
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,600
Good.

243
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,400
I won't wait for you here.

244
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,400
Go ahead.

245
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,400
I'm going to sleep.

246
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,000
Yang.

247
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:29,800
Don't go.

248
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,200
Anything else?

249
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,000
Nothing.

250
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,400
I just suddenly thought of a poem.

251
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,600
It's about the harmony between Yang and me.

252
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,600
The first day and night,

253
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,000
the new morning.

254
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,600
I'm the one in the world.

255
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,200
This is...

256
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,200
An air of fear.

257
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:02,400
They know I'm useless.

258
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:06,200
So delicious.

259
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,000
I used to say this so early,

260
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,400
but I never had someone combine with youil well.

261
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,600
I just got to see Yang today.

262
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:17,000
You had better be posso most proud of me.

263
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:21,400
I made the poem for you when I see you.

264
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,160
Where is Shisan?

265
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,120
You have really reached its啟unun?

266
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,920
Since they tell you the truth,

267
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,720
but actually I was only worthless.

268
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,000
Tell me outside.

269
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,160
Just let the ஒ-Yue Jinxing City

270
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:34,900
13 Yes, Photon

271
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,200
Tan Rights

272
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,760
All Shisan Ahh trains

273
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,160
6 Yeah, Photon

274
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,120
Shisan Ahh trains

275
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,520
S***禎 Cass

276
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,040
4piano

277
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,400
Shisan is a good teacher.

278
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,400
But I feel like I'm missing something.

279
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,400
You're missing something in the face of the hero.

280
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,400
By the way, Brother Yang,

281
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:06,400
since you're a great bowler,

282
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,400
do you mind adding another one?

283
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,400
You have a way to speed up.

284
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,400
That's it.

285
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,400
I'm going to the Ministry of War to make a deal.

286
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,400
I'm missing a great bowler like you.

287
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,400
Please help me.

288
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,400
You're so good at fighting.

289
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:29,400
It's hard to get away from our private world.

290
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,400
Forget it.

291
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,400
I'm in a good mood today.

292
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,400
I'll go with you.

293
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,400
Okay. I'll go get the horse.

294
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,400
Please wait for my order.

295
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,400
No need.

296
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:43,400
Double-eyed, low-heeled, and two-hearted.

297
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:53,400
Double-eyed, low-heeled, and two-hearted.

298
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,400
The first day of the guard,

299
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,400
the new city.

300
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,400
The world is full of me.

301
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,400
This is the new year.

302
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,400
I found it.

303
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,400
I finally feel it.

304
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,400
Brother Yang,

305
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,400
this is...

306
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,400
Where did you get the thief?

307
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,400
How dare you break into the Ministry of War's mansion?

308
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,400
I'm the Chief Minister of the Three Boats.

309
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,400
Come here.

310
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,400
Go again.

311
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,400
Go again.

312
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,400
Go on.

313
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,400
Brother Yang, you...

314
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,400
Don't worry.

315
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,400
I just transferred them to a quiet place.

316
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,400
Go.

317
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,400
How dare you!

318
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,400
Who's in this place?

319
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,400
Who are you?

320
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,400
You dare to break into the Ministry of War's mansion?

321
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,400
I'm the Chief Minister of the Three Boats.

322
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,400
I'll go.

323
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,400
You can't go.

324
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,400
Go?

325
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,400
What do you mean?

326
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,400
Go to Li Wuliang.

327
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,400
Hello, everyone.

328
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,400
The new year's good luck officer,

329
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,400
Wang He Di.

330
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,400
Today, we're going to see

331
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,400
the best man in the world,

332
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,400
Xu Qi'an.

333
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,400
He's here.

334
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,400
He's got a lot of knowledge.

335
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,400
I'll let you be a little boy.

336
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,400
He's talented and smart.

337
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,400
You know what you like.

338
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,400
Yes.

339
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,400
He's talented.

340
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,400
He's got a lot of luck.

341
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,400
I'm sorry to see you again.

342
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,400
What's more important is that

343
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,400
I'm so handsome.

344
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,400
Who said that?

345
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,400
I said he's a good person.

346
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,400
He's a good person.

347
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,400
Is it also a luck?

348
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,400
It's all a luck.

349
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,400
He's the one who's got the most luck.

350
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,400
He's got a lot of luck.

351
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,400
He's got a lot of luck.

352
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,400
He's got a lot of luck.

353
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,400
He's got a lot of luck.

354
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,400
Xu Qi'an is out of the town.

355
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,400
What should we do?

356
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,400
What?

357
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,400
His good luck officer,

358
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,400
Tian Mao,

359
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,400
is working with us.

360
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,400
He's a good guy.

361
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,400
He's got a lot of good value.

362
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,400
No wonder he's so good at using his skills.

363
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,400
I'll go pick him up.

364
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,400
There are many people who came here before.

365
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,400
Please excuse me, Mr. Jiang.

366
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,400
Mr. Qi, you're young.

367
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,400
I heard that

368
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,400
the case of Fang Duan has been released.

369
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,400
And it's also out of the ordinary.

370
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,400
The truth of the case.

371
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,400
Mr. Xiang, it's too much.

372
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,400
No need to ask.

373
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,400
I'm asking what you want to ask.

374
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,400
I came here to understand the case.

375
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,400
I'm afraid that the case will be solved soon.

376
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,400
Mr. Xu, please be funny.

377
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:28,400
You're investigating the case.

378
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,400
You know the case more.

379
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,400
Do I have any clues in my mansion?

380
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,400
Mr. Yang,

381
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,400
what's the truth in the case?

382
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,400
Nothing.

383
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,400
Mr. Yang,

384
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,400
what's the truth

385
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,400
in the case?

386
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,400
Nothing.

387
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,400
This old fox.

388
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,400
If there's nothing else,

389
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,400
I'll go back to the temple.

390
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,400
Okay.

391
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,400
Thank you, Mr. Yang.

392
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,400
Okay.

393
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,400
I'll leave now.

394
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,400
Mr. Yang, are you okay?

395
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,400
I'm fine.

396
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,400
I'm fine.

397
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,400
I found the way.

398
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,400
What's the situation?

399
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,400
You came late.

400
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,400
He's gone to the Jile.

401
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,400
He's dead?

402
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,400
Between me and the dead,

403
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,400
he chose to be the descendant

404
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:56,400
and was killed by the demon.

405
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,400
Brother Ruo.

406
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,400
Brother Ruo.

407
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,400
Brother Ruo.

408
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,400
Brother Ruo.

409
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,400
Brother Ruo.

410
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,400
I'll kill you.

411
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,400
I'll kill you.

412
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,400
The hell is the hell.

413
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,400
The blood is on the king.

414
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,400
You're just so pitiful.

415
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,400
What?

416
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,400
You don't want to be the descendant?

417
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,400
No.

418
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,400
Are you saying that I'm the descendant?

419
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,400
No.

420
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,400
I'll kill you.

421
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,400
You told me that

422
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,400
as long as I can help you,

423
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,400
the world can kill me.

424
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,400
Why?

425
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,400
He can't kill me.

426
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,400
He's the descendant.

427
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:20,400
He's the descendant of the world.

428
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,400
Then,

429
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,400
where's Pingyang?

430
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,400
Pingyang.

431
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,400
Pingyang.

432
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,400
I don't know.

433
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,400
I don't know.

434
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,400
The world can kill me.

435
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,400
I'm the descendant of the world.

436
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,400
He's the descendant.

437
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,400
Brother Ruo.

438
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,400
Didn't you always want to be

439
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,400
a little bit late?

440
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,400
What happened?

441
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,400
Sometimes,

442
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,400
I don't know what to do.

443
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,400
I'll stay here

444
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,400
and wait for you.

445
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,400
You stay here,

446
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,400
but there's something to say.

447
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,400
He's the descendant of the world.

448
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,400
He's gone,

449
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,400
but he didn't give up on revenge.

450
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,400
He gave me the burden.

451
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:11,400
I want to tell you a story.

452
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,400
It happened a year ago.

453
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:20,400
But it's not the story of Henghui and Princess Pingyang.

454
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,400
A year ago,

455
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,400
Qinglongtang

456
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,400
met Princess Pingyang in Henghui.

457
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,400
On Henghui's body,

458
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,400
Pingyang

459
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,400
saw the freedom he had been longing for.

460
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,400
He was forced to run away from the engagement.

461
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:40,400
They decided to leave the capital as soon as possible.

462
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,400
For the success,

463
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,400
they need a weapon

464
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,400
that can cover the air

465
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,400
to avoid the pursuit of the Four Heavens.

466
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,400
Besides,

467
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,400
they also need a weapon

468
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,400
that can help them prepare for the new escort

469
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,400
and the path to leave the capital.

470
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,400
For this,

471
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,400
Princess Pingyang

472
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,400
found a reliable friend.

473
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,400
Princess Pingyang

474
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,400
found a reliable friend.

475
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,400
Pingyuan Bo Di Zi.

476
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,400
Pingyuan Bo and Xun Gui Group

477
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,400
have already been promoted.

478
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,400
After he got the son,

479
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,400
he colluded with the soldier of the Bish

480
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,400
Zhang Feng.

481
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,400
He ordered to send Princess Pingyang

482
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,400
to leave the capital.

483
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,400
But he was not able to

484
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,400
meet the plan of the Prince of Yu.

485
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,400
What is Princess Pingyang's status now?

486
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,400
Pingyuan Bo has a new identity.

487
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,400
Princess Pingyang, who is single,

488
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,400
doesn't know the complicated things

489
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,400
and doesn't know the people's attitude.

490
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,400
A girl who is not fit for the world,

491
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,400
a wandering man who is busy with work,

492
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:11,400
when they decide to leave together,

493
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,400
they are already determined.

494
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,400
People are as evil as snakes.

495
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,400
After leaving the capital,

496
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,400
they reveal the truth

497
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,400
and report to Princess Pingyang in the map.

498
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,400
Pingyang and Xun Gui

499
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,400
fought against each other.

500
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,400
One person was killed.

501
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:33,400
One person was killed.

502
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,400
Princess Pingyang is dead?

503
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,400
They...

504
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,400
Except Pingyuan Bo's son,

505
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,400
who else?

506
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,400
Another evil man

507
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,400
is the death of the soldier, Zhang Feng.

508
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,400
Zhang Yifan.

509
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,400
Princess Pingyang.

510
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,400
Zhang Xun.

511
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,400
Zihui.

512
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,400
Zihui.

513
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,400
Since Henghui died a year ago,

514
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,400
why is he here now?

515
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,400
People die in front of the light.

516
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,400
They can't be revived.

517
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,400
They are dead.

518
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,400
They are dead.

519
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,400
They are dead.

520
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,400
They are dead.

521
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,400
They are dead.

522
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,400
They are dead.

523
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,400
They can't be revived.

524
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,400
Someone sealed Henghui's primordial spirit

525
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,400
in the flesh

526
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,400
and made a promise

527
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,400
that he would not die.

528
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,400
In these years,

529
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,400
he has been the victim of his life.

530
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,400
He is the victim of Princess Pingyang's blood.

531
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,400
Who saved him?

532
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,400
What is the purpose behind it?

533
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,400
It's not known yet.

534
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,400
In Henghui's memory,

535
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,400
he is very vague about this.

536
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,400
He only knows that the person

537
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,400
used his body

538
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,400
to make the demon's hand

539
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,400
a demon.

540
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,400
The demon's hand

541
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,400
is the secret method of the Godless.

542
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,400
It seems that Henghui is just a weapon.

543
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,400
The person behind it

544
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,400
used his body to make the demon's hand

545
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,400
a demon's hand.

546
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,400
It's not right.

547
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,400
Did you say that you have evidence?

548
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,400
If you don't believe me,

549
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,400
bring the body back

550
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,400
and let the five of you have a test.

551
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,400
Be gentle.

552
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,400
Find him.

553
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,400
I will go.

554
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,400
Eunuch Wei, Princess Lianan is here.

555
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,400
Xu Qian.

556
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,400
You accompanied Princess Lianan

557
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,400
to the Night City Hall.

558
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,400
Yes.

559
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,400
Princess.

560
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,400
Princess.

561
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,400
Princess.

562
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,400
Princess.

563
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,400
Princess.

564
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,400
We are not sure

565
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,400
whether this is the right choice.

566
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,400
Maybe he is

567
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,400
the one who is chasing the Princess of the Yangtze River.

568
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,400
Princess.

569
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,400
Princess.

570
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,400
Princess.

571

Lianan.

572
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,400
I don't want to live in the world

573
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,400
with a poor spirit.

574
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,400
I can't take it.

575
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,400
I can't believe it.

576
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,400
Wait for me.

577
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,400

578
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,400
I can't believe it.

579
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,400
I want to go to the compositional hall.

580
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,660

00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,400
I want to go there and go inside.

584
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,400
I have to go there.

585
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,400

587
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:38,360
In addition,

00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,880
Consort Yu also went to the way of the Tianshi Palace.

00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,160

593
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,320
The court has caused this change.

594
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,240
Are you going to...

595
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:51,760

Ka kill used to spook

633
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,400
me on every meal.

634
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,240
He took everything away

635
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,240
from me back then.

636
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:57,880
I sometimes

637
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,840
spooked everything.

638
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,600
I couldn't eat since the dawn.

639
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,600
It's so sweet.

640
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,600
It's really, really sweet.

641
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,600
Try it.

642
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,600
It's just the first 16 years of this year.

643
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,600
You're so stubborn.

644
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:19,600
You're not the one who likes to be stubborn.

645
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,600
Why are you like this?

646
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,600
I'm not like this.

647
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,600

649
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,600
I'm not like this.

650
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:34,600
From now on, I'll be with you.

651
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:38,600

00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:42,600

653
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,600
Let's go home.

654

655
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,600
Who did this?

656
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:07,600
I'm the son of the Peking Yuan.

657
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,600

I'm the son of the Zhang Yi.

659
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,600
He was insulted?

660
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:20,600
He used military service to kill me.

661
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:23,600
He used military service to kill me.

662
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,600

How's the Sangbo case?

667
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,600
Why isn't Wei Yuan here?

668
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:37,600

669
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,600

670
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:40,600
