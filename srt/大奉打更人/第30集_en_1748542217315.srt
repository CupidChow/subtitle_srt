I'm afraid I'm going to be a little bit late

I'm curious what I'm talking about

I'll get this big piece of bowl

102
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,840
What's going on?

103
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,840

What's going on?

108
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,840
Are you okay, uncle?

109
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,840
I'm fine.

110
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,840
You're young.

111
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,840
You're not feeling well?

112
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,840
You're too tired.

113
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,840
You're not like me.

114
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,840
I'm in a hurry.

115
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,840
I can't even stand up.

116
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,840
Isn't Xu's son really iron-fired?

117
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,840
Stop it.

118
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,840
What's wrong, little Doudie?

119
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:20,840
I'm so sleepy.

120
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,840
I'm not sleepy.

121
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,840
Who's there?

122
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,840
Okay, Doudie.

123
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,840
Stop looking stupid.

124
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,840
I'll change my clothes to your father.

125
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,840
Protect your father.

126
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,840
Go, go, go.

127
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,840
Doudie, go back and sleep.

128
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,840
Go back and sleep.

129
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,840
I don't know what you're doing.

130
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,840
It's been years since I last held a baby, right?

131
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,840
I can't do it.

132
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,840
I can't do it.

133
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,840
It's been years since I was a hero.

134
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,840
I think back then,

135
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:54,840
Uncle Er was also a iron-fired soldier.

136
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,840
He was a good man.

137
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,840
He was a man of the word.

138
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,840
He killed his own daughter.

139
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,840
He didn't even have a head.

140
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,840
Yes, yes, yes.

141
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,840
That's what he should be like.

142
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,840
My uncle was a double-dead.

143
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,840
He was a double-dead.

144
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,840
Now he's a real man.

145
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,840
You're a fool.

146
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,840
You know the effect.

147
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,840
No, no, no.

148
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:15,840
It's wrong.

149
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,840
It's wrong.

150
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,840
It's wrong.

151
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,840
You want to say it again?

152
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,840
It's wrong.

153
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,840
You really don't want to say it?

154
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,840
What's wrong?

155
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,840
This is Xu Jianjiao.

156
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,840
He's yours here.

157
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,840
Who is it?

158
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,280
It seems that

159
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:41,840
he's the old comrade that

160
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,840
he killed by his mother.

161
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:50,840
== Good name ==

162
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,400
to the hell lake.

163
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,160
You know,

164
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,600
few of these are available.

165
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:36,160
I also want to weekly motаз game online.

166
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:49,720
Well done.

167
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:50,260
Of course.

168
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:52,860
It's easy.

169
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:56,460
You will come to me eventually.

170
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,780
How can I remember what happened

171
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:02,980
during the Thirteenth Heaven Sword supposed to happen?

172
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,260
That Zither was even better

173
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,820
than that of others.

174
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,740
Ling gegangen passed away,

175
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:19,020
the eldest brother recalled his wounds.

176
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:21,980
It seems that you will bring Qi back to Tianyu.

177
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:24,180
Please be honest.

178
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:32,500
If I don't let you go,

179
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:36,460
Jianzhuang, if you don't,

180
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:40,220
then we will fight against Da Feng.

181
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:44,140
Although we are not familiar with you in Da Feng,

182
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:47,820
I am sure that if we fight,

183
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:51,460
Da Feng will be destroyed.

184
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:55,700
Jianzhuang, think carefully.

185
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:58,380
Do you want to kill one person

186
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:00,940
or kill one city?

187
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:12,740
I won't let you go.

188
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:21,580
If you wanna kill us,

189
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:23,340
just kill him.

190
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:30,020
We won't be changed.

191
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:38,580
げ than you.

192
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:46,780
Spare your life.

193
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:48,780
I'm afraid that

194
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:50,780
you can't let go of the order.

195
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:52,780
You want to take away the sacred book,

196
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:54,780
but you don't know that

197
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:58,780
the sacred book is the best way to keep it in the Great Feng.

198
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:00,780
How can I say that?

199
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:03,780
The speed of the sacred book is not normal.

200
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:08,780
There is one more thing in his body.

201
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:11,780
If the sacred book is removed,

202
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:13,780
I'm afraid that

203
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:19,780
you won't see him again.

204
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:30,780
As the saying goes,

205
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:35,780
the thing that was lost 20 years ago.

206
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:39,780
Even so,

207
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:42,780
that is also the cage that you have been waiting for.

208
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:45,780
You can ask me to bring the sacred book.

209
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:50,780
I'm sure that you won't be able to

210
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:53,780
wake me up with a white tooth.

211
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:57,780
Why don't we make a bet?

212
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:59,780
What bet?

213
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:04,780
Let's bet on the fate of the Great Feng.

214
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:08,780
The future of the sacred book.

215
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:14,780
Did you hear that?

216
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:16,780
This is the sacred book of the Heavenly Jade Embroidery.

217
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:18,780
I didn't expect that the Great Feng and the Heavenly Jade

218
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:20,780
have been together for decades.

219
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:22,780
I'm afraid that they are going to get into trouble again.

220
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:24,780
It's too arrogant to be in the capital.

221
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:26,780
The Great Feng is still not out of control.

222
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:28,780
He broke out of this spell.

223
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,780
He killed the Great Feng and made a big mistake.

224
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:32,780
That's right.

225
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:36,780
Your Majesty, don't be so upset.

226
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:38,780
The Great Feng of the Heavenly Jade

227
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:41,780
will definitely break this barrier.

228
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:48,780
I've always trusted the Heavenly Court.

229
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:52,780
But the Heavenly Jade is prepared for this.

230
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:57,780
The sacred book is special and it's not a war book.

231
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:03,780
If the Great Feng doesn't even have the right to guard the capital,

232
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:08,780
what will happen to the Great Feng?

233
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:16,780
Your Majesty, the Heavenly Sword of the Four Heavens

234
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:18,780
is in danger.

235
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:19,780
Let him in.

236
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:20,780
Yes.

237
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:30,780
Greetings, Your Majesty.

238
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:41,780
When will the Sword of the Sword be ready?

239
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:47,780
Your Majesty, if he breaks out of the spell himself,

240
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:50,780
he might not be able to stand up and stand up.

241
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:54,780
That way, he can raise the Great Feng.

242
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:03,780
Then this person must be Sun Xuan Ji.

243
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:08,780
Your Majesty, the second brother has been out for 20 years.

244
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:10,780
He's been practicing in the seclusion.

245
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:15,780
That means Yang Qian is changed.

246
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:19,780
Yang is not in the seclusion yesterday.

247
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:22,780
What? He's in the seclusion?

248
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:25,780
He's in the seclusion every day?

249
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:31,780
What should we do?

250
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:34,780
You and Song Qing are not good at fighting.

251
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:35,780
You can't do it.

252
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:37,780
Who else is there in the Heavenly Sword of the Four Heavens?

253
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:40,780
Your Majesty, please be quiet.

254
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:42,780
I want to ask Your Majesty about someone.

255
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:45,780
He's the one who's fighting with the Sword of the Four Heavens

256
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:47,780
and the Stone of the Heavenly Jade.

257
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:52,780
Who's the one who's fighting with me?

258
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:53,780
It's strange.

259
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:56,780
The Sword of the Four Heavens is just out of danger.

260
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:58,780
The person in the spell is there.

261
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:00,780
It's not like the Sword of the Four Heavens

262
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:02,780
can't handle the Heavenly Jade.

263
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:04,780
That's right.

264
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:06,780
If the Sword of the Four Heavens can't handle it,

265
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:09,780
it must be the people in the capital.

266
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:13,780
I'm afraid I'll be disappointed

267
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:15,780
if I make a promise with the Heavenly Mother.

268
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:21,780
It's none of your business.

269
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:25,780
Brother, take it.

270
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:26,780
It's too much.

271
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:32,780
What do you think?

272
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:34,780
Forget it.

273
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:38,780
Don't move the elevator.

274
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:39,780
Look at me.

275
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:40,780
Smile, everyone.

276
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:53,780
Please take a look.

277
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:56,780
It's okay.

278
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:57,780
It's done.

279
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:58,780
It's good.

280
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,780
It's as deep as the body.

281
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:01,780
Especially the body.

282
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:02,780
It's so deep.

283
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:05,780
It looks like a peach blossom.

284
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:07,780
It looks like...

285
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:08,780
It looks like...

286
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:10,780
I don't look like it.

287
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:12,780
I'm 18 years old.

288
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:14,780
You're right.

289
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:15,780
You're so bad.

290
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:18,780
Why don't we draw a few more?

291
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:20,780
I can't.

292
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:21,780
Come on.

293
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:23,780
Sir, draw a few more for us.

294
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:24,780
Okay.

295
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:25,780
You can sit down.

296
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:27,780
Okay.

297
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:28,780
Don't move.

298
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:29,780
Okay.

299
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:38,780
Sir, please.

300
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:40,780
I'll go over there.

301
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:44,780
Sir, please wait a minute.

302
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:46,780
Sir, please...

303
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:03,780
Why are you here?

304
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:04,780
I want to see you.

305
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,980
This Bjorn is here,

306
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:11,920
but it's not working.

307
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:15,780
Sir,すごい.

And you can't

311
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:22,780
do so far.

312
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:25,780
There's one mistake that you can't do.

313
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:27,780
No, it's not.

314
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:29,280
He didn't talk it through either.

315
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,780
It's no use.

316
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:32,780
You shouldn't have said that.

317
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:33,780
If I aren't careful,

318
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:34,880
I might amicable.

We had a WeChat

00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,920
I think we need some time.

338
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,640
I told you earlier.

339
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:12,000
There's been a long time.

340
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,040
Chu Yuan Zhen and I have a fight.

341
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,760
But I don't want it to be now.

342
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,040
I understand.

343
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,560
The case is over.

344
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,720
I'll send him out

345
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,960
when the two days are over.

346
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,240
Good.

347
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,640
You can't take it now.

348
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,800
Do you have any orders?

349
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:33,640
Master.

350
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,240
Someone came to the palace.

351
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,640
His Majesty wants to see you.

352
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:40,600
You'll come with him to the palace later.

353
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,440
His Majesty wants to see me?

354
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,800
His Majesty shouldn't discuss

355
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,280
the color of the sky and clouds at this moment.

356
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,280
Exactly.

357
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,480
His Majesty wants you to

358
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,520
kick him out.

359
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,040
Kick him out?

Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

363
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,400
Why?

364
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,240
His Majesty asked me to kick him out.

365
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,800
If I don't go to fight the people,

366
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,400
I'll be in trouble.

367
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,680
If I go to the camp,

368
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,560
how can I fight the people?

369
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,840
It's hard to live.

370
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,320
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

371
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,160
Director Zhao.

372
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,840
The technologist has stated

373
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,340
that the words

374
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:40,040
will be replaced by now.

375
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,280
He is not even going to admit it.

376
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,360
He will be Didi getting out of the trouble,

377
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:51,240
and the pose will be changed to the later number.

378
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,160
What?

379
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,640
It's the first day.

380
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:56,040
Your Majesty hasouchhe and setting the принc editor

381
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,480
in theoretically.

382
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,280
Thank you.

383
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:03,640
You trust Sintian Sword.

384
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:09,320
While D Fenumm flirted with people in the estate with me on you.

385
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,120
Using Sintian Sword.

386
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,220
Sintian Sword is good

387
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:18,560
when I was young and easy on you.

388
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:24,320
Could it have

389
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:27,220
been that you knew pushing me out like that?

390
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,000
Even if the government chose you,

391
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,920
you should have won the battle.

392
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:38,880
I'm not asking you for your opinion,

393
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,840
but to tell you

394
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:45,280
that this is the face of the whole of Guanhu.

395
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,360
You must do everything

396
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,840
to get rid of the dead.

397
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:57,600
Don't worry.

398
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,480
Today,

399
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,320
we must have a key culprit.

400
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,960
What if he provoked us?

401
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,960
Please drop out.

402
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,720
I'll take my leave.

403
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,120
Really?

404
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,840
The dean eschewed Mass Prime Minister's explosion

405
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:20,460
and stayed with the�

406
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,240
in Yundom.

407
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,220
an innocent move in peace.

408
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,380
But Shen Ke'er

409
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:57,460
I wasn't even even thinking about it.

410
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,880
to injure some fur in my body

411
00:25:59,160 --> 00:25:59,520
that day?

412
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:00,480
That is why he wants me

413
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,560
to give up Hisania now.

414
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,120
Minister Xu.

415
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,200
You walked the wrong way.

416
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,440
Jing Tian.

417
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:34,600
Your Highness.

418
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:37,160
Did you hear what I said?

419
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:42,200
I understand what you mean.

420
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,360
But the way you wrote it

421
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,560
is so hard to understand.

422
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:47,960
Your Highness.

423
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,680
Can you help me

424
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,080
to make it clear to His Majesty

425
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,720
and make him choose a new one?

426
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,360
I'm sure he's determined.

427
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,360
I'm afraid

428
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,280
there's no place to return it.

429
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:04,280
I won't let you make it difficult for me.

430
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,520
I don't know why the government chose me.

431
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:10,040
If I lose the Fight Law,

432
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,880
His Majesty will punish me.

433
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,480
It seems that I can't afford to

434
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,200
let you off for the time.

435
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,360
Don't worry.

436
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:18,920
Even if you don't lose,

437
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,720
His Majesty will punish you.

438
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,840
His Majesty doesn't like you.

439
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:25,280
It's not a day or two.

440
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,280
But you don't have to worry.

441
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,200
What do you mean?

442
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:36,080
Tian Yu is a man of the word.

443
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,600
He lost the Fight Law.

444
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,360
He lost the Fight Law.

445
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:42,360
The government is known for letting you marry him.

446
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,200
If you don't have any confidence,

447
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,800
he won't say anything to His Majesty.

448
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,880
Although I know

449
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,200
you're in trouble now,

450
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:54,400
the government ispace will have their purpose.

451
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,000
I don't think so.

452
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,000
The reason for electding a government is

453
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,640
because I'm a第三-rank clique.

454
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,440
Your dressings are in vain.

455
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:11,920
I have myomon'sיד.

456
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,120
My guess was that

457
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,160
the government together in my dispute

458
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,560
is Medicare from the Prime Minister.

459
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,720
and not his identity.

460
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,760
I don't know what exactly he is like.

461
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,920
But this old thing

462
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,760
is getting closer to the sky.

463
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,720
He is in a secret situation.

464
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,520
No one knows what he is thinking.

465
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:36,560
Do you know?

466
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,200
Well...

467
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:39,920
To be honest,

468
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,720
even Wei Gongning doesn't understand.

469
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,720
How can I be so bold?

470
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:45,360
Alright.

471
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:46,760
It's meaningless.

472
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,920
Only the sword and the knife

473
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,200
are in the golden season.

474
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:51,240
Look.

475
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:54,160
There are eight statues of Tianyu.

476
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,320
This is the reference

477
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,720
of the other statues.

478
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:00,960
The statue of Jingang Numu

479
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,040
is the first one to appear.

480
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,120
It doesn't have any records.

481
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:08,120
But it's not a miracle.

482
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,160
Every statue has a formation.

483
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,720
There will be a war if it's a formation.

484
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,480
What you have to do is to break the formation.

485
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,280
Don't use your strength.

486
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,400
Do you know?

487
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:21,600
Yes.

488
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:23,600
Alright.

489
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,480
Take these statues

490
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,040
and study them.

491
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,840
As for the big and small things

492
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:41,720
I found in the Academy,

493
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,560
there is no clear explanation.

494
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:44,640
Come on.

495
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,640
It's dangerous.

496
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:46,960
Well...

497
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,160
Don't worry.

498
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:53,840
Since Wei Gongning said

499
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,960
he would help me

500
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,680
if he had pushed me forward,

501
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,800
he would help me to make my back.

502
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,240
Besides,

503
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,640
Wei Gongning is so loyal to me.

504
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:04,480
He won't let me get close to him.

505
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,800
There won't be any danger.

506
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,960
You should have told me earlier.

507
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:16,720
If you were to defend it so nice and straightforward,

508
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:21,920
all the statues are equals.

509
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:35,080
Ying incongol dual sup Mond

510
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:39,280
don't think that you are

511
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,080
aeda.

512
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,080
You don't what I was thinking.

513
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:45,680
Come on!

514
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,300
Among all those�

515
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,600
I almost could haven'T

516
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,000
I haven'T

517
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:51,660
I

518
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:52,040
I don't know

519
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:52,560
I

520
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,220
don't know

521
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:53,600
you

522
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,480
Great

523
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:57,020
Teacher

524
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,020
Grandpa

525
00:30:58,060 --> 00:30:58,700
You

526
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,640
Are you

527
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:02,760
Att razón

528
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:04,940
I guess

529
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:08,860
I would like to

530
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:09,740
Well

531
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,260
Well

532
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,860
well

533
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,160
So

534
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:17,160
I'll buy you new clothes.

535
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,160
So cute.

536
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,440
I'm afraid that

537
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,240
all the expensive things in the city

538
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,440
will be closed.

539
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,120
Especially,

540
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,840
mom, I'll go with you.

541
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,240
Xinxing, you go with me.

542
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:31,760
Okay.

543
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:32,440
You go with me.

544
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,440
Let's go together.

545
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,160
Ningning, what are you doing?

546
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,440
I'm going to practice the knife technique.

547
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,240
Practice the knife technique.

548
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,400
If you need my help,

549
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,160
aibe an example.

550
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,000
Chocolate

551
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:18,680
cile

552
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:34,520

554
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,360
Lu Qi

555
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:40,600
It turns out he is under myína

556
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,520
Hua Si Li

557
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,160
How did you find me?

558
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,160
It's nothing.

559
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,160
If you want to go, please call

560
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:48,160
the number of the training.

561
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,160
Sister Can Wei.

562
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,160
I'm done.

563
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,160
Take it for me.

564
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,160
Okay.

565
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,160
This way.

566
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:02,160
I'm afraid you're going to make a mistake this time.

567
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,160
Teacher, Xu Qianqiu wants to see you.

568
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,160
I've never missed the right time

569
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:13,160
to see you.

570
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,160
Xu Qianqiu, where are you going?

571
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,160
Xu Qianqiu.

572
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,160
It seems that Teacher is still very clever.

573
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,160
After the ceremony,

574
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,160
he will be promoted to the position of minister.

575
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,160
Of course.

576
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:55,160
But with his confidence,

577
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:57,160
Teacher is not afraid that

578
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,160
he doesn't like the path you chose for him?

579
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:02,160
Tomorrow is the day to come.

580
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:05,160
What about the gold move?

581
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:07,160
There is a wine in the gold move.

582
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:09,160
The gold move is the most.

583
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:13,160
If the minister knows the little god said something,

584
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:16,160
I will ask him for nothing.

585
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:19,160
If the minister doesn't know,

586
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:22,160
I will wait for the same thing to be reported.

587
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:25,160
What should I do?

588
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:29,160
The whole street has been searched.

589
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:31,160
I haven't been searched yet.

590
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:32,160
What should I do?

591
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:35,160
I remember it's near here.

592
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:38,160
If it wasn't for you last time,

593
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:40,160
I wouldn't have gone to the old house in Xu Xia.

594
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:42,160
If it wasn't for me,

595
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:44,160
you wouldn't have seen Minister Xu.

596
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:45,160
You...

597
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:48,160
Princess.

598
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,160
It's really you.

599
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:52,160
Why are you here?

600
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:03,160
Princess, these are...

601
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:06,160
I heard that you want to represent the Great Fengyin Town.

602
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,160
As your master,

603
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:11,160
I will be very happy to help you.

604
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,160
Thank you for your help.

605
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,160
How is it?

606
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:21,160
This battle...

607
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,160
is very exciting.

608
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:30,160
There are three battles in the Great Fengyin Town.

609
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,160
I am just a little silver-grey.

610
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,160
I am not prepared.

611
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,160
So what do you think?

612
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,160
I believe you.

613
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,160
You are Xu Qian'an.

614
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,160
The youngest silver-grey.

615
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:50,160
The most excellent guest in the Lin'an.

616
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:53,160
The silver-grey tea is very expensive.

617
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:56,160
It's a rare sight to see.

618
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,160
Is there anyone who is more suitable

619
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:01,160
to be the Great Fengyin?

620
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,160
So,

621
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:10,160
you should relax your mind and be well-being.

622
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,160
Think about it.

623
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:13,160
If you want to represent the Great Fengyin,

624
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:15,160
what kind of reward do you want?

625
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,160
Reward?

626
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,160
Reward?

627
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:20,160
Princess,

628
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:23,160
do you think this is a little early?

629
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,160
Just a thought.

630
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,160
You never thought about it.

631
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,160
I tell you,

632
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:33,160
I am really very confident in my thoughts.

633
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:37,160
If I can really be lucky,

634
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:43,160
I would like to ask Your Majesty to give me a death penalty.

635
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:49,160
You are so stupid.

636
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:53,160
This death penalty is only a death penalty for you.

637
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,160
Think about it.

638
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:57,160
If someone wants to deal with you,

639
00:36:57,160 --> 00:37:01,160
this death penalty is just a death penalty.

640
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,160
It's not like you.

641
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:05,160
I have been through a lot.

642
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:07,160
I am in the royal family.

643
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:09,160
I am more of a private officer.

644
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:12,160
So, what do you mean?

645
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:15,160
What you need is not a death penalty.

646
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:17,160
It's a status.

647
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,160
Think about it.

648
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,160
If you have a status,

649
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,160
you will have a pulse.

650
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,160
If you have a pulse,

651
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:26,160
you can be a more noble person.

652
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,160
When you are in trouble,

653
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:31,160
these people will be your lifeguards.

654
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:35,160
And what if...

655
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,160
I mean what if...

656
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:46,160
if you are lucky to be a royal family,

657
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:51,160
and you have a ungrateful noble lady who is like you.

658
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,160
I mean,

659
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,160
if you are a royal family,

660
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,160
no one can threaten you.

661
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:11,160
You will have a ungrateful noble lady.

662
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:13,160
You will be a noble lady.

663
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,160
You will have a status.

664
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:19,160
You will have a status.

665
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,160
You will have a status.

666
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,160
Do you understand?

667
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,160
I understand.

668
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:28,160
I still understand your concern.

669
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,160
Really?

670
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,160
I understand.

671
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:55,160
Am I talking too much?

672
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,160
It's not enough to be honest.

673
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,160
It's a little bit.

674
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:02,160
After all, you are noble.

675
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,160
You can visit us personally.

676
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,160
You are a great honor to Lord Xu.

677
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,160
Even so,

678
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,160
if I don't say it out loud,

679
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:13,160
Xu Qian's brain will understand.

680
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,160
That's true.

681
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:18,160
Do you think

682
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,160
he can win Tian Ying?

683
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:22,160
Don't worry, princess.

684
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,160
Since Lord Xu understands what you mean,

685
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,160
he will definitely win the throne.

686
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,160
Yes.

687
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,160
The Four Heavens Sword

688
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:42,160
will fight against the Celestial Emperor.

689
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:44,160
Everyone, go to the告訴 room

690
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,160
and see the yellow net.

691
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,160
The Celestial Emperor

692
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,160
will fight against the Four Heavens Sword.

693
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,160
Xu Qian will represent the Great Phoenix,

694
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,160
and will fight against the Prime Minister.

695
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,160
After the two sides

696
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:57,160
and the Grand Square in Guanxiang House,

697
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:58,160
they will hold a battle.

698
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,160
At that time,

699
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,160
the people in the city

700
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,160
can be the crown prince.

701
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,160
That's great.

702
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:05,160
Finally, someone is out.

703
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,160
The battle is over.

704
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,160
Everyone, listen to me.

705
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,160
After three days,

706
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:11,160
the Four Heavens Sword will fight against the Celestial Emperor.

707
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,160
The Silver Tower will win Xu Qian.

708
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,160
The battle will be over.

709
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,160
This is a big change.

710
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,160
After that,

711
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,160
we will go to see it together.

712
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,160
Yes, we will go to see it together.

713
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,160
After three days.

714
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:23,160
Why did you choose the Silver Tower?

715
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:24,160
The Silver Tower is great.

716
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,160
It has the power of one-on-one.

717
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:27,160
It destroyed the Golden Dragon Ball

718
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,160
called the Godless.

719
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,160
I heard that Xu Yan is going to see the Prime Minister.

720
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,160
At that time, he will be able to

721
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,160
solve the problem of the Heavenly Jade.

722
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:34,160
Okay.

723
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,160
Xiao'er.

724
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,160
Kegui.

725
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:50,160
Old rules.

726
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,160
One lake.

727
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,160
Half a lake, half a fire.

728
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,160
Well...

729
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:00,160
Sir, this way, please.

730
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:05,160
Sir, I'm really sorry.

731
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:07,160
Look, this small store is full.

732
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:09,160
You and this customer

733
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:10,160
are sitting on the same table.

734
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,160
He ordered the same thing as you.

735
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:13,160
Half a lake, half a fire.

736
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:14,160
Half a lake, half a fire.

737
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,160
Can you make a whole for him?

738
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,160
Yes.

739
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:19,160
This is the brother.

740
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:27,160
Why didn't you take a photo of him?

741
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,160
He didn't want me to do it personally.

742
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:33,160
What kind of confession is that?

743
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,160
You two know each other.

744
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,160
That's too far away.

745
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,160
Gu Ge, your wine is ready.

746
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:42,160
Please enjoy it.

747
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,160
What are you eating and drinking?

748
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,160
Someone is watching the statue.

749
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:46,160
Why don't you go and have a look?

750
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,160
The statue?

751
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:48,160
It's a good thing.

752
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,160
Go and have a look.

753
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,160
Xu Qing'an.

754
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,160
I'm the third son.

755
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,160
Mr. Xu?

756
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:59,160
Is that Mr. Xu?

757
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:01,160
I'm Yang Qianhuan.

758
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:04,160
I'm the first one to get the new one.

759
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:05,160
Why are you so stubborn?

760
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:07,160
Cut it out.

761
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:09,160
The statue is behind you.

762
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:10,160
I know.

763
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,160
Brother Yang, you're so blind.

764
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,160
You should go back to the lord.

765
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:15,160
You forgot that you were in the fire.

766
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:16,160
You forgot that you were in the fire.

767
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,160
I'm the third son.

768
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,160
You're in the fire.

769
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,160
You're blind.

770
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:20,160
Bastard.

771
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:24,160
I'm just going to stop Yang Ming.

772
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:25,160
Since Mr. Zheng said that,

773
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:27,160
I don't want to interfere with this.

774
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:28,160
Go back and tell him.

775
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:30,160
Today, I, Yang Qianhuan,

776
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,160
will definitely

777
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:32,160
charge the sky.

778
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,160
Yang Ming is the best.

779
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,160
Haoran Cangming.

780
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:36,160
Everything is going well.

781
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,160
Break the Wan Jun.

782
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:44,160
Haoran Cangming.

783
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,160
Everything is going well.

784
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:46,160
Let's go.

785
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:47,160
Haoran Cangming, retreat.

786
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:53,160
Brother Yang.

787
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:17,160
Go back and tell me your succes this time.

788
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:18,160
Well...

789
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:19,160
As you can see,

790
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:22,160
she's my realchi.

791
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:25,160
But Shan Meng yet she's not in the fore.

792
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:26,160
I wasn't right.

793
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:28,160
It doesn't matter how.

794
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:29,160
I helped to encourage.

795
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:30,160
It wasn't a small matter.

796
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:31,160
Just leave me alone.

797
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:32,160
You can go back now.

798
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:33,160
Come on.

799
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:34,160
Why didn't go back up?

800
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:35,160
Don't keep following me.

801
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:38,160
Let's go.

802
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:39,160
We're not going to backwards from this situation.

803
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:40,160
Go back.

804
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,160
Let's see.

805
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:44,160
I'm going back back to the god.

806
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:46,160
Is it a treasure case in the early years?

807
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:50,160
Come on, Dagenrong.

808
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,160
What's a big deal?

809
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:54,160
Look, this is a complicated answer.

810
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:56,160
If I want to go to the beach one day,

811
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:59,160
I'm afraid I'll have to change four horses in a day.

812
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:01,160
I only need one horse.

813
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:02,160
What?

814
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:03,160
The champion's body.

815
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:04,160
The champion's body?

816
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:05,160
The ability to walk is thousand years.

817
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:06,160
The ability to walk is thousand years.

818
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:08,160
I'm not afraid of you going any further.

819
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:10,160
Unfortunately, sometimes,

820
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:11,160
it's not the way to go.

821
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:13,160
It's the human heart.

822
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:14,160
Look.

823
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:17,160
Why is the curse so serious?

824
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:19,160
Miss Wang is here.

825
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:20,160
Look at her.

826
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:23,160
The further the road is, the more the wave is coming.

827
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,160
Hurry up and persuade her.

828
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:26,160
My mouth is almost dry.

829
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:28,160
Isn't this the typical beauty of the beauty of the eyes?

830
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:30,160
One doesn't talk, one is called a devil.

831
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:33,160
Why don't you find a surprise?

832
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:35,160
The ability to express the mind of the curse

833
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:37,160
can also make Miss Wang face the curse.

834
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:39,160
The miracle of the curse.

835
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:41,160
Brother Song, why are you talking about

836
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:42,160
running around in the cold?

837
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:45,160
Ningye, do you remember my human horse experiment?

838
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:48,160
I finally developed a reliable

839
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:51,160
original new weapon, the duck-doll car.

840
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:52,160
No wonder.

841
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:54,160
The first line of the first line of the sense of melon is

842
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:56,160
that the road is long and the road is long.

843
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:57,160
Song Li wants to be high-end

844
00:44:57,160 --> 00:44:59,160
and the duck-doll car can be satisfied.

845
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:03,160
The long wind will be broken.

846
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:05,160
When you have time, you must be worth it

847
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:07,160
to watch the wind with the duck-doll.

848
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:15,160
One, two, three.

849
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:40,160
The weather is full of dust and dust.

850
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:55,980
The wind is gentle and

851
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:12,160
I'm not afraid of you.

852
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:14,160
I'm not afraid of you.

853
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:16,160
I'm not afraid of you.

854
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:18,160
I'm not afraid of you.

855
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:20,160
I'm not afraid of you.

856
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:22,160
I'm not afraid of you.

857
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:24,160
I'm not afraid of you.

858
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:26,160
I'm not afraid of you.

859
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:28,160
I'm not afraid of you.

860
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:30,160
I'm not afraid of you.

861
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:32,160
I'm not afraid of you.

862
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:34,160
I'm not afraid of you.

863
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:36,160
I'm not afraid of you.

864
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:38,160
I'm not afraid of you.

865
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:40,160
I'm no longer afraid of you first.

866
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:42,160
I don't know whether you are curious about it.

867
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:46,160
I'm your partner.

868
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:48,000
I have every Ji I can bother to tell you

869
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,220
I don't know you every Ji I can bother to tell you

870
00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:55,160
What is thisじゃあ I monger

871
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:57,720
Do not regret

872
00:46:57,720 --> 00:46:59,720
As long as you are alone inside

873
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:04,720
At night I'm an old man

874
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:07,220
Set you aside

875
00:47:07,220 --> 00:47:10,220
I'm not afraid of the wind

876
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:13,720
Who is he?

877
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:15,720
I don't like the adults

878
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:17,720
I'm a man with a bad taste

879
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:19,720
I'm a man with a bad taste

880
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:21,720
I'm a man with a bad taste

881
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:23,720
I'm a man with a bad taste

882
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:25,720
I'm a man with a bad taste

883
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:27,720
Who is he?

884
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:29,720
I don't like the adults

885
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:33,720
Who is he?

886
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:35,720
I don't like the adults

887
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:37,620
Here comes that dance

888
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:39,820
Only I'm happy

889
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:41,720
This Anchor is alive

890
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:44,520
I pat itIf I walk

891
00:47:44,620 --> 00:47:45,520
Then the Reagan is dead

892
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:47,620
The boy came to theFormite

893
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:49,820
What is he?

894
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:51,220
He doesn't look good

895
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:53,520
Here comes that dance

896
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:55,620
Only I'm happy

897
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:57,620
This Anchor is alive

898
00:47:58,420 --> 00:47:59,820
I pat itIf I walk

899
00:48:00,620 --> 00:48:01,940
Then the IoT is lost

900
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:04,020
The burden is like clouds
