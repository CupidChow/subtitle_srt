Episode 1

7
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Today is the 25th.

8
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
It's the day that Princess Royal went to the temple to study.

9
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I'll be at the temple first.

10
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I don't need to go to the temple anymore.

11
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Princess!

12
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Princess!

13
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
This way!

14
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
This way!

15
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Princess!

16
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Princess!

17
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
What's wrong?

18
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Tell me when you're done with the bath.

19
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Xu Qian!

20
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
She went to the temple to study.

21
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
What?

22
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Today is the day that she went to the temple to study.

23
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
If she meets her, I'll be in trouble.

24
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I come here every time.

25
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
It's so busy.

26
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Brother Song.

27
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
If it's like this again,

28
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
we can meet in another place.

29
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I'm usually very low-key.

30
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It has nothing to do with you.

31
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Princess Royal is coming.

32
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
That's good.

33
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I can meet Princess Royal later.

34
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I'll be there any time.

35
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
You know Princess Royal?

36
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Yes.

37
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I have some information.

38
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I've learned a lot about the mirror.

39
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
There's a mysterious and mysterious town inside.

40
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Especially this broken jade stone.

41
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
According to what I see,

42
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
it's the handkerchief of the emperor.

43
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
The emperor?

44
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
The famous emperor of Hehe.

45
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
He disappeared a dozen years ago.

46
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Let me go!

47
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Let me go!

48
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Let me go!

49
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Let me go!

50
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Let me go!

51
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Let me go!

52
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Go!

53
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Hua Qing.

54
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Hua Qing.

55
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I have something important to tell you.

56
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Tell me.

57
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
The sky is clear.

58
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Let's go to the lake.

59
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Hua Qing.

60
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Well.

61
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
It's the third day of the celebration.

62
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Our government office is ready.

63
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Let's go back to the palace.

64
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I dreamed about it last night.

65
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
It's a bomb.

66
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Let's not go in.

67
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
You're here again?

68
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Yes.

69
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Let's take her to the private room.

70
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Let the doctor take a good look.

71
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Yes.

72
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
You can't go in.

73
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
You can't go in.

74
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Xu Xian is in the private room.

75
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Princess Lin'an,

76
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
it seems hard.

77
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Come again.

78
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Help.

79
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I won't go in.

80
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I'll go to the private room.

81
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I'll go to the private room.

82
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I'll go to the private room.

83
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I won't go.

84
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
The mirror is yours.

85
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I can't recognize it.

86
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
So,

87
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I can't know

88
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
the vertical angle.

89
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Once you know it,

90
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
you can go in.

91
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
The mirror is right.

92
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,040
10 away, 8 safe.

93
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:42,240
1, 2, 4...

94
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,220
3?

95
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,060
3 sen External trouble PART?

96
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,360
sey

97
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,520
Answer me.

98
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,360
You're not Jin Lian.

99
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,920
Where is Jin Lian?

100
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,520
You're alive and dead.

101
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,480
How did you get this mirror?

102
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,360
You're from the Heavenly Emperor's Assembly.

103
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,640
Heavenly Emperor's Assembly?

104
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,560
Jin Lian?

105
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,560
I think he's the old man who gave me the mirror.

106
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,280
The ninth brother,

107
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,280
called him the senior brother.

108
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,760
Is it the same person?

109
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,720
I...

110
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,960
I'm not from the Heavenly Emperor's Assembly.

111
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,880
This mirror was given to me by an old man.

112
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,920
How do you prove that you're not from the Heavenly Emperor's Assembly?

113
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,600
You're alive and dead.

114
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,760
I...

115
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,760
I'm just a small tribe.

116
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,840
I'm the younger brother.

117
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,440
A few days ago,

118
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,880
I received the letter of request from Brother Jin Lian.

119
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,640
I knew he was in the capital of Dafeng.

120
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,360
Only after he was in the capital

121
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,720
could he avoid the persecution of the Heavenly Emperor's Assembly.

122
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,720
I was hurt.

123
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,560
But I was in the capital

124
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,280
and lost my brother's contact.

125
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,840
I think he was in a very critical situation.

126
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,080
So he gave you the mirror

127
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,000
to avoid the persecution of the Heavenly Emperor's Assembly.

128
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,160
What do you mean?

129
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,720
Why did you abandon the jade mirror?

130
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,680
Could it be that the people in the Heavenly Emperor's Assembly

131
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,640
could lock the location of the mirror?

132
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,760
Exactly.

133
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,520
Brother Jin Lian gave it to you.

134
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,320
He wanted you to make a profit for him.

135
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,560
You want to face the Heavenly Emperor's Assembly's

136
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,560
disaster and tiger storm?

137
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,160
You mean you gave me the jade?

138
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,360
I'm just a little fast learner.

139
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,400
No.

140
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,880
I'm just a small person.

141
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:34,840
I think

142
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,480
you don't need to take this soul-saving pill.

143
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,720
Could you return the mirror to me?

144
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,320
I will.

145
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,440
Okay. How?

146
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,360
I'll be in the capital.

147
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,400
I can teach you at any time.

148
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,120
What do you want?

149
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,360
You don't need to be polite.

150
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,120
The little jade turtle master

151
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,880
is responsible for my marriage.

152
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:02,520
But your brother told me that

153
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,320
the jade mirror was made of heaven and earth.

154
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,040
It was specially sold to me at the price of 500 taels of gold.

155
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,120
I don't want to be a rich man.

156
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,560
It's just that the treasure will be returned to the owner.

157
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,200
The gold must also be returned to the owner.

158
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,200
You mean you'll exchange it for the price?

159
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,880
Okay.

160
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,120
The marriage is a deal.

161
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,080
I'll be in the capital.

162
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,320
I'll be in the capital.

163
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,080
I'll be in the palace.

164
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,320
No.

165
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,560
I'm getting old.

166
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,120
You promised to be so bold.

167
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,800
It's worth a thousand taels.

168
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,960
No. 3.

169
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,760
Don't believe in No. 9.

170
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,160
Don't turn back.

171
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,600
Don't turn back.

172
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,240
Don't turn back.

173
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:57,720
Brother Yan.

174
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,320
I have an important report for you.

175
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,160
What?

176
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,160
You're so ugly today.

177
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:03,840
I know.

178
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,320
No.

179
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,120
Why don't you just be a little bit more selfish?

180
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,520
That's not what you think.

181
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:12,800
Me?

182
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,760
What's wrong with me?

183
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,720
Don't talk nonsense.

184
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,840
There's something to talk about.

185
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,320
Just a moment.

186
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,000
There's a skydiving list.

187
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,760
The boss is still working.

188
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,720
I think it's a good idea.

189
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,960
The boss is still working.

190
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,240
Only he is my boss.

191
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,880

Okay.

193
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,960
Then...

194
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,840
I think it's fine.

195
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:46,660
You're too stubborn.

196
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:49,060
I should be careful.

197
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:50,420
Yes.

Do I marry to the shumед ninja?

211
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:35,840

Hurry, just find Yanyu.

230
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:42,900
Don't find Yanyu.

231
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,600
I almost got to get her by Sitenjian,.

232
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,320
Yes.

233
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,040
I and Huaiqing

234
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,520
were at the gate of the temple.

235
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,720
Finally,

236
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,760
they took her to the temple.

237
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:56,880
You don't know.

238
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,480
I saw her all the time.

239
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,760
She called the doctor

240
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,960
to poison me.

241
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,800
Princess Huaiqing

242
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,200
asked the doctor for you?

243
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,080
She was trying to revenge me.

244
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,520
I went there

245
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,440
and was tortured by the doctors for hours.

246
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,160
I was wrong.

247
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,040
You've worked hard.

248
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,480
Luckily,

249
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,080
I didn't find out

250
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,400
about Huaiqing.

251
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,800
You didn't find out?

252
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,160
Xu Xianjing is not in the temple.

253
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,080
She's not in the temple?

254
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,800
Then you must be busy.

255
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:44,960
Take care.

256
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,520
An old monster.

257
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,800
Leave him alone.

258
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:50,520
Yes.

259
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,120
Are you definitelyremoving from up to the earth?

260
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,000
It's more than 500 gratification today.

261
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,080
You have the right to honor and honor yourself

262
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:30,080
to hold a certain position within a reasonable agreement.

263
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,720
It's not bad to logged up

264
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,600
with your identity.

265
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,720
Get it all form Forever Aya Temple.

266
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,280
If so,

267
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,920
why haven't you made an appointment?

268
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,760
It's about the Emperor's Hundred between us

269
00:14:49,020 --> 00:15:14,920
and we're highly

270
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:15,760
I don't understand.

271
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,880
I'm actually afraid of death.

272
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,080
Jiang.

273
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,920
I wanted to go to the transaction of the Gui Yue House.

274
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,840
Who knows who you are?

275
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,720
Why do you say no.9?

276
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,720
You are from the Heavenly Emperor's Assembly?

277
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:44,560
Yes.

278
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,200
Then why do you say no.9 is a lunatic?

279
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,800
No.9 is a person who is a subordinate.

280
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,520
They are a group of crazy people who are fierce and greedy.

281
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,560
If you believe in them,

282
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,160
you will have the right to believe them.

283
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,600
But no.9 said you are crazy.

284
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,280
This...

285
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,360
He lied to you.

286
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,920
How do I know that you didn't lie to me?

287
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:05,440
Moreover,

288
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,440
why didn't you come out to confront him

289
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,800
when No.9 was here?

290
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:11,680
No.3 Xiao Jing was banned by the subordinate.

291
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,000
He cut off the tradition between us.

292
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,960
I also passed the law

293
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,080
to contact you when he was careless.

294
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,360
I don't have much time.

295
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,680
You don't have to be so stupid.

296
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,520
As long as you give back the jade seal

297
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,840
to the Heavenly Emperor's Assembly,

298
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,920
I will make sure to protect your life.

299
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,520
What do you mean?

300
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,040
To protect my life?

301
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,400
I've said that

302
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,400
No.9 is a person who is fierce and greedy.

303
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,040
You know his behavior.

304
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,640
He will not keep your life.

305
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,840
I won't hand him over to the subordinate.

306
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:42,920
What can he do to me?

307
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,440
The subordinate can

308
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,040
lock your position

309
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,840
through the jade seal.

310
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,600
Then I will throw the jade seal away.

311
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,440
You...

312
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,640
The seal is still in the jade seal.

313
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,480
Even if you throw it away,

314
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,000
the jade seal will still be in your pocket.

315
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,200
So you think of us.

316
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
People who fight with the subordinate will be interested.

317
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,440
You can find the Wei Palace's guards to deal with them.

318
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,600
On the one hand,

319
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,120
you can avoid the trouble of life.

320
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,200
On the other hand,

321
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,280
you can promote your princesses.

322
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,080
Your doing is very good.

323
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:19,120
I only work in a reasonable area.

324
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,560
I only want a good job.

325
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:37,880
Yang Ye,

326
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,440
I'm here.

327
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:40,960
Go and have a look

328
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,840

329
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:44,600
Yes.

330
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,240
Master,

331
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,240
I'm glad to see you.

332
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,760
You brought an enemy back.

I'm fine.

345
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,640
If I have to,

00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:46,640
then don't blame me for being impolite.

351
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,640
Get out.

352

You're always the mother of four.

367

Don't be so hard on yourself.

This is much more comfortable.

373

00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,640
Why don't you return them?

375
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:06,640

00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,640
Come back.

381
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,640
Come back.

382
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,640
Come back.

383
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,640
Wei Gong.

384
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,640
These two are my colleagues at Chunfeng Hall.

385
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,640
Song Tingfeng.

386
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,640
Tong Lou.

387
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,640
Tong Lou.

388
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,640
Zhong Guangxiao.

389
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,640
You.

390
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,640
See Wei Gong.

391
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,640
You two are here.

392
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,640
No need.

393
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,640
I'll take my leave.

394
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,640
Go to sleep.

395
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,640
Yes.

396
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,640
Go to sleep.

397
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,640
Yes.

398
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,640
Your Excellency.

399
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,640
The tea I made

400
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:22,640
was just made by the tea maker.

401
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,640
Today, I'd like to give you a piece of advice.

402
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:29,640
What's the meaning of this tea?

403
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:32,640
It's made by the great Goura.

404
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,640
It has a good shape.

405
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,640
It's smooth.

406
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,640
It's easy to peel off the skin.

407
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,640
It can be used for the chestnut.

408
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:42,640
It's a good idea.

409
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,640
It's ready.

410
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,640
Put the tea pot on top.

411
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,640
And you can have tea.

412
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,640
This machine

413
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,640
is a way to make the tea.

414
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,640
What's the use of that?

415
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,640
Don't you need to pour the tea?

416
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,640
Yes.

417
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,640
Wei Gong.

418
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,640
Please take your leave.

419
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,640
Since then,

420
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,640
even if you're in the office,

421
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,640
you can have tea at any time.

422
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,640
It's not convenient to do that.

423
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,640
This is the mountain road.

424
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,640
The mountain is the best.

425
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,640
The mountain is the best.

426
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,640
The big hole is the small hole.

427
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:31,640
� blush

428
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,640
The roadside is where you click the button.

429
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,640
Chicken n小芋

430
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,640
So� butter

431
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,640
It's not a dark, sour smell.

432
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,640
Do you want to eat it?

433
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,640
No.

434
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,640
I'm originally from Zhaoshan.

435
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,640
I just got here.

436
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,640
It's a good idea.

437
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,640
Please look after me.

438
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,640
The first name?

439
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,640
There are some coincidences in it.

440
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,640
I'll give it a name.

441
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,640
Dong Fu Cha Tai.

442
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,640
Good.

443
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,640
The Emperor's High-Empress

444
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,640
The Emperor's High-Empress

445
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,640
The Emperor's High-Empress

446
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,640
is indeed not a good match.

447
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,640
The tea is fragrant and strong.

448
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,640
It's delicate and sweet.

449
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:10,640
The marinated fish is obviously not as sweet as the dried fish.

450
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,640
Eunuch Wei,

451
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,640
where did you get this tea from?

452
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,640
Compared to the other days,

453
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,640
I brought these today.

454
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,640
If you like it,

455
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,640
I'll let Xiaorou

456
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,640
put some on you.

457
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,640
Thank you, Eunuch Wei.

458
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,640
How about this?

459
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,640
This tea is made from the cup.

460
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,640
You're a great cook.

461
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,640
Your work is not a waste.

462
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,640
Your work is not a waste.

463
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,640
But in the heart of the real tea-seeker,

464
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,640
like a treasured hero,

465
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,640
the jade sword is busy.

466
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,640
This tea is made from the tea of Eunuch Wei.

467
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,640
It's fragrant and strong.

468
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,640
Mingya, Xiaorou.

469
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,640
Go and get some tea.

470
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,640
Yes, Eunuch Wei.

471
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,640
You're hurt.

472
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,640
Eunuch Wei, I'm back.

473
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,640
I was hurt by the Yin God.

474
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,640
It's not serious.

475
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,640
But I'm incompetent.

476
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,640
I'm not a criminal.

477
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:26,640
The Yin God is not a criminal.

478
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,640
I blame you.

479
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,640
The person who contacted you first

480
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,640
is indeed the person from the emperor.

481
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,640
He's been so devoted to you.

482
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,640
But I'm back.

483
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,640
You won't be in danger for the time being.

484
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,640
Thank you for your kindness.

485
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,640
During the time,

486
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,640
you should take care of the secret weapon

487
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,640
of the person who attacked you.

488
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,640
Yes.

489
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,640
Since you're the main person,

490
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,640
you should take care of it first.

491
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,640
Thank you, Eunuch Wei.

492
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,640
Eunuch Wei,

493
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,640
the person who was hurt by the Yin God

494
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,640
was also attacked by the Yin God.

495
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,640
You should search the secret weapon.

496
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,640
No need.

497
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:36,640
Someone will find him.

498
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:54,640
Yi Shen,

499
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,640
when I took the poison,

500
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:02,640
you scared me.

501
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,640
Go!

502
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,640
Brother,

503
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,640
I just add some kind of poison.

504
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,840
I'm not a big brother.

505
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:22,840
I'm a big brother.

506
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:25,440
Brother Xu, you finally came out.

507
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,040
You two are both bigger than me.

508
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,440
It's not appropriate to be called that.

509
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,040
No.

510
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,440
I'm just a big brother.

511
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,240
It's not a big deal.

512
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:35,840
We can only be a little bit more talented.

513
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:36,440
Don't worry.

514
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,440
We will do our best.

515
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,240
I'll do my best to help you.

516
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,240
You can keep it to yourself.

517
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,440
I'll do my best.

518
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,440
It's easy.

519
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,440
Xu Qiyan!

520
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,840
Why did you come in so late?

521
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:46,640
It's very simple.

522
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,640
Xu Qiyan!

523
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:52,840
When will you come?

524
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,840
No one will know me.

525
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,040
Well...

526
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,240
Ding Yan...

527
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:06,040
You came out of the building?

528
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,440
I...

529
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,640
How can I?

530
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,640
I didn't.

531
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,640
I just...

532
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,040
I was in the way.

533
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,240
I was in a daze.

534
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,840
I was in a hair salon.

535
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,240
You...

536
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,040
You're so funny.

537
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,840
You're in a hair salon?

538
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,640
Not only in a hair salon,

539
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,040
but also in a hair salon.

540
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,040
You're also talking about the unlovable.

541
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,040
Mr. Nan Gong.

542
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,640
Li Yuchun,

543
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,840
you're a subordinate of Ji Ling.

544
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,640
You've been here for a few days.

545
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:42,040
You've become a good friend of mine.

546
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,640
How about this?

547
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,240
You can open the Chunfeng Hall

548
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,640
to the Haoqi House directly.

549
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,240
It's not like we're just

550
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,240
a group of people

551
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,240
who are just like you.

552
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,640
Isn't that a bit too much?

553
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,040
Keep working.

554
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:59,040
Don't care about the system of people.

555
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,640
Don't care about Chunfeng Hall.

556
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,240
As long as we appreciate you,

557
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,240
what can we do about you?

558
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,240
Yang.

559
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:14,240
Yang Yang.

560
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,440
He...

561
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:22,840
He...

562
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,640
You should be able to hear it.

563
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,640
He did it on purpose.

564
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,240
Good.

565
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,240
Let's go.

566
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,640
What did Wei Gong give?

567
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,240
Wei Gong gave it to him.

568
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:48,840
Kneel.

569
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,240
The whole house is not well organized.

570
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,240
No one is going home today.

571
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,240
Brother Jing, come.

572
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,240
Don't be so tired.

573
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,240
You sit down.

574
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,240
Sit down.

575
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,240
Let's sit down.

576
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,240
What are you doing?

577
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,240
This way.

578
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,240
You're so noisy.

579
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,240
Relax.

580
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,240
Be quiet.

581
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,240
How much did you eat?

582
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,240
How much did you eat?

583
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,240
How much did you eat?

584
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,240
How much did you eat?

585
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,240
How much did you eat?

586
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,240
How much did you eat?

587
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,240
How much did you eat?

588
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,240
What is this?

589
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,240
Nothing.

590
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,240
Gao Zi.

591
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,240
Jing.

592
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:49,240
I can't wait any longer.

593
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,240
Princess.

594
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,240
I can't do it.

595
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,240
Look at everyone.

596
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:01,240
They can't do it.

597
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,240
Princess.

598
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,240
I can't do it.

599
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,240
I think

600
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,240
my chest

601
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,240
is like a crack in the dust.

602
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,240
The chest is like a sign.

603
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,240
What is the point of being a soul?

604
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,240
No.

605
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,240
Princess.

606
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,240
In these days,

607
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:25,240
in order to prevent Xu Qian from finding you,

608
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:27,240
we have no time to rest.

609
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:29,240
We have no time to rest.

610
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,240
We have to do everything we can.

611
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,240
You want to drink.

612
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,240
But we have

613
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:38,240
already been tired of praying for the rest of the world.

614
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:43,240
I know you are tired.

615
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:45,240
I am tired too.

616
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,240
These days, we pretend to be happy.

617
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,240
I saw him today.

618
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,240
I think he is so cute.

619
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,240
But I thought it was early.

620
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,240
Now I give up.

621
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,240
No.

622
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,240
Come on.

623
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,240
Come on.

624
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,240
Princess.

625
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,240
Although we are like this,

626
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,240
we can't take it anymore.

627
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:07,240
We can't take it anymore.

628
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:09,240
Now,

629
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:10,240
we are enough.

630
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:12,240
How about we

631
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:14,240
forget it?

632
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:17,240
No.

633
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,240
This time, we can calm him down.

634
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:21,240
What about next time?

635
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:22,240
What about next time?

636
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:24,240
If Xu Qian

637
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:25,240
is in love with him again

638
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:27,240
and does good things for him,

639
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:29,240
then we will be in love again.

640
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:31,240
We are not in love anymore.

641
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:33,240
What you mean is

642
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,240
if I say otherwise,

643
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:39,240
we will think of a way

644
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:41,240
to be good

645
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:44,240
and not bad.

646
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,240
Keng.

647
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:48,240
You look like a little girl.

648
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:49,240
Xing Cheng.

649
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,240
Why do you have to be so stubborn?

650
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:52,240
I have no time for him.

651
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:53,240
I have to take care of him.

652
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:56,240
Even if he finds my identity,

653
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:58,240
he will be loyal to me.

654
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,240
But I don't know

655
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:03,240
if he will be loyal to me.

656
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,240
I don't know.

657
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,240
I don't know.

658
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,240
I don't know.

659
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,240
I don't know.

660
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,240
I don't know.

661
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,240
I don't know.

662
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,240
I don't know.

663
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,240
I don't know.

664
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,240
I don't know.

665
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:14,240
But

666
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:17,240
he is so loyal to Princess Jiang.

667
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,240
What do you mean?

668
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,240
If he is loyal to Jing Cheng,

669
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,240
he will have a chance

670
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:22,240
to be a good person.

671
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,240
Come on.

672
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:26,240
Come on.

673
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,240
No, Princess.

674
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,240
Where is my phone?

675
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,240
I saw it just now.

676
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,240
I saw it.

677
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,240
If he is loyal to Jing Cheng,

678
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,240
hurry up.

679
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,240
That Bun product is so impressive.

680
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,240
I am so Disk Truits!

681
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,240
CK Wu Arcos,

682
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,920
you've been leading this Dahahistoire Debbie Xie seven years ago.

683
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,240
Oh my goodness!

684
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,240
Excellent!

685
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,240
A miracles of Wei Gong

686
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,240
has appeared in the writing of my bra Bakery.

687
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,240
That will raise the burden on Wei Gong.

688
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,240
In the future,

689
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,240
he will have a wife within the Bihui Auld 잉pil.

690
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:11,240
You can see息 In for him.

691
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:12,240
Sir Jing Cheng.

692
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:39,520
The

693
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,160
Go back to sleep.

694
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,280
Chef Xiu.

695
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,600
From the last detail of the współ stacking skill.

696
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:55,720
Xiao You was only a five- hesitFlare배anu.

697
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:58,680
Now he is theucheoueun.

698
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:03,700
Indeed a with不是質的

699
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,280
Alte!

700
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:09,200
I'll go first.

701
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:11,600
Congratulations on this project.

702
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:21,240
I'm just telling you, my junior brother Zilian is still talking.

703
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:27,240
My junior brother Zilian is no longer in the dark.

704
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,240
Wait a minute.

705
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:36,240
So you're here to take over the Imperial Division?

706
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,240
Where's Xiaojun?

707
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:42,240
This is the ninth Xiaojing of my junior brother.

708
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,240
I've taken it back.

709
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:51,240
As for you, I invited Xiaoyou to join the Heavenly Emperor's Assembly.

710
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,240
Heavenly Emperor's Assembly?

711
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,240
The Imperial Division is a subject.

712
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,240
I'll divide them into nine.

713
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:00,240
They are similar in secret and common.

714
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,240
I've divided them into seven different people.

715
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:05,240
So there's Heavenly Emperor's Assembly.

716
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:10,240
Now, with Xiaoyou, the Heavenly Emperor's Assembly is in the hands of seven.

717
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:14,240
Older Brother, you're looking down on me.

718
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:19,240
I'm just a young king who just entered the training room.

719
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,240
Xiaoyou, don't be too modest.

720
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:26,240
I've said earlier that you're a man of high-ranking.

721
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,240
Please, Older Brother, please.

722
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:40,240
I've said earlier that Xiaoyou is a man of high-ranking.

723
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,240
She came to the country on that day.

724
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:45,240
But no matter how far she comes from the country,

725
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:47,240
I can't help but wonder how she came from.

726
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:51,240
But the woman in the carriage

727
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:56,240
is a woman who wants to return to the country with her face.

728
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,240
Xiaoyou gave her a bracelet.

729
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:01,240
You two will definitely have a grudge.

730
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,240
Xiaoyou is still hesitating?

731
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,240
Don't worry.

732
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,240
Even if you join the Heavenly Emperor's Assembly,

733
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:16,240
you won't be allowed to be in the royal family.

734
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:18,240
In the Heavenly Emperor's Assembly,

735
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,240
including Xiaoyou and your men,

736
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,240
they're not the only ones who can do it.

737
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,240
Now, although you're from the Five Lakes and Four Seas,

738
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:27,240
there will be a meeting sooner or later.

739
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:29,240
Why don't you join the Heavenly Emperor's Assembly earlier

740
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:31,240
and settle down with each other?

741
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:33,240
I'll do my best to help you

742
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:37,240
to fight for the Heavenly Emperor's sake.

743
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:49,240
If it's really like what this old man said,

744
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:52,240
every member of the Heavenly Emperor's Assembly is a man of high rank.

745
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:56,240
Then I'll be in this circle.

746
00:39:56,240 --> 00:40:01,240
Can't you just easily enter the high-ranking social circle?

747
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:12,240
Okay.

748
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,240
I agree to join the Heavenly Emperor's Assembly.

749
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,240
If you need any help in the future,

750
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:20,240
you can ask for help from the other members

751
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:23,240
through the Yishi Xiaojing.

752
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:25,240
If they're in the city,

753
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:26,240
they'll be the first.

754
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,240
By the way,

755
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:36,240
the owner of the Yishi Xiaojing is the son of the Heavenly Emperor's Assembly.

756
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:42,240
In addition, the Yishi Xiaojing is the one who will be named

757
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,240
by Xiaojing Xu.

758
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,240
Hello?

759
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,240
Anyone here?

760
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:06,240
What's going on?

761
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:09,240
Should I be able to get back to the contact?

762
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:13,240
Everyone, you're finally back to the contact.

763
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:16,240
No. 3, I've contacted the director of Xiaojing.

764
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,240
I've known the big and small department of the director's office since this year.

765
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,240
Thank you for helping the director

766
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:22,240
to resolve the crisis.

767
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,240
Xiaojing, No. 6,

768
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,240
thank you for reminding me.

769
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:29,240
Otherwise, I've already been poisoned by Zilin.

770
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:31,240
You're welcome.

771
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:33,240
But I'll do my best.

772
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,240
There was a time when I didn't pay attention to the transmission of the progress.

773
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:38,240
Who can tell me what happened?

774
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:41,240
Of course you didn't.

775
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:43,240
After all, you're busy with the cultivation,

776
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:45,240
and the order to serve the emperor.

777
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,240
No. 2, pay attention to the words.

778
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:48,240
We have the words first.

779
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:51,240
We can't reveal each other's identity in front of the new person.

780
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:53,240
You're almost done.

781
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:56,240
When No. 6 came in, you came up and reported my identity.

782
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,240
I'm telling you, I'm telling you.

783
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:59,240
I'm just a heartless person,

784
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:00,240
and you're deliberately doing this.

785
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:01,240
That's right.

786
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:02,240
I did it on purpose.

787
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,240
How about it? Answer me.

788
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:06,240
No. 3, let me tell you.

789
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:10,240
No. 4 is the chief disciple of the leader of the Fengling Bao Ge.

790
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:12,240
Chu Yuanzhen, the son of the great emperor,

791
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:13,240
you've heard it clearly.

792
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:15,240
No. 3, let me tell you.

793
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:18,240
No. 2 is the female heroine Li Miaozhen.

794
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,240
The great emperor's daughter is him. Remember that.

795
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,240
You're so shameless.

796
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,240
You two.

797
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:24,240
You're crazy.

798
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:26,240
The storekeeper called you here for no reason.

799
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:27,240
Who's afraid of who?

800
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:28,240
How can I take your phone?

801
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:29,240
You're not a female heroine.

802
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:31,240
You're just a little wing.

803
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:32,240
Come on.

804
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:33,240
Come on.

805
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:34,240
Come here.

806
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:35,240
The pot.

807
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:39,240
No. 1 appeared.

808
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:42,240
I thought you'd hide behind the mirror to steal the money.

809
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,240
I'm so calm.

810
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:46,240
I don't want to hear it as a young man.

811
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:48,240
Yes.

812
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:51,240
No. 3 appeared.

813
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:54,240
Don't scare him away.

814
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:59,240
No. 3, you're the one who bought the house in the capital.

815
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:02,240
I'm not No. 2 or No. 4.

816
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:04,240
People are in the country.

817
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:07,240
Of course, I have to give myself a horse.

818
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:09,240
The house?

819
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:14,240
The house is just a group of people who are not good at cooking.

820
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:17,240
Then you're a scholar.

821
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:20,240
No. 3, although the Taoist leader agrees to join the Heavenly Emperor's Assembly,

822
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:23,240
you must first win our trust.

823
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:25,240
The Heavenly Emperor's Assembly has a rule.

824
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:27,240
Today is the end of this.

825
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:30,240
No news here, including everyone,

826
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,240
can be leaked.

827
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:33,240
It's a consensus.

828
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:34,240
Don't worry.

829
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:35,240
I'm very strict.

830
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:36,240
By the way,

831
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:38,240
how is the situation in the capital?

832
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,240
The Zhou's people are falling.

833
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:41,240
The battle is starting.

834
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:43,240
But the Zhou's people are going down the stage.

835
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:45,240
There are some crazy henchmen.

836
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:48,240
The reason is that the private courtyard of the King of Weiwu

837
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:51,240
has been exposed to the nightfall.

838
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:54,240
Why do I have to show my face?

839
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:57,240
To show my own standards.

840
00:43:57,240 --> 00:44:01,240
Is that so?

841
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:02,240
Is everything all right?

842
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:04,240
If it's all right, let's leave.

843
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:06,240
I'll have to go to the mountain to get the bandits tomorrow.

844
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:09,240
No. 3, you've been staying here for so long.

845
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:13,240
Can you tell me your true name?

846
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:16,240
Xingmu, don't be ungrateful.

847
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:19,240
I'm Chen Jingnan.

848
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:15,240
I'm a man of my word.

849
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:17,240
I'm a man of my word.

850
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:19,240
I'm a man of my word.

851
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:21,240
I'm a man of my word.

852
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:23,240
I'm a man of my word.

853
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:25,240
I'm a man of my word.

854
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:27,240
I'm a man of my word.

855
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:29,240
I'm a man of my word.

856
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:31,240
I'm a man of my word.

857
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:33,240
I'm a man of my word.

858
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:35,240
I'm a man of my word.

859
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:37,240
I'm a man of my word.

860
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:39,240
I'm a man of my word.

861
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:41,240
I'm a man of my word.

862
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:43,240
A man too man코 is too manāเลย

863
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:45,240
and so devil is so outraged.

864
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:47,240
I'll so quote my teacher Tang During thearla.

865
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:49,240
Should I be afraid of spinach?

866
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:51,240
Amazing.

867
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:53,080
It seems you can manage this

868
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:55,240
because tomorrow is day off.

869
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:57,240
Rejecting Wahl.

870
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:59,240
Let me live in peace.

871
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:01,240
Please come and support me when I retire.

872
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:03,080
You know you deserve for coming.

873
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:05,240
For now, you've got to praise me.

874
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:07,240
And why don't you do?

875
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:09,240
IAsk you aач žright,

876
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:12,240
I will not be his witness

877
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:14,240
I will not be his witness

878
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:16,240
I will not be his witness

879
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:18,240
I will not be his witness

880
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:20,240
I will not be his witness

881
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:25,240
Who is he?

882
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:27,240
He is a bad man

883
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:29,240
He is a bad man

884
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:31,240
He is a bad man

885
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:33,240
He is a bad man

886
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:35,240
He is a bad man

887
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:37,240
He is a bad man

888
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:39,240
He is a bad man

889
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:41,240
He goes to jail

890
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:45,240
Who is he?

891
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:47,240
He is a bad man

892
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:49,240
He is a bad man

893
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:51,240
He is a bad man

894
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:53,240
He is a bad man

895
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:55,240
He is a bad man

896
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:57,240
He goes to jail

897
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:59,240
He is a bad man

898
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:01,240
He is a bad man

899
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:03,240
He is a bad man

900
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:05,240
He is a bad man
