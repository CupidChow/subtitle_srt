1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,600
We have been ヽ worshiping 慵 ад 县居

2
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:04,340
From now on I will shoo from illuminations

3
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:07,120
And I will overcome all the problems

4
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:10,780
There's a better way for me to comfort the others

5
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,340
This will take us through the resurrecting

6
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,000
How many battling에서ESS

7
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:20,980
need to pass the time, visit the dreams

8
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:23,680
So that I will gain more resources

9
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:28,600
I cannot teach anyone

10
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:31,160
I'm afraid that the rules will be changed

11
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,000
I'll lose it

12
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,520
I'll regret it, but there's no time

13
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,240
I'll be a fool, I'll be a fool

14
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,000
I'll be a fool, I'll be a fool

15
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,360
I'll be a fool, I'll be a fool

16
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,440
I'll be a fool, I'll be a fool

17
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:44,040
Episode 1

18
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,320
I'm not afraid of beating people

19
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,520
Beat people?

20
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,480
Put your ears out

21
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,280
Hurry up

22
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,080
You...

23
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,000
Are you Xu Xian?

24
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,520
Yes

25
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,600
You're talking about goods?

26
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,600
Yes, I'm Xu Xian

27
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,480
That's right

28
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,600
Let's go

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,840
No

30
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,040
My lord

31
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,240
I didn't make a mistake

32
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,800
I'm not afraid of beating people

33
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,400
I'm not afraid of beating people

34
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,200
I don't think he has a bone in his body

35
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,200
Where's yours?

36
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,800
Is there?

37
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,800
I think there is

38
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,400
Let me ask you

39
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,200
I think so

40
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,600
Prepare some water for him

41
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,800
I'll go with you

42
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,800
Okay

43
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,000
I've seen you, Mother

44
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,800
I know

45
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,400
I'm not good at literature

46
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,400
I'm sure I won't use my skills today

47
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,200
Mother

48
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,200
You see these are just drafts

49
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,600
You praised me a few days ago

50
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,800
You're serious

51
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,400
You're so stubborn

52
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,600
You're so stubborn

53
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,200
I'm not as good as you

54
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,800
I'm so lucky

55
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,800
It's because I've been to the Four Seasons Sword

56
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,400
to practice metal

57
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,400
And I've lost my fake silver

58
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,800
Those numbers are more praiseable

59
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,200
More smart than Huaiqing

60
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,200
More flexible

61
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,400
Sit down

62
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,400
You've done the Four Seasons Sword

63
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,400
You've passed the seal

64
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,000
Tomorrow will be passed to the public

65
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,000
By then

66
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,000
Everyone will be proud of you as a crown princess

67
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,000
Yangyang is not as good as Huaiqing

68
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,800
Even the Eastern Palace is embarrassed

69
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,200
Mother

70
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,600
This is an accident

71
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,000
I promise

72
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,200
I will work hard to surpass Huaiqing

73
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,800
I won't embarrass the crown prince

74
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,600
That prince

75
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,200
He's so talented and fair

76
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,400
But because of Huaiqing's sister

77
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,600
Even the emperor is so proud of him

78
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,200
And the crown prince

79
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,600
Yangyang is so outstanding

80
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,200
He still loves you so much

81
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,000
You can't let him ruin his life

82
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,200
because of your sister

83
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,000
Princess

84
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,600
I'm going to prepare some hot water now

85
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,600
Princess, you're injured

86
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,200
I'll go get the imperial doctor

87
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,000
Princess

88
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,200
If the lord can tell me what happened

89
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,000
I can't thank you

90
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,800
Who is he?

91
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,800
He's a noble man

92
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,400
He said he would surpass ten to twenty

93
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,600
He's 50

94
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
He's over 50

95
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
He's over 100

96
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,400
He's a beast

97
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,200
He still has to follow the rules

98
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,800
Actually

99
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,600
I'm just a wise man

100
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,600
I don't know the details

101
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,200
But you're a good man

102
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,400
As a brother

103
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,400
I'll give you a word

104
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,000
When you arrive at the gate of the Dakhon people

105
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,200
You should say what you should say

106
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,400
Not what you should say

107
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,600
Don't say it

108
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,600
Go

109
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,800
Here we are

110
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,000
This is the Dakhon people's sheep

111
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,600
Go

112
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,400
Go

113
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,800
Take care of yourself

114
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:50,800
Go

115
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
We meet again

116
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,600
Lord Yang

117
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,400
Sit down

118
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,000
It's been a long time since I met Lord Yang

119
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,600
Xiaorou, you're working

120
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,600
You're a fool

121
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,200
You said don't call me Xiaorou

122
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,000
It's good

123
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,600
I'm the new researcher for you

124
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,200
Why do you ask?

125
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,800
You just answer

126
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,200
If you lie

127
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,000
You'll be punished

128
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:54,800
Yes

129
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,400
Xu Qian

130
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,000
Do you know the mastermind of the secret secret case

131
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,200
is Zhou Shiliang?

132
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,200
I heard the fortune teller of the Four Heavens

133
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,000
say it

134
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,000
Do you know Zhou Li will be in jail for four days?

135
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:06,800
Yes

136
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,000
So you're not going to be a prisoner

137
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,200
and you're going to be a prisoner

138
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,000
You kidnapped Lord Weiwu's son

139
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,800
and gave Zhou Li a hard time

140
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,400
We're going to be in trouble

141
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,400
What are you talking about?

142
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,600
I don't understand

143
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Lord Weiwu's son was kidnapped

144
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,400
and you were in the office of Yang

145
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Where did you go?

146
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,800
I went to the prison to listen to the song

147
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,000
Although there are some restrictions

148
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,200
But it's really unrelated to this case

149
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,800
Then why did you explain the letter?

150
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,880
There are many times in the record of Yang's

151
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,600
investigation of the letter

152
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,600
that you went to the prison

153
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,200
My lord, forgive me

154
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,400
I've never been to the prison

155
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,600
and I've never been to the prison in Yang's house

156
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,400
My lord, are you going to be in trouble?

157
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,400
I've been to the prison for the letter

158
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,000
and I've been cleaning my hands and feet

159
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I want to be a prisoner

160
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,000
You're still so weak

161
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,200
Xiaorou, I told you

162
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,000
to meet the real smart person

163
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,000
You're not good at reading the water bottle

164
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,800
Not bad

165
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,200
If we hadn't got the evidence in advance

166
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,800
we wouldn't have been able to say what we just said

167
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,400
We've believed you

168
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,400
On the first day of March

169
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,200
Xu Qi'an returned from the Yunlu Academy

170
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,400
and was followed by a man from Zhou's Mansion

171
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:33,000
He was assassinated by the Jin Tui Zhou family

172
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,600
On the 11th of March

173
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Xu Qi's year was spent on the female scroll

174
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,800
and the Yunlu Academy's currency

175
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,000
On that day

176
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,400
Xu Qi'an entered the prison

177
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,800
and was named as the governor of Yang's house

178
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,800
Then Xu's father

179
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,800
was cleaned up before the prison

180
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,400
On the 16th of March

181
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,600
you went to Tantou

182
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,600
and lost your daughter in the inner yard

183
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,600
Then you went to the private house

184
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,000
and killed four people in the private house

185
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,200
Finally, you met Wei Xu

186
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,200
and disguised yourself as a car driver

187
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,200
and drove off the car to steal the monkey's number

188
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,400
and killed him with the same means

189
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,200
That's not what happened

190
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,000
At that time

191
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:38,800
Yu as the capital

192
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,000
I'm just a fast learner.

193
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,560
It's not reasonable.

194
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:43,760
Wait.

195
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,920
Their whole process

196
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,200
is not organized.

197
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,640
Is this what you mean?

198
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,880
What else do you want to say?

199
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,440
I admit my wrong.

200
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,920
I did all this.

201
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,120
If you agree,

202
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,960
put it a little harder.

203
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,760
Don't worry.

204
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,920
I will prove it as0白.

205
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:22,300
I won't associate anyone with

206
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,480
your classmate.

207
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,080
What are you talking about?

208
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,720
Follow me.

209
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,320
But you failed to seize the group.

210
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,320
I've Steal it .

211
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,800
The 증jin of Zhou Shilang

212
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:39,960
Na Mo didn't get to show up today.

213
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,520
She should be worth a bit of the money and give me money to look like that kid.

214
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,240
I give you money.

215
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,140
Really?

216
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,260
who made you fall in love.

217
00:11:53,460 --> 00:12:15,620
If you're put during a meeting with Shen Win

218
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,240
Who was bartender

219
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,140
she wants you to come...

220
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:25,820
me?

221
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:32,180
Your Highness!

222
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:35,020
Xuzhian has already been taken away by someone.

223
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:38,380
Well.

224
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:40,820
That's the person High Princess recommended.

225
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:42,900
The Undercover Princess,

226
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:45,060
Softin.

227
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,580
The Undercover Princess is here!

228
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:51,340
It's him.

229
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:53,140
Please, Your Highness.

230
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:55,820
Why did she recommend me?

231
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,860
We're just following orders.

232
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:59,260
If you have any questions,

233
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:00,460
you can ask the Wei State.

234
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:03,620
Of course, it's just one of the reasons.

235
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:06,460
You're a talent.

236
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,580
I've confirmed it when I was in the trial.

237
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:11,460
But we have our own rules.

238
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:14,260
The bottom line is that you're too far from the top.

239
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,140
Yes.

240
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:16,700
So we have to test it.

241
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,380
But it's obvious.

242
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,660
You proved yourself again.

243
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:24,700
The couple is going to repeat your game.

244
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:26,820
We start to fight more.

245
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:28,900
But after being chased,

246
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:30,260
Shuiing has gone stronger.

247
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:31,940
She's the one who did it.

248
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,560
She respect you.

249
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:37,000
But you trusted...

250
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,540
your own talent.

251
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,980
We treasure your imagination.

252
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:42,820
I'll do it.

253
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:50,260
Xiaorou,

254
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,660
according to the agreement,

255
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:54,660
I'm the one who's the one.

256
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:56,740
Please give us

257
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:58,580
the space for communication.

258
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,300
Is this choice for you

259
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:08,460
to choose me or her?

260
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:14,620
We're both in the same team.

261
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,180
We're not in the same team.

262
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:17,940
But she's only in the training.

263
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,420
She doesn't have time for you.

264
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,020
And you follow me.

265
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:23,940
I can take you with me.

266
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:25,540
In the next three or five years,

267
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:28,020
you can inherit my clothes.

268
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:42,820
Thank you.

269
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:44,820
You're welcome.

270
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:47,260
OK.

271
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:02,420
That's just right.

272
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:04,980
Dear Xu Yan.

273
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:07,460
But at the dawn of the night there

274
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,020
was an opportunity to give the May I Business Card

275
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:11,300
Eldest Prince.

276
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:12,660
Keep quiet.

277
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:13,660
Enough.

278
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:16,860
My days happened fast.

279
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:21,300
Lu myths are quite潜 rigid.

280
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:22,720
But they don't want to

281
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:23,940
anda matchup as someone

282
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:24,700
want you to be happy.

283
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:31,540
Let me introduce you to me.

284
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,660
Lu's old mate is quite impetuous.

285
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:37,540
He doesn't like

286
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,780
being kind to you or dirty her shoes.

287
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:42,020
Say no more. Don't call me Xiaorong.

288
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:06,020
Sit.

289
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:11,840
Liu Ye.

290
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:19,820
Hello, Li Ye.

291
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,460
You're the 줄sherf of Red Rose Family.

292
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:37,260
Right.

293
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,740
what was being showed?

294
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:41,300
With your tuner,

295
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:43,380
my hand has to be soiche puzzle,

296
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:45,020
you could say you can go

297
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,340
after the whole scheme is solved.

298
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:53,380
As for duty of哦re Equity,

299
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,780
monitoring the officer duties

300
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:57,380
and defending the justice,

301
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:59,220
according to the details,

302
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:01,180
look ahead and understand carefully.

303
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:03,020
I'll fix the criminal tools

304
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:04,660
in my contract with Greet 50 block keine.

305
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:05,860
We will see

306
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:07,780
and bring you to see your uncle.

307
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:11,820
Mr. Jiang.

308
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:16,420
I'll leave the rest to you.

309
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,260
Let's learn about

310
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,020
the basic situation of working.

311
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:21,420
Yes.

312
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:24,420
Ying.

313
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:27,220
Take your time.

314
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:28,780
Okay.

315
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:30,300
Okay.

316
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:31,980
Okay.

317
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:33,740
Okay.

318
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:35,180
Okay.

319
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:36,180
Feng Tingfeng.

320
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:37,820
Lu Guangxiao.

321
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:40,220
You can do it.

322
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:41,980
You're a colleague now.

323
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:43,660
You can rely on your big brother's husband

324
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:45,780
to take care of the future.

325
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:48,980
It's easy to work with Brother Yan.

326
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,420
But the bad thing is

327
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:53,420
you might be assigned to Chunfeng Hall.

328
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:54,180
It's the same as me.

329
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:54,980
Chunfeng Hall?

330
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:56,180
Is there anything wrong?

331
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:57,500
Nothing.

332
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,140
It's just that

333
00:17:59,140 --> 00:17:59,940
you have to squeeze it.

334
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:03,540
Why are you flying again?

335
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:05,220
We stand higher.

336
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:06,780
Let's have a look at the details.

337
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:07,940
You can clearly understand.

338
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:08,940
Are you afraid of the devil?

339
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:09,580
No.

340
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:10,340
Let me help you.

341
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:11,340
I'll help you.

342
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:11,780
Zhang Yang.

343
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:12,340
Okay.

344
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:14,540
In our Dageng people,

345
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:15,580
the bottom layer

346
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:17,180
is white and not edged.

347
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:18,140
What we do is

348
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,740
observe the water flow.

349
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,740
White and edged are the power source.

350
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:23,380
We don't have to register and make a plan.

351
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:24,180
We can organize the book.

352
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:25,580
This is the same.

353
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:26,980
It's a serious Dageng people.

354
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:28,540
Whether it's a long-term plan

355
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:29,940
or a quick investigation,

356
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:31,740
we're all the smallest.

357
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:41,820
Why didn't you go up?

358
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:43,140
I can't.

359
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:43,780
It's weird.

360
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:56,740
Thank you.

361
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:15,660
This is Silver Snake.

362
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:16,860
Enjoying Buat field.

363
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:17,380
Wow.

364
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:18,260
You can directly see it now.

365
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:19,800
We are just

366
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,540
standing here

367
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:23,700
and remembering our work.

368
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:25,400
I want to perform

369
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,800
After the gold is lost, it's the gold.

370
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,800
The highest level of the position.

371
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,720
The whole Dafeng City has only 12 gold.

372
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,400
It's directly assigned to the Wei Palace.

373
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,320
The situation is like this.

374
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,800
If you don't understand, just ask me.

375
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,000
Before we start,

376
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,000
there's a process.

377
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,040
Self-made test.

378
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:50,840
Self-made test.

379
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,120
Yes. The test is not fixed.

380
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:57,400
The sustain of the operation is

381
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,720
batery and عن concord.

382
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,120
It sounds good!

383
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,640
Mr. Song.

384
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,320
Yes.

385
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,000
Mr. Yang told us to try our best.

386
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,320
You are now a manager.

387
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,640
You have a good job.

388
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,600
You can test it.

389
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,400
The police in our hands

390
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,480
is empty.

391
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,560
There is something in it.

392
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,360
You can choose any of us

393
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,200
to ask for it.

394
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,800
But you can only ask one question.

395
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,440
We only talk about the truth.

396
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,720
The other person only talks about the truth.

397
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,640
You have a lot of time to think about it.

398
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,400
But we won't give you any hint.

399
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,960
Although we are small-scale games,

400
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:48,360
we are not as good as others.

401
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,600
Although I am a man of no mind,

402
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,200
I have spent a lot of time on it.

403
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,160
It is said that only the Golden Roadmen

404
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:58,040
can be self-sufficient in the 20th century.

405
00:20:59,240 --> 00:20:59,840
Okay.

406
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,080
I will try my best.

407
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,400
Let's start.

408
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,400
If you were him, what would you tell me?

409
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:13,920
Nothing.

410
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:15,800
Here is the thing.

411
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,200
Sit down.

412
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,480
Three-star?

413
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:25,600
Go upstairs.

414
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:26,480
Next.

415
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,280
The second one is about the Wenshin Pass.

416
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,280
There is no need for it.

417
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,400
But remember,

418
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:34,880
if you walk with your heart,

419
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,320
you will be eliminated by the average.

420
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,480
The average?

421
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,280
What is it?

422
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,040
You think the test is set?

423
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,280
The average is four-leveled,

424
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,320
the better you are, the more you are equipped.

425
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,200
I am Yi.

426
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,480
It is cake.

427
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:51,960
Top of the cake?

428
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,680
The sunset treaties

429
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,380
's 50-craft knife

430
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:58,040
that does not break the communicate between doors.

431
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,360
Who is it?

432
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,560
This is the Wforeignvert.

433
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,680
You challenge the up-and-down players

434
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,080
They do what they want to.

435
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,360
It's my function.

436
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,560
You can do as you please.

437
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,680
W Pure Pnut, please come up the stage.

438
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,040
Let's go.

439
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,160
This is...

440
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,160
This is the tavern and seafood camp

441
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,400
of the Infinity Man of the Three Peemen.

442
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,600
But did you even eat them?

443
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:46,840
It doesn't look like you spent, just like us.

444
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,680
It's a good thing.

445
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,680
Let's continue.

446
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,680
It's from the prince.

447
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,680
No, you...

448
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,680
I'm sure you don't know this one.

449
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,680
Please introduce him.

450
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,680
He's from Yasheng.

451
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,680
Yasheng is the founder of Yunlu Academy

452
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,680
and also the best-selling author of the Academy.

453
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,680
He was a professor of the world's best-selling author

454
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,680
when he was studying in the university.

455
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,680
He was a good-selling author

456
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,680
and a good-selling author

457
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,680
for the people.

458
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,680
He's a great-selling author

459
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,680
who has been a great-selling author

460
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,680
for the people.

461
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,680
This red box

462
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,680
is Yasheng's painting knife.

463
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,680
It's also the paper of Yunlu Academy.

464
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,680
Yasheng's painting knife

465
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,680
is a great-selling painting knife.

466
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,680
The paper of Yunlu Academy

467
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,680
is not a good idea.

468
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,680
It's a real product.

469
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,680
The real painting knife

470
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,680
is from Yunlu Academy.

471
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,680
I'm telling you,

472
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,680
this thing is powerful.

473
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,680
And it's touching.

474
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,680
It's powerful.

475
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,680
You can use Yunlu Academy

476
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,680
to press it.

477
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,680
What are you doing?

478
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,680
Let me tell you.

479
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,680
Since Yasheng's death,

480
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,680
this knife

481
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,680
has been in use for more than a thousand years.

482
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,680
Brother Song,

483
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,680
can I take this knife

484
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,680
to a kid's house?

485
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,680
Take it.

486
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,680
Thank you.

487
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,680
I have one more.

488
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,680
I have one more one.

489
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:20,680
Warm Shaman is in this room.

490
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,680
He still lives here?

491
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,680
I see.

492
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,680
Brother Song,

493
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,680
look.

494
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,680
I am alone.

495
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,680
Would we still continue?

496
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,680
Aren't we doing useless?

497
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,680
Why don't we close down?

498
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,680
I am not used to this person.

499
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,680
Except my own parents,

500
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,680
I also don't see anyone food on the dish.

501
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,680
Noted.

502
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,680
When we set up an Ascätze Works at our late ham,

503
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,680
we dinnt found aiędzy이라고.

504
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,680
If someone didn't win受 plateau,

505
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,880
I'm a worker.

506
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:45,840
I'm a chef.

507
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,040
A chef?

508
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:49,640
Of course.

509
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,040
If you have this idea,

510
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,440
we won't force you.

511
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,440
Guangxiu, go.

512
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,840
Brother, give me another chance.

513
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:56,640
I'll try.

514
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:57,240
I can do it.

515
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,040
Longshan, I'm going to go now.

516
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,240
Longshan, Longshan.

517
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,640
Longshan.

518
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,640
Longshan.

519
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:12,640
Xiaoxiu.

520
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,400
Xiaoxiu.

521
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,800
Am I a good man?

522
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Do you need me to be a physical man?

523
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,800
Xu Xian, can you stop being so childish?

524
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:19,800
I'm already a man.

525
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,200
Hurry up and give me a chance.

526
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,000
Go, go, go.

527
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,000
Guangxiu, give me a chance.

528
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:23,800
Can you fool us?

529
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,400
Can you fool Wei Qingjing?

530
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,400
I told you,

531
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,200
Wei Qingjing is a man.

532
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,400
He's a man.

533
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,400
He's a man.

534
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,600
If he has a chance,

535
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,800
he'll do anything.

536
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:39,800
What's going on?

537
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,600
I'm a man.

538
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,400
Well, you must be in trouble.

539
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,800
But the business is 어때.

540
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,120
Leave me,

541
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,520
I don't want to stay here anymore.

542
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,560
If your business is surveying the business,

543
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,920
you'll get wine and money back.

544
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,280
Don't ever leave me like this again.

545
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,040
The water is flowing at my back.

546
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,160
How much am I worth?

547
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,360
It's not worth me.

548
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,640
I calculated the second hand,

549
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,960
so I'm going to act like you don't really have knowledge.

550
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,840
Then we can get married later.

551
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,360
If you present your trading reins,

552
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,160
I don't think it's worth it.

553
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,760
I'llлы, don't be like that.

554
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:35,600
Group 3,

555
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,560
Group 3,

556
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,760
I got a blue book.

557
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,920
It says

558
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,240
the nature of the world.

559
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,320
I'm curious.

560
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,720
It's a coincidence.

561
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,720
This book's author is Xu Qian.

562
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,040
The new one, Tong Luo,

563
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:53,920
is Xu Qian.

564
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,840
I've got this one in my mind.

565
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,240
Father,

566
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,160
give me this one.

567
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,000
Xiaorou,

568
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,000
you're here to read the letter.

569
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,160
What's the occasion today?

570
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,760
I'm really good at playing the game.

571
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,440
Xiaorou looks like a good girl.

572
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,240
But if I want to be a doctor

573
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,760
or want to be a person,

574
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,560
she'll be like this.

575
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,200
She won't be controlled.

576
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,600
She won't be a good person

577
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,120
and will be a good person to me.

578
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,160
I'm not good at playing the game.

579
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,720
I don't know what you mean.

580
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,080
You need to help me.

581
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:33,920
You're not a good person.

582
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:35,680
Oh, yeah.

583
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:37,880
Xiang Yan, let me tell you.

584
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,480
If you call me Xiaorou again,

585
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,760
I'll use my hands

586
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,480
to pull your muscles and your skin.

587
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,480
Father will be the first one to call you.

588
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,080
Of course, father can call you.

589
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,480
But you don't deserve it.

590
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,680
Father, you see,

591
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,880
he's really treating me.

592
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,080
Wei Gong,

593
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,560
this is the test result and the emergency response

594
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,280
of the new one, Tong Luo.

595
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:04,760
Please take the test.

596
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,240
Xiaorou.

597
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,680
How many times did you use it

598
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,760
when you answered the question?

599
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,200
I used 15 times.

600
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,880
Yang Yan's mouth

601
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,680
was 19 times.

602
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,520
The new one, Tong Luo's breath.

603
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,480
I used 10 times.

604
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,080
Not bad.

605
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,080
It's not weird

606
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:31,600
to know this in the short term.

607
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,720
The record-breaking record

608
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,480
is about seven times.

609
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,080
How is that possible?

610
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:41,560
Father,

611
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,760
this person must give it to me.

612
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,360
It's a pity that you're late for a trip.

613
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,880
You failed the fourth time.

614
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,360
You're so arrogant.

615
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,640
I don't want this person.

616
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,520
Yang Jin Luo,

617
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:02,800
I'll return it to you.

618
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,120
Father,

619
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:05,920
how can you treat such a person

620
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,880
who's not good at eating and eating?

621
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,360
Where is he now?

622
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:10,720
He took Tong Luo

623
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,840
to the sixth floor.

624
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,280
Wei Gong has a good sense of humor.

625
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,760
He's really good at it.

626
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,480
If someone fails the fourth time,

627
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,800
it's because he's not good at eating and eating.

628
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,200
But Wei Gong

629
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,480
still has one last chance.

630
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,160
That's the fifth room in the city.

631
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,920
But no one has ever been there.

632
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:35,160
You're a good-for-nothing.

633
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,160
Song,

634
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,800
are these all questions?

635
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:48,840
Of course.

636
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,280
Questions and money

637
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,040
are all a waste of the things

638
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:52,840
in the North and North.

639
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:54,720
The rule is the same.

640
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,400
You only have one room.

641
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,240
Take good care of me.

642
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,640
After you finish writing,

643
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,400
knock on the door.

644
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,520
I'll be there in time.

645
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,240
Little brother,

646
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,240
you can do it.

647
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,200
Try your best.

648
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,800
Killing the enemy with a hundred thousand soldiers,

649
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:15,840
killing the demon,

650
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:16,400
killing the demon,

651
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,640
killing the demon,

652
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,880
returning to the capital to eat the gold,

653
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:24,320
filling the imperial court with five senses.

654
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:25,800
It's over.

655
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,280
It seems that Wei Gong wants to be a full-time official.

656
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:31,000
But I have no interest in power.

657
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,240
I just want to find a place

658
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,720
to live a peaceful life for a few days.

659
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,080
No.

660
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:39,760
Don't panic.

661
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:40,720
I have to calm down.

662
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:41,800
Think carefully.

663
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,800
The duty of the reformer

664
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,000
is to monitor the officials.

665
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:46,920
Wei Yuan, this poem

666
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,840
also means

667
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,280
to suppress the officials in the middle of the mirror.

668
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:53,000
This poem is not a poem,

669
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,000
but a story.

670
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,920
If the one who is helpless

671
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:56,920
and helpless

672
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,240
is really a bad person,

673
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,520
the questioner can't resist the poem.

674
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,440
He can write the poem with a strong heart.

675
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:03,520
On the contrary,

676
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,520
it proves that he still has a place to live.

677
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,840
Wei Yuan is willing to give this chance.

678
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,640
Since you want to be together,

679
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,040
I will be together with you.

680
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,040
Remake the Daily Letter

681
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:56,400
Hem ultra famous on the 22nd route.

682
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,520
at the last.

683
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,560
It will be hard to remember,

684
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,880
it will become hard to ignore.

685
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,560
What the little driver means is

686
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:06,400
he is the Cliff of folk,

687
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,960
not the King's Duke.

688
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:09,640
Rather,

689
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,400
Yang adaptation๊

690
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,480
What do you think?

691
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:16,880
I do not know the pussy.

692
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,520
When he was born

693
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,960
to Jinluo Brother Painting,

694
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,360
you should know it.

695
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,960
I can feel that

696
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,280
and become a gold-gatherer?

697
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,600
As long as he is a dancer,

698
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,120
there is no problem.

699
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:33,640
There are different rules in the Three Sects.

700
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:37,040
The number of people is exhausted by the atmosphere in the crowd.

701
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,640
The number of people is still.

702
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:42,400
The only dancer in this world is the purest one.

703
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:45,600
Although I have no power to be a dancer,

704
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,480
I have to admit that

705
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,320
the more I want to be a dancer,

706
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,360
the more I am brave and strong.

707
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,560
I have no fear in my heart.

708
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,120
I can do nothing.

709
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,280
I believe

710
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,040
I can make our future.

711
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,480
If you do not believe well,

712
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:11,760
then it will be a difficulty.

713
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:16,600
As for the taxes

714
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,120
on the nascent fine of the world,

715
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,920
than the proto-representation,

716
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,760
We must do it.

717
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,640
That's the sound.

718
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:45,960
Call.

719
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:46,920
Get in the car.

720
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,480
Yeah, exactly.

721
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:49,520
Get in the car.

722
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,480
What's the result?

723
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,520
Have you finished andWaiting for it?

724
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,400
I'm here.

725
00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:59,320
Stop.

726
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,400
But there's a result.

727
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,160
No.

728
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:07,280
But Mr. Yang told me to take you to wash the water.

729
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,480
Wash the water?

730
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,880
It's home for workers.

731
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:15,560
Workers will give you a chance to improve your strength.

732
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,800
Use the medicine to wash the water.

733
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,600
Start.

734
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,480
What is this?

735
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,760
It's a body wash.

736
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,880
It's a body wash.

737
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,520
This is the body wash?

738
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,120
Put it down.

739
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:56,080
No.

740
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,600
The wash is 150 taels.

741
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,560
I'll open it for you.

742
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,240
Wait.

743
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,720
Brother Zhu, I don't have that much money.

744
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,040
I don't have that much money.

745
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,280
Why did you come here?

746
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,720
You're so cheap.

747
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,120
We don't have money.

748
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:13,880
We're just a few taels.

749
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,320
You think we're willing to be workers?

750
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:17,680
We're all here to pay the debt.

751
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,360
I'm here.

752
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,280
You can look at your dad.

753
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:21,720
I don't like it.

754
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:22,520
You can't afford to learn.

755
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:23,280
You can't spend money.

756
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,480
It's all your fault.

757
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,240
You're all responsible for

758
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,040
the meeting of new people.

759
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,040
It's almost done.

760
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,760
Xu Qian, don't be shy.

761
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,960
Take off your clothes and shoes.

762
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,760
Take off your shoes quickly.

763
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,560
Come on.

764
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,080
Come on.

765
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,800
Yan, give me Xu Qian.

766
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,200
I'll use one silver wheel to exchange it for you.

767
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,640
Do you think I'm stupid?

768
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:53,640
Silver wheel is hard to get.

769
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,640
It's hard to get.

770
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,640
You've been practicing

771
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,640
without time to bring people.

772
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:00,640
Two silver wheels.

773
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,640
Two?

774
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:03,640
Not even 100?

775
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:05,640
I don't have time to bring them.

776
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,640
But someone else helped me.

777
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:08,640
There's no one else

778
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:09,640
in the silver wheel street

779
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:10,640
that you know.

780
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:15,640
I'm a rich man.

781
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:16,640
Rich man?

782
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,640
Li Yuchun.

783
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:18,640
Li Yuchun.

784
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:22,640
The character of the sand in his eyes

785
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:23,640
can be described as Xu Qian.

786
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:24,640
I'm telling you.

787
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,640
It's not three days.

788
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:27,640
It's not enough.

789
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:29,640
I don't agree.

790
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,640
Li Yuchun, I'm telling you.

791
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,640
This is a fake.

792
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:39,640
You have to help me take it.

793
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:46,640
I'm talking to you.

794
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,640
You've got a strong witness, right?

795
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,640
I'm the one who's got a strong witness.

796
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:58,640
I'm not a king

797
00:36:58,640 --> 00:36:59,640
who colludes with the world

798
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,640
and makes a living.

799
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:01,640
I can't even get this kind of

800
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:04,640
evil and impulsive action.

801
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,640
Jiang Jieluo.

802
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:10,640
As the criminal,

803
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:11,640
you've got to help Li Yuchun

804
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,640
get rid of the big-headed man.

805
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:15,640
I'm going to help you get rid of him.

806
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:19,640
How about this?

807
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:20,640
Just one round.

808
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:21,640
I'll take him back

809
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,640
after one round.

810
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:24,640
Can you?

811
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:25,640
You can't do this.

812
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:26,640
Li Yuchun, you...

813
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:34,640
Leave.

814
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,640
Li Yuchun, you're so serious.

815
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:42,640
You treat me like this?

816
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,640
You treat Xiao Jiu like this?

817
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:45,640
Fine.

818
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:47,640
I'll tell Tang Jieluo now.

819
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:48,640
Because of you,

820
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:49,640
his local government

821
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:50,640
can't handle the subordinates

822
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:51,640
and the people

823
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:52,640
who are fighting against him.

824
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,640
He can't do it.

825
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:59,640
What's wrong with you?

826
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,640
Why did you get Jieluo to do this?

827
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:02,640
Why can't I?

828
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:03,640
He's my Tang Jieluo.

829
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:05,640
His brother was bullied by his husband.

830
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,640
Shouldn't he be the master of the battle?

831
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:08,640
He's been playing with me

832
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,640
for the past two days.

833
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,640
You're not a friend to me.

834
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:12,640
I've got a meeting.

835
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:13,640
What meeting?

836
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:14,640
Why are you at home?

837
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:15,640
You're so stubborn.

838
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:16,640
Why do you want to be a family member?

839
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:17,640
Stop it.

840
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,640
We're working on the justice system.

841
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:20,640
What's the point of being a son and a daughter?

842
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:21,640
What's the point of being a wife?

843
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,640
You don't want me at all.

844
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:28,640
You're not even my source of income.

845
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,640
You can't be separated from the company.

846
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:31,640
You...

847
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:36,640
You don't want me?

848
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,640
How can I be so careless?

849
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,640
You don't want me at all?

850
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:52,640
Okay, okay, okay.

851
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:53,640
I promise you.

852
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:54,640
Jieluo.

853
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:57,640
I just want to say

854
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:59,640
my brother-in-law is a person who is kind and polite.

855
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:00,640
My sister can be your brother-in-law

856
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,640
for eight lives.

857
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,640
Come with me

858
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:05,640
and see your new secretary.

859
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:06,640
Wait, wait.

860
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:09,640
What's wrong with you again?

861
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,640
There's a line.

862
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,640
I just said that you should be late for the investigation.

863
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:17,640
Let's go.

864
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:25,640
Mr. Yang.

865
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:26,640
Go.

866
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,640
How is it?

867
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:34,640
Not bad.

868
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:35,640
Just got the laundry.

869
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,640
I should be in the first week of the operation.

870
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:39,640
Since that, I'll go back first.

871
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,640
The money for the laundry is in your account.

872
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:44,640
Wait.

873
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,640
What's the use of the tools?

874
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:48,640
What's the rush?

875
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,640
The laundry is in the operation.

876
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:53,640
It takes less than ten days to get up.

877
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:55,640
Can you let me wait a little bit?

878
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:57,640
My time is also in the spring, okay?

879
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,640
You still have spring?

880
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:01,640
You...

881
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:10,640
Congratulations.

882
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,640
You actually have Schulendeっと?

883
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:13,640
Yes.

884
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:14,640
It's fine.

885
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,640
Very good.

886
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,640
Your salary.

887
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:18,940
pay for the water.

888
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:20,640
Buy more water.

889
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:21,640
I'll bring river banks for fresh water.

890
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,640
It's not that difficult for you to take care of good hands.

891
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:26,640
Our wellbeing is alright.

892
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:27,640
lt's ok.

893
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:30,640
Thanks, Brother.

894
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,640
Thank you for your help.

895
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:33,640
Somehow,

896
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:34,640
I also really wish for

897
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:35,640
ah...

898
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:38,640
Is that Mu design?

899
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,640
This is the miracle for you.

900
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:42,640
With my current state,

901
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:45,640
I can beat ten of my former self.

902
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:11,640
I hate all the people who are like that.

903
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:13,640
I don't want to be divided into the black and white.

904
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:16,640
I'm a lazy person with no way to go.

905
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:27,640
Who is he?

906
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:29,640
Who is he?

907
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:31,640
Who is he?

908
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:33,640
Who is he?

909
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:35,640
Who is he?

910
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:37,640
Who is he?

911
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:39,640
Who is he?

912
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:41,640
Who is he?

913
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:42,640
Who is he?

914
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:43,640
Who is he?

915
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:45,640
Who is he?

916
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:49,640
I'm a random person with no way to go.

917
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,640
I don't want to be divided into the black and white.

918
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:55,640
I'm a lazy person with no way to go.

919
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,640
I hate all the people who are like that.

920
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:03,640
No.

921
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:07,640
I hate all the people who are like that.

922
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:11,640
I'm not afraid of the people I think of

923
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:14,640
I'm not afraid of the darkness

924
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:16,640
I'm not afraid of the dust

925
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:20,640
Who is he?

926
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,640
Who is he?

927
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,640
Who is he?

928
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,640
Who is he?

929
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,640
Who is he?

930
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,640
Who is he?

931
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:32,640
Who is he?

932
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:34,640
Who is he?

933
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:36,640
Who is he?

934
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:39,640
Who is he?

935
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:42,640
Who is he?

936
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:45,640
Why is he?

937
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:47,640
Who is he?

938
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:50,640
Who is he?

939
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:52,860
Who is he?

940
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:57,640
Who is he?

941
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:00,640
Who is he?

942
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:04,020
Who is he?

943
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:06,020
I will be the king of the world

944
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:08,020
I will be the king of the world
