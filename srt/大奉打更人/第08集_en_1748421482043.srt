Thank you for your patience.

17
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:50,260
I used to be an old friend,

18
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:51,940
and I've talked to you many times.

19
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:55,460
I will pass on the meaning of Li Yingruo

20
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,300

00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:02,100
Please come on.

22
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:04,380
All right.

28
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:35,020
but Gui was

29
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:35,740
too usefull.

30
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:37,140
I was

31
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:37,620
really

32
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,260
Kneeling for intentions.

33
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:43,700
You had suffered

34
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,220
tremendous suffering

35
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:46,740

You finally set fire.

but

51
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:20,500
I only made the

00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,860

fairy tale

56
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:31,820
the beauty of reality

57
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,860
a little bit

58
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:35,280
just thought

59
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,700
Your highness

60
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:38,820
Eunuch Wei just took him

61
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,360
and sent over a wild Стinta

62
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,780
I really don't know

63
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,320
ascendance of a warrior

64
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,640

Princess, do the bridal gifts.

72
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:01,540
Huaiqi,

73
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:04,980
I heard you've Parcelled many talents through jiujun rare.

74
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:07,920
Yeah.

75
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,160
Which good cracks dooublise?

76
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:10,860
That's my۔

..

78
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,180
..

79
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:14,260
I added jiujun rare skill to the task,

80
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:17,160
To be dallaing phoenix singer.

81
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,480
You guys know it.

82
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:25,500
I've also done a lot of work for Da Feng each time.

83
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,580
I have a key.

84
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:28,500
You can take it.

85
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:30,260
Take it away.

86
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:31,820
I haven't finished my words.

87
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:32,780
Gangzi.

88
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,060
Let the princess see

89
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:37,500
what level we have seen in the fight against the people.

90
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:41,420
Zhao Jia.

91
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:42,860
以上.

92
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,460
以上.

93
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,380
How to evaluate it?

94
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:49,980
The investigation of the people

95
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:51,060
is very strict.

96
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:53,620
Zhao Jia can be called as以上.

97
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:54,940
He is a phoenix.

98
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,740
As a person,

99
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,820
he can be called as

100
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,140
the phoenix.

101
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,300
Phoenix?

102
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:06,660
How to evaluate it?

103
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:07,940
The phoenix is

104
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,620
a phoenix.

105
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:11,060
It is said that it will be a major

106
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,100
point of the fight against the people.

107
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,380
According to the princess,

108
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:17,820
the person who made the sword

109
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,580
seems to be the highest,

110
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:22,180
but he is just the middle.

111
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:26,780
So,

112
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:29,260
that's how it is.

113
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:31,620
I didn't expect

114
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:33,500
that I would give the sword

115
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:35,540
to the person who gave the sword

116
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:37,060
to the person who gave the sword to the person who gave the sword.

117
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,020
I wonder if the princess of Huaiqing

118
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,380
has any more than one point

119
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:43,020
in the person who made the sword.

120
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:44,660
Let me see.

121
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:48,300
What are you doing?

122
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,380
I just want to see.

123
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:51,300
I'm so busy.

124
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:54,980
I have a key.

125
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,340
I have a key, too.

126
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:57,140
I'll just take a look.

127
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:57,940
I won't wait for you.

128
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,740
The crown prince is here.

129
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:03,060
The crown prince is here.

130
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,500
Why are you so noisy again?

131
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,820
You're not going back to Shaoying Palace?

132
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,380
I heard

133
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:12,740
that Huaiqing made a talent

134
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:13,780
to attack the people.

135
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:15,340
I just want to see

136
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,300
what kind of talent he is.

137
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:18,860
Huaiqing,

138
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,500
how is he?

139
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:21,660
Can he be a official?

140
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:23,140
Image...

141
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:26,700
Mr. Huang� started an affair.

142
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,220
I will make the dutyatherine happy.

143
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:35,780
Watch your mouth.

144
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:43,740
icias of Huaiqing is a distinguished talent.

145
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,380
と思等人才

146
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,220
must be so obsessed with him.

147
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:50,260
No way.

148
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,860
Xia Shi.

149
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:57,940
Li undress me.

150
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:58,860
What's wrong?

151
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:00,060
There are six weapons.

152
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:00,780
Six?

153
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:02,860
Thank goodness.

154
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,940
Rules and Secretary Fingers are really military men.

155
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:07,140
You know how to拼 and measure yourself

156
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,380
with a cube of emptyagnos and hen marker.

157
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:08,980
Each zou had a bo rush.

158
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:10,180
Go ahead and beat up me.

159
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:12,020
I thought you'd investigate�

160
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:15,900
Da Ge.

161
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:16,780
You're alone.

162
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:18,820
He's with you.

163
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:21,020
After last night,

164
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:21,820
What about the other one?

165
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:22,540
Fine.

166
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:23,660
I'll help you.

167
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,020
It's too dangerous.

168
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:26,820
Since it's dangerous,

169
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:29,020
the family will be in danger.

170
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:31,100
The first one to move forward is as silent as the first one.

171
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:32,220
Here.

172
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,140
Help me pick one for you.

173
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:33,620
Here.

174
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:37,940
There's a leather one.

175
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,300
I'll give you something.

176
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,020
Shen Ke Tou.

177
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:51,820
Miss Fang.

178
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:52,580
Master Shen.

179
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:53,660
What's going on?

180
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:55,820
Master.

181
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:56,740
It's still not working.

182
00:07:58,260 --> 00:07:59,500
Officer Zhang.

183
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:04,820
The lady just left.

184
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:06,220
She's still missing.

185
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:06,900
She hasn't returned.

186
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:07,700
She's in the city.

187
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:10,980
Brother.

188
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:12,620
Did you snatch her out?

189
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,300
She was heavily found.

190
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,660
And she's the best father of the Zhu Lian Julu Diesegui.

191
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:18,620
Even I was faced with that.

192
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:19,780
No means no.

193
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:20,860
To make you study hard.

194
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:21,700
They...

195
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,020
They won't go to me, right?

196
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,020
I said you're not hiding anything from me.

197
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:25,860
What if the elders

198
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,020
are angry about such a big thing?

199
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:29,740
You're right.

200
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,620
They really like it.

201
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:34,660
I don't understand.

202
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:35,660
What about 100 taels?

203
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:36,780
If you like the drama,

204
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:37,820
I'll help you move the house.

205
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:38,940
Xiao Yue will help you

206
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:39,500
to plant some flowers.

207
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,380
It's so good.

208
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:41,140
Yes.

209
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:42,340
Don't look at it as a movie.

210
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:43,660
It's a good location.

211
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:44,300
You go out and...

212
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:45,380
It's so cool.

213
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:46,860
You're in the middle of the night.

214
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,540
It's a good place to have a movie.

215
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:50,580
The left turn is the private school.

216
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:53,300
I am very familiar with the private school.

217
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,260
It's very fun to

218
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,640
come here with your kids in the morning.

219
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,220
How are you going to say that?

220
00:08:58,860 --> 00:08:59,660
Mister.

221
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:00,540
How are you?

222
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:01,940
It's a playhouse.

223
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:02,980
What do you mean?

224
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:03,340
Ba Dhuan Song!

225
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:05,260
People in this place are so Illeg Nation.

226
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:06,220
Why are they so Brux.

227
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:07,160
How old are they?

228
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,140
What should we do?

229
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,260
Okay, let's inform them.

230
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:14,380
We have some matters.

231
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,180
It's not much.

232
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:22,580
I think you misunderstood this.

233
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:24,580
We didn't want to sell your house.

234
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:31,580
We are rent.

235
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:33,580
You said you wouldn't come back.

236
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:35,580
The house is also empty.

237
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:36,580
Right?

238
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:37,580
How good is the rent?

239
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:42,580
Uncle and Aunt.

240
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:44,580
You are really...

241
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:45,580
Really...

242
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:49,580
You are really good.

243
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:55,580
You are really good.

244
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:56,580
You are really good.

245
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:57,580
I don't want to sell my house.

246
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:58,580
Uncle and Aunt.

247
00:09:58,580 --> 00:09:59,580
I am your family.

248
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,580
I will sell my house as soon as I leave.

249
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:03,580
I don't want to live in this house.

250
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:04,580
It's easy to sell.

251
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:05,580
Are you still selling?

252
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:06,580
No.

253
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:07,580
No.

254
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:10,580
Fine.

255
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,580
I am a little hungry.

256
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:16,580
I am hungry.

257
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:17,580
I will go to the kitchen to see

258
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:18,580
what is prepared.

259
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:19,580
I will make a meal for you.

260
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:21,580
I will make a meal for you.

261
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:24,580
It's done.

262
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:25,580
What are you doing?

263
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:27,580
Go to the kitchen.

264
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:28,580
Hurry up.

265
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:30,580
I will not do anything.

266
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:42,580
The watermelon is almost done.

267
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:43,580
You are so ugly.

268
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:44,580
Go to the toilet.

269
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:49,580
What?

270
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:51,580
You are so angry.

271
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:57,580
Is there a master who is so angry?

272
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:58,580
No.

273
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:01,580
I was washing the water in our yard.

274
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:03,580
Then I was soaked in the medicine.

275
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:04,580
I was in a daze for a long time.

276
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:05,580
When the end of the day,

277
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:06,580
the inner layer is closed.

278
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:07,580
So I didn't come back.

279
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:09,580
Uncle.

280
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:10,580
I have opened the door.

281
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:11,580
I have opened the door.

282
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,580
Wash the water.

283
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:17,580
I don't want to ask.

284
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:19,580
What are you doing?

285
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:21,580
This is not a cheap thing.

286
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:24,580
You have been in the wild and still want to use this for you.

287
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:25,580
No.

288
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:35,580
You are a man.

289
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:38,580
You are a man.

290
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:39,580
What is going on?

291
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:42,580
Actually,

292
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:44,580
the master recommended me.

293
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,580
Master Zhang Hong.

294
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,580
I was also a man at the beginning.

295
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:50,580
I was in the private room before.

296
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:51,580
I was with him.

297
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:54,580
Is it because I made a move to him?

298
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:58,580
Or because I was so arrogant.

299
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:00,580
I was so mad at him.

300
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:06,580
You were in the school to do the acupuncture in Yunlu.

301
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:07,580
The master was there.

302
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:09,580
He took your poem.

303
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:11,580
He was so kind.

304
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:15,580
He must have been so arrogant at that time.

305
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:18,580
What a pity.

306
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:20,580
It turns out that he was looking at my poem.

307
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:24,580
But you have to be careful.

308
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:25,580
Brother.

309
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:26,580
You have to be careful.

310
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,580
Princess Tao is very sincere.

311
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:32,580
She has been in the school for years.

312
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:35,580
And she has been in the hospital for half a year.

313
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:36,580
She is very good at it.

314
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:37,580
She is very good at it.

315
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:39,580
She recommended you to follow her.

316
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:41,580
You are not a coward.

317
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:48,580
Brother.

318
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:52,580
Do you seem to know about these great characters?

319
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:55,580
The world is full of students.

320
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:58,580
They are all like the master and the master.

321
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:00,580
I know these are not strange.

322
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:03,580
Tell me.

323
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:05,580
What kind of person is Wei Gong?

324
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:06,580
What is his nickname?

325
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:07,580
Well.

326
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:08,580
His appetite.

327
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:10,580
His body language.

328
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:13,580
Is he a little girl?

329
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:14,580
Brother.

330
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:17,580
You are thinking about these things.

331
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:19,580
What do you mean by that?

332
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:21,580
This is called the name of the head.

333
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:22,580
Think about it.

334
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:24,580
If I were the head of Wei Gong.

335
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:27,580
Isn't our Xu family a poor family?

336
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:28,580
Be careful.

337
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:29,580
Father.

338
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:30,580
Tell me.

339
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:32,580
Where did you learn these dirty things?

340
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:34,580
Brother.

341
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:37,580
Your brother is thinking about it.

342
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,580
Tell your brother what you know.

343
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:43,580
But Ning Yan.

344
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:47,580
The people of Da Geng are not as good as the people of Chang Le.

345
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:51,580
You must be careful there.

346
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:54,580
Don't make the master angry.

347
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:55,580
Yes.

348
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:57,580
How about this?

349
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:58,580
You.

350
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:00,580
See me in the people of Da Geng.

351
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:01,580
Look.

352
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:02,580
We are together.

353
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:04,580
I can help you at that time.

354
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:05,580
Right?

355
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:07,580
Uncle.

356
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,580
Do you want to fight with someone?

357
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:15,580
I am not doing this for the sake of our people.

358
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:18,580
Fight with someone is to be smart.

359
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:20,580
Hey.

360
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:22,580
You are going to drop me into the bowl.

361
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:27,580
Uncle.

362
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:28,580
Listen to me.

363
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:29,580
I have something on my hand.

364
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:30,580
I have nothing on my hand.

365
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:32,580
You can ask us a few questions.

366
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,580
We only talk about the truth.

367
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:35,580
We only talk about the lie.

368
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:36,580
Let's start.

369
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:37,580
What lie?

370
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:40,580
Brother is giving you a hint.

371
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:41,580
Yes.

372
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:43,580
What is the hint?

373
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:47,580
Brother.

374
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:48,580
Let's talk about the stomach.

375
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:49,580
Let's go.

376
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:52,580
It hasn't started yet.

377
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:54,580
What are you running?

378
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:04,580
How are you doing?

379
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:05,580
Don't breathe, my son.

380
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:11,580
All I have is my temperament to create a murder.

381
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:23,580
Ren An.

382
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:25,580
Brother.

383
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:27,580
That's simile.

384
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:28,580
Since I got him on purpose,

385
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:29,580
I need a minute's time.

386
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:31,580
So annoying.

387
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:34,420
a Nora special for you?

388
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:35,580
Hold on!

389
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:57,580
Excuse me.

390
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:58,660
It's nicely cooked.

391
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,540
Better than the traditional one.

392
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:01,260
Great.

393
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:03,740
Brother, you should eat too.

394
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:05,540
Look at you.

395
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:06,700
You're like a princess.

396
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:08,620
You're a grown-up child.

397
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:11,340
By the way,

398
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,940
the year is the eighth birthday of the royal grandmother.

399
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:16,180
Father has always been filial to her.

400
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:17,540
He's very important to her.

401
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,780
He will not only set up a grand event,

402
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:22,340
but also hold a grand banquet in Taiqing Palace

403
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:23,540
to celebrate the birthday of the emperor.

404
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:25,620
Don't worry, brother.

405
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:27,700
I've already invited the grand prince

406
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,820
to prepare for the grand banquet.

407
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:31,580
Actually, I...

408
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:35,500
I don't want you to take part in the grand banquet.

409
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:38,820
Mother has always been strict.

410
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:40,940
She always asks for the grand banquet.

411
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,460
As a princess,

412
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:44,300
the grand event in the palace

413
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:46,420
must be celebrated with a clear mind.

414
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:49,500
Mother is like this.

415
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:52,860
The others are like this.

416
00:16:58,420 --> 00:16:58,940
Brother.

417
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,660
How is your highness?

418
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:07,340
I'm fine.

419
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:08,660
I didn't expect this.

420
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,420
I really can't take part in the grand banquet.

421
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,260
I don't know how much trouble I'll have.

422
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:16,540
Your highness, you're a little bit naive.

423
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:19,100
Princess Ling'an will definitely change her mind.

424
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,620
Otherwise, when we passed the four-day ceremony yesterday,

425
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:25,060
I was so disappointed.

426
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:26,540
I was so disappointed.

427
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,460
Five-year-old Yuen, ten-year-old Shun,

428
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:34,580
and a great victory.

429
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:36,460
The child is really a genius.

430
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:38,940
I'm not a genius, I'm Xu Xin Nian.

431
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:39,660
I'm a great fan.

432
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:42,860
I'm a genius.

433
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,020
I'm a genius.

434
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:45,780
I'm just a genius.

435
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:47,300
I'm a genius.

436
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,300
I'm a genius.

437
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,060
I'm a genius.

438
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:51,860
In 2025, I'll be a good luck-gatherer.

439
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:53,620
I'll wear a red dress.

440
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:54,980
I'll be a good luck-gatherer.

441
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:56,340
I'll be a good luck-gatherer.

442
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,660
The first round of the grand banquet.

443
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:58,660
The first round of the grand banquet.

444
00:17:58,660 --> 00:17:59,660
The first round of the grand banquet.

445
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:00,660
The first round of the grand banquet.

446
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:02,660
The family will all be prepared.

447
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:03,740
The horse is not suitable.

448
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:04,940
The face is not suitable.

449
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:05,780
The last time we held a banquet,

450
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:06,860
we all wore red dress.

451
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:07,860
The brand you want,

452
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:08,820
the price you like,

453
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,140
is all on the banquet.

454
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:14,260
Gangzi.

455
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:17,740
Get ready.

456
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:18,580
Wash your face.

457
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,660
Let's move to the public house.

458
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:24,380
We live in the palace.

459
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:26,700
Why do you move to the public house?

460
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,060
We're going to have a meeting.

461
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:32,780
It's convenient to take a look outside.

462
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,900
No, princess.

463
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:38,820
The Noble Consort of the former palace just scolded you.

464
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:41,060
She won't agree to it.

465
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:42,100
Don't worry.

466
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,700
It's mainly for a better thing.

467
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:44,940
Mother won't blame you.

468
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,020
But

469
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:48,500
didn't the crown prince

470
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,900
want you to interfere in the meeting?

471
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:56,180
He lied.

472
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:59,060
Those words

473
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:01,180
comfort me.

474
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:03,460
Actually, he

475
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,820
really wants me to help him.

476
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:08,860
Really?

477
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:09,700
Princess.

478
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:10,340
Of course.

479
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:11,540
I'm a brother.

480
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:13,300
I don't know what he thinks.

481
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:15,260
Besides,

482
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:16,940
he can only help me.

483
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:18,460
I can't help him, either.

484
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:21,060
It's settled.

485
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:21,980
Write it down.

486
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:24,740
Let's do our best

487
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,700
to prepare for the meeting.

488
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:29,700
But other princes and girls

489
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:32,020
have been preparing for it.

490
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:34,100
We're in the process of

491
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:37,340
getting rid of all the four princes.

492
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,780
Don't worry.

493
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:40,700
Let's look for them.

494
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:43,580
By the way,

495
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:45,860
I'll share this cow's milk and snow.

496
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:53,700
shedding

497
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,420
from the battle

498
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,820
Snowfall

499
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:13,060
checked

500
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:22,940
It's so hot.

501
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:31,500
How long has it been?

502
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:34,020
How long?

503
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:35,060
I don't know.

504
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:36,660
If I had breakfast today,

505
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:38,060
my brother would be here.

506
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:46,180
Xu Ning.

507
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:49,980
Hello.

508
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,700
Look at the clothes.

509
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:53,980
I feel like my sleeves are tight.

510
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,180
You're doing business.

511
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:56,660
Are you having breakfast?

512
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:57,780
I know.

513
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:59,460
It must be because I've been practicing.

514
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:02,060
I've gained a lot of weight recently.

515
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:04,740
I said this pants is also so tight.

516
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:06,660
I'm so excited.

517
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:07,700
I forgot to measure it.

518
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:09,580
I'll keep it for two years.

519
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:11,620
I must show it to you.

520
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:15,820
Is it time for the wedding?

521
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,660
It's really weird.

522
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:19,060
A few days ago,

523
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,820
aunt wanted to go to the wedding.

524
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,460
She's so confident today.

525
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:23,700
Is that possible?

526
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:25,980
She's working now.

527
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:28,220
The neighbors saw her.

528
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:30,220
It's good to not give her a chance to go to the palace.

529
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,700
Don't be ridiculous.

530
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,180
My brother is not like this.

531
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:36,740
I think my brother really wants to do business for the people.

532
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:39,540
That's why he's so serious about working.

533
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:40,300
Here.

534
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:47,620
Please take a look at me.

535
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:50,780
My knife and my clothes are not very good.

536
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:52,540
Quite large.

537
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:54,740
Please.

538
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:57,980
Incense knew through with the someone.

539
00:21:58,420 --> 00:21:59,340
You're in charge.

540
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:02,660
She gives me a cough.

541
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:06,260
I think her name isn't so much.

542
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:09,580
You're not much.

543
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:22,420
Let's go.

544
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,140
veel ?!

545
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:32,760

Fuck up those interpolates within a todas esta tinc f dopo

to attach attendants to Pou

549
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:43,880
as long as they come and deal with him

550
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,220
So guys,

551
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,440
as you know,

552
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,640
we won't stay doing depressing things

553
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,500
investigation...

554
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,620
Don't do it.

555
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:55,640
ONG רק

556
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,680
drug.

557
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,940
or stalking.

558
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,760
everybody can Legendary overall

559
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:06,980
no power for the beloved

560
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,180
rules

561
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:12,180
ระ.

562
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:13,280
hello behalf of

563
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,960
any person

564
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,000
long sign

565
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,800
Three, inspect the officials and collect the intelligence.

566
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:24,200
Anyone in the big scene

567
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,000
can use the eyes of the enemy.

568
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,480
Use the hands of the enemy.

569
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,800
The secret passage of the Tianji Pavilion

570
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,520
will be returned to the world.

571
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,720
It's hard to get close to the enemy.

572
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,920
The enemy is very powerful.

573
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,560
No matter you are a worker,

574
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,640
a guard,

575
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,040
we have the right to investigate.

576
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,920
This is the most powerful intelligence in the big scene.

577
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,960
Unintentional search and intelligence.

578
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,600
Finally, the analysis.

579
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:05,480
Add the investigation and investigation

580
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,720
and the investigation and investigation

581
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,280
will be a daily daily.

582
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,600
Xu Qian, are you ready?

583
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,720
Yes, I am.

584
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,160
I am ready.

585
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,000
Come on.

586
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,520
Are we going to investigate the case

587
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,960
or send the intelligence?

588
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,160
Why?

589
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:24,360
Why not start working as a uniformly working force or ownITAF officer?

590
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,400
Insolent.

591
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,120
Hey, Sun Yong.

592
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,280
Forget it.

593
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,760
Have a good look at the evidence bureau before.

594
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:46,080
Nonono.

595
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,640
This is Tearing People Into Tears.

596
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:51,480
Tearing People Into Tears 4, Please jijuan.

597
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:00,240
Hey bride.

598
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,180
I have finished talking.

599
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:04,240
I'mows me to dance.

600
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:05,760
Hey bride.

601
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:08,840
Hey brother.

602
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,080
Hey hiremen.

603
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,600
You so laid back.

604
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,160
Why bother me?

605
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,580
Youいつ.....

606
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:14,540
You can't fit on hearing your words.

607
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,820
Have enough respect.

608
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:16,900
Just let him watch the show.

609
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:18,140
He can't go anywhere.

610
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:19,580
He...

611
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:21,140
Mr. Tao, you're not doing well.

612
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:24,940
What's wrong with him?

613
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:26,500
He's not a person to us.

614
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:28,380
I want to go to the police.

615
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:29,860
Okay.

616
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:32,660
I see.

617
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:33,900
Mr. Tao must have misunderstood.

618
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:34,940
Wait, Mr. Tao.

619
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:36,260
Let me explain.

620
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:37,260
Who's that?

621
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:37,860
He misunderstood.

622
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:38,820
He didn't.

623
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:39,580
He's against you.

624
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:41,660
No, Mr. Tao.

625
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:42,540
We're going out.

626
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:43,700
Be careful.

627
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:44,300
Be careful.

628
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:44,980
Be careful.

629
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:47,780
Who's it?

630
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:48,780
The string broke!

631
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:49,820
Did you lets this bed go away?

632
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:58,260
It's amazing.

633
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:16,380
What?

634
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:19,100
Dad,

635
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:20,340
you've been out for so long.

636
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:21,460
Why haven't you come back yet?

637
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:23,780
I'll go and check on you later.

638
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:25,740
We can't use such a big trick.

639
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:27,460
Such a big person

640
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:28,500
should be strong.

641
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:29,980
We should be strong.

642
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:32,420
Don't worry too much.

643
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:33,220
It's okay.

644
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,740
Why is the word so familiar?

645
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:39,020
Didn't you say it before?

646
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:45,100
Look, look, look.

647
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,380
What did you say?

648
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,260
This is Xu Qian's house.

649
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:52,820
Yes, yes.

650
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:53,980
The order of the emperor,

651
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:54,940
Xu Qian,

652
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:55,940
is it the crown prince?

653
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:57,180
It's a joke.

654
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:00,420
Come in.

655
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:01,420
Come in.

656
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:02,420
Hurry up.

657
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:03,740
What time is it?

658
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:04,340
Left.

659
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:04,980
Right there.

660
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:06,140
Just go in.

661
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:06,860
Come on.

662
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:07,940
Drink some water.

663
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:08,620
Right here.

664
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:09,900
Let's go.

665
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,220
I'll get you some tea later.

666
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:11,940
It's time to go.

667
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:12,900
There's something.

668
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:14,020
Come on.

669
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:15,140
Close the door.

670
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:16,300
Little Longqiao.

671
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:17,180
Okay.

672
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:18,020
Forget about this.

673
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:19,580
Our door windows

674
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:20,860
have been closed.

675
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:21,940
But recently,

676
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:23,260
the construction staff of this house,

677
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:24,220
you can see

678
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:25,940
which place needs to come more.

679
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:27,140
You can go there yourself.

680
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:29,820
Are you his uncle?

681
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:30,980
You're not bad.

682
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:33,500
I can tell.

683
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:34,540
But this is your house.

684
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:35,420
You can come.

685
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:36,260
Okay.

686
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:37,060
I'll come.

687
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:37,900
Okay.

688
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:43,140
You really don't want to come?

689
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:44,820
You really don't want to?

690
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:45,580
Fine.

691
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:47,420
I'll go get it.

692
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:56,260
Xu Qian,

693
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:58,020
your family is really...

694
00:27:58,020 --> 00:27:59,340
You're so old.

695
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:05,380
I don't know.

696
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:08,580
What?

697
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:10,140
Who's the prince

698
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:11,700
who's trying to hide the secret?

699
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:16,020
It's too old-fashioned.

700
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:20,860
Where's the Imperial College?

701
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:21,980
Did you go there?

702
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,460
Don't mention it, Your Highness.

703
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:25,980
The talents of the Imperial College

704
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:27,660
were taken by the seventh prince.

705
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:29,060
The students of Zhiyaxuan

706
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:30,660
were taken by the fourth prince.

707
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:33,220
I was about to go to Mingde Village.

708
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:35,260
But I met the eighth prince's eunuch.

709
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:36,700
He came to us.

710
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:39,260
What should we do?

711
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:43,860
Yunlu Academy.

712
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:45,620
The one who stole Huaiqing from the Academy.

713
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:48,620
I've never heard of it.

714
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:50,740
I'm not sure.

715
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:52,380
They agreed.

716
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:53,780
What about them?

717
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:55,660
I didn't let them come.

718
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:58,100
I read what they wrote.

719
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:04,660
They wrote

720
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:06,980
Yunlu Academy,

721
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:08,860
the one who stole the military law,

722
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:10,540
and the one who stole the crown prince.

723
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,260
Right.

724
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:13,620
The Academy is so big.

725
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:15,500
They can't even find a writer.

726
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:17,380
The one who stole the

727
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:18,460
Song of Mianyang Pavilion

728
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:20,340
was the one who stole

729
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:22,060
the Song of Mianyang Pavilion.

730
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:26,060
It's like this.

731
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:30,780
Your Highness, please take a look.

732
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:34,460
She's reading the дужеi with a Bahamut effect.

733
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:35,780
As Abduced Knot,

734
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:36,840
I, Su Yanxiang,

735
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:37,900
raise my trust and evaluate you very much.

736
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:38,860
Your Highness,

737
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:41,700
what do you think of this poem?

738
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:46,380
This poem?

739
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:52,980
There's quite an emphasis on this poem.

740
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:55,860
This poem is about

741
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:58,760
the modern poems sent by

742
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,260
the teaching department.

743
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:01,380
and make a poem.

744
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:03,020
It's so mysterious.

745
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:04,620
I heard that

746
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:07,380
the prince IV, prince VII, prince VIII, and prince XIII

747
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:08,940
have sent people to the Temple of the Temple of the Temple.

748
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:10,100
They've spent several days

749
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:12,300
to find the person who wrote the poem.

750
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:14,260
It's good that he's included in the meeting.

751
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:15,420
The poem is a mystery.

752
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:17,180
It's him.

753
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:18,700
Thank you for everything.

754
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:20,380
Find the person who wrote the poem for me.

755
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:22,540
Yes.

756
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:23,940
Hurry up and go.

757
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:29,380
Yang Ling?

758
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:31,380
I'm really sorry to keep trying.

759
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,060
Okay.

760
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:35,500
Thank you for everything.

761
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:54,700
You just finished the anth thesis?

762
00:30:58,420 --> 00:30:59,660
What is this?

763
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:01,060
OK.

764
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:02,780
It's a good idea.

765
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:04,820
Song.

766
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:07,340
I've read the sentence.

767
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,940
I've read the rules in the yard many times.

768
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:11,380
So,

769
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:14,060
can we execute the task?

770
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:17,940
OK.

771
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:18,860
Wang.

772
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:20,620
Do we have a task?

773
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:22,940
Yes.

774
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:25,380
Yes.

775
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:26,060
Good buddy.

776
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:27,260
Good buddy.

777
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:32,300
My eyes are looking at you.

778
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:38,860
You should care about me.

779
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:41,060
How can I care about you?

780
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:42,220
It's a good job.

781
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:44,540
OK.

782
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:55,820
What is it?

783
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:02,260
Episode 1

784
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,260
Serve the dishes.

785
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:11,260
This is the next round.

786
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:12,260
This is the next round.

787
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:13,260
This is the next round.

788
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:15,260
One round, one round.

789
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:17,260
Brothers, please step down.

790
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:21,260
Brothers,

791
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:22,260
thank you for your hard work.

792
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:26,260
Close the door.

793
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:28,260
The color is good.

794
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:29,260
Don't open it.

795
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:30,260
Okay.

796
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:32,260
By the way,

797
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:45,860
although our

798
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:47,260
brothers are not secretaries,

799
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:49,260
if you are stolen or damaged,

800
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:51,260
you will be punished.

801
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:52,260
I...

802
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:54,260
Brother.

803
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:55,260
Brother.

804
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:56,260
Brother.

805
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:57,260
Brother.

806
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:58,260
Brother.

807
00:32:58,260 --> 00:32:59,260
Brother,

808
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:00,260
what is this?

809
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:02,260
It's okay.

810
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:03,260
I can't open my mouth.

811
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:04,260
Let go of my leg first.

812
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:05,260
Listen to me.

813
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:06,260
I won't let you go.

814
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:07,260
I have a little problem with my daily life.

815
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:08,260
I'm almost dead.

816
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:10,260
Do you know

817
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:12,260
there is a hot spot called the forbidden eye?

818
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:14,260
I can see my eyes here.

819
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:15,260
If you don't open it,

820
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:16,260
I'll get blind.

821
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:17,260
Open it.

822
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,260
Help me, brother.

823
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:19,260
Brother.

824
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:20,260
Brother, are we good brothers?

825
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:21,260
No.

826
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:22,260
You are busy.

827
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:23,260
You are so busy.

828
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:24,260
You are so hard-working.

829
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:25,260
I don't want to live.

830
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:26,260
I want to be a task.

831
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:27,260
You want me to do my work.

832
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:30,260
I'll do my job.

833
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:31,260
I'll do my work.

834
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:32,260
I'll do my job.

835
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,260
I'll do my work.

836
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:34,260
I'll do my job.

837
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:35,260
I'll do my work.

838
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:37,260
Hurry up.

839
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:42,260
Yang Ling.

840
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:52,260
You finished watching?

841
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:57,260
This is the dance.

842
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:00,260
The dance is called the forbidden eye.

843
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:02,260
I want to put every scroll on it.

844
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:03,260
And the personal idea.

845
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:05,260
All of them are on the forbidden eye.

846
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:06,260
In this way,

847
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:08,260
I can guarantee the forbidden eye

848
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:10,260
and the whole world.

849
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:12,260
You two can be more convenient

850
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:13,260
when you turn the music up.

851
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,260
Good idea.

852
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:18,260
Brother Song.

853
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:20,260
I finished watching the scroll.

854
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:22,260
I've read the rules in the door.

855
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:24,260
So,

856
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:27,260
can we do the work?

857
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:30,260
Sure.

858
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:31,260
Guangqiao.

859
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:33,260
Do we have a job?

860
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:35,260
Yes.

861
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:38,260
Yes.

862
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:39,260
Good job.

863
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:40,260
Good job.

864
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:47,260
You're making fun of me.

865
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:49,260
What do you mean?

866
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:50,260
You're so good.

867
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:54,260
What's this?

868
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:00,260
It's a meal.

869
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:02,260
This is the next round.

870
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:03,260
This is the next round.

871
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:04,260
This is the next round.

872
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:06,260
One more round.

873
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:08,260
Brothers, please stand up.

874
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:11,260
Brothers,

875
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:13,260
you've worked hard.

876
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:17,260
Close the door.

877
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:18,260
Close the door.

878
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:20,260
Don't open the door.

879
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:21,260
Okay.

880
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:24,260
By the way,

881
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:26,260
we have a lot of people here.

882
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:27,260
By the way,

883
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:28,260
although we're not

884
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:29,260
a secret drug,

885
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:31,260
you must keep your promise.

886
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:33,260
Once you're seen or damaged,

887
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:35,260
you'll be punished.

888
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:41,260
Brother Song.

889
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:42,260
Brother Song.

890
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:43,260
Brother Song.

891
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:49,260
Brother Song.

892
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:50,260
Tell me about the head.

893
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:51,260
Tell me about it.

894
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:52,260
I'm asking him.

895
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:53,260
I'm asking him

896
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:55,260
when he's going to die.

897
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:58,260
It's okay. I can't talk.

898
00:35:58,260 --> 00:35:59,260
Let go of my leg.

899
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:00,260
Listen to me.

900
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:01,260
I won't let go of your leg.

901
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:02,260
I'm going to be a little devil

902
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:03,260
in this world.

903
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:05,260
Do you know

904
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:06,260
there's a drug called

905
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:07,260
the eye of the mirror?

906
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:09,260
I'm going to see my eyes.

907
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:10,260
If you don't open it,

908
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:11,260
I'll open my eyes.

909
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:12,260
Open it.

910
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:13,260
Are you going to blame me?

911
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:14,260
Brother Song.

912
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:15,260
Brother Song.

913
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:16,260
Are we good brothers?

914
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:17,260
You're so busy.

915
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:18,260
You're so busy.

916
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:19,260
You're a new business.

917
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,260
I'm not going to live.

918
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:21,260
I'm going to work.

919
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:22,260
You let me do my work.

920
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:23,260
I'm going to be a machine.

921
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:24,260
I'm going to work.

922
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:25,260
Be careful.

923
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:26,260
Be careful.

924
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:27,260
Brother Song.

925
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:29,260
You're a bad guy.

926
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:32,260
Did you hear that?

927
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:33,260
You're calling me?

928
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:34,260
You should go back first.

929
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:36,260
Or you can go back to see Mr. Jun.

930
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:37,260
And Mr. Xu.

931
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:38,260
You must be a bad guy.

932
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:42,260
The big yellow mountain of Taikang County

933
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:43,260
has a monster attack.

934
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:44,260
A lot of people have eaten it.

935
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:46,260
You should go and check it out.

936
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:49,260
If the level of the monster is not high,

937
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:51,260
you should go to the scene.

938
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:54,260
Jin Zhaofu will also help you.

939
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:57,260
They are waiting outside the yard.

940
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:58,260
Zeng Ling.

941
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:01,260
Xu Qi'an.

942
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:03,260
Go with them.

943
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:08,260
Zeng Ling.

944
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:11,260
The big yellow mountain is a dangerous place.

945
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:13,260
You must cooperate with each other.

946
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:14,260
Okay.

947
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:17,260
And...

948
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:28,260
The knife is two inches long.

949
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:30,260
Take one inch from the left.

950
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:34,260
Go.

951
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:45,260
Jin Zhaofu also ordered medicine.

952
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:50,260
Xu Qi'an is a scumbag.

953
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:53,260
Xu Qi'an is a scumbag.

954
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:56,260
Xu Qi'an.

955
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:57,260
What's your little brother's name?

956
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:59,260
Why does he suddenly turn his head to you?

957
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:00,260
I don't know.

958
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:02,260
Is it because I'm a general manager?

959
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:03,260
I'm a senior in the prison.

960
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:04,260
It's impossible.

961
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:06,260
He has a name.

962
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:08,260
It's not easy to change his name.

963
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:09,260
I know.

964
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:11,260
He wants you to die.

965
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:13,260
Oh, that's right.

966
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:14,260
Last year,

967
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:15,260
there was a little guy.

968
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:16,260
Didn't he die outside?

969
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:18,260
The mountain is full of blood.

970
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:19,260
I'm so happy.

971
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:21,260
I hope you can say something.

972
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:22,260
Look, I can change myself.

973
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:24,260
I've seen three adults.

974
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:27,260
No, you...

975
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:28,260
The common people in Da Gengren

976
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:29,260
can ride horses.

977
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:30,260
The carriage is unnecessary.

978
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:31,260
It's about the monster.

979
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:33,260
Mr. Chen asked for the four-day sword

980
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:34,260
to help investigate.

981
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:35,260
He's going with us.

982
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:37,260
Four-day sword?

983
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:38,260
Yes.

984
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:43,260
Da Gengren and I, Song Tingfeng,

985
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:46,260
have seen the four-day swordsmen.

986
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:48,260
They asked everyone,

987
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:50,260
each of them is crazy.

988
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:51,260
Today,

989
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:53,260
we'll play together.

990
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:54,260
Don't touch me.

991
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:56,260
This is a little bad.

992
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:00,260
Xu Xian, don't touch me.

993
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:01,260
Hurry up.

994
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:09,260
Xu Xian.

995
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:12,260
Miss Caiwei,

996
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:13,260
it's really you.

997
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:15,260
Don't ride the horse.

998
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:16,260
Come on, let's ride the carriage.

999
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:17,260
Okay.

1000
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:20,260
This is for you.

1001
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:22,260
Thanks.

1002
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:24,260
I'll go in and see you.

1003
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:28,260
Get in.

1004
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:31,260
What's going on?

1005
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:40,260
So it's because

1006
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:41,260
you asked me to come out

1007
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:42,260
to do business.

1008
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:44,260
Not all of it.

1009
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:46,260
Yang Yan told me

1010
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:48,260
that you've joined Da Gengren.

1011
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:50,260
If you want to fight with Da Gengren,

1012
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:51,260
you'd better wear it.

1013
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:52,260
Yang Jingzong.

1014
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:55,260
I'm still curious.

1015
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:57,260
Why did you join Da Gengren?

1016
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:01,260
Why did you throw the sword?

1017
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:02,260
I'm scared.

1018
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:04,260
I'm not scared.

1019
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:06,260
His back is so stiff.

1020
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:07,260
You're wearing shoes for him.

1021
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:08,260
I'm scared.

1022
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:09,260
You can't say that.

1023
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:10,260
Don't be with me.

1024
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:11,260
I asked him to have dinner.

1025
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:14,260
Who told you that?

1026
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:16,260
The shooting case is over.

1027
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:17,260
Why did you

1028
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:18,260
give the money back to Jingzhao?

1029
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:21,260
I'm angry.

1030
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:23,260
I'm a spy.

1031
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:25,260
The police gave me the whole

1032
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:26,260
of the shooting case.

1033
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:27,260
I found out that

1034
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:28,260
the Zhou Shilang was a spy.

1035
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:29,260
Isn't that good?

1036
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,260
It's good.

1037
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:31,260
I opened the door.

1038
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:33,260
If I break the case,

1039
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:34,260
I'll stay in Jingzhao's house

1040
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:35,260
and continue to investigate the shooting case.

1041
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:36,260
I'll chase the shooting case

1042
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:38,260
until I'm back.

1043
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:40,260
I'm so annoyed.

1044
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:44,260
What did you hear?

1045
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:45,260
Go.

1046
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:49,260
What's his relationship?

1047
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:51,260
They're in the same car.

1048
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:52,260
We're in the same car.

1049
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:54,260
We're in the same car.

1050
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:55,260
We're in the same car.

1051
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:59,260
Xu Qian, you're so good.

1052
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:00,260
You're done.

1053
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:03,260
Xu Qian, you're so good.

1054
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:04,260
Who's that?

1055
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:15,260
Xu Qian, how can you do this?

1056
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:18,260
I'm late.

1057
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:20,260
Xu Qian,

1058
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:22,260
are you hungry?

1059
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:23,260
I'm not hungry.

1060
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:25,260
No, you're hungry.

1061
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:26,260
Take it.

1062
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:27,260
Take it.

1063
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:30,260
Shang Shilang.

1064
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:31,260
Yes.

1065
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:32,260
What's this?

1066
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:35,260
I've been taking some money from you.

1067
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:36,260
I'm paying you back.

1068
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:38,260
I just want to pay you back.

1069
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:40,260
When did I borrow your money?

1070
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:41,260
Pay back.

1071
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:47,260
That's it.

1072
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:49,260
I remember it.

1073
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:50,260
I watch the movie every day.

1074
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:52,260
I don't talk much.

1075
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:53,260
You can talk.

1076
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:55,260
I'll help you.

1077
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:57,260
So many?

1078
00:41:57,260 --> 00:41:58,260
Can you see it?

1079
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:00,260
I'll pay you back.

1080
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:01,260
Okay?

1081
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:02,260
I'll pay you back.

1082
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:04,260
Xu Qian, I have to pay you back.

1083
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:05,260
I'm not afraid of you.

1084
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:09,260
Where are you?

1085
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:10,260
Answer me.

1086
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:12,260
Are you a business man?

1087
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:13,260
Nothing.

1088
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:16,260
Please have some wine.

1089
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:17,260
Okay.

1090
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:19,260
The Grand Mountain of the North of the Haikang County

1091
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:21,260
is over 1,000 meters high.

1092
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:23,260
It's over 10 kilometers from the mountain.

1093
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:25,260
There are many rock salt hidden in the mountain.

1094
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:27,260
It's covered with the mountains.

1095
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:28,260
From the beginning of this year,

1096
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:30,260
a monster was found near the water near the Grand Mountain.

1097
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:32,260
The monster often dies on the shore.

1098
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:34,260
Many of the monsters are killed by the monster.

1099
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:35,260
The monster is broken.

1100
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:37,260
The county magistrate didn't report that the local monster

1101
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:38,260
is still on the mountain.

1102
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:40,260
That's why the mountain is covered with the mountains.

1103
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:42,260
Only a few merchants came here

1104
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:44,260
and reported this to the government.

1105
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:46,260
That's the real place where the local monster

1106
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:47,260
is hiding rock salt.

1107
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:48,260
Yes.

1108
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:50,260
There are high-quality rock salt

1109
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:52,260
and rich iron mine in the Grand Mountain.

1110
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:53,260
It can be used to make and open the rock.

1111
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:55,260
The monster is here to open the rock.

1112
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:57,260
It's very convenient.

1113
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:00,260
It's rich in material and beautiful.

1114
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:01,260
It's very powerful.

1115
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:03,260
So the rich iron is a little bit more famous.

1116
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:05,260
After it's been cut, it's broken.

1117
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:09,260
The rock salt is very famous.

1118
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:12,260
The famous rock salt is the most beautiful food.

1119
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:16,260
It's strange.

1120
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:20,260
What did you find?

1121
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:22,260
Nothing strange.

1122
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:25,260
I was wondering when I was on the mountain.

1123
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:27,260
I thought it was the mountain's rock salt.

1124
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:28,260
It was the mountain's rock salt.

1125
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:30,260
But look at this.

1126
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:32,260
The rock salt is so serious.

1127
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:34,260
I can't forget the dead monster.

1128
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:36,260
Of course.

1129
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:38,260
We still have some clues.

1130
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:39,260
Let's go in.

1131
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:40,260
Let's go.

1132
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:42,260
Don't listen to the door.

1133
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:57,260
Be careful.

1134
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:23,260
Be careful.

1135
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:27,260
Why is the rock so deep?

1136
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:29,260
It's been a while since we checked it.

1137
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:30,260
It's still not over yet.

1138
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:35,260
Maybe we should open something now.

1139
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:37,260
Be careful.

1140
00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:39,260
Listen to me.

1141
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:45,260
What are you looking at?
