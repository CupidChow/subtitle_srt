1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I want to change my mind

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,500
I'm curious about what I'm talking about

3
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,000
I don't want to think about the future

4
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The whole book in my mouth

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Letting the whole world know

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,500
That I'm not too stubborn

7
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,500
When you're here

8
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,500
I'll give you the rules

9
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,000
And keep on being sick

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
And take this big piece of the bowl

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
We're all like a step by step

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
We're all like a step by step

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
We're all like a step by step

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I want to change my mind

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,040
Be woman

16
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,160
And take no counter CCP

17
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,300
Letting the whole feeling have an infected

18
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:13,300
I was so worried

19
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,280
But I didn't have a moment

20
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,400
locked up within the buildings

21
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,240
Of an innocent law

22
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,160
Talking innocent

23
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,140
and lonely

24
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:22,160
There's someone holding my heart

25
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,000
and rem Friend

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,500
Look at my zwei hands

27
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,200
and beOP

28
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,500
Look at my two hands

29
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,180
What is holding back for each other?

30
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:29,220
There are Dahua's memories.

31
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,580
Hang around more toving this solid dream.

32
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:32,820
I'm drained from what's real.

33
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:33,900
Ending the war.

34
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,220
Time stops.

35
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:42,940
ould draw is deep.

36
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,860
Princess there is a trick

37
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:48,460
he can be54 princess no doubt.

38
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,900
Just this trick?

39
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:51,220
Speak no more nonsense.

40
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,060
Falting?

41
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,360
Then the unit

42
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,120
should look for her service.

43
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,420
Yes, as long as you ask her to decide.

44
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:06,800
Then, there will surely not be any dispute with you.

45
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,580
But

46
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,260
He just intentioned

47
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,700
to threaten you

48
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:13,880
then it is because

49
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,740
since I'm from a long distance,

50
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:17,500
I'll do no harm

51
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:19,680
but

52
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:20,960
What do you mean?

53
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:25,660
I don't know,

54
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,220
It doesn't matter.

55
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:33,660
You all know?

56
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,340
Don't touch it.

57
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,180
Move faster.

58
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:56,500
I'll get it after I finish it.

59
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,780
It's ugly.

60
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:00,380
That's right.

61
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,100
Mengmeng.

62
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,340
He poisoned it.

63
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:05,860
He won't.

64
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:07,220
It's true.

65
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,900
Here it is.

66
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,780
The tomato fried egg.

67
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:18,540
Let me see.

68
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:22,460
What else is there?

69
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:23,380
Tell me.

70
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:23,980
I'll do it.

71
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:25,180
Or I'll sleep

72
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,420
and get angry.

73
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:31,700
The sign at the door

74
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:34,100
needs to be polished and colored.

75
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:34,940
That's great.

76
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:35,740
Sister.

77
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:36,300
I'll go now.

78
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:36,900
You eat first.

79
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:37,380
Don't bother me.

80
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:38,340
I'll eat later.

81
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,220
You don't bother me.

82
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:40,180
Niannian.

83
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:43,900
Are you going to break the mirror?

84
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:45,220
You know what, Uncle?

85
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:46,060
Look at the accurate picture.

86
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,100
It's so fast.

87
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:48,380
What's wrong?

88
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:49,380
Are you unhappy?

89
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:50,340
I'm happy.

90
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:51,940
I'm happy.

91
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:53,740
I've lived for decades.

92
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:55,500
I'm hoping I can sleep well.

93
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:57,580
Niannian.

94
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:59,300
I'm really happy for you.

95
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:01,420
How did you practice?

96
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:02,980
Can you teach us?

97
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,100
It's actually very simple.

98
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:04,540
It's just...

99
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:05,300
Niannian.

100
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:06,980
Xu Qi.

101
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:07,740
Say it later.

102
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:08,660
Coming.

103
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:11,820
Niannian.

104
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:12,980
Where did you go yesterday?

105
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:14,100
Ask the mirror first.

106
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,460
I went out yesterday.

107
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:17,140
Why are you here?

108
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:18,180
Aren't you going to repair the wood?

109
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:19,580
Good.

110
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:20,340
Come here.

111
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:23,300
What's the good thing?

112
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,140
Well,

113
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:26,420
don't tell us that we don't take care of you.

114
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:27,500
Go to the supermarket with us.

115
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,180
The supermarket?

116
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:29,340
I'm telling you.

117
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:30,380
Isn't that guy from Taikang?

118
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:31,460
He's in jail.

119
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:33,140
But his family should have been in jail.

120
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:34,260
If my wife were in jail,

121
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:35,260
she would have quit.

122
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:37,460
What's the good thing about the supermarket?

123
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:38,420
I'm still alive.

124
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,100
You didn't go to the supermarket.

125
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,300
You don't understand the rules.

126
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:43,380
When the supermarket is in production,

127
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:45,580
the company will order food and goods in the front yard.

128
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:46,460
They'll be in the car.

129
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:47,620
Then they'll bring the sheep.

130
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,340
But...

131
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,380
They don't participate in the execution.

132
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,980
It's a big deal.

133
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:54,660
Isn't that good?

134
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:56,580
What are you thinking about?

135
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,380
We mean

136
00:04:58,380 --> 00:04:59,740
we should get the things

137
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:00,620
that no one wants.

138
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:00,900
Right?

139
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,660
And then we can't remember the rubbish.

140
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,500
Maybe you have the things in it.

141
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:07,180
What did you say?

142
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,060
How can we...

143
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:11,140
In the reasonable range,

144
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:12,380
we should get the goods.

145
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:12,740
Right.

146
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:15,500
Get changed.

147
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,020
Wait for me.

148
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:16,860
What's the matter?

149
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:17,460
Hurry up.

150
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:18,060
Hurry up.

151
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,140
Uncle, we're eating at home.

152
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:22,980
Hurry up.

153
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:25,140
Have a vampires award.

154
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:25,900
Let's eat.

155
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:28,300
Let's go.

156
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:28,780
Let's go.

157
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:29,580
Let's go.

158
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:30,420
Be quick.

159
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:34,100
My friend,

160
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:36,420
have theância節 nettejas arrived yet?

161
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:45,100
Springose's

162
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,260
The three of you are late.

163
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:47,980
We are...

164
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:50,340
They dig deep into wild animals.

165
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:54,420
Young pode, youngope, are you going to keep your words from me or am I going to say no to you?

166
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,460
Excuse me, excuse me, can I have a word with you?

167
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,340
Yes, can I??

168
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:00,580
You should have invited me would never do this!

169
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:14,860
Feufang, Feufan, you're annoying now!

170
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:16,180
Great, great

171
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:17,620
I need to see all of your friends

172
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:18,980
They want to protect us

173
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:20,660
I would give them my lord's owners

174
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:21,920
Why are you bothering, yes

175
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:22,600
Whoa!

176
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:32,820
beloved knife

177
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,480
Time out

178
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:52,820
Look.

179
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:14,940
Are you tired?

180
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:24,000
Hey, hey, hey

181
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:39,400
Hey

182
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,140
Hey, hey

183
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,340
Come over

184
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:48,980
barefoot

185
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,260
I have it

186
00:07:58,260 --> 00:07:59,700
Don't target other students learning

187
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:00,860
Do you understand?

188
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:04,700
Do not target others

189
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:05,900
Do you understand?

190
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:07,500
Do you understand?

191
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,620
Yes

192
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:09,460
Ok

193
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,140
Good training

194
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:18,880
we can rest here

195

I heard that Zhu Yingluo doesn't like us.

208
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:03,420
He doesn't like Brother Chun, but he doesn't like you.

209
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:06,220
He said that you're a little bit like him.

00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:33,620
Clean it up.

00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:35,620

00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:15,620
Okay.

00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:25,620
What's the matter?

240
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:26,620
You have something to say?

241
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:32,620
Ningning.

242
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:34,620
I'm sorry.

243
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:35,620
I thought it was a good thing.

244
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:36,620
I didn't think about it.

245
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:38,620
No.

246
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:39,620
I'm the one who made you.

247

Ningning.

248
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:43,620
I saw you holding hands many times.

249
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:44,620
You hurt your head.

250
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:51,620
No.

251
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:52,620
You're angry again?

00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:54,620
I'll tell you.

254
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:55,620
This wound can be healed.

255
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:56,620
You'll tell me later.

256
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:57,620
I can't bear to do it.

257
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:58,620
Forget it.

258
00:12:58,620 --> 00:12:59,620
Don't give me a headache.

259
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:04,620
Find a stomach.

260
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:07,620
Let go of me.

261
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:11,620
What's the matter?

262
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:12,620
Don't be impulsive.

263
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:13,620
Don't be impulsive.

264
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:14,620
The door is locked.

265
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:15,620
The nail is not connected.

266
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:17,620
Just work.

267
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:18,620
No.

268
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:19,620
No.

269
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:24,620

275
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:36,620
Please.

276
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:37,620
Please.

277
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:43,620
Get out of here.

278
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:54,620
Go.

279
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:55,620
I...

280
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:56,620
Come.

281
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:57,620
Look at me.

282
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:58,620
I remember your name.

283
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,620
I'll tell Wei Gong about it.

284
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:03,620
Okay.

285
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:04,620
Wait a minute.

286
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,620
I'm looking for a stomach now.

287
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:08,620
I'm so angry.

288
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:13,620
Get up.

289
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:22,620
You're real strangers.

290
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:26,620
One person is me.

291
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:30,620
Please kill me.

292
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:39,620
If you dare to touch him again,

293
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:40,620
I'll sue Wei Gong immediately.

294
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:43,620
I'll kill you.

295
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:56,620
Get out of here.

296
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:03,620
Let go of me.

297
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:06,620
Let go of me.

298
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,620
What are you doing to me?

299
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:17,620
Ningning.

300
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:20,620
Don't move.

301
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:21,620
Don't move.

302
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:22,620
You know the consequence.

303
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:26,620
Let him go.

304
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:28,620
Otherwise, I'll kill you.

305
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:33,620
Did you hear that?

306
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,620
He's going to kill me.

307
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:43,620
Let me go.

308
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:47,620
Okay.

309
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:49,620
I'll see

310
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:52,620
how you'll kill me.

311
00:15:58,620 --> 00:15:59,620
Help me.

312
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:03,620
Help me.

313
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:06,620
Get lost.

314
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:13,620
Help me.

315
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:28,620
Let me go.

316
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:33,620
Remember.

317
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:36,620
Wait for the morning light.

318
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:42,620
Let me go.

319
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:12,620
Let me go.

320
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:39,620
Get out of here.

321
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:40,620
Ningning.

322
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:41,620
Ningning.

323
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:42,620
Ningning.

324
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:43,620
Get out of here.

325
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:44,620
You can't live.

326
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:45,620
Get out of here.

327
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:46,620
I'm going to run.

328
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:48,620
I'll let you go first.

329
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:49,620
What about you?

330
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:52,620
Do you know?

331
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:54,620
Do you know

332
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,620
what you did to me?

333
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:58,620
There's not much to eat.

334
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,620
There's always time.

335
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:03,620
To be higher than life.

336
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:08,620
I'll kill him.

337
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:12,620
I'll kill him.

338
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:25,620
Hongluo, marry Xie'an.

339
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:26,620
Go to the capital.

340
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:27,620
No way.

341
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:29,620
There's a village seal.

342
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:30,620
No way.

343
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:31,620
There's a servant.

344
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:34,620
Wang Xiao.

345
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:35,620
I'll save you.

346
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:36,620
I'll give you the dead body.

347
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:37,620
Sister.

348
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:38,620
Don't let Zhu Yinglong

349
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:39,620
be a servant.

350
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:40,620
You must hold on.

351
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:41,620
Yes.

352
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,620
Get out of here.

353
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:43,620
Get out of here.

354
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:44,620
Get out of here.

355
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:45,620
Yes.

356
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:46,620
Get out of here.

357
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:48,620
Run.

358
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:49,620
Brother.

359
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:50,620
Something big happened.

360
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:51,620
Something big happened.

361
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:53,620
Master, what's going on?

362
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:55,620
Xu Xie'an

363
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:56,620
is almost killed by Zhu Yinglong.

364
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:58,620
Hurry and rescue him.

365
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:00,620
Wang Xiao is on his way back to the house.

366
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:02,620
Zhu Dingluo will know the news soon.

367
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:03,620
I'm afraid that Xu Xie'an

368
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:04,620
will not have the chance to kill him.

369
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:06,620
Hurry.

370
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:07,620
Zhu'er.

371
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:10,620
Zhu'er.

372
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:13,620
Help.

373
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:16,620
There's still a way to save him.

374
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:18,620
Master Zhu's counterattack

375
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:19,620
was a lucky one.

376
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:20,620
He saved his life.

377
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:26,620
Zhu'er.

378
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:27,620
Father is here.

379
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:28,620
Wake up.

380
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:30,620
Zhu'er.

381
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:32,620
What's going on?

382
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:34,620
The robbers are in the house.

383
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,620
The number of robbers is not enough.

384
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:37,620
Where are the robbers?

385
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:38,620
They have sent people to get them.

386
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:39,620
They will arrive soon.

387
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:40,620
Let them get out of here.

388
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:41,620
They will not come back.

389
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:43,620
I will let you go with them.

390
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:44,620
Yes.

391
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:45,620
Son.

392
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:47,620
Zhu'er.

393
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:49,620
What's going on?

394
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:51,620
Wake up.

395
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:53,620
What's going on?

396
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:02,620
Mr. Huo.

397
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:03,620
Let's go to Yang's cell.

398
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:18,620
Zhu Jinwo.

399
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:24,620
You are Xu Qi'an.

400
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:30,620
My Lord.

401
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:32,620
Xu Qi'an is from Chunfeng Hall.

402
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:34,620
Please allow me to bring him back to Chunfeng Hall.

403
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:37,620
Huo Xiang.

404
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:44,620
It's you.

405
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:46,620
You hurt my son.

406
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:49,620
What else do you want to say?

407
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:52,620
I regret it.

408
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:55,620
I didn't kill your brother.

409
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:58,620
I want to die.

410
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:02,620
I want to die.

411
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:21,620
You are so moved by my people in Chunfeng Hall.

412
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:23,620
Huo Xiang.

413
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:24,620
Are you okay?

414
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:26,620
It hurts.

415
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:28,620
I know.

416
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:29,620
Don't talk.

417
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:34,620
Yang.

418
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:39,620
He killed my son.

419
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:40,620
What do you want to say?

420
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:43,620
Are you sure you want to keep it?

421
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:51,620
You want to keep it?

422
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:56,620
Stop.

423
00:21:58,620 --> 00:21:59,620
I have a command.

424
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:00,620
Bring Xu Qi'an back to Ya'an.

425
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:02,620
He will decide it.

426
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:13,620
My Lord.

427
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:14,620
My son Zhu Chengzhu.

428
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:17,620
was killed by Tong Luo and Xu Qi'an.

429
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:20,620
He is still in danger.

430
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:22,620
I want to die.

431
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:23,620
I want to see your father.

432
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:24,620
I want to see your son.

433
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:25,620
I want to see your mother.

434
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:26,620
I want to see your father too.

435
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:30,620
Gu Xiao Spread the bet.

436
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:31,620

I beg.

442
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:40,620
It's good.

Here.

444
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:43,620
He died at 18?

445
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:44,620
I don't know.

446
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:46,620
I feel so unfair.

447
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:47,620
Let's sign it.

448
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:48,620
Please sign it.

449
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:51,620
Contradiction solche with the Supreme Commander Yu.

450

Let's meet Wei Gong

451
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:56,760
Make sure that you give Wei Gong your 100k primates

452
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,560
Wei Gong,

453
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,420
when Chi Chi-an arrived in Chuu Ying Luo

454
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,100
시nder Walt 1600

455
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:04,240
in order to teach him a lesson

456
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,860
he most filmed his attitude

457
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:07,360
and betrayed a close friend

458
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,120
Xu Qian-an and your husband

459
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,560
are in a relationship

460
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:11,620
He is

461
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:12,760
afraid of getting hurting

462
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:15,920
Wei Gong

463
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,080
applicants are on the right track

464
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:18,640
Chi Chi

465
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,600
I am not late

466
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,000
I have waiting here

467
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:21,640
and make a big deal of it.

468
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,840
Hit me and Xu Qian.

469
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,120
Supervisor,

470
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,720
he kept us in the front hall

471
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:26,920
and didn't allow us to enter the courtyard.

472
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,360
I can only do it.

473
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:31,080
Until the girls' crying sound came from the backyard,

474
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,520
Xu Qian was so reluctant

475
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,960
to go to support Zhu Yin Luo.

476
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,640
Zhu Yin Luo didn't have a face to face.

477
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,000
Instead, she took the key to the courtyard

478
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,200
and took the key to the courtyard.

479
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,280
You must break Xu Qian's hand.

480
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:46,840
Sir,

481
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,920
he is a student of Xu Qian's private school.

482
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,520
He is so insensitive.

483
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,040
He is not talented enough.

484
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,160
Sir,

485
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,480
there are many people in the same building.

486
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,400
They can all be the witness.

487
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,560
To be honest,

488
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,640
I can't guarantee you.

489
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,080
In the emergency,

490
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,920
Xu Qian didn't have a face to face.

491
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,760
Zhu Yin Luo did take the key to the courtyard

492
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,200
and took the key to the courtyard.

493
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,400
In the speech,

494
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,920
he was so confident about Xu Qian.

495
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:19,880
Shut up!

496
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,040
Even so,

497
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,040
you must leave it to the servants to handle it.

498
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,480
When will you

499
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,720
take the little copper wheel to handle it?

500
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,440
Sir,

501
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:35,080
Xu Qian is in a hurry.

502
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,560
According to the rules of the Dage people,

503
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,040
he should be killed.

504
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:51,960
What's going on?

505
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,120
The babies are babies?

506
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,360
What's going on?

507
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,440
What's going on?

508
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,360
Defending the Zいた?

509
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:07,560
Where?

510
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,440
This is the Z."

511
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:11,960
What's going on?

512
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:12,680
Bye!

513
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,360
You Luke Wind.

514
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,400

He was按摆 into jail

518
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:23,680
In seven days

519
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,640
he was pricked by theauen

520
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:28,960
Step back

521
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:37,900
Sit down

522
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,640
Let's talk a bit

523
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:52,000
He needs to know

524
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,320
He wants to know

525
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,880
But he told me

526
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,740
He fought with us

527
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,120
He may think

528
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,840
we are already ζ

529
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,120

I'll kick you out

534
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,540
Just as I thought

535
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:18,860
not sentenced to quarter of a century.

536
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:30,220
Ready to sacrifice your life

537
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:31,100
for grace

538
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:34,580
but sincere?

539
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:41,580
Of course, be sincere.

540
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:53,700

Subscribe with a like, if you like, please hit forward!

542
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:28,700
I'm afraid that I'll be too warm and bloody.

543
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:29,700
Who will bear the pain?

544
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:31,700
It's also my true heart.

545
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:35,700
I'm not afraid of the wind, I'm not afraid of the rain.

546
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:41,700
I'm not afraid of the wind, I'm not afraid of the rain.

547
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,700
Guards!

548
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,700
According to the order of Wei Palace,

549
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:49,700
we will put Xu Qi'an in the prison and wait for the execution.

550
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:51,700
What's the point of you?

551
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:54,700
The life is in the hot time,

552
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:58,700
and I can comfort you and me.

553
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:02,700
I'm afraid that the world is too bright,

554
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:05,700
and I'm only willing to be in the dark.

555
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:09,700
I'm afraid that I'll be too warm and bloody.

556
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:13,700
I'm afraid that I'll be too hot and bloody.

557
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:21,700
I'm willing to fight with you for the rest of my life.

558
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:34,700
Mr. Xu,

559
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:36,700
I've seen the top-level silver螺,

560
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:39,700
and I'm in charge of the Wei Palace.

561
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:42,700
Turn around.

562
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:46,700
Turn around.

563
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:51,700
Hold it.

564
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:06,700
Wait, I'll send it to you.

565
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:16,700
Wait a minute. I'll do it.

566
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:24,700
Do we still have the same thing?

567
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:25,700
We've found it.

568
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:27,700
Now that we only have Jin Lu,

569
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:29,700
we can't contact each other.

570
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:48,700
How long have you been together?

571
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:55,700
I've known you have a private family.

572
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,700
You should have told me when you knew.

573
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:19,700
I know that Wei Palace has its difficulties.

574
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:24,700
Xu Qian An is indeed making a mistake.

575
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,700
This fool

576
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:33,700
almost killed someone,

577
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:35,700
and he's still a silver螺.

578
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,700
I think I've already

579
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,700
become more stupid than him.

580
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:46,700
I didn't expect him to be more stupid than me.

581
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:56,700
I don't want him to know.

582
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:59,700
I'm so upset.

583
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:05,700
I really deserve it.

584
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:10,700
Even if you're better than others,

585
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:13,700
you're so stupid.

586
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:17,700
People in the family are all looking down on you.

587
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:23,700
Are you lying to him?

588
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:29,700
He's a good man.

589
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:31,700
He's a good man.

590
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:36,700
In the world, you need to be young and beautiful.

591
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:40,700
And you need to be in a moment to break it.

592
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:52,700
If you're lying to me, Xu Qian An,

593
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:56,700
who else would believe in Wei Palace?

594
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:02,700
If you can't Systems Peace,

595
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:04,700
then I'll give it to you.

596
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:16,960
Nice

597
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:18,860
What?

598
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:21,700
I'm all泯 clean these days.

599
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:24,700
But others are just like us today.

600
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:27,660
I have to temporary

601
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:38,620
как a Chinese

602
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:55,580
She doesn' t see anything.

603
00:32:57,820 --> 00:32:58,620
She doesn' t see anything.

604
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:25,940
Guo Jia.

605
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:28,420
Is he absolutely his father?

606
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:30,620
I didn't understand him.

607
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:34,700
Yet he only goes to the court.

608
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:38,020
Soon after...

609
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:39,340
A long time had passed

610
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:46,220
because of the people in the abra.

611
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:49,500
Xu Qian!

612
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:53,140
I'm afraid Birthday is going to be running out of business.

613
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:57,700
Settings,

614
00:33:58,740 --> 00:33:59,700
şu

615
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:02,260
Ok

616
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:22,300
Brother

617
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,620
Xiu He揭

618
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:28,360
Do you have a sister like me, A new lowered...

619
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:30,060
And you do.

620
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:35,880
For...

621
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,640
Please forgive me for making you unable to walk on the mountain.

622
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:41,120
This is a bonus.

623
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:43,700
This is my previous target.

624
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:48,860
You must have paid pretty much.

625
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:50,860
Sister never sends me anything.

626
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:51,860
She's just gone.

627
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:53,860
How pitiful.

628
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:56,860
It's my nephew, Xu Qi'an,

629
00:34:57,860 --> 00:35:00,860
who injured Yingluo and was sentenced to death.

630
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:03,860
He was sentenced to a waist-bomb.

631
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:07,860
So I want to ask Lord Shilang

632
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:09,860
to give me a favor.

633
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:12,860
To protect my nephew.

634
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:13,860
This is my life.

635
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:15,860
My lord,

636
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:17,860
Lord Shilang is a minister after all.

637
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:21,860
It's still a joke in the court.

638
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:24,860
But my lord is a high-ranking official.

639
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:28,860
He's innocent and has committed a crime.

640
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:31,860
If he's caught by the enemy,

641
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:33,860
I won't harm him.

642
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:37,860
You'd better take the high-ranking official back.

643
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:39,860
Let's go back.

644
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:46,860
Go back.

645
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:07,860
Madam.

646
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:11,860
Madam.

647
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:12,860
What should I say?

648
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:17,860
Well,

649
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:20,860
I'll help you.

650
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:26,860
Where's your bracelet?

651
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:28,860
I'm begging you.

652
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:30,860
You're pretending?

653
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:33,860
It's all my fault.

654
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:35,860
When the banquet is back,

655
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:38,860
I'll be in front of the moon from next month.

656
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:41,860
What did you say to Si Tianjie?

657
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:42,860
What did you say to him?

658
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:46,860
I saw Song Qing.

659
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:48,860
She said

660
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:51,860
the matter about the fight with the people

661
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:53,860
was not investigated by Si Tianjie.

662
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:57,860
And the Wei State.

663
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:08,860
It's useless to be my uncle.

664
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:12,860
Ok?

665
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:29,860
At that time,

666
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:32,860
Er Lang was worth coming back again.

667
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:33,860
He may

668
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:35,460
I overnight

669
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:38,060
tires Kinyuan

670
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:40,020
why don't I go home?

671
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,280
Any reason?

672
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,860
What do you say next time?

673
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:48,420
Ok, see you

674
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:51,260
I am really looking forward

675
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:57,380
It's just our friendship

676
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:00,220
...

677
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,220
and supposedly withYa

678
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,240
There is no sign testing

679
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:09,220
toi la past

680
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:12,580
Kuatu

681
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:20,560
so

682
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:23,560
1893

683
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:35,740
Two days later

684
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:44,540
People are confused

685
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:45,080
Their care never scored

686
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,820
It's hard not to have been noted

687
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:48,040
Because it has been delivered

688
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,940
It has to be done

689
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,280
the criminal's daughter is in the palace.

690
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:53,760
Xu Qianan is a Taoist,

691
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,200
so he is a leader.

692
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,360
I think

693
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,080
this is

694
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,240
the unlawful style

695
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,840
that is beneficial to the government.

696
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,920
I am willing to serve the court

697
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,800
and spare Xu Tongluo's life.

698
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:07,120
I am willing to serve the court

699
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:08,840
and spare Xu Tongluo's life.

700
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:16,960
I beg you to serve the court.

701
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:18,360
Take some of them.

702
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:19,860
Don't eat them all.

703
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:25,840
Is Xu Qianan well?

704
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:27,560
His temperature has droped.

705
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:28,880
His patience with a rat

706
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:41,920
can never

707
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:45,400
remove the spine.

708
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,400
The clothes are not wrong.

709
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:49,400
But there is no time.

710
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:56,160
You two are so stubborn.

711
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:56,560
Head.

712
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:57,640
Don't be impulsive.

713
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:58,720
There is really another way.

714
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,160
Head.

715
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,000
Don't go up.

716
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:00,600
Miss.

717
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:01,960
Brother Chuan.

718
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:02,760
There must be another way.

719
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:03,160
Head.

720
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:04,160
Don't let him go.

721
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:04,680
Head.

722
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:05,600
Head.

723
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:06,400
You are so selfish.

724
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,000
Head.

725
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,160
Wenyuan.

726
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,160
Come out.

727
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,160
Get up.

728
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:26,160
Li Yuchun.

729
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,160
This...

730
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,160
Li Yuchun.

731
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:32,760
Head.

732
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:34,160
Don't be impulsive.

733
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,160
He drank too much.

734
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,160
He has a headache.

735
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,160
He is a fool.

736
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:40,160
He can't drink.

737
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,160
Get out.

738
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,180
Brother Chuan.

739
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:44,520
Close up.

740
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,620
The secretctive Li Yuchun...

741
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:53,840
was a defender...

742
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,160
of Yan and harmonphase system...

743
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:58,040
for 210 years.

744
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:00,040
years ago...

745
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:03,400
because Lunar tightened emergency leakage...

746
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:06,320
Sc忘記你收拾本身的ondo course.

747
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,720
In 1971,

748
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,720
he lay in the past days.

749
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:14,600
umeliamentary affairs are regulated and crimes law

750
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:16,400
and the guitare flattery arelegitimata

751
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:21,120
B. ML loaded with blasphemy

752
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:23,360
commerce comes across heaven and earth

753
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:27,860
But in the last 17 years

754
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:32,620
Chu lost the stainized part of the seven편tial citizens

755
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:36,380
and tried to deuxième the second of coup

756
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:38,400
but those owned by national authorities

757
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:43,180
It's human to say it's not human!

758
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,400
I'm afraid of the danger

759
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,400
But I'm a year old

760
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,400
I'm a traitor

761
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,400
I'm a coward

762
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,400
I'm a man

763
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,400
I'm not good enough

764
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,400
I'm a man

765
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:26,400
I'm a man

766
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,400
I'm a man

767
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,400
I'm a man

768
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,400
I'm a man

769
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,400
I'm a man

770
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,400
I'm a man

771
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:39,400
I'm a man

772
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:41,400
I'm a man

773
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:43,400
I'm a man

774
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:46,400
I'm a man

775
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,400
I'm a man

776
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,400
I'm a man

777
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,400
Because of you

778
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,400
I've become a plantation

779
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:05,400
I've become a farmer

780
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,400
I will never go back to the past

781
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:38,400
I will never change

782
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:42,400
I will only be determined to live my life

783
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,400
My heart is like a lake

784
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:45,400
I am like a lake

785
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:46,400
I am like a lake

786
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:47,400
I am like a lake

787
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:48,400
I am like a lake

788
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:51,400
I am like a lake

789
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:52,400
I am like a lake

790
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,400
I am like a lake

791
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:56,400
I am like a lake

792
00:43:58,400 --> 00:43:59,400
I am like a lake

793
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:00,400
I am like a lake

794
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:02,400
I am like a lake

795
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:05,400
An old tent, an old and lonely long night

796
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:06,400
Happiness is an liar

797
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:10,400
The only one who insights it, it turns out, there is no anyway

798
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:12,400
My heart said forever is a lie

799
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:15,400
Bra openly giving figures, anyone can fall for theirハgrove

800
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:17,400
In bonds of love you'll close us

801
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:22,400
I came to a letter which was falling in the mud

802
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,400
I hold passion in my hands

803
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:25,400
t Mercifully for my life

804
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:28,400
I live the eternal life

805
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,400
Isn't just a part of me
