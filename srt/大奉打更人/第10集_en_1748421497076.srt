1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm afraid I'll be a little bit late

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm curious what I'm talking about

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I don't want to think about the future

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Let this bowl of soup be a little bit more than that

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm not very strict

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
When you're here

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'll keep the rules and I'll keep the rules

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'll keep my fingers crossed

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'll keep this big piece of bowl

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
We're all like a step by step

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
We're all like a step by step

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
We're all like a step by step

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
We're all like a step by step

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
We're all like a step by step

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:16,440
D absolute

16
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,440
I'll be a little bit late

17
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,440
I'll keep my fingers crossed

18
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,440
It's headquarters

19
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,440
Where's the name date

20
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,440
There's no illuminator

21
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,520
I'll use the image choices

22
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:28,760
I'll sample the question

23
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,920
out, movements, whatever

24
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,280
Take all the memories

25
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:45,380

28
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:31,780
您看大鳳打耕人 Vivo S20系列 行经长交人像 拍眼拍镜都漂亮 扬宁观看大鳳打耕人

29
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:43,420
公民利路与我如浮云 我以名言 死身只愿追随 长公主怀庆 全全之心欲越可见

30
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:47,420
你也太看得清我了

31
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:52,420
三来公子心意已决 劫如盘石 很好

32
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:00,420
参见长公

33
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,420
这是怀庆的走狗

34
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:12,420
公主怎么办 敬酒不吃 给他吃法酒

35
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:15,420
来人 把他拖下去

36
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:17,420
还去公主

37
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:18,420
打他

38
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:27,420
南花

39
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:34,420
心里

40
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:46,420
高雅

41
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:50,420
做事也太难了吧

42
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:57,420
我不是本公手下无人可动 何须苦苦照

43
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:01,420
公主

44
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:04,420
怎么样 姜云照了吗

45
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:06,420
命死不去

46
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:08,420
卢少女下过下过堂吗

47
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:09,420
照做了

48
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:12,420
做了 奴婢还特地借了打耕人 18 世

49
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,420
一一展示下来她争着一夜呢

50
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:17,420
可是她就是命完不灵

51
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:19,420
实在不行

52
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:21,420
抽她几遍 抽了

53
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:24,420
而且是狠狠地抽了好几遍呢

54
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:25,420
她真的不怕啊

55
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:27,420
怎么不怕 她怕得要死

56
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:28,420
怕得

57
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:30,420
都昏过去了两回

58
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:34,420
可是妹妹醒来

59
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:35,420
一就不知悔改

60
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:38,420
反复就是那一句话

61
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:40,420
什么话

62
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:42,420
誓死追随怀庆

63
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:44,420
使之不于

64
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:47,420
这就是大哥人的兴趣

65
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:58,420
屈屈挤鞭子

66
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:00,420
给我脑痒痒的

67
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:03,420
老子可是练气紧了

68
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:08,420
打耕人多的是比这严酷的人

69
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:09,420
兴趣

70
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:13,420
这就是大哥人的兴趣

71
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:17,420
屈屈挤鞭子

72
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:34,420
给她解开

73
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:39,420
还有什么手段

74
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:41,420
尽管放马过来

75
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:42,420
吃点

76
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:44,420
吃

77
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:46,420
再给你最后一次机会

78
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:48,420
到底追随谁

79
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:52,420
誓死追随怀庆

80
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,420
使之不于

81
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:57,420
她就没有办法了

82
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:58,420
太子

83
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:59,420
去哪儿啊

84
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:02,420
誓死追随怀庆

85
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:04,420
使之不于

86
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:06,420
什么意思啊

87
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:07,420
这就完了

88
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:11,420
主上说了

89
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:12,420
你既然无意追随

90
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:14,420
我妹妹不抢人所难

91
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:15,420
I mean

92
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:16,420
老子不送

93
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,420
不是了

94
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:24,420
问你们这么容易就放弃了吗

95
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,420
公主

96
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:30,420
送走了

97
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:31,420
送走了

98
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:33,420
那就好

99
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:35,420
但愿她不要去报官

100
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:37,420
要是被公理知道就麻烦了

101
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:39,420
公主

102
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:41,420
公主

103
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:42,420
怎么了

104
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:44,420
Yang Ling

105
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:46,420
她去报官了

106
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:48,420
啊那倒没有

107
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:50,420
只不过她一直在门口徘徊

108
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:51,420
说一夜折辱

109
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:52,420
却面也不见

110
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:53,420
就要让这要见主的一面

111
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:54,420
给她个说法

112
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:57,420
闹闹

113
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:58,420
现在走

114
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:00,420
我不就会打翻了

115
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:11,420
一十二遍

116
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:13,420
这一拳

117
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:15,420
我杨林一年定要投个说法

118
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:18,420
叫你们主上出来叫我

119
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:21,420
不见不见

120
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:23,420
赶紧把弄走吧

121
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:24,420
是

122
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:39,420
走了吗

123
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:41,420
还堵在门口呢

124
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,420
油眼不见

125
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:44,420
肩刃不拔

126
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:46,420
如今连席子都备好了

127
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:48,420
还说

128
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:49,420
若是主人不见的

129
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:52,420
便要与咱们不死不休

130
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:57,420
好

131
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:01,420
本宫从未见过这样的人

132
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:04,420
一身老然风古

133
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:06,420
确实和少爷公那群

134
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:07,420
饭桶不一样

135
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,420
可惜了

136
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:10,420
不能为我所用

137
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:12,420
公主

138
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:14,420
你说我们该怎么办

139
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:15,420
他天天堵在那

140
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:16,420
我妈还回不回宫

141
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:17,420
自然回了

142
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:21,420
罢了罢了

143
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:23,420
他在门口反倒惹眼

144
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,420
本公主

145
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:27,420
亲自去回回他

146
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:39,420
公子这是何苦呢

147
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:43,420
隔下如我一夜

148
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:45,420
难道不应该给我

149
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:46,420
养某人一个说法吗

150
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:49,420
此事是我唐突了

151
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:51,420
人想诚意招揽

152
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:52,420
没想到

153
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:54,420
公子如此高风良节

154
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:55,420
實之不愉

155
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:56,420
既无缘

156
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,420
那我助公子

157
00:08:58,420 --> 00:08:59,420
嫌成四季

158
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:02,420
公子

159
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:04,420
公子

160
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:05,420
公子

161
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:06,420
嫌成四季

162
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:09,420
起轿

163
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:10,420
且慢

164
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:13,420
连面都不露

165
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:14,420
这就是隔下

166
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:15,420
给人道歉的态度吗

167
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:21,420
公子说得再厉

168
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:36,420
公子

169
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:01,420
此事是我的不对

170
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:07,420
剑月

171
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:10,420
十五个剑月了

172
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:16,420
参见掌公主

173
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:18,420
掌公主

174
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:22,420
原来隔下就是掌公主

175
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:25,420
是在下有眼无足

176
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:27,420
显先错失良楚

177
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,420
这就是掌公主

178
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,420
这就是掌公主

179
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:32,420
这就是掌公主

180
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:34,420
这就是掌公主

181
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:37,420
忘了自我介绍

182
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:39,420
再下许七安

183
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:40,420
阳林只是我的避命

184
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:42,420
许七安

185
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:47,420
那人真是掌公主的避命

186
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:49,420
当然了

187
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:52,420
人家都找到门上来了

188
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,420
足见人家的这个重视和诚意

189
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:58,420
四九

190
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:00,420
假一时日

191
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:02,420
你也病如你大哥一般

192
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:03,420
莫要灰心

193
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:07,420
大哥

194
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:09,420
可还顺利啊

195
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:15,420
成了

196
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:20,420
顾坐不知道他就是掌公主

197
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:23,420
在他的威逼利用

198
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:24,420
没停手动下

199
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:27,420
标达了对掌公主的一片重心

200
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,420
这才通过了考验

201
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:29,420
将他死死拿捏

202
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,420
这掌公主

203
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:33,420
当真不认识您

204
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:34,420
怎么会不认识我呢

205
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:38,420
我啊就是掌公主随手落下的

206
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:39,420
一枚弦琪

207
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:40,420
但是我要让他知道

208
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:43,420
这颗弦琪也能定成坤

209
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:46,420
公主贵人多忘事

210
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:48,420
此前正是您推荐

211
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:49,420
我竟打个人压门的

212
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:51,420
打更人

213
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,420
怀俊眼光果然土道

214
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:57,420
四等人才竟被他照彻回家

215
00:11:58,420 --> 00:11:59,420
你就是那怀俊

216
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,420
这人真是个弦琪

217
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:02,420
你就是那怀俊

218
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:09,420
就是本宫推荐近打个人的许其他呀

219
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:15,420
正事在下 学期安

220
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:18,420
然后呢然后就简单了呀

221
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:20,420
对我的师座暂不绝口

222
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:21,420
将我两位客亲

223
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:23,420
让我为他写诗

224
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:25,420
这明日啊

225
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,420
还约我去他府中一去

226
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:29,420
那你快起来吧

227
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:34,420
I've read your poem before

228
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,420
and I'm not good at it

229
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:37,420
so I've specially recommended you to me

230
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:40,420
The little tests you just did

231
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:44,420
made me think you're a kindhearted person

232
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:46,420
I'm just trying to be kind

233
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:50,420
You just said you wanted to repay me

234
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:53,420
I'm honored to be treated like a princess

235
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:55,420
and I've done many things for you

236
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:57,420
Very well

237
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:58,420
Let me ask you again

238
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,420
Do you want to be my guest

239
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:00,420
and write a poem for me

240
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:03,420
and share my experience with the public?

241
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:11,420
The school of death is back to its original state

242
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:12,420
and the world is not in the same place

243
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:20,420
The eldest princess is a famous talent

244
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:21,420
She's a famous figure

245
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:23,420
How can she find a corpse?

246
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:26,420
This is called a silver color

247
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:27,420
Silver color?

248
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:30,420
This character is complicated

249
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:31,420
You see it

250
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:33,420
It's all she wants you to see

251
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:35,420
You can go to the court to be a servant

252
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:36,420
Remember what she said

253
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:38,420
She's helpful to you

254
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:40,420
I have to learn to be a good person, right?

255
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,420
By the way, she asked me to sign the letter

256
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:44,420
and made me a guest

257
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:46,420
The one who drew it is my teacher

258
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:48,420
But this is also our chance

259
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:51,420
Where's the money?

260
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:53,420
Of course it's not

261
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:55,420
This is the favor of the eldest princess

262
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:56,420
It's a favor of the eldest princess

263
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:58,420
What's the point of going to the capital?

264
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:00,420
Don't affect the answer

265
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:04,420
Yes, you just have to get her happiness

266
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,420
We won't be afraid of the last wave

267
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:09,420
We have a reliable family

268
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:10,420
Right?

269
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:14,420
You can't forget the second uncle

270
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,420
after you develop in the future

271
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:18,420
Don't worry, second uncle

272
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:20,420
The eldest princess is good

273
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:21,420
I am good

274
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:24,420
We are a good family

275
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:27,420
Come on

276
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:34,420
I will buy it for you

277
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:35,420
Fourth uncle

278
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:36,420
For our old Xu family

279
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:38,420
I hope you can work hard

280
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:39,420
Do it

281
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,420
Help me to grind it

282
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:41,420
Okay

283
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:43,420
Today is a real election

284
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:45,420
Fortunately, the princess is smart

285
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:48,420
A move to exchange the crown prince

286
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,420
He just let his heart beat

287
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:51,420
He is completely filial to you

288
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:54,420
I didn't expect that Yang Lin is Xu Qi

289
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:57,420
But I pretend to be happy

290
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:00,420
I am not

291
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:03,420
They all say that the rich are in the middle of the world

292
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:04,420
With the slave card

293
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:05,420
Princess, don't worry

294
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:08,420
As long as she doesn't meet the eldest princess

295
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:10,420
It's more than a thousand ways

296
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:11,420
You said it easily

297
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:13,420
Xu Qi'an is happy

298
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:14,420
Recommend a person to enter the palace

299
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:16,420
If you want to see two people

300
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:20,420
It's hard to say

301
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:23,420
But the world will be in this

302
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:25,420
I want to win the gold

303
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:26,420
I have no chance to win

304
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:30,420
Then the princess means

305
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:33,420
First hold her

306
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:34,420
Just lie to the teacher

307
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:39,420
Bring her to the teacher tomorrow

308
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:42,420
Let's think of a way

309
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:43,420
Talk about the way

310
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:49,420
You didn't expect

311
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:51,420
Xu Ning'en is a rich Yang Lin

312
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:52,420
I am not a rich Yang Lin

313
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:53,420
No, hurry

314
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:55,420
You said we should go to the imperial palace

315
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:57,420
Can't we let the rich marry the rich?

316
00:15:58,420 --> 00:15:59,420
No need to spend money

317
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:07,420
Coming

318
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:08,420
Yang Lin

319
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:10,420
What's wrong with you?

320
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:14,420
Why are you here?

321
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:17,420
I was so late to sleep last night

322
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:19,420
The head is not here

323
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:20,420
Not here

324
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:21,420
I've been here long time ago

325
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:22,420
I went to the private room

326
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:24,420
He chose me

327
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:25,420
I don't know

328
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:27,420
You are not a dame today

329
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:28,420
You are not a dame

330
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:33,420
What if you are not a dame?

331
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:34,420
What will happen to the harem?

332
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:35,420
If he doesn't chase

333
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:36,420
Just take a few words

334
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:37,420
Give him some money

335
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:39,420
What if he is chasing?

336
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:40,420
Only dead people

337
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:41,420
It's a good idea

338
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:48,420
Run

339
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:50,420
Run

340
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:55,420
Tao Er

341
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:00,420
How is the harem?

342
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:01,420
Good

343
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,420
I am investigating it carefully

344
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:04,420
Tao Er

345
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:06,420
Why don't you go back to Chunfeng hall and have some tea?

346
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:07,420
I will report the case later

347
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:09,420
How can I know

348
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:11,420
You are not satisfied with the harem?

349
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:14,420
Do you think I am the one who is making trouble?

350
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:15,420
No

351
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:16,420
No

352
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:18,420
Which bastard

353
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:19,420
Is the harem a little bit dangerous?

354
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:21,420
Maybe it's the harem

355
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:22,420
It's a fake

356
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:24,420
If you really don't like it

357
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:27,420
Don't pretend to be a devil

358
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:29,420
Go to the oil street

359
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:30,420
Come

360
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:32,420
The oil street

361
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:34,420
Don't go to the oil street

362
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:35,420
Tao Er

363
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:36,420
I like to watch the TV show now

364
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:37,420
I still like to watch the TV show

365
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:38,420
Go

366
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:39,420
Go

367
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:40,420
Go

368
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:42,420
Tao Er

369
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:43,420
I like to watch the TV show

370
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:45,420
I think the TV show is not suitable for me

371
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:48,420
You two go out and have a drink

372
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:49,420
What oil street is the oil street?

373
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:50,420
What kind of light is the oil street?

374
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:51,420
Tell me

375
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:53,420
I am not afraid of being a big run

376
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:56,420
What kind of light is the oil street?

377
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:58,420
The light is a big run

378
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:00,420
You ran

379
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:03,420
Come

380
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:04,420
Xiaobao, I will give you a gift

381
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:06,420
Big run

382
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:08,420
I am not afraid of running

383
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:10,420
No

384
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:11,420
This is the oil street

385
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:12,420
The oil street

386
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:13,420
The oil street

387
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:14,420
The first oil street

388
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:15,420
The next street

389
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:17,420
The sky is foggy

390
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:19,420
The fire is burning

391
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:20,420
I am done

392
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:21,420
Hurry up

393
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:22,420
You two just got married

394
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:23,420
I thought you guys

395
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:24,420
I was going to take my clothes off

396
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:25,420
Then the oil street is heavy

397
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:27,420
It took half a day to play the game

398
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:28,420
Can you come out

399
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:30,420
The patrol room is a village house

400
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:31,420
Is this the house?

401
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:32,420
Yes

402
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:33,420
I will buy some

403
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:34,420
Come

404
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:36,420
Come on

405
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:37,420
Come on

406
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:38,420
I am done

407
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:39,420
Next time

408
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:40,420
Next time

409
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:41,420
You can have a drink

410
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:42,420
Next time

411
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:43,420
You see

412
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:44,420
Three times one

413
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:46,420
Come on

414
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,420
Brother, come on

415
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:50,420
Come on

416
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:54,420
Wenyang

417
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:55,420
Wenyang

418
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:56,420
Come on

419
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:57,420
I am done

420
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:58,420
I am done

421
00:18:58,420 --> 00:18:59,420
Xiao Yuan

422
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:01,420
He is already old

423
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:02,420
I can't forget

424
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:04,420
This is the best

425
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:05,420
What a fool

426
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:07,420
What should I do

427
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:10,420
Xiao Ju

428
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:11,420
Xiao Ju

429
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:12,420
Are you okay?

430
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:13,420
Can you play with me

431
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:14,420
No, I am not

432
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:15,420
I haven't played with you yet

433
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:16,420
Brother

434
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:17,420
Xiao Ju, hurry up

435
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:19,420
Don't make me cheap

436
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:22,420
Xiao Lan

437
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:24,420
What's up

438
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:26,420
Is it bad?

439
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:27,420
Good, come on

440
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:28,420
Come on

441
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:29,420
It must be Xiao Lan

442
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,420
By the way

443
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:34,420
That head, that cow, that skin

444
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:35,420
Who did it with him

445
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:36,420
He is not old

446
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:37,420
Then yesterday

447
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:38,420
Didn't you say goodbye to your mother

448
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:40,420
How can I change my surname today

449
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:43,420
You are older than you

450
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:44,420
Are you

451
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:46,420
Are you using personal relationships

452
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:48,420
See you

453
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:53,420
Yunlu Academy

454
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:54,420
Or

455
00:19:58,420 --> 00:19:59,420
It's me

456
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:03,420
Since you are already my person

457
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:05,420
Of course I want to take care of you

458
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:08,420
I asked someone

459
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:09,420
I heard

460
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:11,420
The relationship between you and the head

461
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:12,420
Is not good

462
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,420
The store is not in the way

463
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:16,420
Let him take care of you

464
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:20,420
What?

465
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:21,420
Make you sleepy

466
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:22,420
No, no

467
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:25,420
Princess Zhang is very polite

468
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:27,420
But I have no such experience

469
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:30,420
I am really

470
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:32,420
I am not afraid of being impolite

471
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:35,420
Can report

472
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:37,420
Can report

473
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:45,420
Eat

474
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:47,420
Eat

475
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:50,420
Eat

476
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,420
Princess, here

477
00:20:57,420 --> 00:21:00,420
Golden gold wine, 10,000

478
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:02,420
The jade plate is really beautiful

479
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:03,420
10,000

480
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:09,420
Love More

481
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:11,700
When belittling

482
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:24,540
Deserive

483
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:28,300
I bow to the King of T森.

484
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:30,260
I recite to the Emperor.

485
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:36,540
I feel qing,

486
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:38,020
whipping the unbeatable,

487
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:43,380
to protect my...

488
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:46,020
To protect your...

489
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:47,860
This is hard.

490
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:50,500
I was trapped to go through

491
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,940
a problem last night.

492
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:53,460
I was not well.

493
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:55,700
Clear what you wanna understand.

494
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,180
So satisfying.

495
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:00,140
When can we finish writing the tenemosas?

496
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:01,780
😅

497
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:03,340
less than 3-5 days.

498
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:05,740
And for 3-5 months.

499
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:08,640
It is because this poem is so great.

500
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:12,300
For example,A congratio dino with real repaired rites.

501
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:13,780
It's so hard to explain.

502
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:15,640
I mean,

503
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,800
I have to wait for yourनe lal of the anthem.

504
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,440
And for payerе.

505
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:20,460
Sure,

506
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:27,060
If it's to have a princess with you,

507
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:31,120
you might gain fame by following the light.

508
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:42,880
Who said soutely?

509
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,300
Gangzi,

510
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,700
can I have a line on the rooftop, please?

511
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,520
You need me to meet her.

512
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:50,900
Do as you please.

513
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,600
Ri Purong also

514
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,600
You're not a fairy.

515
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,600
Who?

516
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,600
Five-year-old Yuwen, ten-year-old Shun,

517
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,600
a holy face.

518
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,600
This kid is really a god.

519
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,600
God.

520
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,600
God doesn't accept me as a new year.

521
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,600
Da Feng.

522
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,600
He's a new rule.

523
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,600
He's a red face.

524
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,600
He's just a new year.

525
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,600
New year is coming.

526
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,600
Happy New Year.

527
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,600
Why didn't you go to find Wei Gong?

528
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,600
How come I didn't know?

529
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,600
Wei Gong took her back from me.

530
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,600
I saw her as a red face.

531
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,600
Xu Xian said that

532
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,600
she was against the top of the tower.

533
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,600
I told Shun Shi

534
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,600
to let her take the responsibility.

535
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,600
I told her to do something.

536
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,600
Princess Ying Ming.

537
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,600
But Ying Ming

538
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:14,600
seems to be hiding in the dark.

539
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,600
She wants to take the blame on the new year.

540
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,600
I see.

541
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,600
You're here.

542
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,600
This person is not a fool.

543
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,600
But he's really a good cook.

544
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,600
He's a good cook.

545
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,600
It seems that

546
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,600
we need to change our plan.

547
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,600
We need to make a long-term plan.

548
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,600
We need to make a plan.

549
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,600
What do you mean?

550
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,600
We can't keep it.

551
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,600
From now on,

552
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,600
no one in this house

553
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,600
can be a fool.

554
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,600
We need to make a plan.

555
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,600
We need to make a good plan.

556
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,600
From now on,

557
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,600
we'll be happy.

558
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,600
I

559
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,600
am the princess.

560
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,600
Yes.

561
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,600
Sazi.

562
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,600
How dare you leave the team?

563
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,600
Xu Qi.

564
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,600
You two

565
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,600
don't have to

566
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,600
find her back.

567
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,600
You go to the crime scene alone.

568
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,600
Yes.

569
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,600
Xu Qi.

570
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,600
Where are you going?

571
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,600
Where are you going?

572
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,600
I...

573
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,600
Look at you.

574
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,600
You're not wearing a uniform.

575
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,600
You're not wearing a uniform.

576
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,600
You're not wearing a uniform.

577
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,600
You're really a criminal.

578
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,600
He's going to put me in the crime scene.

579
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,600
He's going to put me in the crime scene.

580
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,600
Hey.

581
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,600
Hey.

582
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,600
Don't let him breathe.

583
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,600
Let him go.

584
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,600
Let's go.

585
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,600
You're my man.

586
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,600
I'll take care of you.

587
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,600
I've been looking into it.

588
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,600
I heard

589
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,600
that you have a bad relationship

590
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,600
with Shang Tu.

591
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,600
So I asked Wei Yuan

592
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,600
to let him take care of you.

593
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,600
Wei Yuan?

594
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,600
Li Yuchuan.

595
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,600
You're so bold.

596
00:26:47,600 --> 00:27:07,580
よ

597
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,600
I'm going to the heaven

598
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,600
When I'm 70 years old

599
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,600
Brothers, take the blame

600
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,600
I just want to go to the heaven

601
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,600
I don't want to think about the sky

602
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,600
What else do you want to do?

603
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,600
He's not too stubborn

604
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,600
When you're here

605
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,600
The rules I have to follow are not for me

606
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,600
Just keep it simple

607
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,600
Sing out this big piece of music

608
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:38,600
Our family is like a step by step

609
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:41,600
Our family is divided from smile to smile

610
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,600
Our family is like a blue sky

611
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,600
The moon is like a whole tree

612
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,600
I'm like a lonely soul

613
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,600
I'm just a lonely soul

614
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,600
You, you, you

615
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,600
What are you?

616
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,600
I'm just a daily street

617
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:57,600
No one has any legal rules

618
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,600
You're a fool

619
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,600
What kind of legal rules are you?

620
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,600
This is what you should do

621
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,600
You should be careful

622
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,600
The route you plan every day

623
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:09,600
Walk up the street

624
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,600
Complete the task

625
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,600
This is not what you should do

626
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,600
This is called a dog

627
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:19,600
You don't wear a piece of clothing

628
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,600
I wear a piece of clothing

629
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,600
I wear a piece of clothes

630
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,600
And I don't wear an uniform

631
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,600
I wear a pair of pants

632
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,600
And I wear a pair of pants

633
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,600
And I don't wear a pair of pants

634
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,600
The whole thing is a joke

635
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,600
Right?

636
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,600
Wake up

637
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,600
Come and save these things

638
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,600
Are you a little bit angry?

639
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,600
I...

640
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,600
I'm just a little bit angry

641
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,600
You're a little bit angry

642
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,600
Let's go back, please

643
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,600
No, I don't!

644
00:28:46,600 --> 00:29:09,320
I was so scared to death about no reason, but I was gonna take a birthday

645
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,720
I think I was being too perceived.

646
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:11,760
This is what I bring to the party

647
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,000
to encourage the public of little by little .

648
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,900
Make the public stand up and appreciate it.

649
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:23,440
Make the clear board of Kimetsuhin?

650
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,620
Well, guys.

651
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,700
I didn't say nothing to you.

652
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,800
After some warm-up,

653
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,480
I've already found many problems

654
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,640
with our inner parties.

655
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,440
But you know,

656
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,560
it's not just about co- firs

657
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:43,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

658
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,420
ah, okay, no more love and action.

659
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:46,060
Yeah.

660
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:50,460
Ah...

661
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,100
Yeah.

662
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,000
Yeah.

663
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:04,380
Get out.

664
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:05,760
the hoch любinski?

665
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,880
an sensational smooth job.

666
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,720
We prepared it for Master Wei.

667
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:23,000
So he uses it to 던

668
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,160
his Pho.

669
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,300
Why夢

670
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,860
you would Asia.

671
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:32,120
How do I know,

672
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,280
is someone

673
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,840
gonna makeUh fear,

674
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,440
I'll be in a hurry to discuss with you.

675
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,240
If there's really anything wrong,

676
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,440
I'll find a way to solve it.

677
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,240
Brother Cheng.

678
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,040
You've got a good attitude.

679
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,240
Fine. I'll go back and study.

680
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,640
Have some tea.

681
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:55,640
I'll be back.

682
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,440
I'll be back.

683
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,440
I'll be back.

684
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,040
I'll be back.

685
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,240
I'll be back.

686
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,440
I'll be back.

687
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:06,840
White leather?

688
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,240
Qi Yin is a war between Xu Qi'an and Li Yuchun

689
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,040
who is good at handling the paper.

690
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,920
And then Xu Qi'an took out a white leather

691
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,840
and beat the workers.

692
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:18,840
Please take it back.

693
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:21,440
Although I'm a little arrogant,

694
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,840
I think I'm a little rebellious.

695
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,640
But I have a good intention.

696
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:29,040
I have my own way.

697
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,840
The color of the uniform

698
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:37,040
and the way it's worn.

699
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,240
Yes.

700
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:42,040
Xu Qi'an has taken the short-term

701
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,440
and the necessary to catch the workers.

702
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,440
If it's wearing the uniform

703
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,440
and wearing the uniform,

704
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,640
it can catch the thief.

705
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,040
How stupid is the thief?

706
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:52,440
Who's thinking about the rules?

707
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:56,840
I'm thinking.

708
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:00,340
Excuse me.

709
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:05,440
Are you OK?

710
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,240
Is there anything wrong with roar?

711
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,240
The clothes are dull.

712
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,840
Puerto RicoShin,

713
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:29,760
PD.

714
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:34,240
March 30th..

715
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:42,720
Today is the 31th day when I

716
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:47,260
arrived at dadurch high.

717
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:52,760
On that day,I abdicated my late son,

718
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,520
Xu Qianan.

719
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,140
He thought I was Huaiqing,

720
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:57,560
and continuously useless.

721
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,360
As long as I'm a good teacher,

722
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,560
I'll be able to become her star sooner or later.

723
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:04,960
I'm not afraid of being a star.

724
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,160
As long as I'm good at it,

725
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:10,560
I'm very confident that I'll be the first princess

726
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,760
in the world to be the best.

727
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,560
Thank you, Brother Quan.

728
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:30,560
Go ahead.

729
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:31,760
May 1st.

730
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,360
According to our rules,

731
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,960
today is the Labor Festival.

732
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,560
It's three days off.

733
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,560
So I told Li Yuchun

734
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,160
that I'd be watching for three days.

735
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:42,160
He didn't even think about it.

736
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,560
Deng Weng, let's go.

737
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,760
I know that

738
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,160
all these things are due to the care of the princess.

739
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,160
He reminded me that

740
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,160
the princess has talent

741
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:55,360
and is very considerate of her.

742
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,160
Every time I meet a good teacher,

743
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,760
I'll be able to make a fair and square version.

744
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,560
But if I keep it from him,

745
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,160
I'll be able to do it on purpose.

746
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,960
So I'll have to hurry up and write the book.

747
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:08,160
It seems that I'll have to hurry up and write the poem.

748
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,760
The quality of the poem

749
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:10,960
will be a big deal.

750
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:13,560
It seems that every minute and every second

751
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,360
I'll have to use it on the knife

752
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:18,760
to hold Xu Qian'an's wife tightly.

753
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:23,760
So I can hold the princess's big box tightly.

754
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,560
Today is the second day

755
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:27,960
that I'm trying to learn to play the violin.

756
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:30,360
Princess, it's a little dance.

757
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,360
Are you going to get up or not?

758
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:34,760
You're calling me again?

759
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:36,960
I'm crying.

760
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,960
I didn't have much time to prepare the poem before I got married.

761
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:40,960
Let's go.

762
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,960
I'll go to the piano in the second floor.

763
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:44,360
We'll meet the day after tomorrow.

764
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,560
First, I'll give myself a day off.

765
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:47,960
Let's drink together.

766
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,360
I'll get up on the day after tomorrow.

767
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,960
Anyway, I'll meet the day after tomorrow.

768
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:59,560
I'll give myself a day off.

769
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,160
Cheers.

770
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:02,560
Good.

771
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:03,360
Good.

772
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:04,360
Good.

773
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,360
Good.

774
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:06,960
Good.

775
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:07,960
Good.

776
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,360
Yesterday was still a little bit of a shame.

777
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:14,560
So today,

778
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:17,160
I decided to make a strong move.

779
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:18,960
I woke up early.

780
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,160
Have an apple and a polka dot.

781
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,960
But I'm really sleepy.

782
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,160
Let's take this guy back first.

783
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,160
Earlier yesterday,

784
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:34,560
I attended theinkling of the Simpsons in the streets of Jiaojin

785
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,320
and my senior brother in Emperor restoring the imperial Marcus.

786
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:41,460
Ofc, it's better than holding it high with just a few glasses.

787
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:44,460
And I'm honest with myself.

788
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:47,160
I did so.

789
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,400
I was confused

790
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,320
when I woke up.

791
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,280
I was the one who asked for the medicine

792
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,600
and gave me the medicine

793
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,880
to wake up.

794
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:03,800
What should I do?

795
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,360
I'll see you tomorrow.

796
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,480
I haven't woken up.

797
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:08,880
What am I going to

798
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,800
get from the princess?

799
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,280
I haven't started to study.

800
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,640
How can I

801
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,920
get the title of Xu Qian?

802
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,360
What should I do?

803
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:22,680
I can't play for days.

804
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,280
Today is May 4th.

805
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,320
I asked for the title of

806
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,080
meeting the princess.

807
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,040
So,

808
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,800
I want to have a good time.

809
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,000
Si Jiang!

810
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,480
What does Princess Huai Xing usually say?

811
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:38,880
Write it down.

812
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,480
Yes.

813
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,120
Si Jiang!

814
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:43,960
Tell your teacher

815
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:46,080
how I use the acupuncture stone.

816
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:47,680
Si Jiang!

817
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,160
Si Jiang!

818
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:52,040
My good brother!

819
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,520
The acupuncture stone.

820
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,720
How should I evaluate it?

821
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:09,800
They only wrote me a few sentences.

822
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:15,920
I'm very proud of this.

823
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,080
The princess was obviously

824
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:19,280
shocked by my performance these days.

825
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,120
She gave me a very good evaluation.

826
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,280
Xu Qian!

827
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,000
You must give me the acupuncture stone!

828
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,560
I'll kill you!

829
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:27,760
Don't stop me!

830
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,080
I'll kill you!

831
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,520
I'll kill you!

832
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:31,920
Drink it!

833
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,120
Drink it!

834
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,360
I'll kill you!

835
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,000
I'll kill you!

836
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:40,880
Let's go!

837
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:41,480
I'll kill you!

838
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,080
I'll kill you!

839
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:42,880
I'll kill you!

840
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:43,520
I'll kill you!

841
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,360
I'll kill you!

842
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,080
I'll kill you!

843
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,800
You're making me angry again!

844
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,480
It's been three years.

845
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,040
It's been seven years.

846
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,200
I must be serious

847
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,000
about the next life.

848
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,200
I'll take care of

849
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,440
the rest of the family.

850
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,160
Princess,

851
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,440
do you want to kick the sword?

852
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,120
Have a rest.

853
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,160
Drink some wine.

854
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,080
I'll go.

855
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,840
Anyway, it's been three days.

856
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,240
Yes.

857
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,840
It's still early.

858
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,200
Why don't...

859
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,240
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

860
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,080
Wait for me!

861
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:41,960
Brother,

862
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:43,000
I'm serious.

863
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,280
You're making me angry again.

864
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,240
I'll kill you!

865
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:47,000
I'll kill you!

866
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,480
I'll kill you!

867
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,000
I'll kill you!

868
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,480
I'll kill you!

869
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,800
Sit down.

870
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,440
Aunt!

871
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,280
Wait for me.

872
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:05,280
Where are you going?

873
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,640
Let me go!

874
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:07,280
Let me go!

875
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,440
I'll start!

876
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,040
Lin Yunluo.

877
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:26,880
Tao.

878
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:29,680
I only allowed her to stay at home for three days.

879
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:30,880
Xu Qiyan is in a hurry.

880
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:31,800
He's not going to go back to Yamen.

881
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:32,840
He's such a jerk!

882
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,080
He...

883
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:37,080
He said he wanted to change

884
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,600
Yamen's secret.

885
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,880
He's going to close the door.

886
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,000
Yixun?

887
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:43,880
What's he thinking?

888
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,040
He's thinking about God!

889
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,080
Listen.

890
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,080
Go find him now

891
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,080
and bring him back.

892
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:50,280
No.

893
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,080
Mr. Li.

894
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,280
Congratulations, Mr. Li.

895
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,480
Congratulations, Mr. Li.

896
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,680
Thanks to your subordinate,

897
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:04,880
Tong Luo and Xu Qiyan,

898
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,080
we've made a change

899
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:09,480
according to his white-skinned book.

900
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:10,880
Guess what?

901
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,480
His efficiency is so high.

902
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:14,680
He's so short.

903
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:16,480
I can't even get over the case.

904
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:18,680
Look.

905
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,880
He's a fast-paced guy.

906
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:21,680
He's a fast-paced guy.

907
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,080
He's here with me.

908
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:25,480
But,

909
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,080
I told Mr. Li

910
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:27,880
that there's a palace

911
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:30,080
in here with your pool.

912
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:32,680
Look.

913
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:44,880
I've met Mr. Tao.

914
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,280
Mr. Li.

915
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:50,280
I heard that Xu Qiyan

916
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,480
is not in charge of teaching.

917
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:52,880
He's in the dark.

918
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:54,680
How about this?

919
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,080
You teach him to the person

920
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,080
in the palace.

921
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,880
I'll teach him to the person in charge.

922
00:40:59,280 --> 00:40:59,880
What do you say?

923
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:02,280
I'll let you down.

924
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,680
I'll let you down

925
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:06,080
when I'm in the spring and winter.

926
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:08,080
I'll never be in the dark.

927
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:14,680
But I heard that

928
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:15,880
Xu Qiyan

929
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:18,680
hasn't been in the dark for a long time.

930
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,680
I taught him to the person in charge.

931
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:26,680
Yes.

932
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,880
He's a good man.

933
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,680
He's a good man.

934
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:32,080
He's a good man.

935
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:33,680
He's young.

936
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,280
He's not that good.

937
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,480
I'm afraid that

938
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:41,480
he'll be affected by others.

939
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,080
Mr. Li.

940
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,080
You're so thoughtful.

941
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:49,880
Go.

942
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:52,880
What are you looking at?

943
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,080
You're so thoughtful.

944
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,080
You're so thoughtful.

945
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:01,080
You're so thoughtful.

946
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:03,880
Mr. Li.

947
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:04,880
Xu Qiyan,

948
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,480
do you still need me to take you home?

949
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:09,880
Go back to your work.

950
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:11,080
I'll take you home.

951
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:11,880
I'll take you home.

952
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:12,680
I'll take you home.

953
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:13,880
I'll take you home.

954
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:26,880
Ziyou.

955
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:30,680
The mountain has a path, but the snow has no teeth.

956
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:31,480
It's hard to make a choice.

957
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:31,880
Learn.

958
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:33,680
I've used it.

959
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:35,280
You have the face.

960
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:36,280
This one.

961
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,280
It's a book with a book.

962
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,280
It's a book with a golden house.

963
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:49,280
It's a book with a golden house.

964
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:50,280
I've used it.

965
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,280
It's been two hours.

966
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:06,680
I've made three sentences.

967
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:08,280
And two sentences are used.

968
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:12,280
When can you make the whole world?

969
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,880
Both sides will lose their sentences.

970
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:17,680
I'm so tired.

971
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:19,280
I have no thoughts.

972
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:21,080
I'll have a rest after eating.

973
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:23,280
That's a good idea.

974
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:25,680
When can I go back to the Academy?

975
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:27,480
When can I meet my teacher?

976
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,080
It's a good smell.

977
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:30,680
Have a bite.

978
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:31,480
No.

979
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,280
Erlang, don't be anxious.

980
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:35,280
Don't be angry.

981
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:36,880
I have a way.

982
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:42,080
Ningye.

983
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:45,880
Why don't you introduce me to Princess Zhang?

984
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:47,880
I'll be her horse.

985
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:50,080
Second Uncle, if he's happy,

986
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:51,880
you don't have to go there.

987
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:54,240
You can write a full-fledged

988
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:56,480
book for the teacher.

989
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:57,280
Right?

990
00:43:58,480 --> 00:43:59,680
Teacher, let's continue.

991
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:00,680
Let me think about it.

992
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:06,080
It's a small book with a poem.

993
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:06,680
Write it.

994
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:08,480
You've got it.

995
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:14,680
Big Brother,

996
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:17,080
Princess is here to see you.

997
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:18,880
What's so beautiful about her?

998
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:19,680
Don't be upset.

999
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:20,680
Big Brother is here to write a poem.

1000
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:22,680
I can help you.

1001
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:24,880
Miss Caiwei.

1002
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:26,480
What's the matter?

1003
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:27,280
I'm here to see you.

1004
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:28,680
Brother Song is here to see you.

1005
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:31,080
He said your mirror has a tombstone.

1006
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:33,280
Really?

1007
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:35,080
Let's go.

1008
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:36,480
Hurry up.

1009
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:37,480
Let's go.

1010
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:37,880
No.

1011
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:39,280
Who's the teacher in the library?

1012
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:40,480
Come back, Big Brother.

1013
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:43,480
Come back.

1014
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:50,480
How do you feel, Mother?

1015
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:53,680
Good.

1016
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:55,480
Although you're a half-man,

1017
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:57,080
you're a man.

1018
00:44:57,880 --> 00:44:58,480
Lin'an,

1019
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,880
you've been working in many families since you were a child.

1020
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:03,880
Mother,

1021
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:05,680
I've found a guest today.

1022
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:06,680
I've prepared a lot of poems

1023
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:09,280
for you.

1024
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:12,080
I want to compare them with the one I like.

1025
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:13,680
There's fish in the kitchen.

1026
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:17,480
It's a good thing.

1027
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:19,880
Hao Lin'an will be a great cook

1028
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:20,880
in the world.

1029
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:22,480
He'll be your brother.

1030
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:23,880
Look at you.

1031
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:25,280
You've been thin lately.

1032
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:27,280
Good.

1033
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:28,480
The kitchen is made

1034
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:30,680
your favorite beef blood cake.

1035
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:31,280
Come on.

1036
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:32,080
Try it.

1037
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:38,880
It's good.

1038
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:40,880
Chuntao,

1039
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:43,480
get some more for the princess.

1040
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:44,480
Yes.

1041
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:46,880
Thank you, Mother.

1042
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:51,480
Yunfei has been hurting me for a long time.

1043
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:55,680
Unfortunately, Your Highness the Noble Consort doesn't know

1044
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,480
that the princess doesn't like sweet food.

1045
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:03,280
But she must still care about me.

1046
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:05,880
Otherwise, she won't hurt me.

1047
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:11,080
Thanks to Xu Qian'an,

1048
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:12,480
I appreciate her.

1049
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:14,880
Where is she going today?

1050
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:17,480
She's been staying at home.

1051
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:19,080
She hasn't gone to play with someone yet.

1052
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:22,480
But according to her previous work,

1053
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:25,080
she'll go to play wine at the wedding.

1054
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:26,480
Where's Huaixian?

1055
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:28,480
She's going to work today.

1056
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:30,280
Today?

1057
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:31,680
25.

1058
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:33,480
It's the day

1059
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:35,080
that the princess went to the temple to study.

1060
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:37,480
After she's gone,

1061
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:39,480
I'll never go to the temple again.

1062
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:41,680
Princess.

1063
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:42,880
Princess.

1064
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:43,480
This way.

1065
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:43,880
Princess.

1066
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:44,680
This way.

1067
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:45,880
Princess.

1068
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:46,680
Princess.

1069
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:47,680
Princess.

1070
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:48,280
What's wrong?

1071
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:49,680
Tell me when you're done.

1072
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:52,080
Xu Qian,

1073
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:53,680
I'm going to the temple.

1074
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:54,680
What?

1075
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:00,880
Come and have breakfast.

1076
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:01,680
No.

1077
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:03,680
I'm going to play with the same thing.

1078
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:04,880
Grandpa's farm,

1079
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:05,880
milk, water, milk.

1080
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:06,880
Brother, drink it every day.

1081
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:08,480
The protein is higher.

1082
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:09,880
The milk is lighter.

1083
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:11,880
It's like ice cream.

1084
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:13,080
The energy is low.

1085
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:14,280
Grandpa's farm.

1086
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:15,280
Come and have breakfast.

1087
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:16,280
The famous farm.

1088
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:17,680
I'm going to study.

1089
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:37,880
I'm going to the temple.

1090
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:07,880
I'm going to the temple.

1091
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:37,880
I'm going to the temple.

1092
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:07,880
I'm going to the temple.

1093
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:08,880
I'm going to the temple.

1094
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:09,880
I'm going to the temple.

1095
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:10,880
I'm going to study.

1096
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:11,880
I'm going to the temple.

1097
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:12,880
I'm going to study.

1098
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:13,880
I'm going to the temple.

1099
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:14,880
I'm going to study.

1100
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:15,880
I'm going to study.

1101
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:16,880
I'm going to study.

1102
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:17,880
I'm going to study.

1103
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:18,880
I'm going to study.

1104
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:19,880
I'm going to study.

1105
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:20,880
I'm going to study.

1106
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:21,880
I'm going to study.

1107
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:22,880
I'm going to study.

1108
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:23,880
I'm going to study.

1109
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:24,880
I'm going to study.

1110
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:25,880
I'm going to study.

1111
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:26,880
I'm going to study.

1112
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:27,880
I'm going to study.

1113
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:28,880
I'm going to study.

1114
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:29,880
I'm going to study.

1115
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:30,880
I'm going to study.

1116
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:31,880
I'm going to study.

1117
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:32,880
I'm going to study.

1118
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:33,880
I'm going to study.
