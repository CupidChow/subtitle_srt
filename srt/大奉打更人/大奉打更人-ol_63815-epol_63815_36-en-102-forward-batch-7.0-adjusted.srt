=Episode 36=

40
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:54,080
But I met several soldiers
from Chuzhou City before,

41
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,160
and I asked them.

42
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,640
None of them knew
about Duke Zhenbei's massacre.

43
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,240
Their memories might've been altered,

44
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,550
or they might not even know

45
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,000
what they did.

46
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:06,910
But in any case,

47
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,110
this is not something
a Fighter could do.

48
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:10,150
So,

49
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,030
Duke Zhenbei must have

50
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:16,080
top-level powerhouses
from other factions helping him.

51
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:17,510
The Witcher's Sect?

52
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:18,390
Yes.

53
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:22,990
Back in the capital,

54
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:25,080
they worked with Kui.

55
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:27,240
I don't know what happened,

56
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:29,390
but I think their cooperation has terminated.

57
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,480
After all,

58
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:32,990
Kui wouldn't let Duke Zhenbei
break through his limits.

59
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,200
Otherwise,

60
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:36,830
they wouldn't have tried to kill the Duchess.

61
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,110
What do you suggest?

62
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:39,710
Miaozhen,

63
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,830
I need you to get the word out

64
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:43,270
to Kui.

65
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:44,430
No problem.

66
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:46,870
My men are best at spreading news.

67
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,080
I'll stay and protect Mr. Zheng.

68
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,390
When you come back,

69
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,080
we'll go to Chuzhou together.

70
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:53,920
Sure.

71
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:01,380
(The Lost in the Wilderness)

72
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:13,230
Scouts reported back

73
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:14,340
that the core is in Chuzhou.

74
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:15,670
Good.

75
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,240
Pass my order.

76
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,960
(Mighty Bone)
Gather all Kui troops.

77
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,780
(Lord Qingyan of Kui,
3rd-Rank Overlord)

78
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,080
Attack Chuzhou.

79
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,830
Attack Chuzhou!

80
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:32,710
Attack Chuzhou!

81
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:41,300
(Duke Zhenbei, Marshal of Chuzhou,
3rd Rank Fighter)

82
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:45,080
They've found out.

83
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,830
As expected.

84
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,920
We kept the bloodshed in Chuzhou for months.

85
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,270
That was good enough.

86
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:55,760
How much longer will it take to work?

87
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,640
Six hours.

88
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,270
Without Mu Nanzhi,

89
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:01,430
even if you take the core,

90
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,390
you can't reach the 2nd Rank.

91
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:07,240
We've found a remedy, haven't we?

92
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,200
Rest assured.

93
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,430
A promise is a promise.

94
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:14,520
I won't go back on my word.

95
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:15,570
Together,

96
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:16,750
it's win-win...

97
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:19,950
Your Grace.

98
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,520
The Mighty Bone, General of Kui, is

99
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,520
marching to Chuzhou with his troops.

100
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:28,830
However,

101
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:32,050
Zheng Xinghuai's whereabouts remain unknown.

102
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:38,470
After this war,

103
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,680
if I reach the 2nd Rank,

104
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:43,000
I can't care less about him.

105
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,150
Even if I fail, you'll still be safe.

106
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,080
Don't worry.

107
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,590
Are you confident

108
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,440
of winning, Your Grace?

109
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:02,080
It's time for the Dafeng
to have a 2nd-Rank Fighter.

110
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,560
Over the years,

111
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,960
Kui and The Witcher's Sect
have been too wild.

112
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,830
They don't give a hoot about us!

113
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,440
After this war,

114
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:11,880
Mount Tuotian will be leveled.

115
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,760
That chief of Kui will be butchered

116
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,350
for our soldiers to have a bite.

117
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:48,100
(Chuzhou)

118
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:10,000
How many times has that girl fallen?

119
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,910
That's the 8th.

120
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:16,470
How many times has that woman

121
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:18,030
visited that stall?

122
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,320
The same, the 8th.

123
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:23,150
How many times has that senior passed here?

124
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:25,310
Also the 8th.

125
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:26,310
The 8th.

126
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,760
They've all come eight times.

127
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,350
Excuse me.

128
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:31,440
Would you like some noodles?

129
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:36,150
The 8th, too!

130
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:04,030
Charge!

131
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:06,200
Kui's in sight!

132
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,790
2,000 steps away!

133
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:24,200
800 steps!

134
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,200
Fire!

135
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:23,150
Duke Zhenbei!

136
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:24,200
The invincible!

137
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:25,470
Duke Zhenbei!

138
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:26,440
The invincible!

139
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,390
Duke Zhenbei!

140
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:28,230
The invincible!

141
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:29,230
Duke Zhenbei!

142
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:30,200
The invincible!

143
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,120
Duke Zhenbei!

144
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,080
The invincible!

145
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:35,760
The invincible?

146
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,080
You're invincible, huh?

147
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,560
But not anymore

148
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:42,200
after I kill you!

149
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,110
How absurd.

150
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:57,920
Duke Zhenbei! The invincible!

151
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,520
What's going on?

152
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,870
Is Kui attacking Chuzhou?

153
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:04,040
How dare they invade Chuzhou!

154
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,140
Are they provoking an all-out war against us?

155
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,080
It's a hallucination!

156
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,680
The bloodshed!

157
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:45,710
The bloodshed!

158
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,200
Those animals!

159
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,830
380,000 people lived in Chuzhou!

160
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,160
All of them were killed!

161
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,560
The Dafeng has ruled the state for 600 years

162
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:12,280
but never witnessed such atrocities!

163
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,870
I'm going back to impeach Duke Huai.

164
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:18,750
I won't stop until death!

165
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:24,830
As a duke of the state,

166
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,960
how could he harm innocent civilians?

167
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:31,040
He deserves more than death.

168
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:33,320
More than death!

169
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,680
The bloodshed happened

170
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:41,870
in Chuzhou.

171
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,200
The core.

172
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,590
Attack!

173
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:03,350
How fragile!

174
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:05,200
Once my core is formed,

175
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,960
you'll all be as weak as ants.

176
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:09,310
Chuzhou

177
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,750
will enjoy forever peace!

178
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:26,070
Who is it?

179
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,830
How come?

180
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,280
This is

181
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:04,200
the core forged

182
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:05,630
by the people of Chuzhou.

183
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,240
Very well.

184
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,750
I can also command this sword.

185
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:55,470
Impossible.

186
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:02,040
Whoever you are,

187
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:05,040
the master of the Supreme Sword

188
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:08,230
can only be the Dafeng royalty.

189
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,080
Kui from the North

190
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:12,560
keeps invading our border

191
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:13,990
and harming our people.

192
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:15,520
This is

193
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:18,230
a once-in-a-lifetime chance to destroy them.

194
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,440
So

195
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,040
you massacred the civilians in Chuzhou?

196
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,800
They were worthless ants.

197
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:31,400
Blood will be shed to achieve greatness.

198
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,320
How about we join hands

199
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:40,110
and crush Kui?

200
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:41,230
After this war,

201
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,470
Chuzhou

202
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,920
will enjoy forever peace!

203
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:50,880
Pass.

204
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,800
I'm here to kill you.

205
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,680
Who exactly is he?

206
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:32,080
No idea.

207
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:35,800
Who is that?

208
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:36,640
Can't see it clearly.

209
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,030
Duke Zhenbei,

210
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:43,810
you shall die.

211
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:51,320
Duke Zhenbei,

212
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,080
in order to reach the 2nd Rank,

213
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:57,710
you killed 380,000 people of Chuzhou.

214
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,870
They all died because of you.

215
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,470
All of them respected you

216
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:06,400
and saw you as a hero
for guarding the border.

217
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,710
But you had them trampled by the cavalry.

218
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:12,350
You colluded with The Witcher's Sect

219
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,470
and used their dark spell

220
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,990
to refine your Qi energy

221
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:17,800
and take others' lives.

222
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,590
Such extreme brutalities

223
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,160
are unforgivable.

224
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,520
Duke Zhenbei,

225
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,710
do you deserve your troops' support?

226
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:30,630
Do you deserve 380,000 people's respect?

227
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:31,560
Shut up!

228
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,960
You cold-blood animal!

229
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:51,320
Who are you?

230
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:53,750
How dare you defame me

231
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:54,830
and ruin my name!

232
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:57,510
Is... what he just said true?

233
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:58,920
Soldiers,

234
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:01,800
this is Kui's scheme!

235
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,990
They're trying to frame Duke Zhenbei!

236
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:07,350
To guard the border, he hasn't
returned to the capital for decades.

237
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:09,590
He's a national hero!

238
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:12,310
Duke Zhenbei cannot die.

239
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:14,960
He's the soul of the Dafeng army.

240
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:17,120
The state needs him!

241
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:18,510
The people

242
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,200
need him!

243
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:21,920
Follow Duke Zhenbei to death!

244
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,640
Follow Duke Zhenbei to death!

245
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,510
Follow Duke Zhenbei to death!

246
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,310
Follow Duke Zhenbei to death!

247
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:29,070
Follow Duke Zhenbei to death!

248
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,840
Follow Duke Zhenbei to death!

249
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:34,120
The soul of the Supreme Sword

250
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,230
can judge people's characters

251
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,600
and read their minds.

252
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,640
If you have a clear conscience,

253
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,200
ask the sword

254
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,440
if it'll choose you.

255
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,040
I...

256
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,360
What am I seeing?

257
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:39,030
I must be hallucinated.

258
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:41,230
The Supreme Sword has left Duke Zhenbei.

259
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,480
Tell me.

260
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,400
Did he kill all the people of Chuzhou?

261
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:46,180
Did he slaughter all of them?

262
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,270
Impossible!

263
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,600
No way!

264
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,070
The evil will be

265
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,600
punished by heaven.

266
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,600
Duke Zhenbei,

267
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:05,160
you murdered all of them.

268
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,120
Did it ever cross your mind that...?

269
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,550
Shut up and act!

270
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:09,800
I can't hold it

271
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,750
for too long!

272
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,120
Your life ends now!

273
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,750
Now, I remember!

274
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,640
Duke Huai used us.

275
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:13,840
We did it.

276
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:16,550
We killed all those people!

277
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:20,270
We did it!

278
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:23,200
Kill him...

279
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,680
Kill Duke Zhenbei!

280
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,600
Kill Duke Zhenbei!

281
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:31,550
Kill him...!

282
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:34,880
Kill Duke Zhenbei!

283
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:41,640
Poor people of Chuzhou!

284
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:45,790
All of you

285
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:48,640
shouldn't have died!

286
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:53,590
Let's go!

287
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,360
How ironic.

288
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:06,030
We're fighting to the death

289
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:09,470
for a bunch of worthless ants.

290
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:13,510
Ironic?

291
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,920
Is it ironic to fight for ordinary people?

292
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:19,030
Without them,

293
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,200
how could you be a duke?

294
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,960
Whose duke would you be?

295
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,400
If you kill me,

296
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:29,960
Chuzhou will never regain peace.

297
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:34,070
I'll teach you something for the deceased.

298
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,440
You...

299
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,750
are also an ant.

300
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,680
Duke Zhenbei's energy is gone.

301
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:55,440
Enter the city first.

302
00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:58,960
What happened in Chuzhou?

303
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:04,590
Let's go.

304
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,720
Let's go.

305
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:29,980
(No.)

306
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:31,740
(That chief of Kui can't be spared.)

307
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:33,540
(Or Chuzhou will never be safe.)

308
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:22,580
Wait here for me.

309
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:43,540
Xu Qi'an...

310
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:08,900
The chief of Kui?

311
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,340
Who is it?

312
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:50,780
Xu Qi'an?

313
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,740
Mr. Zheng,

314
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:13,370
thank you

315
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:16,500
for all that you did for Chuzhou.

316
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:25,660
Xu Qi'an!

317
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:41,860
Duke Zhenbei was killed!

318
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:43,460
Guardian Yang Yan is here

319
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:46,860
to escort Commissioner Zheng back

320
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,500
to lead Chuzhou!

321
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:57,260
Mr. Zheng.

322
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:00,860
Duke Zhenbei

323
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:02,740
is dead?

324
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:04,740
He was killed.

325
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:06,580
His body remains in Chuzhou.

326
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:08,100
Yes! Great!

327
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,020
Finally, he's dead!

328
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:10,100
We can go back!

329
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:11,820
We can go home!

330
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:12,900
Yes!

331
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:15,100
Gentlemen,

332
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:15,940
let's

333
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:17,660
go back.

334
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:26,820
Mr. Zheng,

335
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:28,860
let's go.

336
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:30,500
Sir...

337
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:36,860
I need

338
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:40,340
a minute of alone time.

339
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:00,020
Yes.

340
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:18,940
(Seven Days Later)

341
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:23,260
(The Lost in the Wilderness)

342
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:36,980
(The Lost in the Wilderness)

343
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:56,540
(Master,)

344
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:58,380
(are you still there?)

345
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:00,150
(Master?)

346
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:21,980
Mr. Xu,

347
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:24,220
you can't move.

348
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:26,700
Your veins and Qi were damaged.

349
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:28,980
You survived by sheer luck.

350
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:31,060
Without your two colleagues

351
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:33,380
transferring Qi forces to you day and night,

352
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:35,700
who knows if you'd survive?

353
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:37,100
My two colleagues?

354
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:38,140
Who are they?

355
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:40,820
They...

356
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:46,300
- Ningyan!
- Ningyan!

357
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:49,500
- Ningyan!
- Ningyan!

358
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:03,820
Thanks, guys.

359
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:12,420
Thanks for your work today.

360
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:14,980
I'll have to trouble you again
to repair houses

361
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:16,020
on the west side tomorrow.

362
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:16,890
Sure. No problem.

363
00:31:16,890 --> 00:31:19,020
It's our honor to participate

364
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:20,340
in rebuilding Chuzhou.

365
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:21,180
We'll

366
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:23,020
follow Winged Woman to death!

367
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:26,100
Master.

368
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:34,340
Didn't I tell you

369
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:35,700
not to come?

370
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:37,260
You'd hold back the work here.

371
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:39,740
Focus!

372
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:46,220
What's up?

373
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:48,180
Was that Copper Gong mean to you again?

374
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:51,220
Mr. Xu woke up.

375
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:53,940
The South?

376
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:59,580
So this Golden Silkworm...

377
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:01,060
Golden Gu.

378
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:02,900
Golden Gu.

379
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:06,620
Didn't you go to destroy
The Witcher's Sect in Yunzhou?

380
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:08,540
Why turn to the South to rear the Golden Gu?

381
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:12,100
Long story.

382
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:13,900
On the day of your funeral,

383
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:15,340
we were overwhelmed with grief.

384
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,580
Some came up with this idea,

385
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:19,340
and others agreed.

386
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,680
On the spur of the moment,

387
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:23,780
we set out with no way

388
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:25,900
of coming back.

389
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:46,060
To avenge your death,

390
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:47,100
originally,

391
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,500
we meant to go to Yunzhou

392
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:49,860
to wipe out The Witcher's Sect.

393
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:51,340
Unexpectedly,

394
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:52,660
a tsunami struck,

395
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:53,740
plunging us

396
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:54,660
into the sea.

397
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:58,780
A vicious fish coveted our flesh

398
00:32:58,780 --> 00:32:59,940
and attacked us fiercely.

399
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:00,860
The three of us

400
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:02,660
protected Mr. Yang with our lives

401
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:04,260
and fought back bravely.

402
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:06,340
Thanks to our superb skills,

403
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,980
we made a narrow escape.

404
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:09,700
After that,

405
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,180
we floated for one day...

406
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:15,140
two days...

407
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:16,980
three days...

408
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:19,020
and arrived at an unknown island.

409
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:21,140
Despite the tough environment,

410
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:23,430
we remained optimistic

411
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:26,220
and tried various ways to seek help.

412
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:28,100
We made smoke.

413
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,380
We banged gongs.

414
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:32,780
We used a carrier pigeon.

415
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:35,900
To gain food,

416
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:37,940
we battled with nature.

417
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:39,620
It was really hard

418
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:41,740
to survive on that island.

419
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:43,420
Finally,

420
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:45,140
two weeks later,

421
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:47,380
a fishing boat passed by.

422
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:48,700
It took us

423
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:50,380
to Yunzhou.

424
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:57,580
However,

425
00:33:58,260 --> 00:33:59,340
when we got off,

426
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,780
(Yunzhou)
we didn't end up in Yunzhou

427
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:02,020
(South)
but in the South!

428
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:05,380
Somehow, we annoyed a local Gu Master

429
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:06,740
who went after us

430
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:10,420
for one day...

431
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:13,380
two days...

432
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,500
three days...

433
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:17,180
Unexpectedly,

434
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:19,900
the Gu led us back to our capital.

435
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:20,860
(Capital of the Dafeng)

436
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:21,700
But

437
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:23,100
as soon as we arrived,

438
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:24,300
Lord Wei said,

439
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,740
"Now that you're back,

440
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:28,260
there's no time to rest.

441
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:30,500
Go on to Chuzhou in the north.

442
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:33,100
Xu Qi'an is there waiting for you."

443
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:36,910
Ningyan is still alive!

444
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:38,060
We're sworn brothers

445
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:39,750
forever!

446
00:34:43,910 --> 00:34:44,780
Let's go!

447
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:58,420
We're sworn brothers.

448
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:03,020
Forever!

449
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:08,420
(Chuzhou)

450
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:13,580
(Guangliang)

451
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:17,460
Sir.

452
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:27,020
Chuzhou was

453
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:29,460
barren and cold,

454
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:32,340
facing Kui's constant invasions.

455
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:35,780
But the locals were honest and kind.

456
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:40,060
I'm over 50 years old.

457
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:43,620
I spent half of my life guarding Chuzhou.

458
00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:46,010
But now...

459
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:48,470
♪Out of fury, I wield my saber♪

460
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:55,060
♪To cut down injustice and triumph over evil♪

461
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:58,340
♪Across eternity, this realm
feels like an endless night♪

462
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:01,990
♪Only my steadfast heart remains unchanged♪

463
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:05,390
♪Stars and constellations
scattered like murky smoke♪

464
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:07,100
"Fame and wealth

465
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:08,860
are like a piece of paper

466
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:13,860
to turn to dust eventually."

467
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:16,160
♪Darkness disintegrates before me♪

468
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:17,060
History will

469
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:20,140
record this to warn future generations.

470
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:21,700
Also,

471
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:25,180
it'll write down Duke Zhenbei's atrocities,

472
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:27,780
leaving him to be condemned forever.

473
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:31,980
Will the court

474
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:35,140
convict Duke Zhenbei?

475
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:36,780
He might've been

476
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:38,580
a member of royalty

477
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:39,820
and a war hero,

478
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:41,100
but...

479
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:45,580
We have to fight for victory.

480
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:49,660
Mr. Xu.

481
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:00,860
It's not easy to convict Duke Zhenbei,

482
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:02,660
but there's a way we can try.

483
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:03,780
What way?

484
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:05,080
Return to the capital now

485
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:06,780
to seize the initiative.

486
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:08,140
Gain the majority's support

487
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:09,620
to conclude this case.

488
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:12,060
Chuzhou suffered huge losses.

489
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:13,900
It takes time for the city to recover.

490
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:15,700
It's too soon to go back.

491
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:17,100
Duke Zhenbei is dead,

492
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:19,100
but his crimes haven't been made public.

493
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:21,820
I heard Que Yongxiu had fled
to avoid punishment.

494
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:23,340
He was Duke Huai's deputy

495
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:25,700
and one of the prime culprits
in the bloodshed.

496
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:28,180
If he beats us to it to see His Majesty

497
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:29,340
and twists the facts,

498
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:30,420
trouble might arise.

499
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:33,380
As for the details of our plan,

500
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:35,460
we can discuss them

501
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:36,540
on the way back.

502
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:38,940
Commissioner Zheng is the main witness.

503
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:40,660
He has to go back with us.

504
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:41,980
But Chuzhou

505
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:44,180
can't be left unsupervised.

506
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:45,700
Someone has to take charge.

507
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:48,020
I can recommend a person.

508
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:50,420
Li Yuanhua.

509
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:52,560
He was Duke Zhenbei's right-hand man

510
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,980
and took part in the bloodshed, too.

511
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:56,080
He was controlled
by The Witcher's Sect's dark spell

512
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:57,020
against his will.

513
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:58,540
Based on my observation,

514
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:00,060
he's honest and upright,

515
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:01,140
calm and collected.

516
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:02,620
More importantly,

517
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,300
he's led the troops here for years

518
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:05,660
and gained high prestige.

519
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:08,140
The truth dealt the army a heavy blow,

520
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:09,060
shaking the morale.

521
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:10,180
He stepped forward

522
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:11,460
to appease everyone

523
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:12,460
and deal with everything.

524
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:13,540
Also, he's the one

525
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:16,060
who's repairing the city with the troops

526
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,080
and restoring the morale.

527
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:19,140
General Li and I aren't close,

528
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,780
but I've heard of his integrity, kindness,

529
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:23,780
and prestige in the army.

530
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:26,060
He's suitable.

531
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:27,420
Guards.

532
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:29,940
Tell General Li to come here.

533
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:31,100
Yes.

534
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:33,900
Take care of the things

535
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:35,740
of the Breeze Hall.

536
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:37,780
Yes.

537
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:39,500
How's your condition?

538
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:41,580
I'm fine. I survived by luck.

539
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:43,100
You were severely injured.

540
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:44,660
You need to rest for three months.

541
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:48,060
Lord Wei sent us

542
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:49,460
to protect

543
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:50,940
the mission covertly.

544
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:52,780
Gold Gong Nangong said

545
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:53,940
during this trip,

546
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:56,540
you killed a chief of Kui on your own.

547
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:58,140
He looked like those being killed

548
00:38:58,420 --> 00:38:59,300
by that thing in...

549
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:00,940
That evil object once sealed in Sangbo

550
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:02,340
is now inside me.

551
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:07,100
Don't worry.

552
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:09,380
He's fallen asleep.

553
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:10,940
He's not evil by nature.

554
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:12,340
He won't mess up my mind.

555
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:13,180
Does

556
00:39:13,490 --> 00:39:14,510
Lord Wei know?

557
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:16,340
Yes.

558
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:18,180
Good.

559
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:24,100
Yan.

560
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:28,740
I'll reconfirm it with Lord Wei
when I get back.

561
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:32,540
Tread carefully in the future.

562
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:33,700
Remember,

563
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:36,700
do not keep anything from us.

564
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:38,140
If you have doubts,

565
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:40,180
ask Lord Wei first.

566
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:44,100
Yes.

567
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:45,180
Sir,

568
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:46,700
bad news! Sir!

569
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:49,500
Sir, bad news!

570
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:50,580
What happened?

571
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:52,860
General Li

572
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:54,380
gave away all his properties

573
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:55,800
and killed himself in the army!

574
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:57,780
He only left this note.

575
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:03,420
(I'm guilty.)

576
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:05,540
"I'm guilty."

577
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:24,300
(10 Days Later)

578
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:28,020
(Wharf, Capital)
There's a little fox

579
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:31,500
sitting on a slope.

580
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:35,740
As the swing swings,

581
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:39,260
petals fall like snow.

582
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:43,180
(Peace and Prosperity)
April was always frostless.

583
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:46,900
Why are people heartbroken?

584
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:50,460
Farmers are busy with spring plowing.

585
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:51,900
We've arrived. You may come out.

586
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,740
Sighs and wails linger.

587
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:57,140
Deceased soldiers are coming home.

588
00:40:58,020 --> 00:40:58,980
Silver Gong Xu,

589
00:40:59,770 --> 00:41:01,850
I understand we have to go fast and light

590
00:41:02,110 --> 00:41:04,860
without telling the court we're back,

591
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:06,860
but this is too tough.

592
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:09,100
Go ashore, sir.

593
00:41:15,650 --> 00:41:16,490
Mr. Zheng.

594
00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:19,570
Be careful.

595
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:32,780
(Peace and Prosperity)

596
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:47,460
Who are those people?

597
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:48,980
Why are there Guardians?

598
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:51,340
Did something bad happen in the capital?

599
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:54,220
As the swing swings,

600
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:56,620
petals fall like snow.

601
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:59,180
April was always frostless.

602
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:02,060
Why are people heartbroken?

603
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:04,900
Farmers are busy with spring plowing.

604
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:07,500
Sighs and wails linger.

605
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:10,820
Deceased soldiers are coming home.

606
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:20,780
(Shiqian Gate)

607
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:33,540
Go report to His Majesty.

608
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:36,340
The mission to investigate
the case in Chuzhou

609
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:37,980
is back in the capital.
