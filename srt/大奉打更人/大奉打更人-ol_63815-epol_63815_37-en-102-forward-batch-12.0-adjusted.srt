The mission to investigate
the case in Chuzhou

42
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,910
is back in the capital.

00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:25,940
(Shiqian Gate)

44
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:51,040
Your Majesty.

45
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:52,960
Your Majesty.

46
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,520
The mission from Chuzhou has returned.

47
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,550
My Lords.

48
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,710
Greetings...

49
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:37,510
Look.

50
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,870
Your Majesty, you've caught
such a big fish.

51
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,360
Your Majesty.

52
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,430
Slow down.

53
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,150
Come on, step aside.

54
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,200
Step aside.

55
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:55,240
I've inquired with the Cabinet.

56
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:59,040
We've never received
any documents from you.

57
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,430
Don't you know the rules?

58
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,360
Your Majesty,

59
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:07,870
the current situation in Chuzhou
makes it impossible to send documents.

60
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:16,110
Why are you here?

61
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,320
As the Commissioner of Chuzhou,

62
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,590
how dare you enter the capital

63
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,800
without permission from the court?

64
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,350
Chuzhou City has gone.

65
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,390
The Commissioner of Chuzhou

66
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:36,440
has become a mere title.

67
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,150
Duke Zhenbei,
General Commander of Chuzhou,

68
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,270
collaborated with the Witcher's Sect
to advance his rank

69
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:49,910
and slaughtered 380,000 commoners
of Chuzhou.

70
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:51,190
I petition

71
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,880
to impeach Duke Zhenbei.

72
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:57,200
Your Majesty, please bring justice
to the innocent people who died

73
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:59,320
and punish Duke Zhenbei severely.

74
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,230
I petition

75
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,080
to impeach Duke Zhenbei.

76
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,880
- Seconded.
- Seconded.

77
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,880
Where is

78
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,560
Duke Zhenbei now?

79
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,910
Duke Zhenbei

80
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:34,470
has been executed.

81
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,590
Let me ask again.

82
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:53,270
Where is Duke Zhenbei?

83
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:57,390
Duke Zhenbei

84
00:05:58,590 --> 00:05:59,880
is dead.

85
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:02,960
Impossible.

86
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,590
You're lying to me.

87
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,120
This cannot be.

88
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,830
You are all deceiving me.

89
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:11,880
Where is he?

90
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:13,150
Where is he?

91
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,480
Your Majesty,

92
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,000
please take care of your health.

93
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,120
Guards, protect His Majesty!

94
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,520
Your Majesty,

95
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,640
please take care of your health.

96
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:26,270
Your Majesty,

97
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:28,350
please take care of your health.

98
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:40,830
What's wrong?

99
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,790
Zhenbei!

100
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,200
Zhenbei!

101
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,680
Your Majesty,
please take care of yourself.

102
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,560
Don't grieve too much.

103
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:07,230
You must know

104
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:08,740
that deep love leads to an early death.

105
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,030
If the people of Chuzhou knew
how sad you are for them,

106
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,390
they would find comfort

107
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,270
even in the afterlife.

108
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:29,910
Duke Zhenbei slaughtered
380,000 commoners

109
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:31,320
of Chuzhou.

110
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:33,200
He deserved to die!

111
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:35,320
But now that he's dead,

112
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:38,000
his crime has not been fully proven.

113
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:40,350
How we should deal with it

114
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:42,350
is for Your Majesty to decide.

115
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,110
I have no objections.

116
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:03,310
Get lost.

117
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:08,470
I told you to get lost.

118
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:10,510
When do you plan to announce this
to the world?

119
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:25,680
Do you truly think

120
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:29,080
I wouldn't dare kill you?

121
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:30,310
Is that so?

122
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:39,680
- I'll kill you now.
- Your Majesty.

123
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:43,110
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

124
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:47,630
Do you believe

125
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,470
I'll kill you too?

126
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,160
My family has already been killed.

127
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:23,040
Everyone, get lost!

128
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:34,640
Your Majesty,
please take care of yourself.

129
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,110
I will take my leave first.

130
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,040
Mr. Zheng.

131
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:21,630
Xu Qi'an,

132
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,750
don't you know the rules?

133
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,400
I didn't report back to the yamen first.

134
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:28,990
Lord Wei, please punish me.

135
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:43,230
Serve the tea.

136
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,000
Yes.

137
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:00,230
About Chuzhou,

138
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,870
is there anything else you want to add?

139
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:04,670
Yes.

140
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:06,830
When I was in Sanhuang County,

141
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:08,400
there was a scout named Cai,

142
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,750
who gave me incorrect information.

143
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,990
It was an excuse to send you away.

144
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:14,680
Chuzhou was too dangerous.

145
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:15,620
If you had gone,

146
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:17,740
it would've been like a lamb
entering a tiger's den.

147
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:21,230
I once asked Li Miaozhen

148
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:23,680
to spread the news
of the city's massacre to the Kui,

149
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,680
but later she told me

150
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,080
before she could spread the word,

151
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:29,400
the Kui was already at Chuzhou's gates.

152
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:30,710
The timing was right,

153
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:32,930
and there was no time for her.

154
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:35,470
Lord Wei,

155
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:36,990
you knew all along

156
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:38,590
that Duke Zhenbei massacred Chuzhou.

157
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,400
Lord Wei, how did you know?

158
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:43,760
I guessed.

159
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:45,630
You guessed?

160
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:48,110
Before the mission set off,

161
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,160
Duke Zhenbei had borrowed
the Supreme Sword from the court.

162
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,320
Why did he borrow it?

163
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:56,560
To resist the northern wars?

164
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:58,800
There have always been wars
in the North.

165
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:01,110
He was worried
that the core might emerge,

166
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:02,590
and the Kui army would press down.

167
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:04,710
If he couldn't control the situation,

168
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:06,630
he planned to use the Supreme Sword

169
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,400
to suppress the Kui.

170
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,040
Duke Zhenbei

171
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,560
was really scheming.

172
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:14,750
But no matter how he planned,

173
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:18,800
he didn't expect
that a mysterious man would come

174
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,630
and easily turn the tide,

175
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,630
causing him to lose everything.

176
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:27,350
When I had you go get
The Lost in the Wilderness,

177
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,800
it was also to give you the power
to protect yourself.

178
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,200
But Lord Wei,

179
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:33,800
given the situation, I had no choice.

180
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,960
You did nothing wrong.

181
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:36,710
But

182
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:40,470
Duke Zhenbei did not have to die
in Chuzhou.

183
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:43,200
Duke Zhenbei aimed
to reach the 2nd rank.

184
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,350
If that had happened,

185
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:45,920
who would've been able to deal with him?

186
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:47,800
He couldn't reach the 2nd rank.

187
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:50,830
You intercepted the Duchess in advance.

188
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:53,310
You...

189
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:55,350
You knew everything.

190
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,870
If Duke Zhenbei had won,

191
00:13:58,110 --> 00:13:59,320
devoured the core,

192
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:01,400
and reached the 3rd Rank Perfection,

193
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,440
his next move would've been
to attack the Kui

194
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,800
or even the Witcher's Sect.

195
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:06,280
We could've made them

196
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:07,960
enemies of Duke Zhenbei.

197
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,590
We could've driven the tiger
to swallow the wolves

198
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,680
and also turned the wolves
against the tiger.

199
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,960
On the battlefield,

200
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,400
there would've been countless ways
to punish them.

201
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,590
Once we'd used them enough,

202
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,540
it would've been easy to eliminate them.

203
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:23,320
But Lord Wei,

204
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,510
if we waited until afterward

205
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:27,590
to pursue Duke Zhenbei's crimes,

206
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,590
does it still hold any meaning?

207
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,040
The meaning is different,

208
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,160
but the risk is much smaller.

209
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,560
The outcome

210
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,630
is still the same.

211
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:43,830
We'll still bring justice
to the people of Chuzhou.

212
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:48,510
Xu Qi'an,

213
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:50,920
you must remember this:

214
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:52,990
A wise strategist

215
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:54,200
must know patience.

216
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:58,230
You were lucky
not to get exposed this time.

217
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,160
If you keep

218
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,920
acting with reckless bravery,

219
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:05,110
though it's satisfying for a moment,

220
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,040
you will lose

221
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,680
much more.

222
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:16,110
I understand.

223
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,990
You brought Duke Zhenbei's remains

224
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,750
back to the capital.

225
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:31,990
What are your plans for the future?

226
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,400
Convict Duke Zhenbei

227
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:38,110
and bring justice
to the people of Chuzhou.

228
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,560
Court affairs are not your area
of expertise.

229
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,470
You should

230
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:43,920
stop right here.

231
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,620
Lord Wei, what do you mean by this?

232
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,660
(Warmth)

233
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,080
The unparalleled genius Xu Qi'an,

234
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:13,560
with a face like jade,

235
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,870
floats like an immortal

236
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:16,920
and stands eight chi tall.

237
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:18,160
Nine chi.

238
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:19,170
Yes.

239
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,040
Yes.

240
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,440
With sharp insight,

241
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,440
solving cases like a god,

242
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,110
he's often able to strategize,

243
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:25,560
winning from miles away.

244
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:28,080
When the Yunzhou rebels
surged toward him,

245
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:30,750
Mr. Xu alone stood
against hundreds of thousands of them

246
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:32,470
and almost died in a foreign land.

247
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:33,310
Wait a minute.

248
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:36,560
It's millions.

249
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:37,520
Yes.

250
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,040
Your Highness,

251
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,350
isn't this a bit too exaggerated?

252
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:44,750
Before, he was fighting a thousand,

253
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:45,650
then ten thousand,

254
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:47,200
and even hundreds of thousands.

255
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,440
But now,

256
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,830
he's fighting millions?

257
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,960
I'm afraid the entire Yunzhou

258
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,350
doesn't have that many people.

259
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:54,610
What's the problem with that?

260
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,870
I'm just helping Xu Qi'an

261
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,130
promote his achievements
and establish his reputation.

262
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,750
The larger the number, the better.

263
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:01,830
But

264
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,800
it should still be realistic, right?

265
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,470
This is truly too exaggerated.

266
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,440
If not, how else can we help him?

267
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,240
Think about it.

268
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:12,230
This time he went to Chuzhou
for the case.

269
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:14,000
He'll surely be caught in a dilemma.

270
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,280
Moreover,

271
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:16,990
he is just a viscount.

272
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:20,230
With us backing him,

273
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:21,790
first,

274
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,990
it will reduce potential obstacles.

275
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:25,360
Second,

276
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:29,200
even if he doesn't uncover anything,

277
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,680
and if Father blames him,

278
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,680
the whole world will defend him.

279
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,720
Your Highness,

280
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:39,400
you really care

281
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,550
about Mr. Xu.

282
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:45,200
Because he's my good guest adviser.

283
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,710
Besides,

284
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:50,440
he sent me a gift

285
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,750
despite our distance.

286
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:54,880
Of course, I have to return the favor.

287
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:56,750
It's just a piece of Butter Jade.

288
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:59,120
How many gifts
have you given his family?

289
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:01,750
But I can feel his sincerity.

290
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:03,400
What do you know?

291
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:07,110
By the way,

292
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,440
remember to attach Xu Qi'an's poem
at the end

293
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,210
and have someone polish

294
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:12,250
and make a thousand copies

295
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:14,640
to distribute at all the inns
inside and outside the city.

296
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,600
- Yes.
- Yes.

297
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:17,990
Your Highness.

298
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:19,070
Your Highness.

299
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:20,070
Your Highness.

300
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,400
Why are you running in panic?

301
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:23,270
The mission has returned.

302
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:24,550
Really?

303
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:29,310
Why didn't you get the news in advance?

304
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,280
I...

305
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:32,510
This can't be.

306
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,160
I've made arrangements everywhere.

307
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:36,990
I should've received the news
the moment they returned.

308
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:39,710
Xuan, what's going on?

309
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:41,070
When did they return?

310
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:42,550
I don't know.

311
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:45,440
I only know that they met His Majesty
as soon as they returned.

312
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,400
His Majesty was furious

313
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,130
and locked himself
in the Imperial Study.

314
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:50,970
Just now, the Noble Consort
and the Crown Prince went to visit him.

315
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:52,300
What happened?

316
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:54,540
Touring the Five Mountains,

317
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:56,280
I met the host.

318
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:58,440
He is Mr. Wang, possessing books

319
00:18:58,820 --> 00:18:59,940
from countless cities.

320
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:01,960
Among a crowd of thousands,

321
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:03,440
a handshake with him

322
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,120
leaves my sleeve scented

323
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:07,160
for three years.

324
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:10,440
How's this poem?

325
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,510
Prime Minister, don't hesitate
to give your advice.

326
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:22,360
It's not good.

327
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,710
The long wind will surely

328
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,360
break the waves,

329
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,200
hoisting the sails,

330
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:35,920
to cross the vast sea.

331
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,840
How about this line?

332
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:41,550
Prime Minister, please guide me.

333
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,640
The Prime Minister is here.

334
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:51,510
Greetings, Prime Minister.

335
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,510
No need to bow.

336
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,510
The Prime Minister didn't come.

337
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:08,740
(Xiaoxiang Poetry)

338
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,600
It seems like the Prime Minister

339
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,310
still holds deep prejudice against me,

340
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,230
refusing to meet until now.

341
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:27,310
Father originally wanted to attend

342
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:28,880
today's poetry gathering.

343
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,600
He was already outside,

344
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,680
but he met the mission from Chuzhou.

345
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,750
The mission?

346
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,030
The mission is back?

347
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,200
But why didn't Ningyan

348
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:42,960
send someone to notify us?

349
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:46,640
Something happened.

350
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,160
What happened?

351
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,270
- Get lost.
- Open the door.

352
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:53,920
We must meet with His Majesty.

353
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:55,710
We must meet with His Majesty.

354
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:56,550
How dare you!

355
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:02,760
Xinnian,

356
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,840
you may speak freely.

357
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,920
Though this act
might offend His Majesty,

358
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,990
it is your chance
to make a name for yourself.

359
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:12,550
Simu,

360
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,510
I did not come

361
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,200
to make a name for myself.

362
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,790
Open the door! We must meet His Majesty.

363
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:37,160
How dare you!

364
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:38,470
His Majesty has ordered:

365
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:40,750
If you dare to barge into the Palace,

366
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:42,160
you will be executed!

367
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,120
Duke Huai should be demoted
to a commoner

368
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:46,130
to give the world an explanation

369
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:47,750
for slaughtering the commoners
as a duke!

370
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:48,590
Exactly.

371
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:50,070
Give the world an explanation!

372
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:51,070
Duke Zhenbei

373
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:52,880
deserved to die
for slaughtering the people.

374
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,200
We must seek justice
for the people of Chuzhou!

375
00:21:56,770 --> 00:21:57,640
Get up!

376
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,880
Let us in!

377
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,960
Move aside!

378
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:14,200
The rat bears teeth, yet men lack shame.

379
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,920
Without shame, how can men live?

380
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:20,400
Unlike locusts,
kings can have no courtesy.

381
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,070
When kings forsake their courtesy,
the nation's ruin is but a day.

382
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:24,560
Now we hear of Duke Huai's deed:

383
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,550
He slaughtered a city
to serve his greed.

384
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:27,830
Alas!

385
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:29,160
How grievous the heavens cry!

386
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,270
Thus, I came here.

387
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:35,400
(Four hours later)
Scholars are called of no worth,

388
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,330
but they never wield a blade
against commoners.

389
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,840
You, clad in gold,

390
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,570
how dare you hold a spear
against the dead?

391
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,960
Alas, as vast as Chuzhou is,

392
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,880
there is no one alive left.

393
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,710
If only the white bones
could return to life,

394
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:49,790
wouldn't they cry blood for justice?

395
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:50,990
Bravo!

396
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:51,840
Well said!

397
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,040
Mr. Xu, clear your throat.

398
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,270
No more cursing.

399
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,310
No more cursing.

400
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:07,990
This is outrageous.

401
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:10,030
The Dafeng has stood for 600 years,

402
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:12,680
and never has there been
someone like you,

403
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,980
blocking the door,
cursing for four hours straight.

404
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:16,510
Eunuch, please don't talk with me.

405
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,200
I cannot bear

406
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:19,510
this nonsense.

407
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:23,550
You...

408
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:25,200
You...

409
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,750
Guards, arrest him!

410
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:29,840
- Wait!
- Don't!

411
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:30,710
Don't!

412
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:31,830
What?

413
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,710
Do you also want to arrest me?

414
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:37,710
Greetings, Prime Minister.

415
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:40,750
- Yang Youde.
- Yes.

416
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,270
Does His Majesty want to see me?

417
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:44,710
His Majesty said

418
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,120
only you may enter.

419
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:48,840
The rest, leave now.

420
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,200
Don't stay before the Palace gate.

421
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,510
We'll leave this to you, Mr. Wang.

422
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,400
We'll leave this to you, Mr. Wang.

423
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,750
This way, Prime Minister.

424
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:11,870
Let's go back.

425
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:17,420
(Self-disciplined and Pure)

426
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:21,960
Prime Minister,

427
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:23,360
please wait a moment.

428
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,360
Prime Minister, thank you for waiting.

429
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,200
Eunuch.

430
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,810
- His Majesty...
- Prime Minister.

431
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:01,750
His Majesty is deeply saddened

432
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:02,730
and in poor spirits,

433
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:03,910
so he won't meet with you.

434
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:05,230
Prime Minister,

435
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:07,640
His Majesty needs time to calm down.

436
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,030
As you know,

437
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,200
Duke Huai is his younger brother.

438
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:15,400
They'd had a deep bond
since childhood.

439
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,400
Now that Duke Huai
has unexpectedly passed,

440
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,960
His Majesty...

441
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:22,800
Eunuch,

442
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:26,510
I understand.

443
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:41,200
Prime Minister,

444
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,440
please help me clear

445
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,960
the officials at the door.

446
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,400
Your Majesty,

447
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:00,630
I will

448
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:03,680
take my leave.

449
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:27,870
Your Majesty,

450
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:30,230
the Prime Minister has returned.

451
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:39,160
Who is gathering

452
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,920
before the Palace gate?

453
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:42,510
Your Majesty,

454
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:45,090
everyone who should've come

455
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,160
has come.

456
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,200
These scoundrels.

457
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,960
They usually bite each other,

458
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,470
but it's all just an act.

459
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:02,030
How hateful!

460
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:04,070
How detestable!

461
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:06,880
They deserve to die.

462
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:07,910
Your Majesty,

463
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,920
your health comes first.

464
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,070
Did Wei Yuan show up?

465
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:17,360
Your Majesty,

466
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,440
I didn't see him.

467
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,030
Write down the names

468
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:26,160
of those who haven't come.

469
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:29,510
For the next few days,

470
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,440
do the same.

471
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,000
Yes.

472
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:42,870
Mr. Zheng,

473
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:45,230
are you really staying at the inn?

474
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:47,470
Ningyan, don't worry.

475
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:49,400
Duke Zhenbei's massacre has

476
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,360
put Mr. Zheng
at the center of attention.

477
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,790
Even His Majesty

478
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:55,160
wouldn't make a rash move now.

479
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,540
It'd provoke public outrage.

480
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:57,910
As we know,

481
00:27:58,070 --> 00:27:59,160
the great tide

482
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:00,270
cannot be resisted head-on.

483
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:02,160
Mr. Xu,

484
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,550
your cousin really has sharp insight.

485
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:05,840
He's absolutely right.

486
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:09,600
With such composure,

487
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:13,230
you'll certainly have a bright future.

488
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:18,640
He reminds me of the grandeur
of Lord Wei back in the day.

489
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:23,710
Don't worry.

490
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:26,550
A group of Guardians
is staying at the inn.

491
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:27,790
You understand.

492
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:33,070
Goodbye.

493
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,790
Mr. Zheng is a pitiful man.

494
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:47,540
He's a Presented Scholar
in Yuanjing Year 19.

495
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:49,160
I've heard the masters say

496
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:50,990
his father passed away early,

497
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:54,010
and his widowed mother
raised him with great hardship.

498
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,160
It wasn't easy for him
to enter the Directorate

499
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,360
and become a Presented Scholar.

500
00:28:57,710 --> 00:28:58,710
But his mother died

501
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:00,470
due to years of suffering

502
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,600
and poor health

503
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:05,840
before he could return in glory.

504
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:09,460
Later, because of his compassion
for the people

505
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,070
and the desire to seek justice,

506
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:12,990
he volunteered to serve in Chuzhou.

507
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:14,840
He spent

508
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,310
20 years there.

509
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:18,470
Almost half his life.

510
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,990
But in one night,

511
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,600
it all turned to dust.

512
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:26,640
20 years of hardship

513
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:28,200
and half a lifetime of ambition

514
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,710
has become a tale for the bones.

515
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,740
Let's not talk about that.

516
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,230
How are things

517
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,710
going with Miss Wang?

518
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:44,330
Ningyan, behave yourself.

519
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,360
It's inappropriate.

520
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,030
Under these circumstances,

521
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:48,260
I don't want to talk about it.

522
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:50,030
Come on, let's talk.

523
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:50,990
I miss you.

524
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:52,070
How long has it been?

525
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:53,120
I don't miss you.

526
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:54,510
Did you hold hands?

527
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,500
- Did you hug?
- I won't tell you.

528
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,960
Did you upset your mother
while I was away?

529
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,920
I've never upset her.

530
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:05,120
You're the one who upsets her.

531
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,600
You little brat!

532
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,410
Why didn't you let me know
when you returned?

533
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:11,120
I was so busy.

534
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,220
There are barely any dishes.

535
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:13,510
It's so hot.

536
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:14,750
Ningyan, you're back!

537
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:16,310
- Hurry. I'm hungry.
- Sis.

538
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:19,030
Lingyue, come here.

539
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:20,990
There are a few dishes left.
I'll go grab them.

540
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:22,070
Sis, don't bother.

541
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:25,310
Ningyan,

542
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:27,640
why does it feel like you've changed

543
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,440
- since you returned?
- Let's eat.

544
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,550
What's changed?

545
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:33,600
The coordination of your limbs

546
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:36,200
and how you exert force have improved.

547
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:38,360
Did someone give you pointers?

548
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,030
Honey, stop talking.

549
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:42,160
Let Ningyan eat in peace.

550
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,030
Okay, okay.

551
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,480
Aunt,

552
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:48,270
while I was away,

553
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:49,640
Uncle must've treated you well.

554
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:52,510
This bracelet is dazzling.

555
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:54,880
How can you laugh, Xu Pingzhi?

556
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:56,470
Have you ever thought about that?

557
00:30:56,990 --> 00:30:58,270
Let's eat.

558
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:00,640
It wasn't from Uncle?

559
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:02,120
Oh no, Uncle.

560
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:03,880
Look, there's a rival.

561
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,470
You brat, stop making nonsense.

562
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,990
This was a gift from my future

563
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:14,160
niece-in-law.

564
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:16,550
Niece-in-law.

565
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:17,960
What? Wait.

566
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:19,200
Niece-in-law?

567
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:20,750
How come I didn't know?

568
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:22,880
It was from Lin'an.

569
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,750
Lin'an is the best.

570
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:27,440
She buys me different yogurts
every day.

571
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,750
It's so delicious!

572
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:32,600
Oh, it's Lin'an.

573
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,470
While you were away,

574
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:37,550
Princess Lin'an would send gifts to us
from time to time.

575
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:39,230
Princess Lin'an gave Father

576
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:41,600
the golden saber on him yesterday.

577
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:44,840
He loves it.

578
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:47,160
Last night, he was holding it
while sleeping.

579
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,840
He didn't even hold me.

580
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:54,470
Speaking of Princess Lin'an,
she'd send people every day

581
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:56,160
to ask when you'd return.

582
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,330
Why hasn't anyone come today?

583
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,200
Yes.

584
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:00,640
Lin'an must be hiding.

585
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:01,630
Come out.

586
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:02,930
She's not here, right?

587
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,360
Sir, your dish is ready.

588
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,200
Enjoy.

589
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,120
Plain noodles again.

590
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,070
Can't you give me something else?

591
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,990
I pay for your food and drinks.

592
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:27,400
How can you still complain?

593
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:37,200
It's not good.

594
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:45,680
Let me tell you.

595
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:48,880
If it weren't for Xu Qi'an
repeatedly telling me

596
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:51,310
to safely bring you back to the capital,

597
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:55,200
I'd throw you into the bandit's den
and let you fend for yourself.

598
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,710
Anyway, we're entering the city.

599
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:58,680
After that,

600
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,270
I'll make sure to repay you.

601
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:10,640
Your Highness,

602
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,070
His Majesty won't meet with you.

603
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,540
If Father won't meet with me,

604
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:15,440
I'll kneel here until dawn.

605
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:22,150
Lin'an.

606
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:29,990
The ground is cold.

607
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,400
Come back with me.

608
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,240
Be good.

609
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:34,310
Mother,

610
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,550
you've taught me since I was little

611
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,330
that a gentleman doesn't harm others

612
00:33:38,410 --> 00:33:39,230
or deceive himself.

613
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,680
Although I am not talented,

614
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:44,070
I always remember this.

615
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,790
Uncle's massacre has caused uproar

616
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,790
in the city today.

617
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:51,710
The officials tried to advise,

618
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:53,710
yet Father avoided them.

619
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:55,990
As his daughter,

620
00:33:56,990 --> 00:33:58,550
I cannot sit idly by.

621
00:33:58,550 --> 00:33:59,400
Shut up.

622
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:06,150
Lin'an,

623
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:08,470
go back to your Shaoyin Palace

624
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:11,120
or return to your residence outside.

625
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:12,400
Just don't ask about this

626
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,790
or intervene in this.

627
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:14,630
Be good.

628
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,400
Take the princess away.

629
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:19,870
Mother.

630
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:20,920
The princess...

631
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,720
The princess is concerned
about His Majesty's health,

632
00:34:23,990 --> 00:34:25,670
- so she knelt here to pray.
- Let's go.

633
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:27,220
Now, her knees hurt too much to stand.

634
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:27,830
Hurry.

635
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,320
Help her back to the Palace to rest.

636
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,960
Something serious happened in Chuzhou.

637
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,880
Today, the officials caused uproar.

638
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,720
Everyone's talking about it.

639
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,440
What happened?

640
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,590
What's so serious?

641
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,510
You're a woman.

642
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:50,110
Why are you asking so many questions?

643
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,670
The Dafeng actually has such a beast.

644
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:55,240
Let's go inside to play.

645
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:56,880
No wonder.

646
00:34:57,670 --> 00:34:59,990
No wonder you returned
to the capital so suddenly.

647
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,150
Mr. Zheng definitely won't allow

648
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:04,400
Duke Zhenbei to be buried as a duke.

649
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:05,590
Nor will he let him

650
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:07,550
be remembered

651
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:08,650
as the Dafeng's Protector.

652
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,200
Ningyan,

653
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:16,840
something seems off.

654
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:21,670
His Majesty's been cultivating
for years.

655
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:23,880
His emotions have become more stable,

656
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:26,590
but today, he lost
his temper and composure

657
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:27,630
in front of you all.

658
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:30,150
Is this really our Emperor?

659
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,440
- Your Majesty.
- I'll kill you now.

660
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:34,760
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

661
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:38,720
Indeed.

662
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,150
Don't forget.

663
00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:42,320
Que Yongxiu escaped,

664
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,190
and so did Duke Zhenbei's spies.

665
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:46,800
Could these people

666
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:49,630
have brought back
the news of Duke Zhenbei's fall?

667
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:52,320
While you were full of confidence,

668
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:54,030
His Majesty might've secretly planned

669
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:55,470
how to handle this.

670
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:57,720
Could the loss of composure

671
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,120
be just a way

672
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,720
of showing weakness?

673
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:03,960
If so,

674
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:07,360
the mission's plan
to catch him off guard

675
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:09,510
would have failed from the start.

676
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,070
Even if this is just my guess,

677
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,150
I still need to remind you

678
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:19,800
that His Majesty

679
00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:21,750
has played political games
for so many years.

680
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,190
If he gets serious,

681
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:25,920
there might be no one in the court
who can rival him.

682
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:34,590
Cijiu, how do you think

683
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,320
we should fight this battle?

684
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:39,070
Since I can think of it,

685
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:41,990
those big figures

686
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,670
should've noticed it as well.

687
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,080
Tomorrow,

688
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:47,800
I'll continue to shout
at the Palace gate

689
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,070
to test His Majesty's intentions.

690
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:51,440
If our guess is right,

691
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:52,840
within three days,

692
00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:53,920
he'll definitely move.

693
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:58,760
But for now, I'm in a lowly position,

694
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:00,240
unable to attend court.

695
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:02,990
Though I can help from the outside,

696
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,510
the real battlefield

697
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,320
should still be left to Lord Wei,

698
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:08,720
Mr. Zheng,

699
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,160
and those officials
who care for their name,

700
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,200
and perhaps,

701
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:14,760
still harbor some sense of justice.

702
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,360
I heard Duke Zhenbei
died in the North.

703
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:25,320
This is a godsend opportunity,

704
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,190
yet you lock me away underground.

705
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:30,360
It should have been me
avenging the people,

706
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,240
pursuing the culprit,

707
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,840
and killing the Mighty Bone.

708
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:35,030
The thought of this

709
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,160
has made my hair

710
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:39,140
stand on end.

711
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,320
Why?

712
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:43,840
Why was it that mysterious man?

713
00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:45,150
Why?

714
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,030
The Supervisor held me back!

715
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:54,670
However,

716
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:57,590
it wasn't Xu Ningyan

717
00:37:57,670 --> 00:37:59,360
who did those heroic acts after all.

718
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:02,030
I feel much better.

719
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:03,070
That kid

720
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:04,110
took my chance away.

721
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:04,960
How hateful.

722
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,760
He must've watched

723
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:09,920
that mysterious man
strategize in Chuzhou.

724
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,670
He must've been very envious.

725
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:18,510
Master, are you ashamed?

726
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,230
Aren't you supposed to use magic?

727
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,590
Activate the portal.

728
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:28,990
Deactivate.

729
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:30,470
Activate again.

730
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:31,640
It's too late.

731
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,670
Master, I feel incredibly lucky

732
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,240
to see you get upset.

733
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,470
My disciple is rude.

734
00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:46,960
Sorry, Your Highness.

735
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:48,800
The mission's arrival in the capital

736
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:49,920
has enraged Father.

737
00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:51,280
The current situation

738
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,090
will definitely lead
to bloodshed and chaos.

739
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:54,920
I don't know

740
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,190
how it will all end.

741
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,800
Everything is decided by fate.

742
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:01,360
Your Highness, do not worry.

743
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:02,720
However,

744
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,590
things are getting interesting.

745
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,070
The Duke Zhenbei is dead.

746
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:09,720
The world is about
to descend into chaos.

747
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:10,990
Some people

748
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:13,880
must be laughing even in their dreams.

749
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,190
Congrats, My Lord.

750
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:43,360
Your great achievement is near.

751
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:46,280
The time has not come yet.

752
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:53,550
At the end of Yin hour,

753
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:56,440
the sun will rise.

754
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:00,510
Reports say

755
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,340
there are assassins in the Palace.

756
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,360
Imperial Guards are ordered
to enter the Palace,

757
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:06,630
seal off the inner Palace,

758
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:07,990
and protect the Empress.

759
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:08,990
Yes.

760
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:11,720
(Dew)
His Majesty has ordered

761
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:14,320
to send these
to the officials' mansions

762
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:17,150
and carefully record

763
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:19,150
their reactions and words.

764
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,160
Yes.

765
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:21,390
As the saying goes,

766
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,400
positions bring responsibilities.

767
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:26,440
Mr. Xu is just a student
from Yunlu Academy.

768
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:28,390
How could he understand
His Majesty's thoughts?

769
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:29,400
This is absurd.

770
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:37,620
(South Gate)

771
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:48,300
(Calligraphy Studio)

772
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:52,220
(Charity Hall)

773
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:04,380
(Dafeng Capital Map)

774
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,960
What do the officials think

775
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:16,920
of Duke Zhenbei's massacre?

776
00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:18,470
Your Majesty,

777
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:21,320
except for the few at the Palace gates

778
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:24,240
and a few senior officials,

779
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,360
the others

780
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:26,960
have made their stances clear.

781
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,550
What about Zheng Xinghuai?

782
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:33,240
I've heard that he speaks openly
on the streets every day

783
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,110
and connects with many officials.

784
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:36,960
However,

785
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,360
only a few

786
00:41:38,470 --> 00:41:39,720
agreed to meet him.

787
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:50,840
On the court,

788
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:53,990
only Wei Yuan and Wang Zhenwen
seem to care.

789
00:41:55,070 --> 00:41:56,840
The others seem indifferent.

790
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:04,510
Summon the Cabinet

791
00:42:04,590 --> 00:42:05,840
to the court immediately

792
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:07,760
for Duke Huai's Bloodshed Case.

793
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:08,800
