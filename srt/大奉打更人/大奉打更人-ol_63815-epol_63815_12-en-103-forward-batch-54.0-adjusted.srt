I have bandits to kill
in the mountains tomorrow.

43

No, 3,

44
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,190
we've been here for so long.

45
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,640

46
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,960
your name?

47
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:51,800
I go

48
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,310

52
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,110
Did you draw this table?

53
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:05,270
Yes.

54
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:07,200
It looks creative.

55
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:10,800
Tell me about it.

56
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:13,320
As you can see,

57
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,990
the Realm Sect holds nine core members.

58
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:18,200
They're holders of the Jade Mirrors, too,

59
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,430
and sorted by their mirror numbers.

60
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:22,430
No. 1 is in the capital

61
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,360
with powerful figures behind, I believe.

62
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,710
He's likely to work for the court.

63
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:28,390
No. 6 seems

64
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,920
straightforward

65
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:31,080
and easygoing.

66
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:33,390
We can use him to our advantage.

67
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,710
As for No. 3,

68
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,040
he's charming,

69
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,870
fun to hang out with,

70
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:38,800
faithful,

71
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,830
and upright.

Identity: Copper Gong Guardian.

73
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:42,920
Yes, that's me.

74

As for No. 5, No. 7, No. 8,

75
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,670
we haven't talked.

76
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:52,920
It's hard to say.

77
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:55,080
No. 2, Li Miaozhen,

78
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:56,520
is in Yunzhou,

79
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,710
devoted to killing bandits.

80
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:59,670
People call her Winged Woman.

81
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:01,760
No. 4, Chu Yuanzhen, is

82
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,550
the Chief Disciple of the Treasure Sect.

83
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,640
Those two have been hostile

84
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,320
to each other for a long time.

85
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:12,320
He's also

86
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,390
the Saint of Men.

87
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,520
Do you know him, Lord Wei?

88
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:20,640
Li Miaozhen must be the Saintess of Heaven.

89
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,320
Heaven and Men

90
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:23,870
have never ceased fighting.

91
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,640
Those two will battle someday.

92
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:32,390
Have you found out why Jinlian

93
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,320
founded the Realm Sect?

94
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:37,550
He said after the Head

95
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:39,920
of Earth was demonized,

96
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:42,080
he founded the Realm Sect.

97
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,040
He gave the Jade Mirrors

98
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,390
to the best talents all over the world

99
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,800
and supported them

100
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,270
to gain their help

101
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:51,390
when he cleaned house.

102
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:55,080
The Earth Sect is traceless.

103
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:57,920
The Guardians still don't know everything

104
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,240
about the Sect Head's demonetization.

105
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:03,360
He knew you were a Guardian

106
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,640
but didn't hide anything.

107
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,320
Do you know why?

108
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,080
Are you saying

109
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,790
he meant to form an alliance

110
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:17,320
with you secretly through me?

111
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,280
You'll

112
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23,350
be the Guardians' spy in the Realm Sect

113
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,150
to watch the Earth Sect's every move.

Li Yuchun'll help you select a manual
from the Sutra Library.

121
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:45,680
Do you use a saber or a sword?

122
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:46,800
Both are fine.

123
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:48,230

129
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,910
unlike other cultivators,

130
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,830
barely have any super power.

131
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,150
They rely on strength.

132
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,160
That's why

133
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:09,080
the simplest is the best.

134
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:13,760
When you reach even higher stages,

135
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,350
you'll know better.

00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:57,960
One Chop?

191
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:05,390
"Nothing in the world can survive this chop.

192
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,440
If there is,

193
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:08,000
my advice is

194
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:09,880
run."

195
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,760
Fighters

196
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,320
must not panic in battle.

197
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:16,230
We can't run away!

198
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,270
"Chop once

199
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,910
with a clear conscience.

200
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:24,120
It can reshape the universe."

201
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,920
Can one really reshape the universe?

202
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,320
Impossible.

203
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,320
Even Duke Zhenbei

204
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,280
cannot reshape the universe.

205
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,040
This manual is

206
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,080
(One Chop to Kill All)
a game of bluff.

207
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,680
It's worthless.

208
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,400
It doesn't suit you.

209
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,750
Choose something else.

210
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,750
But I think

211
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:49,280
it's perfect.

212
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,440
Do you have a weapon?

213
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,000
No.

214
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,560
But I might get one in the future.

215
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,160
I can keep this manual for now.

216
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:59,440
This is your only chance.

217
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:02,510
Think twice.

218
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,800
No need.

219
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:05,070
I'll take it.

220
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,060
(One Chop to Kill All)

221
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,320
One Chop to Kill All?

222
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:11,710
Yes.

223
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,680
I told him

224
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,440
it'd require a weapon.

225
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:16,350
Don't waste such a good chance.

226
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:18,350
But Copper Gong Xu took it anyway.

227
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,110
I see.

228
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:22,110
You may leave.

229
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:26,430
What's wrong?

230
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:27,470
Anything else?

231
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,280
Hearing that he had to pay 300 liang for it,

232
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,590
he said he didn't bring that much,

233
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:33,510
and he'd pay later.

234
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:34,710
But given his tone,

235
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:36,040
I don't think he will.

236
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:38,470
Deduct it from his salary.

237
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,000
Yes.

238
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:46,110
The Bureau.

239
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,000
Master,

240
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,590
Lord Wei is wise.

241
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:50,990
After all that we've done,

242
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:52,710
he must be alerted.

243
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:54,590
It's fine.

244
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,160
Anyway,

245
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,080
he'd find out sooner or later.

246
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,400
You found out, huh?

247
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:04,590
It was your order, wasn't it?

248
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:05,750
I knew

249
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:08,160
the manual came too easily.

250
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:11,470
When I visited the Bureau earlier,

251
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,230
I told Supervisor

252
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,040
to look after you covertly.

253
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,830
Although you've found out,

254
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,680
do keep a low profile.

255
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:21,510
Do not tell others

256
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,590
about today's incident.

257
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:26,440
You aren't their member.

258
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,750
Such special treatment might ruin

259
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,320
Supervisor's name.

260
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,470
Today's incident?

261
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,590
What happened today?

262
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,640
I...

263
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,440
lost my memory.

264
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,710
I don't remember

265
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,120
what happened.

266
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,320
Clever!

267
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,080
You deserve a drink

268
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:00,080
(Liquor)
for your cleverness.

269
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:01,310
Sit.

270
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:06,710
Sit with us, Gang.

271
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:07,550
Thanks.

272
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:09,780
(Liquor)

273
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:13,110
Princess Huaiqing, benevolent

274
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:15,280
and kind masters like you are rare.

275
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:16,510
I'm so fortunate

276
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:18,110
to be able to serve you.

277
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:19,230
Alright.

278
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:20,470
I'll make toasts.

279
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:22,200
A toast to you, Your Highness.

280
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,080
Thank you for cultivating me.

281
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,110
I'll drink up.

282
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:31,400
Next, I toast you, Gang.

283
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:34,200
You're above me in terms of seniority.

284
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,320
- Thanks.
- You're humble.

285
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,160
I'll drink up.

286
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:45,040
Do you mean

287
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:47,160
you chose me because I appreciated you

288
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:48,830
and treated you well?

289
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,830
Of course.

290
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,510
If someone

291
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:55,880
appreciates you more

292
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,040
and treats you better,

293
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,750
even if it's not Huaiqing,

294
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:00,190
will you

295
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,230
serve her?

296
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,400
Of course not.

297
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,750
I might not be highly educated,

298
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,230
but I'm grateful.

299
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:09,470
I'd never betray my master

300
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:11,040
for personal gain.

301
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:17,280
Don't be nervous.

302
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,590
I was joking.

303
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,590
What if I let you go?

304
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,160
You let me go?

305
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:23,470
Yes, that's right.

306
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,470
That way, you won't betray anyone.

307
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,400
Then will you serve

308
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,350
someone else?

309
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:32,670
I'll rephrase it.

310
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,590
In what condition

311
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,350
will you leave Huaiqing

312
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,680
for someone else?

313
00:13:58,710 --> 00:13:59,630
I get it.

314
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:03,280
You can't leave!

315
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:08,750
Now that you've found someone better,

316
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:10,440
no need to make me stay.

317
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:11,800
Don't worry.

318
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:15,400
I'll keep in mind all that you've done

319
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,750
for me these days.

320
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:17,920
I'll leave quietly.

321
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:19,470
Take care.

322
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,160
I...

323
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,560
I didn't mean that.

324
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:25,680
Xu Qi'an! What's wrong with you?

325
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,320
I said you got it all wrong.

326
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,470
So what did you mean?

327
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:37,350
That was a joke.

328
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,440
A joke?

329
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,510
Didn't you let me go

330
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,320
because you detest me,

331
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,040
and you meant to let me leave with dignity?

332
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:49,350
♪Breakups should♪

333
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,470
The liquor I had made me sing.

334
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,280
I swear

335
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:55,870
if I detest you,

336
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,200
I'll be struck by thunder

337
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,110
and condemned!

338
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:00,750
I, Xu Qi'an, swear

339
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,680
I'll serve Grand Princess wholeheartedly.

340
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,280
No matter where I am,

341
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,160
in weal or woe,

342
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,510
I will remain faithful

343
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:08,510
to Grand Princess forever!

344
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,160
Good.

345
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:15,880
Great.

346
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,400
If I ever

347
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,200
betray Princess Huaiqing

348
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,400
for others,

349
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,990
I, Xu Qi'an, will be killed by lightning...

350
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:24,990
Alright. Enough!

351
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:26,110
I heard you.

352
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,440
Get up.

353
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:32,040
Your Highness,

354
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:34,160
I've been greatly inspired

355
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,110
and written more poems.

356
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:36,990
I look forward to your comments.

357
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:37,830
Not today.

358
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:39,400
You're free to go.

359
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:41,400
We haven't finished the drink.

360
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:42,350
Get lost!

361
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:45,110
Yes. I'll take my leave then.

362
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:47,080
Huaiqing this, Huaiqing that.

363
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:48,960
He brings up her name all the time.

364
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:50,670
Princess,

365
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,080
we need another plan.

366
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,110
His admiration
for Grand Princess is like fire.

367
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:57,510
He won't yield to you.

368
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,960
Fire, you say?

369
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,630
Put it out!

370
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:07,740
Here you go.

371
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,700
- Do you know
- Next.

372
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,040
- how to build
- Whitening Cream.

373
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,470
- unbreakable trust between people?
- You'll be fair.

374
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:15,630
That's easy.

375
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,590
Go to the Imperial Office of Music and drink.

376
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:18,800
Your bond will be unbreakable.

377
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:20,080
That person is powerful.

378
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,220
We can't be drinking buddies.

379
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:23,040
Do whatever that person wants

380
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,400
to bond step by step.

381
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,400
I've been like a slave.

382
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,440
Is that not enough?

383
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:29,960
I'm still being tested constantly.

384
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,680
See, Zhu Guangxiao?

385
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:33,800
He's thinking

386
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,920
about his future even while eating.

387
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,040
We've

388
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,750
fallen far behind.

389
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:40,870
No wonder

390
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,870
he went to the Haoqi Tower.

391
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,940
(No Pain, No Gain, Minced Pork Rice)

392
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,160
- Sir.
- Thanks for coming.

393
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,000
Keep the change.

394
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:53,110
Thank you, sir.

395
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,870
You owed me two liang
in the last game.

396
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,470
So familiar!

397
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:05,160
What's familiar?

398
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:06,630
The silver in Ningyan's hand

399
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,080
looks like mine.

400
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:10,110
I've lost money over and over.

401
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:11,830
It's about two qian.

402
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,400
You think this is yours?

403
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,830
Is your name on it?

404
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:15,670
Let me check.

405
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,440
I said it looked familiar.

406
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,320
It is mine!

407
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:23,960
- Yes.
- Ningyan,

408
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,440
where did you find the silver?

409
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,160
What's going on?

410
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,680
It's a red alert

411
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,830
to track down or arrest someone.

412
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,440
Maybe our members found a suspect

413
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:42,560
who ran away.

414
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:44,110
The signal is right over there.

415
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:45,280
It's close to us.

416
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,800
What's going on?

417
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,870
Earl Pingyuan was killed.

418
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:53,230
Two of our men in that area were injured.

419
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,560
The killer escaped mysteriously.

420
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,830
His whereabouts are unknown.

421
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:57,960
Earl Pingyuan?

422
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:00,270
An earl was killed.

423
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:02,030
Move it!

424
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:02,880
Come on!

425
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,070
Let's go, guys.

426
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:10,020
(Fruit Shop)

427
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:15,680
Guys,

428
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,760
this is No. 6.

429
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:18,120
I'm in trouble in the capital.

430
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:19,230
Can anyone help me?

431
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,520
No. 6,

432
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,710
what's wrong?

433
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,510
I'm stuck in the Inner City

434
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:25,440
and hunted by the Guardians.

435
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,230
What?

436
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,790
The Guardians haven't found me,

437
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,400
but those of the Bureau

438
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,160
will arrive in less than two hours.

439
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,220
(Heng Yuan, No. 6)
Then I won't

440
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:38,480
(8th Rank of Tianyu)
get away.

441
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:40,370
(No. 4)
I'm too far away from you

442
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:41,670
to help out.

443
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,220
(No. 3, No. 5, No. 6)
No. 6,

444
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:44,400
can you find a way to get out

445
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,200
by force?

446
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:48,360
I can't. I'm far away from the gate.

447
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:51,360
The Guardians and Imperial Guards
are patrolling.

448
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:52,390
Even if I got out

449
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,550
of the Inner City,

450
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,120
I couldn't leave the Outer City.

451
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,470
Do you have energy-concealing weapons?

452
00:18:57,790 --> 00:18:58,630
No.

453
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:00,400
(No. 6)
I have one,

454
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,470
but I can't send it to you.

455
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,790
Don't worry.

456
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:05,510
If I can't survive,

457
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,680
I'll leave the Mirror at my spot.

458
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:09,440
You may follow the energy

459
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:10,790
to recover it tomorrow.

460
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:13,030
(No. 6)
Don't curse yourself, No. 6.

461
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:14,310
Ask No. 1.

462
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,240
He's in the capital.

463
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:17,070
No. 1,

464
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,160
can you help me?

465
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,940
(No. 1)

466
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:21,070
What did you do?

467
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,270
I killed Earl Pingyuan.

468
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:27,920
Sorry,

469
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:29,400
my hands are tied.

470
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:30,960
No. 1,

471
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,960
we fellows should help each other.

472
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,580
No. 6 must've killed him for a reason.

473
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:39,460
(No. 1)

474
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:40,800
No. 6,

475
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,120
you've helped me once.

476
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,470
I might return the favor

477
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,880
if you tell me

478
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,510
why you killed him.

479
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,920
(If No. 6 is a good man,)

480
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:52,400
(I'll help him)

481
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,470
(and establish credibility in this sect.)

482
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:56,470
(If he's bad,)

483
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,960
(I'll gain his trust,)

484
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,840
(get his exact location,)

485
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:02,440
(and tell the Guardians.)

486
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,710
(I'll be rewarded.)

487
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:05,200
(Either way, it benefits me.)

488
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:09,840
You may remain silent,

489
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,640
but think carefully.

490
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,230
Right now, only I can

491
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,360
help you out.

492
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,200
No. 6,

493
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:18,470
(No. 6)
he's agreed to give you a hand.

494
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,680
Tell us everything.

495
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,520
Yes.

496
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,990
Killing an earl is huge.

497
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:25,400
You should at least be honest to get help.

498
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:32,880
Last year,

499
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:35,470
my junior fellow went missing.

500
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:38,840
I believe he was abducted

501
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,310
and secretly sent out of the capital.

502
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:43,840
After a lot of digging and checking,

503
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,230
I found a group of human traffickers.

504
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:49,030
The one behind them was

505
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:51,680
Earl Pingyuan.

506
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:54,710
So you killed him for revenge?

507
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,550
I sneaked into his mansion to ask him

508
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,710
where my fellow was but got nothing,

509
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:00,160
so I killed him

510
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:01,400
for his sins.

511
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:04,920
(Some vigilante he is.)

512
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:07,200
(He could've reported that earl.)

513
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,470
(Killing him is so not wise.)

514
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,920
You broke the law, too.

515
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,960
Why not report him?

516
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:14,840
(See?)

517
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:16,990
(No. 1 seems more sensible.)

518
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,640
Report him?

519
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:20,200
Had that worked,

520
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,840
he would've been executed already.

521
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:23,510
Officials shield each other.

522
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:26,230
If they can't uphold justice,

523
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:28,160
I'll get it by force!

524
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:30,750
(No. 2 seems)

525
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,400
(more hotheaded than No. 6)

526
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,470
I did it for a reason.

527
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,040
Over the past year,

528
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:40,510
I've rescued tons of children.

529
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,160
Most of them

530
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,880
had handicaps

531
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:45,200
and little food to eat.

532
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,550
They suffered tremendously.

533
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,790
They groveled to beg for money.

534
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,270
If they got a few coins,

535
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,750
they'd have cold food to eat.

536
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:57,030
Otherwise,

537
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:00,990
they'd end up dead in the wild.

538
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,500
(1, 3, 4, 5, 6)
So,

539
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:04,120
where are those children now?

540
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:06,230
I brought them to a shelter,

541
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,600
the Anji House.

542
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,510
Later, I found out

543
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,710
all of them were abducted by that group

544
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:17,600
from all over the state.

545
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:20,120
(No. 1)
No. 6, is that true?

546
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,550
Absolutely.

547
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,030
Earl Pingyuan secretly supported traffickers

548
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:27,550
to sell people in the capital
to rake in money.

549
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:28,590
They

550
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31,310
sold abducted children and women

551
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:32,920
to brothels

552
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,680
and sweatshops.

553
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,750
They became thieves and even...

554
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,270
lost their limbs to satisfy

555
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:43,640
others' sick fetishes.

556
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,240
So,

557
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:50,030
(No. 6)
even if my junior fellow were fine,

558
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:52,550
I wouldn't let Earl Pingyuan go.

559
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,200
Only if he died

560
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,880
could that group be cracked

561
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:57,710
and more people

562
00:22:58,790 --> 00:22:59,960
be safe.

563
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:02,920
Yes! Great job!

564
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,680
That scum deserves death!

565
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,980
(No. 2)
Agreed.

566
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:07,070
No. 6 is

567
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:08,440
admirable for what he did.

568
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,480
No. 3,

569
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,600
if you can help No. 6 out,

570
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:12,640
I'll owe you one

571
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,800
and pay you back when we meet.

572
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:14,990
Count me in!

573
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:16,350
No. 3,

574
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:18,710
I hope you'll lend a hand.

575
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,880
(No. 1)
I understand what he did,

576
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:23,790
but killing an earl is a felony.

577
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,120
Rescuing him under the Guardians' noses

578
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:28,120
is almost impossible.

579
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,640
Whoever makes the move,

580
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,840
they'll get into trouble.

581
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,820
(No. 4)

582
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:34,300
(1, 3, 4, 5, 6)

583
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,780
(No. 3, No. 6)

584
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:37,820
(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)

585
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:40,100
(No. 3)

586
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:42,160
I never meant to

587
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:44,070
trouble all of you.

588
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:46,800
I will

589
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,550
take responsibility

590
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,680
for my actions.

591
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:53,220
(No. 6)

592
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:56,630
No. 6,

593
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:57,980
where are you now?

594
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:01,100
(No. 6)

595
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,310
You guys, go this way.

596
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,440
You two, that way!

597
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,300
You guys follow me!

598
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:16,710
Check every corner.

599
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:18,990
Leave no stone unturned!

600
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:19,960
Yes.

601
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,960
"A scholar's robe

602
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,640
carrying the great spirit

603
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,360
can conceal murderous energy."

604
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,600
No. 3 is

605
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:21,710
from the Yunlu Academy!

606
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:27,070
(Buddhist Staff?)

607
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,440
(He's from Tianyu.)

608
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:47,780
(Jiang Lyuzhong, Guardian, 4th Rank Fighter)

609
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:48,720
It's odd.

610
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,030
The crimson light is gone.

611
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:54,630
Song Tingfeng of the Breeze Hall.

612
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,160
Zhu Guangxiao of the Breeze Hall.

613
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:57,750
Greetings, Gold Gong Jiang.

614
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,790
Did you find any traces of the killer?

615
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:03,790
We searched the streets.

616
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:04,710
There's no sign of him.

617
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,880
I found nothing either.

618
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:08,550
Officers,

619
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,600
was the crimson light here?

620
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,160
Are you questioning us?

621
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:13,550
I wouldn't dare.

622
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:19,750
Did you search down there?

623
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:24,790
Uh... no.

624
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:25,760
No.

625
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,710
Are you people of the Breeze Hall

626
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:32,160
always so reckless?

627
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:43,310
Mr. Jiang,

628
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:44,380
we found this.

629
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:48,960
Chief.

630
00:26:58,550 --> 00:26:59,390
Looks like

631
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:01,030
some kind of weapon.

632
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,360
Why was it in the ditch?

633
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,840
Did the killer leave it there?

634
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:14,960
Report it to the high-ups.

635
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,040
Yes.

636
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:18,070
Hold on!

637
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,480
Mr. Xu.

638
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,310
It really is him.

639
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:24,630
Mr. Xu, you haven't

640
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,200
gone to the Bureau for a while.

641
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,680
Senior Song keeps bringing you up.

642
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,960
Yes, Mr. Xu.

643
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,920
Do come for tea when you're free.

644
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:33,470
We're eager to learn
more alchemy skills from you.

645
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:34,750
- Alchemy?
- Not today.

646
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:35,920
I'm on duty now.

647
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:37,840
Yes, sure.

648
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:43,200
Sir, that's my device.

649
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:44,960
It's yours?

650
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:47,160
Who are you? Which hall are you in?

651
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:48,960
He's one of us of the Breeze Hall.

652
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,160
He's Xu Qi'an.

653
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:56,680
Sir, Lord Wei gave that to me.

654
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:58,510
May I have it back?

655
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,920
Why was it in the ditch?

656
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,710
I had the runs just now.

657
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:07,960
Perhaps

658
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,990
when I relieved myself,

659
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:11,750
it slipped out.

660
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:20,550
If you don't believe me,

661
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,270
check with Lord Wei.

662
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,160
You're something else.

663
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,000
Yes.

664
00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:28,920
Ignore him.

665
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:30,630
Officers,

666
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:32,750
do you know that Guardian

667
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:33,920
in our office?

668
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,750
We know him,

669
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,160
but he might not know us.

670
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:40,630
How come?

671
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:42,360
You know Senior Song Qing, right?

672
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:43,640
Supervisor called him

673
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,880
a once-in-a-century genius in alchemy.

674
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:48,990
But Senior Song keeps saying this lately.

675
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:50,200
Do you know what it is?

676
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:52,030
"Xu Ningyan

677
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:54,310
is indeed my master."

678
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,680
Go to the Breeze Hall tomorrow

679
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:02,230
and bring him to our hall.

680
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:04,070
Yes.

681
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:06,640
Hey, Ningyan,

682
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,710
you were amazing.

683
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,990
You won for our hall.

684
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:11,200
Shut up.

685
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,470
They can still hear us.

686
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:13,790
So what?

687
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:14,990
We're with Ningyan.

688
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,120
What can a mere Gold Gong do to us?

689
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:18,360
Look at them just now.

690
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:20,920
"Alchemy!"

691
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,270
You're good.

692
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:23,920
I'm scared. I'm off.

693
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:28,030
- What's so funny?
- Chief.

694
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,070
Stop slacking off.

695
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:31,350
Go find the killer!

696
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:32,680
Yes, on it!

697
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,880
Stop laughing. Go!

698
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,960
No. 3,

699
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:51,310
why did you send me to a chicken coop?

700
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:01,220
(South Gate)

701
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:06,550
Go.

702
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:10,150
What's on the cart?

703
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,570
- Search it.
- Just some supplies.

704
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:13,730
We made them.

705
00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:15,450
They're fine.

706
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:21,060
(Zhang's Plain and Meat Buns)

707
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:22,160
We looked all night

708
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:23,310
but found nothing.

709
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,000
We caught two thieves, though.

710
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:26,640
Not bad.

711
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,990
We'll get at least five qian.

712
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,030
(How's No. 6 doing now?)

713
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,270
We'll go back to report it to Chief.

714
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:35,350
Ningyan,

715
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,230
will you join us?

716
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,750
I'm needed elsewhere. Go without me.

717
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:39,680
See you this afternoon.

718
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,000
That man...

719
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:45,120
(No. 6!)

720
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:47,110
What about him?

721
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:49,360
He's just a scholar, isn't he?

722
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,520
No.

723
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:51,790
He is not.

724
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:53,070
The robe he's wearing

725
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,310
is someone else's.

726
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:55,600
It doesn't fit at all.

727
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,400
He's walking

728
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:58,640
with weak steps

729
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:00,070
as if he's out of strength.

730
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:01,550
Besides,

731
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:04,270
he came from the Inner City.

732
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:06,550
Do you mean...?

733
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:13,800
That's right.

734
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:15,920
He must've gone to the...

735
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:22,960
Imperial Office of Music.

736
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:25,960
I want to go there, too.

737
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:28,120
Shall we go there tonight?

738
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:31,160
I'm exhausted!

739
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,020
I want to have fun.

740
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:33,440
Come on. Go back to rest.

741
00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:36,680
I won't be tired at all in front of girls.

742
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:40,460
(Breeze Hall)

743
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,440
Look at the time, guys.

744
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:02,830
Aren't you going to

745
00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:03,990
report it to Chief?

746
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,270
Already done.

747
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,750
Why not keep searching for the killer?

748
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:15,200
No rush. We haven't received the order.

749
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:20,160
How strange.

750
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:23,120
This is a high-profile case.

751
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,640
It's not strange at all.

752
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,600
Earl Pingyuan was a scum anyway.

753
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,400
Lord Wei must be glad

754
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,640
that pest is dead.

755
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:35,510
Is that what he's like?

756
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,470
Put that away if your peanuts are baked.

757
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:40,470
It's burning my behind.

758
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:44,840
We searched the area
around Earl Pingyuan's Mansion overnight.

759
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:48,200
There's no sign of the killer in the houses

760
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:50,070
or the inns in the Inner City.

761
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,470
Those in white of the Bureau

762
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:53,710
didn't sense the murderous energy either.

763
00:32:53,710 --> 00:32:54,880
I'm sorry.

764
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:55,800
Please

765
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:56,920
punish me, Lord Wei.

766
00:32:57,230 --> 00:32:58,840
Look at you, Mr. Jiang.

767
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:00,960
You let the killer get away

768
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,880
even with the Bureau's help.

769
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:05,880
Do you know those ill-willed court officials

770
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,790
are waiting to laugh at our office?

771
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:09,440
I'll send in more people to search

772
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,710
in a wider area.

773
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:11,600
I promise to

774
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,600
catch the killer

775
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:13,960
before tomorrow.

776
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:14,800
Relax.

777
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,440
You worked all night.

778
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,030
You must be tired.

779
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,270
Go back and rest.

780
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:25,110
Yes.

781
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,550
Lord Wei,

782
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:36,030
did you give anyone weapons lately?

783
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,270
What's your point?

784
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:43,120
I have something else to report to you.

785
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:50,720
Father,

786
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:52,070
the Ministry of Justice is

787
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:53,790
looking for the killer, too, in secret.

788
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,070
I think they want to beat us to it

789
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:58,270
and accuse the Guardians of inability.

790
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,440
If we couldn't find anything,

791
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,310
what could those losers do?

792
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:05,470
Lord Wei,

793
00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:06,710
Copper Gong Xu is here.

794
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:20,880
I have important things to report.

795
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,200
Speak.

796
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:26,110
Lord Wei,

797
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,070
it's sensitive.

798
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:29,470
Can we speak in private?

799
00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:31,310
What?

800
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,790
Are you, a mere Copper Gong,
asking us to leave?

801
00:34:37,990 --> 00:34:38,840
You may go.

802
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,030
Go.

803
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,440
Come up here.

804
00:34:54,470 --> 00:34:55,310
Yes.

805
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,630
Is it about the Realm Sect?

806
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,030
It's about Earl Pingyuan.

807
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,920
The one who killed him

808
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,880
is No. 6 of the Realm Sect.

809
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:15,840
The motive?

810
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:24,030
Letting a killer go

811
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,840
is as guilty as murder!

812
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,240
Are you insane?

813
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,400
I'm sorry.

814
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:32,360
I'm guilty beyond forgiveness.

815
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:33,880
I struggled overnight but couldn't

816
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,840
live with a guilty conscience.

817
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,190
I have to tell you the truth.

818
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,440
However you'll punish me,

819
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:39,630
I'll accept it.

820
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:51,840
Earlier today,

821
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,840
when I chatted with others,

822
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:55,590
I learned

823
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,760
that you were rebuked by His Majesty.

824
00:35:58,510 --> 00:36:00,470
Other court officials ganged up on you

825
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:01,720
to bring you down.

826
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,990
I owe you more than I can repay.

827
00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:06,030
- I...
- Enough.

828
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:08,400
You don't

829
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:09,720
owe me.

830
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,960
Get to the point.

831
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:20,510
Earl Pingyuan secretly supported traffickers

832
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,400
to sell people

833
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,590
to rake in money!

834
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,280
They sold children and women

835
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,720
to brothels and sweatshops.

836
00:36:28,990 --> 00:36:30,070
They became thieves

837
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:32,800
and even lost their limbs
to satisfy others' fetishes.

838
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,470
Hearing such inhumanity,

839
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,190
I'd rather kill those animals myself.

840
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:46,920
Get up.

841
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:52,510
Yes.

842
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,320
Xu Qi'an,

843
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:02,030
how well do you know

844
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,630
the Realm Sect?

845
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,440
How well do you know Jinlian

846
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:08,920
of the Earth Sect?

847
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,470
Investigation shows

848
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:18,920
the Earl did keep a group of traffickers.

849
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,110
But did No. 6

850
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,550
kill him for his junior fellow

851
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:25,840
without any hidden agenda?

852
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:28,510
Maybe

853
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:31,440
the Earl was involved in other things, too.

854
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:33,720
Maybe

855
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:37,990
those traffickers did something else

856
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,240
that led to their doom.

857
00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:43,510
Did you consider

858
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:46,030
all those possibilities?

859
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,360
(He's teaching me.)

860
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,190
(He's helping me grow.)

861
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:54,240
I was reckless.

862
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:55,510
Never mind.

863
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:56,550
You stay

864
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,760
out of this case.

865
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:01,150
I'll assign it to others.

866
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:03,550
Keep your cover in the Realm Sect.

867
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:05,110
Your priority

868
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:06,280
is to check out

869
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:08,920
the identity of everyone there.

870
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,600
And...

871
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,280
Stay safe.

872
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:26,670
I'll give it my all, sir.

873
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:32,100
(Peace)

874
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:33,240
That's absurd!

875
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,070
You're a Gold Gong.

876
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,990
That Cooper Gong overreached himself.

877
00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:38,670
Clearly, he has no respect for you.

878
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:45,320
I'm sowing discord. Say something.

879
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:54,030
You know how good he is

880
00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:56,590
and how much Lord Wei values him.

881
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:57,990
What do you expect me to say?

882
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:01,440
He doesn't respect you at all.

883
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:02,670
You know that, too, right?

884
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:06,070
That doesn't change the fact

885
00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:08,360
that he serves under me.

886
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:12,190
Wait and see, Yang Yan.

887
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:14,030
This isn't over.

888
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:17,390
Good day.

889
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:30,460
(Anji House)

890
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:34,870
Be careful.

891
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:37,760
Master Heng Yuan,

892
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,280
you're finally back.

893
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:41,990
Why are you dressed like this?

894
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:44,920
I had work to do.

895
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,720
We can't afford to buy more food.

896
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,280
I'll find a way

897
00:39:58,510 --> 00:39:59,720
to raise money.

898
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:05,990
No. 6.

899
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:06,950
No. 6!

900
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,360
Are you safe now?

901
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:12,380
(Anji House)

902
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:14,660
(No. 4)

903
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:15,510
How are you?

904
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:16,550
Are you safe?

905
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,110
(No. 6)
I heard nothing overnight

906
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:19,800
but wouldn't dare ask.

907
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:22,140
Thanks for your concern.

908
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,590
I'm safe for now.

909
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:26,370
(No. 6)
So

910
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,670
did No. 3 help you out?

911
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,240
Yes.

912
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:31,320
Thanks to him,

913
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:33,400
I made it out.

914
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,660
(No. 3)

915
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:38,190
Where is No. 3?

916
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,470
Is he in trouble?

917
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,590
He's blessed by the heavens.

918
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:43,070
I'm sure he's fine.

919
00:40:43,070 --> 00:40:44,660
(No. 3)

920
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:47,030
- No. 3!
- No. 6.

921
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,240
I heard the news.

922
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:50,550
(No. 6, No. 4, No. 2)
My office got anonymous tips.

923
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:51,760
They'll keep going after you.

924
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:52,630
Be prepared

925
00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:53,550
and stay alert.

926
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:55,800
Thanks for the heads-up.

927
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,320
No. 3 has helped No. 6 out

928
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:01,070
and infiltrated into the Guardians.

929
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:03,510
I knew he was capable.

930
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,630
No. 6, now that No. 3 is here,

931
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:07,840
can you tell us how you got out?

932
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,640
No. 3,

933
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,240
can I...

934
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:14,350
I say it?

935
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,320
Why not?

936
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,760
I have nothing to hide.

937
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:18,760
Go ahead.

938
00:41:18,990 --> 00:41:19,830
Sure.

939
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,240
Here's the thing.

940
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:22,720
No. 3

941
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:24,590
gave me a scholar's robe

942
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,110
to conceal my murderous energy.

943
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:27,990
Yes.

944
00:41:28,510 --> 00:41:30,800
But that wasn't enough.

945
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:34,470
Then I brought him to an inn that no one knew

946
00:41:34,470 --> 00:41:35,360
to hide.

947
00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:37,670
Even so,

948
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:39,610
(No. 1)
the Guardians were everywhere.

949
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:41,350
How did you hide from them?

950
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:43,190
He couldn't.

951
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:46,880
After a while, they found traces of him.

952
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,800
Thanks to my Plan B,

953
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,880
he made a narrow escape.

954
00:41:50,990 --> 00:41:51,880
What did you do?

955
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,960
I put on the robe I had got

956
00:41:55,070 --> 00:41:56,030
from No. 6

957
00:41:56,190 --> 00:41:57,360
and jumped out of the window,

958
00:41:57,470 --> 00:41:59,760
drawing the attention of the Guardians

959
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,070
and those of the Bureau to me.

960
00:42:01,470 --> 00:42:03,590
Then No. 6 spent the rest of the night

961
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:04,920
in the mirror safely.

962
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:06,420
(No. 6)

963
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,400
Am I right,

964
00:42:07,670 --> 00:42:08,840
No. 6?

965
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:14,590
Yes,

966
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:15,990
I guess.

967
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:21,670
(Looks like No. 6 isn't too dumb.)

968
00:42:22,030 --> 00:42:22,960
(He can be my friend.)

969
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:23,950
Nice!

970
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:26,240
Creating a distraction is smart.

971
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:27,260
(No. 1)
No. 3,

972
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,320
how did you avoid their search?

973
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:31,550
The truth is

974
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:35,070
I'm still in hot water.

975
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:36,630
They've searched all night,

976
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:39,190
and they're still chasing after me.

977
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:42,400
Do you have more energy-concealing weapons?

978
00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:44,470
Master only gave me one scholar's robe.

979
00:42:44,470 --> 00:42:45,880
No. 6 used it.

980
00:42:47,550 --> 00:42:50,670
I'll have to wait
until the murderous energy is gone.

981
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:53,030
If I get caught before that,

982
00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:54,190
I promise

983
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:55,960
I won't sell No. 6 out

984
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,470
or any of you here.

985
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:58,670
No. 3,

986
00:42:59,470 --> 00:43:00,590
to protect No. 6,

987
00:43:01,150 --> 00:43:03,360
- you'd rather...
- I'll die for my friends!

988
00:43:03,630 --> 00:43:05,110
What No. 6 said earlier

989
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:06,440
is touching

990
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:07,720
and enlightening.

991
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,720
A righteous hero like him

992
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:11,240
cannot be caught,

993
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:14,630
let alone be tortured by the Guardians!

994
00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:17,440
As No. 6's fellow,

995
00:43:17,630 --> 00:43:20,240
I shall protect him.

996
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:21,080
Worry not.

997
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:22,990
Even if I meet my doom,

998
00:43:23,190 --> 00:43:25,400
I'll die a worthy death!
