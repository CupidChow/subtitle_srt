I'm afraid I'll be a failure

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I stress less, and I discreetly drop myself

36
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
5 million

37
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,500

Die

39
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,800
With high lights.

40
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,560
Police are watching in the city.

41
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,040
that day.

42
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,680
With him not honoring us,

43
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,560
I woke up better.

44
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,520
The police!

45
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,120
patients,

46
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,960
Two unknown soldiers.

47
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,440
Close your eyes

48
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:32,400
There is one more

49
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,940
The wolf is just a small animal

50
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:42,740
Let's have fun

51
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,080
Quan Brahman

52
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,680
Van Greeting

53
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,840
Anç·Š

54
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,860
Let's have fun

55
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:55,300
Drink more.

56
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:02,980
What a coincidence.

57
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,700
What a coincidence.

58
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:08,780
Do you know each other?

59
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,100
Not only know each other.

60
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:12,660
This is my little brother.

61
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,140
Brother Li.

62
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:15,980
I'm Yang Meng.

63
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:18,820
We met in the Academy.

64
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:22,900
Yang.

65
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,220
Ling.

66
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:26,460
Ling Xiu.

67
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:29,540
These two unfilial children.

68
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:31,300
Didn't they say they had no time?

69
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:33,540
They just keep on saying old things.

70
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,380
They often say something wrong.

71
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,780
But Ning Yan never goes to Gou Lan.

72
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:42,780
Second Uncle said he was good at playing the role of Shen Shen last night.

73
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:45,660
I told Shen Shen when I came back.

74
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,580
See if I can beat Second Uncle.

75
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:50,180
Didn't you never go to Gou Lan?

76
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:52,620
You're shameless.

77
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:54,420
And Dad.

78
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:57,300
Why didn't you see my brother?

79
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:01,380
I mean, Brother Xu and Brother Li.

80
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,220
If you two want to come,

81
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:05,220
you can know each other for a while.

82
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,020
We can come together.

83
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:08,980
After all, we are friends.

84
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:11,380
We are close friends.

85
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:15,780
We should be together for a whole life.

86
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,420
Right?

87
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:21,300
Yes, absolutely.

88
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,620
Inappearance!

89
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:27,000
It is easy to be the world champion.

90
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:30,160
Way to go.

91
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,860
Wow.

92
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:33,760
She's so handsome!

93
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,360
eee

94
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,360
great.

95
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,780
Yes!

96
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,580
Thank you.

97
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,020
Good.

98
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:57,660
Level-5

99
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:19,400
Wonderful

100
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,480
Wonderful

101
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:26,060
No

102
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,640
No

103
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:43,700
Sorry

104
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:45,660
Sorry

105
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:55,900
For a while

106
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,260
Take hit

107
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,740
Get dead

108
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,740
Good!

109
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,740
Good!

110
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:17,740
Ren-chan!

111
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:18,740
Ren-chan!

112
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:19,740
It's amazing!

113
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,740
It's amazing!

114
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:28,740
Almost done.

115
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,740
Okay.

116
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:40,740
Lady,

117
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:42,740
go and ask questions.

118
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:43,740
Yes.

119
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:45,740
Miss Fu Xiang,

120
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:46,740
you've given out the top-level.

121
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:47,740
Please,

122
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,740
in the time of the one-day meeting,

123
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:50,740
give out the top-level questions.

124
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:52,740
Please start.

125
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:55,740
Songye, bamboo leaf, leaves, leaves, and crisp.

126
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:57,740
Wow, it's still a sticky face.

127
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:58,740
It's really amazing.

128
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:00,740
It's amazing.

129
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:04,740
Yang,

130
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:07,740
are you interested in coming first?

131
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:11,740
I didn't expect it to be a pair.

132
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:12,740
It's not my imagination.

133
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:13,740
Let me think about it again.

134
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:15,740
How about you?

135
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:16,740
Please, Mr. Li.

136
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:18,740
Then,

137
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:19,740
let's invite Mr. Xu first.

138
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:20,740
Yes, yes, yes.

139
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:21,740
Let's invite Mr. Xu first.

140
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:22,740
Why?

141
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:23,740
I'm not good at magic.

142
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:24,740
I have to be more gentle.

143
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:26,740
I'll be better later.

144
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:27,740
I'll be better later.

145
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:28,740
I'll be better later.

146
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:29,740
I'll be better later.

147
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:30,740
I'll be better later.

148
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:31,740
I'll be better later.

149
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:39,740
No,

150
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:40,740
think about it.

151
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:41,740
Think about it.

152
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:44,740
Your eyes are deep.

153
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:45,740
Your body is cold.

154
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:49,740
Just this.

155
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,740
Although you're a god,

156
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:53,740
you're still a princess.

157
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:58,740
My wife,

158
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,740
please come in and have tea.

159
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:01,740
Congratulations.

160
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:02,740
Congratulations.

161
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:03,740
Congratulations.

162
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:07,740
Everyone,

163
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:09,740
you're admitted.

164
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:14,740
Yunlu Academy.

165
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,740
He's so good at acting.

166
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:25,740
He's a good actor.

167
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:26,740
Think about it.

168
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:28,740
I told you.

169
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:30,740
My poems are from the ancient times.

170
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:31,740
They're not my poems.

171
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:32,740
Why can't I believe it?

172
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:34,740
And dad,

173
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,740
you don't even know the word.

174
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:37,740
Why do you pretend to be a genius?

175
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:38,740
Exactly.

176
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:40,740
Why are you so angry?

177
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:41,740
What's the matter?

178
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:42,740
You're talking about this?

179
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:43,740
People are getting bored.

180
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:50,740
This is really a loss.

181
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:52,740
The name is 17.

182
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,740
But the key is that

183
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:56,740
no news has been found.

184
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,740
This fragrance is a hundred flowers.

185
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:06,740
It's called the double-dead.

186
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:10,740
Zijing,

187
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:11,740
listen to me.

188
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:16,740
The book is very sweet.

189
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:17,740
The water is clear.

190
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:20,740
The fragrance is fragrant.

191
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:21,740
The moon is yellow.

192
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:23,740
Fragrant fragrance.

193
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:26,740
Guards.

194
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:27,740
Who sent this?

195
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:28,740
Who is this?

196
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:29,740
Who is this gentleman?

197
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:30,740
Where is he now?

198
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:32,740
Don't blame me, Mr. Zhao.

199
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:33,740
Miss Fragrant

200
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,740
has chosen someone else.

201
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:36,740
What?

202
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:37,740
Mr. Yang,

203
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:38,740
my wife is here.

204
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:41,740
Please come with me.

205
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:49,740
Why did he go?

206
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,740
He's not going to the palace.

207
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:52,740
Mr. Zhao.

208
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,740
I've seen Mr. Yang.

209
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:14,740
Mr. Yang, please have a seat.

210
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:24,740
You're a gentleman.

211
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,740
You're a talented person.

212
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,740
I'm sure you've been studying for years.

213
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:29,740
You can remember this.

214
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:31,740
That's not true.

215
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:33,740
It's all my previous wisdom.

216
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:35,740
I'm just a

217
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:38,740
master of the poetry.

218
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:40,740
No, no, no.

219
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:41,740
I can't get out.

220
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:44,740
No, no.

221
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:45,740
I'll go out and take a breath.

222
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:48,740
We spent money.

223
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:49,740
We spent money.

224
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:51,740
Dad.

225
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:52,740
By the way,

226
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,740
I have a question.

227
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:56,740
Miss Fragrant is a talented person.

228
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:57,740
Does anyone

229
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,740
have a teacher for you?

230
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:01,740
Miss Fragrant

231
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:02,740
can't be a teacher

232
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:04,740
when she's a teacher.

233
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:06,740
No.

234
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:07,740
I've heard that

235
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,740
Miss Fragrant has many followers.

236
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:11,740
She's not a famous person.

237
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:13,740
For example,

238
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,740
Mr. Zhang of the Ministry of Revenue,

239
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:16,740
Zhou Li,

240
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,740
you're very fond of her.

241
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:22,740
This person is so ridiculous.

242
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:23,740
He's so mean.

243
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:24,740
I don't like him.

244
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:27,740
Every time he comes to check on me,

245
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:29,740
he can give me gifts.

246
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:31,740
I can't stand him.

247
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:33,740
Mr. Zhang is a minister.

248
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:35,740
He's a man who protects the minister.

249
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:38,740
I can't hate him,

250
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,740
but I can't touch him.

251
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:43,740
How can you be so ridiculous?

252
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,740
The Xunhua Wendling

253
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,740
is the company of these rich men.

254
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:52,740
This is a secret.

255
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:54,740
It's a secret.

256
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:56,740
I'm just a person of my word.

257
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:57,740
I won't tell anyone.

258
00:11:58,740 --> 00:11:59,740
This is what

259
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:02,740
I want to say from Yuan Xiaojie last year.

260
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:05,740
Zhou Li is a crazy person.

261
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:07,740
She saw a woman

262
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,740
at the Yuan Xiaojie meeting.

263
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:11,740
She was so arrogant

264
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:13,740
that she went to the flight.

265
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:14,740
Who knows

266
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,740
that she met the son of Marquis Wei,

267
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,740
Zhang Yunying.

268
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:20,740
Zhang Yunying

269
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,740
also liked that woman.

270
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:24,740
The two of them

271
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,740
were jealous of her.

272
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:29,740
They were so bold.

273
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:30,740
The school in our school

274
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,740
doesn't have a big beard like this.

275
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:33,740
They won't do the boxing.

276
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:34,740
They're so weird.

277
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:36,740
I think I'm pretty good at it.

278
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:38,740
Yes, you're right.

279
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:39,740
No wonder the monthly salary

280
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:40,740
is so low.

281
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:42,740
They're all here.

282
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:44,740
I'm not here to

283
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:47,740
tell you about Zhou Shi Lang.

284
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:48,740
It's all excuses.

285
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,740
I'll believe you.

286
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:53,740
Erlang is good.

287
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,740
Who told me

288
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:56,740
that the country of Yan is

289
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:57,740
a country of

290
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:59,740
the country of the country.

291
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:01,740
The country has its own country.

292
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,740
We have to share the situation.

293
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:05,740
You're so mean.

294
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:08,740
Did you rent the house?

295
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:09,740
Yes.

296
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:10,740
Let's go home.

297
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:11,740
Wait.

298
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:12,740
I'll go home like this.

299
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:13,740
What if I don't?

300
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:17,740
You're still young.

301
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:18,740
Zhang Erlang.

302
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:20,740
I'll take three sets of armor.

303
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:21,740
Okay.

304
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:26,740
Remember to take the armor.

305
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:27,740
Okay.

306
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:39,740
You didn't send the female hospital

307
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:40,740
to Yunlu Academy?

308
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:41,740
We did.

309
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:42,740
Then why did you send it?

310
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:44,740
You're so naive.

311
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:45,740
You're so mean.

312
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:46,740
You're so mean.

313
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,740
What if she comes back?

314
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:51,740
Jiang is old indeed.

315
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:52,740
No wonder

316
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:53,740
she doesn't smell like

317
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:54,740
the greenery on her father's body.

318
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:55,740
Stop it.

319
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:56,740
Help me.

320
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:57,740
Okay.

321
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:58,740
It's almost done.

322
00:13:58,740 --> 00:13:59,740
Come on.

323
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:00,740
Take a seat.

324
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:06,740
The number of the fifth monkey

325
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:08,740
is Zhang Yun Yang.

326
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:09,740
Yes.

327
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:10,740
Zhang Yun Ying

328
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,740
is very cruel to Zhou Li.

329
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:13,740
And this kind of cruel brother

330
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,740
is easily used by us.

331
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:16,740
You think so much.

332
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:18,740
Keep an eye on him

333
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:20,740
and then find a chance to get off.

334
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:21,740
You're lying.

335
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:25,740
The number of the fifth monkey

336
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,740
should have some protection.

337
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:28,740
But not too much.

338
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:29,740
After all, it's not a flute.

339
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:32,740
We can make chaos

340
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:33,740
and then take the opportunity

341
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:35,740
to help them.

342
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:37,740
If we get off in the daytime,

343
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:38,740
how can we

344
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:40,740
take the people off in the middle of the road?

345
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:42,740
We may be very hungry.

346
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:44,740
If we get off at night,

347
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:46,740
how can we

348
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:48,740
break through the monkey house?

349
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:50,740
If I say that,

350
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:52,740
I can solve this problem.

351
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:02,740
Uncle.

352
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:03,740
Uncle.

353
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:04,740
Dad.

354
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:05,740
Uncle.

355
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:06,740
You can sleep here.

356
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:07,740
Wake up.

357
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,740
Uncle.

358
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:09,740
Are you okay?

359
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:14,740
Where are you?

360
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:15,740
Why are you here?

361
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:17,740
You asked me.

362
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:18,740
Who am I asking?

363
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:24,740
I was going to take a bath just now.

364
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:25,740
Didn't you say

365
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:26,740
you want to get me hot water?

366
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:28,740
Then?

367
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:38,740
Ying Ying.

368
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:39,740
You want me to get you hot water?

369
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:44,740
Uncle.

370
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:45,740
Go back to your room.

371
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:49,740
The mirror?

372
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:50,740
I don't know.

373
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:52,740
It's just a reflection.

374
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:54,740
Dad is a master of the machine.

375
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:55,740
He can be made here

376
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:56,740
without knowing the rules.

377
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:58,740
How did he do it?

378
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,740
You'll know tomorrow.

379
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:02,740
I'm not sure.

380
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:03,740
I'm not sure.

381
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:04,740
I'm not sure.

382
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:05,740
How did he do it?

383
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:06,740
You'll know tomorrow.

384
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:08,740
Ying Ying.

385
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:10,740
You didn't bring me here.

386
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:11,740
Don't bother.

387
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:12,740
It's cold outside.

388
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:13,740
Go back to take a rest.

389
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:17,740
I have some details to discuss with you.

390
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:18,740
I'll go to the room.

391
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:19,740
What details?

392
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:20,740
Can I participate?

393
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:22,740
I told you.

394
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:23,740
Don't bother.

395
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:24,740
By the way,

396
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:26,740
just tie Wei Wu's son up.

397
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:29,740
Wei Wu's son?

398
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:30,740
What are you doing?

399
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,740
Don't be so surprised.

400
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:33,740
Just tie him up.

401
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:35,740
Don't get angry.

402
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:41,740
Stop.

403
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:42,740
The rehearsal hasn't been finished.

404
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:43,740
It's full of blood.

405
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:45,740
He looks very sick.

406
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:47,740
It's him.

407
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:48,740
Yes, Master.

408
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:49,740
It's him.

409
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:50,740
Don't be so surprised.

410
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:51,740
Let go.

411
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:52,740
Let go of me.

412
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:53,740
Come here and forgive me.

413
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:54,740
What are you doing?

414
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:00,740
Get away.

415
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:08,740
All of you, carrying the chest!

416
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:25,740
For real? I don't dare won you over!

417
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:27,120
20

418
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:30,940
50

419
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:32,060
Don't escape!

420
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:58,100
Oh, son of Zifu.

421
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,900
I just saw he had a white affair

422
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:02,900
I'll move Bai Yu and cut his fingers later.

423
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:05,900
No.

424
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:17,900
The number of the Five-Demon Marquis

425
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:21,900
can still be counted as your dog's play.

426
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:23,900
They know who I am.

427
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,900
They even call me a coward.

428
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:28,900
Tell me, how do you deal with him?

429
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:34,900
He's good at torturing me in the yard.

430
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:38,900
He's good at drinking and taking a walk.

431
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:42,900
He's always on the roof and playing with the tree every day.

432
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,900
His father is a Five-Demon Marquis.

433
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,900
How dare you treat him like this?

434
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,900
Five-Demon Marquis, what's the matter?

435
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:53,900
Our father is a Fox-Demon Marquis.

436
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:54,900
What do you think?

437
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,900
Fox-Demon Marquis's son, Zhong Li?

438
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:58,900
Zhong Li?

439
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,900
Okay, I think he's coming.

440
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:05,900
Why don't we go and buy some wine to help him?

441
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:06,900
No.

442
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,900
He said he'd let us watch him.

443
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:13,900
We don't have much time. Let's go.

444
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:32,900
You're using this mirror to catch Zhang Yunying?

445
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,900
Not only Zhang Yunying,

446
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:39,900
but also the maid and the lady who took care of Zhong Li's house.

447
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,900
All four of them are in here.

448
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:42,900
In here?

449
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:45,900
Don't be so serious.

450
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,900
I'll wash you a little later.

451
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,900
I'll give you back.

452
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:50,900
Here.

453
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,900
Do you think he can't escape?

454
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,900
Why can't we lock him up?

455
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,900
It's too obvious if we don't lock him up.

456
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:07,900
A strong bodyguard will make a person's money.

457
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,900
I believe we can get him out.

458
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:10,900
We can get him out of here.

459
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:17,900
He really escaped.

460
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:18,900
Help!

461
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,900
Help!

462
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:21,900
I'm being held hostage.

463
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,900
I'm Zhong Li's son.

464
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:24,900
I'm being held hostage.

465
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,900
Yun'er, you're in trouble again.

466
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,900
Yun'er, Dad.

467
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:34,900
Yun'er, why is Zhong Li...

468
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:35,900
Zhong Li is helping me.

469
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:38,900
He's not only trying to torture me,

470
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,900
but also trying to save my life.

471
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:44,900
Why did you go there so long?

472
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:45,900
Any results?

473
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:46,900
Don't mention it.

474
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:48,900
I'm so tired.

475
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,900
I've been with Zhong Li for the whole day.

476
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:01,900
At first, he was taken to the capital.

477
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:05,900
I was just looking for someone to ask about the situation.

478
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,900
Someone from the Ministry of Justice is here.

479
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,900
I was thinking about the Ministry of Justice.

480
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,900
I followed him to the Ministry of Justice.

481
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:13,900
But who was thinking?

482
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,900
He was here for an hour.

483
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,900
And then he was from the Ministry of Justice.

484
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,900
He was taken to the Ministry of Justice.

485
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:23,900
But then he couldn't get out of here.

486
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:26,900
The people from the capital have been waiting inside.

487
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,900
The grandson was taken back to the capital.

488
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:30,900
I followed him to the capital.

489
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,900
Look at me.

490
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,900
What's going on?

491
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:37,900
How would I know?

492
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:38,900
I've been with him for a day.

493
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,900
How could I ask him to come here?

494
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,900
I've been with him for a day.

495
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,900
He's the son of the Ministry of Justice.

496
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,900
He's not that good.

497
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:47,900
Of course.

498
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:12,900
It's ugly.

499
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:13,900
It's so strange.

500
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:14,900
The noodles are so dry.

501
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:17,900
So the liquid is sucked down.

502
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:38,480
I'm going to let the number of the

503
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:41,900
people in the capital come.

504
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:44,900
They say that Zongrong and Qi Zi are the family of Zhang Yunying.

505
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,900
They want His Majesty to be a justice.

506
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,900
They want to be the general of the world.

507
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:52,900
What's the relationship between his family and the general of the world?

508
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:54,900
It's just an excuse.

509
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,900
How could you do that?

510
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,900
His Majesty sent a letter to the Ministry of Justice.

511
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:02,900
He ordered the Ministry of Justice to take care of this case.

512
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:06,900
Listen to me, old man.

513
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,900
Go, go, go.

514
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,900
Go, go, go.

515
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,900
What's the matter?

516
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:15,900
Mr. Zhou is still in the capital.

517
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,900
He's going to the capital.

518
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:19,900
He can't come today.

519
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,900
He's going to the capital.

520
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,900
He's going to the capital.

521
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:26,900
He's going to use his power to kill me.

522
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:30,900
We'll be in trouble if we do this.

523
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,900
Don't worry, Mr. Zhou.

524
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:34,900
His Majesty is in a state of emergency.

525
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:37,900
As long as you're with me,

526
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,900
we'll be fine.

527
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:42,900
But when the time comes, we'll be the chief.

528
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,900
When the time comes,

529
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:47,900
we'll be in no hurry to go to the Court of Justice and the Court of Justice.

530
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:50,900
Then we'll just have to find a scapegoat.

531
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,900
It's over.

532
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:54,900
I didn't do this.

533
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,900
I know him.

534
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,900
Yes, yes.

535
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:02,900
You're a scapegoat?

536
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,900
Yes.

537
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,900
I have a person.

538
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,900
Qi Yan.

539
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:15,900
Although I've been in a daze for days,

540
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:18,900
I've never been in a daze with him.

541
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:21,900
How can I be in a daze with you?

542
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:31,900
Mr. Song.

543
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:33,900
What are you doing?

544
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:36,900
I'm here to see you.

545
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:44,900
Let me show you my recent research.

546
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,900
You said that plants and animals can't be separated.

547
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:49,900
So I was thinking about it.

548
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:52,900
What about animals?

549
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:55,900
Look, this is just my theory.

550
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,900
I've already given up on time.

551
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:59,900
Please take a look.

552
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,900
Look.

553
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:08,900
If we combine the war history with military code,

554
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:10,900
we can solve the problem of our military code.

555
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:13,900
In fact, every war history is a horse.

556
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:16,900
We can use it to fight in the long run.

557
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:20,900
This will greatly improve our military code.

558
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:22,900
How is it?

559
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,900
Please have a look.

560
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,900
Come on.

561
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,900
Sit down.

562
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,900
Sit down.

563
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,900
Please.

564
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,900
How is it?

565
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:38,900
Is it very fierce?

566
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,900
Sixth round? No need.

567
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:44,900
Mr. Song, I'm here to ask you for help.

568
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,900
Go back.

569
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,900
Go back.

570
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:07,900
How is it?

571
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:10,900
Mr. Song, it's like this.

572
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:13,900
You know that I offended Mr. Zhou.

573
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:14,900
I know.

574
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:15,900
I've said it.

575
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:19,900
But it's a pity that we don't have any power in the four days.

576
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:24,900
Moreover, I'm not the only one who can handle the guard.

577
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:25,900
Don't worry.

578
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:28,900
I just want you to help me with the simplest thing.

579
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,900
Wang Qian.

580
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:36,900
It's impossible.

581
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,900
I'm just a good man.

582
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:41,900
I'll never do such a thing.

583
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,900
I've made up my mind.

584
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:49,900
Let's talk about your price theory.

585
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,900
It's my opinion.

586
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:56,900
These theories are impossible to succeed.

587
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:58,900
Why?

588
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:00,900
The teacher has said the same thing to you.

589
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:03,900
You still don't understand why the Lord of the Sword is denying it.

590
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:06,900
What is the real reason?

591
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:08,900
You know.

592
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,900
I haven't participated in the research.

593
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:14,900
But I can provide you with a theory.

594
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:18,900
Have you heard of the promotion of the quarantine?

595
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:21,900
The promotion of the quarantine.

596
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:24,900
The promotion of the promotion of the quarantine.

597
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:26,900
But the quarantine.

598
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:28,900
What's the relationship between you and me?

599
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:29,900
What's the relationship between you and me?

600
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:31,900
Mr. Song, you forgot.

601
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:37,900
The principle of the practice is waiting for exchange.

602
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:41,900
Let's talk.

603
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:50,900
Don't let them in.

604
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:51,900
Go.

605
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:52,900
Don't let them in.

606
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:53,900
Don't let them in!

607
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:55,900
What are you doing?

608
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:57,900
Didn't you say what's going on tomorrow?

609
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:58,900
The disciples of the Temple of Heaven and Earth

610
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:01,900
are ordered by His Majesty to come to the school to ask questions.

611
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:02,900
Let me go.

612
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:03,900
Let me go.

613
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:05,900
Zhou Li.

614
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:08,900
Did you teach Wei Wuhou and the illegitimate child Zhang Yunying?

615
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:09,900
Of course.

616
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,900
I'm the Lord of the Garden.

617
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:12,900
I'm the Lord of the Garden.

618
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,900
I'm the Lord of the Garden.

619
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:15,900
I'm the Lord of the Garden.

620
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,900
I'm the Lord of the Garden.

621
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:18,900
I'm not me.

622
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:19,900
I'm not me.

623
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:20,900
Let me go.

624
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:21,900
Let me go.

625
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,900
Yuan Jin, 36 years old.

626
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:25,900
The guardian of the temple is Zhou Xianping.

627
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:27,900
He was killed because of the greed of the country.

628
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:30,900
He was killed because of the greed of the country.

629
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:32,900
The son of Qi Zizhou Li.

630
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:35,900
He was kidnapped by Wei Wuhou's illegitimate child Zhang Yunying.

631
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:37,900
He was sentenced to death.

632
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:40,900
So,

633
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:43,900
you bought the tree of the Temple of Heaven and Earth?

634
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:45,900
It's so rough.

635
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:49,900
How can you buy the tree of the Temple of Heaven and Earth?

636
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:52,900
It's called the exchange of the lamp.

637
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:54,900
No.

638
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,900
Is our handæ®µ not righteous?

639
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:00,900
Cixiu.

640
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,900
You are a scholar indeed.

641
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:05,900
Don't you know

642
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,900
that Ruoxiao will be bullied?

643
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:10,900
Where are you going?

644
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:11,900
I'm just...

645
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:15,900
You will be bullied if you fall.

646
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:18,900
Xu Jiabei forced this to the ground.

647
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,900
We have no choice.

648
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:22,900
We are against him

649
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,900
for Zhou Li.

650
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:26,900
We are against him for the sake of skin and sweat.

651
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:28,900
But for the Sword of the Temple of Heaven,

652
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,900
he is the skin.

653
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:31,900
It's not me.

654
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:32,900
It's not me.

655
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:33,900
Let me go.

656
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:34,900
Let me go.

657
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:36,900
It's not me, my lord.

658
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:37,900
It's not Yuan Wang.

659
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:38,900
It's Yuan Wang.

660
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:39,900
You didn't get Yuan Wang.

661
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:40,900
You are just talking.

662
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:43,900
Do you still want to ask me

663
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:44,900
why the Wei Wuhou

664
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,900
and these court officials

665
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:47,900
can't tell

666
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:50,900
that this is not a wise lie?

667
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:54,900
I just thought about it.

668
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:56,900
For the enemy of Zhou Shi Lang,

669
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:58,900
whether Zhou Li was wronged

670
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:00,900
is not important.

671
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,900
They will only catch this enemy

672
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:03,900
and kill Zhou Shi Lang.

673
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:05,900
For Wei Wuhou,

674
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:07,900
this is a good opportunity to revenge.

675
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:09,900
Zhou Shi Lang didn't fight with him before.

676
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:10,900
He didn't help him.

677
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,900
Now, he is the master of the Sword of the Temple of Heaven.

678
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:14,900
So he was only

679
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:16,900
making a fuss at the store that day.

680
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,900
As for whether he was saved by Zhou Li,

681
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:20,900
he might suspect that

682
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:22,900
before there was enough evidence,

683
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:24,900
he should solve his enemy first.

684
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:26,900
That's the priority.

685
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:30,900
You are really good at it.

686
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:34,900
It's our lucky this time.

687
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:35,900
Next time,

688
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:39,900
it will be hard to win.

689
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:49,900
Don't be angry.

690
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:50,900
Look.

691
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:52,900
Now you are in the school of Clouds.

692
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:55,900
The front page is bright.

693
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:57,900
Plus your intelligence.

694
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:59,900
Maybe it won't take many years.

695
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,900
Let's just let the Marquis go.

696
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:03,900
No one will dare to bully our Xu family.

697
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:04,900
What about you?

698
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:05,900
What are you going to do?

699
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:08,900
I...

700
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:09,900
I...

701
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:10,900
I'll go first.

702
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:11,900
Where are you going?

703
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:13,900
I don't know.

704
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:15,900
But I can't stay in the Capital City anymore.

705
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:18,900
I've been in the Capital City for months.

706
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:19,900
I've been in the Capital City for two times.

707
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:21,900
You are the only one

708
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:23,900
who can take the future of our Xu family.

709
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:26,900
Zijiao,

710
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:28,900
what do you think of Nan Feng?

711
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,900
He is a little red-headed.

712
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:31,900
He is a little red-headed.

713
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:32,900
He is a little red-headed.

714
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:33,900
He is a little red-headed.

715
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:34,900
He is a little red-headed.

716
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:36,900
That's right.

717
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:37,900
It's settled.

718
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:41,900
At least wait for your father and mother to come back and leave.

719
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:43,900
I can't take Li Bin.

720
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:45,900
How about this?

721
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:49,900
You can tell me what you want to say in the two-leafed gold.

722
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:54,900
It's about the time.

723
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:56,900
When I arrive at a new place,

724
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:58,900
I will write a new one for you.

725
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:00,900
Brother,

726
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:02,900
goodbye.

727
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:07,900
When will you come back?

728
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:15,900
The second brother's wedding day is coming.

729
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:18,900
Brother, Yijing,

730
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:19,900
you are back.

731
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:21,900
I'm leaving.

732
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:23,900
Xu family won't be arrested, right?

733
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:27,900
Li Bin.

734
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:28,900
Li Bin,

735
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:29,900
let's talk in the dark.

736
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:31,900
Didn't you see my love?

737
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:32,900
What are you laughing at?

738
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:33,900
You are annoying.

739
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:42,900
Clean these bottles and bottles.

740
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:52,900
Brother Song,

741
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:53,900
thank you for the last time.

742
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:54,900
You're welcome.

743
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:56,900
What are you busy with?

744
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:59,900
Princess is coming to learn the gold.

745
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:00,900
She asked us to tell her.

746
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:02,900
Princess.

747
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,900
Princess is interested in the gold, too.

748
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:08,900
Princess is very talented.

749
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:11,900
She will come to our temple to learn the gold every time she sees you.

750
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:12,900
But this time,

751
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:13,900
she didn't know why she mentioned the two of you.

752
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:15,900
So she is a little busy now.

753
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:18,900
I won't bother you.

754
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:21,900
I'm here to say goodbye to Brother Song and Cai Wei.

755
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:23,900
Goodbye?

756
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:25,900
You want to leave the capital?

757
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:28,900
Yes.

758
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:30,900
You know that

759
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:32,900
many things have happened in my family recently.

760
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:34,900
I have some problems.

761
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:37,900
There are always things that are separated.

762
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:39,900
Goodbye, brother.

763
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:41,900
Brother Song,

764
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:42,900
thank you for taking care of me.

765
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:45,900
By the way,

766
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:46,900
I brought you something.

767
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,900
This is what I promised you before.

768
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:50,900
There are things you want.

769
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,900
The silver of the gold is a good guide.

770
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,900
Only a person like Brother Song

771
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:57,900
can raise this man's skin.

772
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:58,900
You are serious.

773
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:00,900
But don't worry.

774
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:02,900
I will read carefully.

775
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:04,900
I will never disappoint you.

776
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:05,900
Ten taels of silver.

777
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:11,900
I will give you a piece of silver.

778
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:13,900
Ten taels of silver.

779
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:18,900
You still take money?

780
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:20,900
Of course.

781
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:25,900
Dear family members and children,

782
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:29,900
welcome to the press conference of this four-year gold tree.

783
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:32,900
I want to ask Sister Cai Wei.

784
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:36,900
It must be painful to learn the four-year gold tree.

785
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:37,900
Yes.

786
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:39,900
For the sake of the school,

787
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:40,900
I often use the exchange rate.

788
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:43,900
I can use the hairpin to make a big hair.

789
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:45,900
I am fat and I can walk.

790
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:47,900
If I say that there is a book now

791
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:49,900
that can make you practice gold tree,

792
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:51,900
at least one more step.

793
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:52,900
You can do it.

794
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:55,900
This book is on the hand of Cai Wei.

795
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:58,900
How to improve the secret of fake silver chain.

796
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,900
How much is the market price of this book?

797
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:03,900
This book is quite difficult to buy.

798
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:05,900
So our market price is 25 taels.

799
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:06,900
What?

800
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:07,900
25 taels.

801
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:08,900
No.

802
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:09,900
25 taels is too expensive.

803
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:10,900
For our family and children,

804
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,900
it is a big burden.

805
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:13,900
I have to think of a way

806
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:14,900
to help my family.

807
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:16,900
I can sell the real estate

808
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:18,900
and save the middle-class business.

809
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:20,900
I will give the price to my family.

810
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:21,900
I will kill you.

811
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:25,900
If you don't want to see

812
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:27,900
the good share with me,

813
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:29,900
my brother will go to the foreign house.

814
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,900
Brotherhood is a foreign house.

815
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:40,900
Let's be happy together.

816
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:48,900
Knowledge is wealth.

817
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:02,900
Princess is here.

818
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:09,900
ì—¬ê¸°ì„œ.

819
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:11,900
Let's take a taxi.

820
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,900
I wonder why you couldn't come.

821
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:37,520
Why do you treat yourself this way?

822
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,200
Kou W Twitter,

823
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,880
I am your daughter but I can not do it.

824
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,680
Your Highness, please.

825
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:49,320
No, please leave, Princess.

826
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,420
I see

827
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:57,780
that he is the awareì§€ë§Œ å¥³,

828
00:36:57,780 --> 00:37:00,120
who is in charge of theKNOWN.

829
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,400
Just like the story

830
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,800
you actually show

831
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,580
His Majesty,

832
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:07,660
a grandeur and graceful nails ofÃ ng yha

833
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:11,080
It might as well be thegic idea that we brought along these beads and this edict.

834
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:13,460
I've suggested I just ask you

835
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:15,720
to come with me.

836
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:18,800
How did you know the Hitlerç´… be so bratish?

837
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,200
This is not the time for me to be gaining weight!

838
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:24,540
You will be better than the Hitler redhead.

839
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:27,740
So this is how you prepare yourself, alright?

840
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:32,680
Since I don't know you yet, I'll...

841
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:34,880
Stop completely.

842
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,360
I have a lot of business to do.

843
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,240
I will learn from you today.

844
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:39,520
Your Highness.

845
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,360
Take me to tell the teacher first.

846
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,120
No need.

847
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,720
Don't let the witness know.

848
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,720
I know this private room very well.

849
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,680
Let's go to the practice room.

850
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:53,640
Okay.

851
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,400
Go to the practice room.

852
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:58,760
Your Highness.

853
00:37:58,760 --> 00:37:59,920
Slow down.

854
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,600
Keep your voice down.

855
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,400
Slow down.

856
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,240
Here.

857
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,280
I see thecheck box.

858
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,320
Slowly get out of here.

859
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:25,560
The water still Legendary jam

860
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,000
ÙˆÙŽÙ†ÙŽØ§

861
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,280
See if my firewfire stack on the roof.

862
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,400
See if there is fire.

863
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:35,960
Guards to do.

864
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,200
I was just passing by the winter palace.

865
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,280
Someone ran into me.

866
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:44,560
She even bought a small pack.

867
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,240
Princess ì•™?

868
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,680
Your hand taste is quite aircraftful.

869
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:51,920
All right.

870
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:52,840
This campaign

871
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:53,840
will not be for a princess.

872
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:54,960
How will you practice?

873
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,040
How can I do it?

874
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,840
elder brother Song don't need to perform the execution.

875
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,680
I've already heard

876
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,400
ourå°ºsian sword

877
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,800
has practiced outside a lie.

878
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,800
Even Huaiqing is from the study.

879
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,800
Yes.

880
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:12,800
Even if you are as smart as Huaiqing,

881
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,800
you want to practice this,

882
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:14,800
it's not a matter of consciousness.

883
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:15,800
Besides, you...

884
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:22,800
Princess Ling An,

885
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:24,800
I didn't mean that.

886
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:26,800
I mean,

887
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,800
you are more smart and kind.

888
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,800
You do such a small experiment,

889
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:34,800
but you are just a little bit useless.

890
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:36,800
You are so cunning.

891
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:38,800
I just want to try it.

892
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,800
It's not as good as Huaiqing.

893
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:42,800
Is it a good idea?

894
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,800
Let's start.

895
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:51,800
First step,

896
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:52,800
melt the salt.

897
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:53,800
Add salt.

898
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,800
And then,

899
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,800
add the ginger and green onion.

900
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,800
What's next?

901
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,800
Brother Sao.

902
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:16,800
Come here.

903
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,800
I forgot what's next.

904
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:20,800
Well,

905
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,800
just put it on the stove.

906
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:24,800
And then,

907
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:25,800
take the temperature test,

908
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,800
and suck out the metal.

909
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:33,800
Next step, I know.

910
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:34,800
Melt the crystal.

911
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:36,800
Fortunately, I prepared the magic.

912
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:37,800
Magic?

913
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:39,800
The magic you have seen in the past.

914
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:41,800
I have never seen this.

915
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:42,800
Brother, don't panic.

916
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,800
I have a new feeling.

917
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:47,800
The gold-dead, the leather-painted,

918
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:48,800
the carbon-cured, the nourishing milk,

919
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:49,800
the beauty-gloomy,

920
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:50,800
the beauty-gloomy, right?

921
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:51,800
Wait!

922
00:40:58,800 --> 00:40:59,800
Brother Sao.

923
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:01,800
Are you okay?

924
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:08,800
Brother Sao.

925
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,800
The fake silver-cured is like this.

926
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,800
It's not as good as the silver-cured.

927
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,800
And the magic you have seen in the past.

928
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,800
I am the master of the four-point-channel.

929
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,800
How about this?

930
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,800
The next day, the machine is here.

931
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:25,800
Let's continue.

932
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,800
The fake silver-cured is like this.

933
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,800
The red-dead, the light.

934
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,800
The human.

935
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:37,800
The human.

936
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:40,800
It's done.

937
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:41,800
The metal is melted.

938
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:42,800
Yes.

939
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:43,800
Be careful to control the voltage.

940
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:44,800
What voltage?

941
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,800
It's just a small voltage.

942
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:47,800
Be careful.

943
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,800
Take care.

944
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:53,800
Let's go.

945
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,800
The night is not a waste of time.

946
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,800
I am not afraid of being beaten up.

947
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,800
Beat up?

948
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:16,800
Put your ears down.

949
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:17,800
Be serious.

950
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:21,800
You are Xu Xian.

951
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:25,800
You are talking.

952
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,800
Yes, I am Xu Xian.

953
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:29,800
That's right.

954
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:30,800
Let's go.

955
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:31,800
No.

956
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:32,800
You two.

957
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,800
I didn't make a mistake.

958
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:35,800
The night is not a waste of time.

959
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,800
I am not afraid of being beaten up.

960
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:39,800
Come on.

961
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:43,800
It's useless.

962
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,800
It's a victory.

963
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,800
I am not a god.

964
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:48,800
Xu Xian.

965
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:49,800
Little ghost.

966
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:51,800
Who is it?

967
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,800
I am your brother who sent you something.

968
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:55,800
A secret.

969
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:57,800
You know nothing.

970
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:58,800
I understand.

971
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,800
Please help me.

972
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:01,800

Be happy.

975
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:04,800
Be careful.

976
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:05,800
Be careful.

977
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:06,800
I will help you.

978
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:07,800

Be careful.

980
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:09,800
Be careful.

981
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:10,800
Be careful.

982
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:11,800
I will help you.

983
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:12,800
Be careful.

984
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:14,800
I am tired.

985
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,800
The whole village is running around.

986
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,800
Where is the guest you are talking about?

987
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,800
You two are the suspicious people

988
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:29,800
who are doing the new year food activity.

989
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:37,800
Where is the hotel?

990
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:39,800
I want to take my brothers to eat something.

991
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,800
All the big cities in our village

992
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:44,800
have new year's food.

993
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:45,800
It's much better.

994
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:46,800
Much better.

995
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:47,800
Hurry up.

996
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:48,800
It's really cheap.

997
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:49,800
You are here for class.

998
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:51,800
But you are too happy.

999
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:52,800
Since you are so open-minded,

1000
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,800
you should have a name for this business.

1001
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:55,800
I have thought about it.

1002
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:56,800
Beauty is far away.

1003
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:57,800
It's good to save money.

1004
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:58,800
This business is called

1005
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,800
Beauty is far away.

1006
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,800
Thank you for your help today.

1007
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:07,800
But I need your help.

1008
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:08,800
I need to pay the price.

1009
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:13,800
The new year's food is

1010
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:14,800
made by Beauty Group.

1011
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:15,800
It's much better.

1012
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:16,800
Much better.

1013
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:17,800
Go to Beauty Group to search for

1014
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:18,800
the great Feng's secret recipe.

1015
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,800
It's hard to make a new year's meal

1016
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:21,800
in advance.

1017
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:23,800
Use Beauty Group's magic

1018
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:24,800
to make it even better.

1019
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:37,800
