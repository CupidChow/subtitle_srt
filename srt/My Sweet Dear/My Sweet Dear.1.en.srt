1
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:19,769
Yes, I'm getting ready.

9
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:49,080
Chef Yoon.

10
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:51,360
- Have a taste.
- What is it?

11
00:02:57,439 --> 00:02:58,520
It's really good.

12
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,919
- I'm going into the storage room.
- Okay.

13
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,400
Ye Jun!

14
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,919
Excuse me.

15
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,879
What is it?

16
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:14,840
I think you should step outside.

17
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,319
- Excuse me?
- Yes?

18
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,360
Sir. Is there a problem with the food?

19
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,759
Open up.

20
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:47,960
Open up.

21
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,360
What do you think?

22
00:03:57,919 --> 00:03:59,719
I don't understand what you mean.

23
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,520
Right.

24
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:05,879
What do I mean?

25
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,039
But we shouldn't get too serious.

26
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,080
"We"?

27
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,639
Yes. "We".

28
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:02,240
The aprons at this place
are quite unique.

29
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,120
Oh, right.

30
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:10,560
I'll see you around.

31
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:34,040
(Laura's Dining)

32
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:43,199
Do you want to make money or not?

33
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:46,360
His fan service is terrible.

34
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,600
(I made reservations to try
the new dish at Laura's Dining.)

35
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,160
(It wasn't that good,
but the vibe was nice.)

36
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:53,319
Plus, how is this
Yoon Do Gun's restaurant,

37
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,120
when Laura Kim is sitting right here?

38
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,920
Welcome.

39
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,560
Have a seat.

40
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,120
Look at how tired you look.

41
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:11,360
You must've been busy today.

42
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,199
Do you have something to say?

43
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,240
Yes. Hold on.

44
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,319
These are the hottest restaurants
on social media.

45
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,279
Food is a part of fashion too now.

46
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:29,040
It'll be over
if we fall behind in the trends.

47
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,680
How long do you want to stay
in one place?

48
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,399
Ms. Kim. Like I mentioned last time, I--

49
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:36,680
I know.

50
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:38,959
I know how you feel.

51
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,759
I fell for your classic charms.

52
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,800
We got rated by Micheline
because of that too.

53
00:06:45,399 --> 00:06:46,439
But...

54
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:49,959
I have big dreams.

55
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:52,759
I plan on...

56
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,319
launching
this restaurant internationally.

57
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,079
I want it to be casual and mainstream.

58
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:03,879
I like the basics
as opposed to trendiness.

59
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,680
Basics.

60
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,879
If you keep acting so dry,
you'll lose all your charm.

61
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:19,519
Did you see the sales for the new dish?

62
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,319
That's our report card.

63
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,639
I would like you to study more
on your own.

64
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:29,680
Before I force you to do so.

65
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,560
Do you get what I mean?

66
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,399
(Hey, Chef Choi. Where are you?)

67
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:48,920
Why do you want to know where I am?

68
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,240
(The money that you borrowed
to open up your own place.)

69
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,079
(I know I asked for it back,)

70
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,000
(but I was surprised you paid it back
at once.)

71
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,560
(What happened? Did you hit the lotto?)

72
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:01,199
You know what the best thing about
paying back my debts is?

73
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:06,000
I don't need to answer when people ask
where I am.

74
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:09,279
I hope I never see you again.

75
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:23,040
I did hit the lotto.

76
00:08:57,399 --> 00:09:03,960
(Laura's Dining)

77
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:05,600
(Close)

78
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:13,039
(Close)

79
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:17,399
I'm sorry!

80
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:23,960
Gosh, who forgot to whisk this?

81
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:26,399
- How far along are you on that?
- Almost done.

82
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:28,330
- Keep up the good work.
- Yes, sir!

83
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,840
Oh, my gosh! You surprised me!

84
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,600
Sir, you can't come back here.

85
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:44,240
The hall is over there.

86
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:45,480
Are you the second in line?

87
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:47,330
Nice to meet you.

88
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:52,240
Excuse me, sir.

89
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:55,240
You can't come in here--
Hold on. You can't sit there either.

90
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,480
I'll take you back to the hall.

91
00:09:58,159 --> 00:09:59,519
Come with me.

92
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,330
Hey.

93
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:07,480
You're quite diligent.
I didn't expect you to come so early.

94
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,210
This is Chef Choi Jung Woo,
and he'll be joining us starting today.

95
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,559
Say hello.

96
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,279
Hold on. I think my brain is buffering.

97
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:19,360
Hold on.

98
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,960
Chef Yoon didn't say anything--

99
00:10:24,919 --> 00:10:28,759
No way. He's not a head chef
or something, right?

100
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:32,840
Not right now,

101
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,960
but you never know what will happen.

102
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:37,240
I hope we can get along.

103
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:40,799
We have customers coming in,
so let's talk more later.

104
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:47,480
Those customers always order
Chef Yoon's special.

105
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:50,600
We're in trouble.

106
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:54,090
Gosh. Why did they have to come
when he's not here? My head...

107
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:56,440
Why can't we serve the special?

108
00:10:56,679 --> 00:10:57,879
Don't we have the ingredients?

109
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,919
It's a dish that only Chef Yoon
knows how to make.

110
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,399
Take the order.

111
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:20,440
Those people know when it's not
Chef Yoon's recipe.

112
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:24,360
I guess we'll find out if that's true.

113
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,440
We'll be in trouble...

114
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,440
if Chef Yoon finds out.

115
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:32,200
"Chef Yoon".

116
00:11:32,679 --> 00:11:35,759
This kitchen is just filled with love,
isn't it?

117
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,279
I like it. I'll enjoy working here.

118
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,320
Okay. Shall we get started?

119
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,039
(Order)

120
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:50,919
Carrot.

121
00:11:58,399 --> 00:11:59,480
Onion.

122
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,559
- Hey, Jae Hoon.
(- Chef.)

123
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,639
(We're in trouble. It's an emergency!)

124
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,799
Why? What's wrong?
Can you explain it carefully?

125
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,159
(So someone ordered the special,)

126
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,480
(but some stranger--)

127
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:40,639
What are you saying?
You're not making any sense.

128
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:44,600
(In any case, come back to
the restaurant as soon as possible!)

129
00:12:55,799 --> 00:12:56,879
What is this?

130
00:12:57,879 --> 00:13:00,080
Who has cologne on?

131
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:06,600
As expected,

132
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,039
a star chef is sensitive.

133
00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:15,039
I'll see you around.

134
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:18,879
You're that guy who fixed my apron.

135
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,360
Can you call me Choi Jung Woo?

136
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,720
Nice to meet you again.
