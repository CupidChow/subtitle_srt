=My Sweet Dear=

4
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,559
Gosh, it's so spicy.

5
00:00:17,589 --> 00:00:18,559
(Episode 4)

6
00:00:18,589 --> 00:00:20,460
I feel like I'm going to die.

7
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:25,359
Why do they always make me
do things like this?

8
00:00:27,629 --> 00:00:29,699
Gosh, my eyes burn. It hurts.

9
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:34,109
- Can you taste this for me?
- Okay.

10
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,909
Gosh. It's amazing.
You have magical hands!

11
00:00:39,939 --> 00:00:41,210
It's really good.

12
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,750
- Stop overreacting.
- I'm not overreacting. It's true.

13
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:44,880
It's really good.

14
00:00:46,549 --> 00:00:49,549
Ye Jun. You need to work hard
to become a chef.

15
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:53,060
Chef, aren't you going to work on
your dish for the tasting?

16
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:55,659
You should work hard.

17
00:00:55,689 --> 00:00:57,729
This is really good.

18
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:00,500
- I like to take things easy.
- Easy?

19
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:02,700
Simple is best. Don't you know?

20
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,840
Okay. Peel a million, go.

21
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:09,540
Go!

22
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:14,250
Chef.

23
00:01:14,409 --> 00:01:17,719
I looked into Chef Choi's background.

24
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:20,950
You must have a lot of time
on your hands.

25
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:24,859
My gosh. Whose side are you on?

26
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:26,659
Who takes sides in the kitchen?

27
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:29,390
When Chef Choi...

28
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:31,859
worked in restaurants in Spain and Bali,

29
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:34,769
he copied the recipes made by
the other chefs...

30
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,170
and posted them on his social media
as his own.

31
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,239
Can you believe?

32
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:42,709
So you should be careful too.

33
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:47,409
He might end up copying
your recipe at the end.

34
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:55,349
(Food I had during the trip)

35
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:58,090
(Green grape, fresh, no sugar content)

36
00:01:58,290 --> 00:01:59,420
That's hot.

37
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:02,390
It tastes good though.

38
00:02:04,129 --> 00:02:06,629
I don't think those rumors are true.

39
00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:10,030
How would you know?

40
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,039
I just have a feeling.

41
00:02:14,939 --> 00:02:17,110
Plus, I'm not going to make a dish...

42
00:02:17,139 --> 00:02:20,909
that's easy for Choi Jung Woo
or anyone else to copy, so don't worry.

43
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:23,750
I knew it. Respect.

44
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:25,819
Stop talking nonsense...

45
00:02:25,849 --> 00:02:28,120
and check the ingredients that we need
and go buy them.

46
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:31,960
I'm going to check the storage to look
for the ingredients I need for my dish.

47
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:33,419
Okay.

48
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:35,259
- Goodbye, sir.
- Okay.

49
00:02:41,969 --> 00:02:43,069
This is good.

50
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:46,199
It's so good.

51
00:02:47,939 --> 00:02:50,210
How is it still so good?

52
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,810
(Laura's Dining, Enjoy Steak)

53
00:02:53,949 --> 00:02:55,050
What's wrong with this?

54
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,680
I should fix it later.

55
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:25,280
Don't close the door. Stop!

56
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,310
What? What's wrong?

57
00:03:29,349 --> 00:03:31,580
The door's broken.
It doesn't open from the inside.

58
00:03:32,449 --> 00:03:33,590
It doesn't open?

59
00:03:35,719 --> 00:03:36,719
What's wrong with this?

60
00:03:38,689 --> 00:03:41,430
- Why would you tell me that now?
- When did I have time to tell you?

61
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:43,860
We could ask someone to open it.

62
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,360
Wait.

63
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:48,069
I forgot my phone.

64
00:03:49,069 --> 00:03:51,870
Hey. Are we stuck in here then?

65
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,569
Gosh. What a thrill.

66
00:03:56,009 --> 00:03:57,340
What are you doing here?

67
00:04:01,009 --> 00:04:03,080
I heard you were choosing
ingredients for your dish,

68
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:04,650
so I came here to spy on you.

69
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,689
What? Did you hear everything?

70
00:04:08,189 --> 00:04:09,849
Do I have to say it again?

71
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,860
If you know your enemy and yourself,
you can win every battle.

72
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:22,170
Gosh, it's cold.

73
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:26,870
Are you okay?

74
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:29,870
I'm fine.

75
00:04:32,009 --> 00:04:33,649
You don't look fine.

76
00:04:47,389 --> 00:04:50,259
- Here, cover yourself with this.
- I'm fine.

77
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,360
Just use it. I'm fine.

78
00:04:59,139 --> 00:05:01,170
Did you overhear everything?

79
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,310
Yes.

80
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,110
Why didn't you say anything?

81
00:05:08,709 --> 00:05:10,480
That's why people spread those rumors.

82
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,319
Why do you think those are rumors?

83
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:20,490
You're arrogant,

84
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:23,290
but you don't seem like you'd do that.

85
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,740
Then why did you say
I didn't have any foundations?

86
00:05:35,509 --> 00:05:36,509
I'm sorry.

87
00:05:39,509 --> 00:05:43,149
I'm glad I lent you my apron.

88
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:46,250
How can you joke around
at a time like this?

89
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:00,899
You must really hate me.

90
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,029
Right?

91
00:06:08,009 --> 00:06:11,639
To be honest, I didn't start cooking
because I liked it.

92
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,750
Then?

93
00:06:16,149 --> 00:06:18,620
If you cook, you can always eat.

94
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,550
At the very least,

95
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:23,519
you won't end up starving.

96
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:30,800
Don't look at me with that look of pity.

97
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:36,529
Other people look at me like that too,
so I don't tell anyone.

98
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,009
Then you must be full now.

99
00:06:52,449 --> 00:06:54,589
- Let go.
- Come here.

100
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:04,930
How warm.

101
00:07:34,089 --> 00:07:35,829
(Choi Jung Woo, Thanks for today.)

102
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:44,300
(Are you feeling okay?)

103
00:08:07,629 --> 00:08:10,259
(Yoon Do Gun: Are you feeling okay?)

104
00:08:10,329 --> 00:08:13,699
(Laura Kim)

105
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,939
He read it.

106
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,819
What is this? Is he ignoring me?

107
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:34,289
(How are things with Chef Yoon?)

108
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:37,049
Is everything going well?

109
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:38,559
(Yes, I guess so.)

110
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:41,159
(Go and get some fresh air
with Chef Yoon.)

111
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:43,759
(You can learn how to find
good ingredients too.)

112
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,370
I have a question.

113
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:50,000
Why are you doing this to Yoon Do Gun?

114
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:53,539
Because Chef Yoon and I...

115
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:55,740
both have rights to the new dish.

116
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:58,039
We need someone to help us.

117
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,509
(Do I need to go on?)

118
00:09:13,889 --> 00:09:15,389
(Yoon Do Gun: Are you feeling okay?)

119
00:09:58,039 --> 00:09:59,240
Surprise!

120
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:01,070
What is this?

121
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:05,940
Yoon Do Gun. Why are you
so serious about ingredients?

122
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:08,509
You and I are so different.

123
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:11,080
Why are you here?

124
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:12,549
Why do you think?

125
00:10:13,649 --> 00:10:15,049
I'm here to spy on you again.

126
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:18,019
Are you my stalker or something?

127
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:22,159
Hey. Is this how you do it?

128
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:26,299
Hey!

129
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:29,070
It's a clam.

130
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:31,139
I caught a clam.

131
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:34,809
I caught a clam.

132
00:10:35,409 --> 00:10:37,539
- Forget it. Follow me.
- What are you doing?

133
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,610
Hey. I found another one.

134
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,889
Choi Jung Woo. Are you slacking off?

135
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:00,220
How many did you catch?

136
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:02,789
Show me.

137
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,200
Where did it go?

138
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,029
What is this?
You didn't get a single one?

139
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,769
It went somewhere.

140
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:13,940
Can you be more diligent?
I even caught a long-legged octopus.

141
00:12:16,539 --> 00:12:17,580
Are you serious?

142
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:20,309
You acted so tough,
but you're a complete coward!

143
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,809
Don't! Go away.

144
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:24,820
Touch it!

145
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:26,149
- Touch it!
- I don't want to!

146
00:13:36,889 --> 00:13:39,659
