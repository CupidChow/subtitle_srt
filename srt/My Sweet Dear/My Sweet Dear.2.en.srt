(Jang Eui Soo)

00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:06,799
(Lee Chan Hyeong)

3
00:00:12,519 --> 00:00:14,880
=My Sweet Dear=

4
00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:18,640
What is this?

5
00:00:19,609 --> 00:00:21,879
Who has cologne on?

6
00:00:27,399 --> 00:00:28,519
As expected,

7
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:31,879
a star chef is sensitive.

8
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:36,960
I'll see you around.

9
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:40,560
You're that guy who fixed my apron.

10
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,280
Gosh, is that how you remember me?

11
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,640
What a terrible first impression.

12
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,679
Can you call me Choi Jung Woo?

13
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,600
Nice to meet you again.

14
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:53,240
What are you doing?

15
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:57,079
- What do you mean?
- What are you doing here?

16
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:01,560
As you can see...

17
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,799
Oh, right. The cologne...

18
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:09,280
Today's my first day here,
so I wanted to smell nice.

19
00:01:17,689 --> 00:01:18,879
Who made this?

20
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:22,359
Oh, dear.

21
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:24,400
It was me again.

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,480
What do you think this dish is?
How dare you revise the recipe?

23
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:32,560
I know what the dish is
since I tried it that day.

24
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,599
What were you guys doing?

25
00:01:35,959 --> 00:01:37,560
Can anyone enter this kitchen?

26
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:40,959
Calm down. You're tensing up the vibe
of the kitchen.

27
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:44,159
They tried to stop me.
They did the best they could.

28
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,680
Don't worry.
We didn't get any complaints.

29
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,480
Get out.

30
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:52,959
I only came in an hour ago.

31
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,239
What should I do? Should I kick you out?

32
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,519
Do you know who I am?

33
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,560
I don't need to know who you are.
Get out of my kitchen right now.

34
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:18,240
We need to wait to find out
if this will stay as your kitchen...

35
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:20,159
or if it will become mine.

36
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,879
What?

37
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:27,810
Chef.

38
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:32,370
We have three orders of the special.

39
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,599
We have customers.
Let's take care of urgent matters first.

40
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:38,680
We can continue our fight later.

41
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:33,560
This is my take on the dish, chef.

42
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,000
This will make people want to post
photos of the dish.

43
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:04,800
I'm sorry about this, Chef Yoon.

44
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,120
I forgot to tell you.

45
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,120
I heard...

46
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,080
your first meeting was intense.

47
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,170
Don't embarrass me.

48
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,680
I'd like it if you got along.

49
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,199
What's the reason for this?

50
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:24,360
Our team gets along, and we've been--

51
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:25,920
That's what you think.

52
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,199
I don't agree.

53
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,959
I thought about what would be more
effective than making you study more,

54
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:37,399
and I realized that a top student
didn't need to study more.

55
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:39,240
Instead,

56
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,319
I thought it might get interesting
if I brought in another top student.

57
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,959
Isn't this fun?

58
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,480
A competition between the classic
Chef Yoon and the trendy Chef Choi.

59
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:53,480
And I plan on holding a tasting
for a new dish in a month.

60
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:55,610
A tasting for a new dish?

61
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,879
It's just that.
We're going to invite some VIPs...

62
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:02,610
to taste and evaluate your new dishes.

63
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,560
And after the evaluation?

64
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,050
We can't have...

65
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:11,730
two head chefs in one kitchen.

66
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:18,839
Oh, so in other words,
"One nail drives out the other"?

67
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,279
You're so mean.

68
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:24,439
Who knows?

69
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:26,680
The other nail...

70
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:29,319
might just make
the original nail stronger.

71
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,720
Don't you think so, Chef Yoon?

72
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,800
(Micheline 2019, Seoul)

73
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:54,720
Chef Yoon!

74
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:57,519
This is your favorite, flower tea.

75
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,199
It'll get rid of all your stress.

76
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:03,439
No way. Chef Yoon needs energy like me.

77
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,639
This is the right time.

78
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,160
- Flower tea.
- Energy.

79
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:09,519
- Flower tea.
- Energy.

80
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,279
Thank you.

81
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,639
Gosh, the weather's so nice.

82
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,120
It's really nice.

83
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:23,399
(Micheline 2019, Seoul)

84
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:26,759
It was so exciting when we got that.

85
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:29,079
That Laura Kim.

86
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:31,720
Doesn't she realize that
the Micheline star...

87
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,279
and her success are all thanks to him?

88
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:35,839
Of course she doesn't.
She doesn't know anything.

89
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:37,680
Be quiet.

90
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,160
It's true.

91
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,800
I thought it was strange from the start.

92
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,279
Right?

93
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,120
How was he able to make a dish...

94
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,519
that only our chef knows how to make
in one day?

95
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,040
- Does that even make sense?
- No way!

96
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:53,720
I bet Ms. Kim gave him the recipe.

97
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,399
- Evil woman.
- Evil woman.

98
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:02,839
This is my take on the dish.

99
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,439
When he was cooking,

100
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,000
he looked quite cool.

101
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:23,959
Can you stop it already?

102
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,319
- What?
- Have some tact!

103
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:34,199
Is becoming serious
all of a sudden your thing?

104
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,160
Can you let me join this kitchen
full of love?

105
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:44,759
So we can get along.

106
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:48,399
In a month,
either you will leave or I will,

107
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:50,439
so what's the point?

108
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:00,920
Is he always like that?

109
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:04,240
He's not like that usually,
but he's a bit irritable today.

110
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,160
I think he's usually like that.

111
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,920
Yes, did you look into him?

112
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,439
(You were right.
Choi Jung Woo is a nobody.)

113
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,959
(It seems like he lived abroad,)

114
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,560
(but he didn't attend any schools.)

115
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,800
(He's just one of those vagrants.)

116
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:26,639
(In any case, be careful. You know
how things are in this industry.)

117
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,920
(Those with nothing to lose
do everything they can...)

118
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:30,759
(to take from people
who have something.)

119
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:35,759
(Laura's Dining)

120
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:42,919
(Laura's Dining)

121
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,480
Sorry. I'm a bit late.

122
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,240
Please show up early.

123
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:50,799
Jae Hoon.

124
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:54,639
Here's a gift.

125
00:08:56,919 --> 00:08:58,960
Ye Jun. Work hard.

126
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,330
Thank you.

127
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:02,919
- Ki Jung.
- Thank you.

128
00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:08,720
Chef Yoon.

129
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,159
What is this? How pointless.

130
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:18,480
Let's use these aprons from now on.

131
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:24,639
Also, I feel uncomfortable
wearing the uniform,

132
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:26,330
so I want to dress casually.
Is that okay?

133
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,399
A chef just needs to cook well.

134
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,919
The look in your eyes today
is difficult to read.

135
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:40,720
Are you okay with it or not?

136
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:44,720
I'll just interpret it however I want.

137
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,600
Don't you like it?

138
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,799
- What's this?
- Yes, ma'am.

139
00:09:57,090 --> 00:09:59,960
Yes. We'll enjoy the meal, have fun,

140
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,919
and call it a day. Don't worry.

141
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,639
Okay. Thank you. Goodbye.

142
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:10,000
Okay. Does everyone have a drink?

143
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,210
Hold on.

144
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,279
- Okay.
- It's hot.

145
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:18,210
- Okay. Everyone raise your glass!
- The meat is ready.

146
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:20,639
- Okay, everyone. Cheers!
- Cheers!

147
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:22,759
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

148
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,330
People don't make toasts these days.

149
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,090
Right. It's tacky. Don't do it.

150
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,879
My gosh. This is driving me crazy.
Come to your senses.

151
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,559
I think it's burnt.

152
00:10:39,159 --> 00:10:41,039
Ki Jung. His glass is empty.
What are you doing?

153
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:42,450
Come to your senses!

154
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:46,600
You guys have fun.

155
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:49,039
I'm not in the mood.

156
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:51,960
Gosh, Chef Yoon! Team dinners...

157
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:54,879
exist for those who are in bad moods.

158
00:10:54,919 --> 00:10:56,039
Right?

159
00:10:56,759 --> 00:10:58,480
- Sit down.
- Don't get up.

160
00:10:58,519 --> 00:10:59,559
That's right!

161
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:02,440
I like it when things are a bit awkward.

162
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,279
- Right.
- I'll pay at the next place we go.

163
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:09,279
Oh, nice!

164
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,759
Nice! Have some more food.

165
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,080
Oh, right.

166
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:16,799
How did you make Chef Yoon's recipe?

167
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,759
Your sense of taste is like a memory.

168
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:24,320
You remember...

169
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:29,360
the people, atmosphere, and feelings
you got at that moment.

170
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,039
Then can you recreate anything
you've tasted once?

171
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,000
Yes, well...

172
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,159
I know kids like you.

173
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,679
What kind of kid am I?

174
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:55,759
Kids who have no foundations...

175
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:57,600
and do everything half-heartedly.

176
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,480
Gosh, it's the first time...

177
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,679
someone told me...

178
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,679
I had no foundations to my face.

179
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:08,720
It makes me kind of mad.

180
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:10,840
Am I wrong?

181
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:15,960
I don't want to fight with you
while we're all having dinner together.

182
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:20,919
That's enough. Stop fighting.

183
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,559
How about this?

184
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:26,159
Why doesn't our new member sing a song?

185
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,320
- Sing a song!
- Sing a song!

186
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,840

187
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:34,559
