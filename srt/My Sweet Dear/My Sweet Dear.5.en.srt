=My Sweet Dear=

4
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,159
Get over here.

5
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:30,900
We need to take a selfie
to remember this.

6
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:33,430
Hold on.

7
00:01:33,469 --> 00:01:35,129
Let's take another one.

8
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:45,709
Can you smile?

9
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,549
- Ta-da.
- Hey!

10
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:55,219
My gosh, that surprised me.

11
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:56,890
What a coward.

12
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:00,959
Hey. We worked hard, so let's play hard.

13
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:03,560
Play? This bucket isn't even half full.

14
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:04,859
Did you bring a bathing suit?

15
00:02:05,099 --> 00:02:06,260
A bathing suit?

16
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,030
- Let's go.
- My gosh.

17
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,680
Okay.

18
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,689
I've never seen anyone
bring things like this with them.

19
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,620
I'm a bit of a romantic.

20
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:35,860
It's been so long
since I've been to the beach.

21
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:48,969
Gosh, the weather's nice.

22
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:52,210
Aren't you taking off your shirt?

23
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:54,710
What? No, I'm fine.

24
00:02:55,409 --> 00:02:56,650
Okay, then.

25
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:58,180
Gosh.

26
00:03:37,789 --> 00:03:39,020
What are you doing?

27
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:41,430
What do you mean?

28
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:43,759
I'm laying down.

29
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:46,759
- You weren't sleeping?
- Did you think I was?

30
00:03:47,469 --> 00:03:49,300
I was watching you.

31
00:03:51,099 --> 00:03:53,270
Stop looking at my handsome face...

32
00:03:54,539 --> 00:03:55,840
and let's go into the water.

33
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:31,310
This is so nice!

34
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:51,660
Isn't this place nice?

35
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,339
How so?

36
00:04:58,139 --> 00:04:59,600
I wanted to open one here.

37
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:02,610
A restaurant.

38
00:05:04,939 --> 00:05:07,149
The restaurant I wanted to run...

39
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,980
was a restaurant that was by
a quiet beach...

40
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:11,680
where the chef made whatever he wanted.

41
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:14,790
You can do that now.

42
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:17,720
What's a star chef like you afraid of?

43
00:05:20,189 --> 00:05:21,589
The special menu.

44
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:24,560
That's why I'm still there.

45
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:30,870
Honestly, it could just be
my lame regret for being unable to...

46
00:05:31,069 --> 00:05:33,040
top that dish.

47
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:36,970
My goal as someone with
no fundamentals in cooking...

48
00:05:37,209 --> 00:05:39,509
was to become a star chef.

49
00:05:39,779 --> 00:05:43,850
Gosh, look at your face.
You really know how to hold a grudge.

50
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:46,019
I already told you I was sorry,

51
00:05:46,449 --> 00:05:47,620
but you brought it up again?

52
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:50,660
I'm going to tease you about this
for at least a year.

53
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:53,319
Do as you please.

54
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:11,740
What is this?

55
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:14,910
Did you have that much fun?

56
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:31,889
Yoon Do Gun.

57
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,500
Why aren't you here yet?

58
00:07:42,029 --> 00:07:43,100
The youngest?

59
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:47,000
Sorry. I was a bit late.

60
00:07:47,069 --> 00:07:48,139
What are you doing here?

61
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:50,740
Aren't I better than Jae Hoon?

62
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:54,050
I wanted to learn a thing or two
from Yoon Do Gun,

63
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:55,410
who's serious about ingredients.

64
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,649
Oh, right.

65
00:07:57,649 --> 00:07:59,149
I don't use cologne anymore.

66
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,689
What are you talking about?
That's something you have to do.

67
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:06,660
I'm not craving any sweets right now.

68
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:09,060
I'm craving
Yoon Do Gun's sweet compliment.

69
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,060
It's so hard to receive a compliment.

70
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:27,410
You have to see if they have any scars.

71
00:08:27,449 --> 00:08:28,550
Check for scars.

72
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:33,620
But today, none of them have scars,
and they all look fresh.

73
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:34,889
They're fresh.

74
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:37,389
Yes. Those guys too.

75
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:40,889
How pretty.

76
00:08:42,629 --> 00:08:45,059
- What is?
- Your eyes.

77
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,299
Sometimes they're moist,
and sometimes they're cold.

78
00:08:52,299 --> 00:08:53,399
What about now?

79
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:58,039
Right now... They're hungry.

80
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:04,679
I'm hungry. Are we going to eat?

81
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,779
Let's go.

82
00:09:15,059 --> 00:09:17,429
No way. You can't eat raw fish?

83
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:22,029
You're not qualified to be a chef then.

84
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,669
There are three things that I can't eat.

85
00:09:28,139 --> 00:09:30,610
This isn't number 1. It's number 2.

86
00:09:32,409 --> 00:09:35,149
They make this
with their own special recipe.

87
00:09:35,179 --> 00:09:38,149
Trust me and try it. It's really good.

88
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:52,559
I'm going to try it.

89
00:10:02,009 --> 00:10:04,110
What do you think? I'm right, aren't I?

90
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:08,750
This is good.

91
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:10,779
This is really good.

92
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,389
Thank goodness.
I was worried you might complain.

93
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:20,960
Why did it take so long
for me to try this?

94
00:10:22,259 --> 00:10:23,559
I'm going to get started now.

95
00:10:27,629 --> 00:10:29,870
What is this? Sea squirt?

96
00:10:34,309 --> 00:10:35,539
My gosh.

97
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:45,049
I'm so happy today.

98
00:10:57,529 --> 00:10:58,830
This is amazing.

99
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,700
(Ok Gyeom's Seafood)

100
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:12,009
- That hurt!
- My gosh.

101
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,210
- Can you be more careful?
- That hurt.

102
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:17,919
I know. Can you be more careful?

103
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,519
Hey.

104
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:23,289
You're worried about this corner,
not me. Right?

105
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,389
Of course.

106
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:26,559
"Of course"?

107
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:27,759
Okay. I'm sorry!

108
00:11:27,789 --> 00:11:30,730
- I'm sorry.
- Hey, I'm an expensive person.

109
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:39,070
That hurt.

110
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:46,240
Why? Does it taste funny?

111
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:02,490
It's good.

112
00:12:03,629 --> 00:12:05,129
What if you added some herbs?

113
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:06,860
In here?

114
00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:09,870
Yes. I think it would change the flavor.

115
00:12:14,669 --> 00:12:17,580
Gosh,
I'm craving Yoon Do Gun's compliments.

116
00:12:18,039 --> 00:12:21,009
Can you give me one with
that sweet look in your eyes?

117
00:12:21,809 --> 00:12:22,879
What's up with you guys?

118
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:24,220
What?

119
00:12:25,049 --> 00:12:26,149
Wait.

120
00:12:27,149 --> 00:12:28,820
I am very keen.

121
00:12:29,419 --> 00:12:31,919
What's with this romantic look
you guys both have in your eyes?

122
00:12:32,659 --> 00:12:34,389
What are you talking about?

123
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:40,700
If you guys get closer to each other
than me, I'm going to get jealous.

124
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:48,470
What are you doing tomorrow night?

125
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:50,110
Me?

126
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:52,409
Yes, you.

127
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:55,009
Why?

128
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:15,200
