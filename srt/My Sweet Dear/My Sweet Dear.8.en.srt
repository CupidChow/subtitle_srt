00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,420
There you go.

6
00:00:18,219 --> 00:00:19,859
Today's the day.

(Laura's Dining's New Menu Tasting)

8
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:30,870
Let's do well, Jung Woo.

9
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:38,710
You look good.

10
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,189
I'm reminded of the day we first met.

11
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:56,960
You were really rude that day.
You know that, right?

12
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:02,000
Are you ready?

13
00:01:06,769 --> 00:01:07,840
Yes.

14
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,280
The day of the new menu tasting
is finally here.

15
00:01:51,819 --> 00:01:53,049
I'm excited.

16
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,219
Okay.

00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:06,459
Please have a seat here.

20
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:09,969
This place really grows on you.

21
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,639
Welcome. Please have a seat here.

22
00:02:12,669 --> 00:02:15,439
- It's been a while.
- It's been a while.

23
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:18,340
Just enjoy yourselves.
This is just a formality.

24
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:21,379
- Just enjoy yourself.
- Okay.

25
00:02:21,409 --> 00:02:22,710
Who's coming?

26
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,639
The dishes are ready.

27
00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:02,419
Good job to the both of you.

28
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:06,389
Then can you please explain your dishes?

29
00:03:08,189 --> 00:03:10,189
- The theme of my dish...
- The theme of my dish...

30
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,500
- is memories.
- is love.

31
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:17,240
Chef Choi. Can you give us
a detailed explanation first?

32
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:23,939
The theme of my dish is love.

33
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:27,409
It's something I learned here
at Laura's Dining.

34
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,620
I created this dish while
referring to that emotion.

35
00:03:40,659 --> 00:03:42,629
(We were endlessly happy,)

36
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:44,800
(and at times, we fought.)

37
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:46,199
A mistake? What kind of mistake?

38
00:03:48,469 --> 00:03:51,340
(And we made up after.)

39
00:03:54,909 --> 00:03:59,180
I created a dish that recreated
the sweet and bitter taste of love...

40
00:04:00,009 --> 00:04:01,210
that everyone has experienced.

41
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:19,029
The theme of my dish is memories.

42
00:04:20,129 --> 00:04:23,370
I first started cooking as a chef...

43
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:25,240
here at Laura's Dining.

44
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:29,709
I still remember the day...

45
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,540
Laura and I opened this restaurant.

46
00:04:31,779 --> 00:04:33,209
I was really happy.

47
00:04:35,649 --> 00:04:37,319
This plate...

48
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:40,279
contains the time I have spent
at Laura's Dining.

49
00:04:40,949 --> 00:04:42,389
Someone once told me...

50
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,689
that flavors are memories.

51
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:46,889
Isn't that an incredible saying?

52
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,230
Open up.

53
00:04:52,129 --> 00:04:54,300
Don't worry.
We didn't get any complaints.

54
00:04:55,129 --> 00:04:56,699
(- Get out.
- That jelly.)

55
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:04,379
(But I wanted to give Laura's Dining...)

56
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:10,819
(a new memory.)

57
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,740
I like the basics
as opposed to trendiness.

(Very Satisfied)

63
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:25,459
I'll announce the winner of this match.

64
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:28,360
The winner is...

65
00:06:34,629 --> 00:06:36,100
Chef Choi Jung Woo.

66
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:45,079
(Head Chef Choi Jung Woo)

67
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:49,449
Congratulations. Good job.

68
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:27,649
Chef Yoon.

69
00:07:32,889 --> 00:07:36,430
If I think about it now,
there was a lot that I forgot about.

70
00:07:38,029 --> 00:07:40,029
When I tasted your dish,

71
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:42,629
I was reminded of when
we first opened this place.

72
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,699
The innocent...

73
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:49,170
and happy memories.

74
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:56,149
Oh, right.
I have to tell you this before I forget.

75
00:07:57,379 --> 00:07:58,819
Your dish...

76
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:03,120
was the best thing I've ever had.

77
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:08,829
I realized that
I made a lot of mistakes...

78
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:10,459
that led you to make this decision.

79
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:14,899
But I will continue being stubborn.

80
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:20,069
Plus, Laura's Dining
has a new head chef.

81
00:08:21,269 --> 00:08:22,639
I'd like it...

82
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:25,639
if you reconsidered, Chef Yoon.

83
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:31,519
Thank you for everything.

84
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,690
You're still the same as ever.

85
00:09:05,649 --> 00:09:07,450
Thank you for keeping your promise.

86
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:11,159
It's all thanks to
Head Chef Yoon Do Gun.

87
00:09:14,029 --> 00:09:17,029
Take good care of Laura's Dining for me.

(Laura's Dining,
Head Chef Choi Jung Woo)

89
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,470
Can't you stay for me?

90
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:30,679
I'm leaving for you.

91
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:35,409
Why are you being like this on
such a good day?

92
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:38,179
Because I'm so happy.

93
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,250
Because I'm so touched.

94
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:42,250
My goodness.

95
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:56,970
How did you...

96
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,669
Don't throw this out ever again.

97
00:10:00,539 --> 00:10:01,970
Keep it next to you all the time...

98
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:04,509
and think about me.

99
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:08,879
Okay.
I'll think about you every, single day.

100
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,820
Let's eat.

101
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:31,539
My face is going to wear out.

102
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,340
Let's be like this for a minute.

103
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,679
Let me recharge with Yoon Do Gun's eyes.

104
00:10:44,379 --> 00:10:45,549
Eat this.

105
00:10:48,019 --> 00:10:49,090
Cheers!

106
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:10,440
Check to see if there are any scars.

107
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:14,549
Auntie. This fish is fresh!

108
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:15,879
Can you give me one?

109
00:11:17,649 --> 00:11:18,980
And...

110
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:21,820
- Auntie!
- Hey.

111
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,389
The shrimps look really good today!

112
00:11:24,419 --> 00:11:25,820
- Come again!
- I will!

113
00:11:26,389 --> 00:11:29,690
Auntie, can I get a big conch?

114
00:11:30,259 --> 00:11:31,500
Can you give me one?

115
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:35,330
- This one is fresh!
- That's right.

116
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:37,700
This one. Give me one of these...

117
00:11:46,009 --> 00:11:47,710
(3 months later)

118
00:11:48,179 --> 00:11:50,850
Chef Choi. A little bit more. Smile.

119
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,289
Okay. I'm taking the photo now.
One, two three.

120
00:11:54,919 --> 00:11:55,889
Okay.

121
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:57,690
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

122
00:11:57,889 --> 00:11:59,559
You're so handsome!

123
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:00,590
I know.

124
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,429
- Enjoy your meal.
- Thank you.

125
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,929
The new dish is doing amazing!

126
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:10,629
I'm Choi Jung Woo.

127
00:12:10,669 --> 00:12:12,740
Goodness. Chef Choi Jung Woo!

128
00:12:13,269 --> 00:12:16,440
- Let's do well today!
- Let's do well!

129
00:12:17,539 --> 00:12:18,940
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

130
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,580
- I'll prepare it right away.
- Okay.

131
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,629
- Be careful.
- That hurt.

132
00:12:43,669 --> 00:12:47,269
Some dummy keeps going around
bumping into everything.

133
00:12:48,539 --> 00:12:50,639
I was planning on doing this.

134
00:12:50,669 --> 00:12:51,980
Don't look at me like that.

135
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:04,820
Hey, Do Gun.

136
00:14:17,929 --> 00:14:19,360
You became more handsome.

137
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:24,200
My look got completely ruined
because I ran here to see you.

138
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:26,169
How do I look handsome?

139
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,769
Your heart.
That's what I'm talking about.

140
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:33,840
I missed you.

141
00:14:36,679 --> 00:14:37,879
Every, single moment.

142
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:10,309
I'm reminded of last time.

143
00:15:24,659 --> 00:15:28,129
(Shwim)

144
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:30,629
This is it.

145
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:41,409
(Shwim)

146
00:15:48,389 --> 00:15:50,919
Gosh, this place is nice.

147
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:54,360
I'm not completely ready yet.
I'm still working out the kinks.

148
00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:57,460
But I decided to open today anyway.

149
00:15:59,029 --> 00:16:00,000
Open?

150
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:03,529
I wanted to invite you
as the first guest to my restaurant.

151
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,370
It's an honor.

152
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:11,210
Oh, my.

153
00:16:18,379 --> 00:16:19,980
This looks good here.

154
00:16:20,019 --> 00:16:22,149
Of course. You know who gave it to me.

155
00:16:37,899 --> 00:16:40,100
Then should
I taste how good this place is?

156
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:00,990
Your food is ready.

157
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:10,099
When did Yoon Do Gun's food
become so bright?

158
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:13,670
Ever since he met someone
named Choi Jung Woo.

159
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:19,039
Do you remember
the cold raw fish soup we had?

160
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,279
How can I forget such
an impressionable taste?

161
00:17:21,779 --> 00:17:24,079
I recreated it in my own style. Try it.

162
00:17:36,329 --> 00:17:37,460
It's amazing.

163
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:42,599
But I haven't decided
on a name for the dish.

164
00:17:51,509 --> 00:17:54,380
My Sweet Dear.

165
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:59,920
My Sweet Dear.

166
00:18:26,109 --> 00:18:32,250
=My Sweet Dear=

167
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:34,349
=My Sweet Dear=

00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:37,789
I'm so busy right now.
Is there a problem?

169
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:41,089
No. The customer wanted to see you.

170
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:42,990
Me?

171
00:18:52,539 --> 00:18:53,599
Sir.

172
00:18:54,769 --> 00:18:56,210
Is there a problem with the food?

173
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:06,920
The food has left
a strong impression on me.

174
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:09,220
Open up.

175
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,700
The aprons here are sexy.
