00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:06,809

=My Sweet Dear=

4
00:00:14,949 --> 00:00:16,789
That hurt.

5
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,460
Why? Does it taste funny?

6
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,280
It's good.

7
00:00:41,549 --> 00:00:43,049
What if you added some herbs?

8
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,390
What are you doing tomorrow night?

9
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:52,759
Why?

10
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:05,400
Did something good happen?
What's with this atmosphere?

11
00:01:06,469 --> 00:01:07,810
You know that cold raw fish soup?

12
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:11,540
It left such a strong impression on me,
and I couldn't stop thinking about it.

13
00:01:13,209 --> 00:01:14,549
Today, I want to...

14
00:01:15,549 --> 00:01:17,379
leave a strong impression on you.

15
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:22,519
In Plaza de Espana,

16
00:01:22,689 --> 00:01:24,590
there are these stairs.

17
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:28,560
If you walk into the small alley
at the foot of those stairs,

18
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:31,200
there's a small restaurant.

19
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,569
It's a dish I learned how to make
while I was working there.

20
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:38,439
Sonrisa de albondigas.

21
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,769
Son... What?

22
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:43,879
Sonrisa de albondigas.

23
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:45,510
Sonrisa...

24
00:01:48,109 --> 00:01:49,349
means smile.

25
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:40,900
Do you still...

26
00:02:42,569 --> 00:02:43,770
hate me?

27
00:02:48,539 --> 00:02:50,409
I never hated you.

28
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,909
I was just uncomfortable...

29
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,280
with having someone enter my kitchen.

30
00:02:59,419 --> 00:03:00,550
What about now?

31
00:03:02,189 --> 00:03:03,560
Are you still uncomfortable?

32
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:14,569
I like you.

33
00:03:22,169 --> 00:03:24,009
♪Hi, it's me♪

34
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,710
♪Are you doing well?♪

35
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:32,349
♪I missed you so much♪

36
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,889
I like you too.

37
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,150
Isn't it good?

38
00:04:07,189 --> 00:04:08,590
Your smile...

39
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,960
is beautiful.

40
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,829
It's not.

41
00:04:20,569 --> 00:04:22,769
Go Jae Hoon. Stop acting up.

42
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:25,170
I'll see you tomorrow.

43
00:04:26,769 --> 00:04:28,009
(Go Jae Hoon)

44
00:04:29,509 --> 00:04:30,610
Hey. I have to go.

45
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:02,439
(Coffee)

46
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:05,579
It smells nice.

47
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:08,009
You drink it first with your eyes...

48
00:05:08,209 --> 00:05:09,810
and then your nose.

49
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:15,850
Why did you call me in so early?

50
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,620
It's an important matter.

51
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,959
(Head Chef Contract)

52
00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:24,800
It's a gift. Do you like it?

53
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:34,170
Do you have to...

54
00:05:35,769 --> 00:05:37,180
fire Yoon Do Gun?

55
00:05:38,139 --> 00:05:40,949
You know exactly how much...

56
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:43,750
he cares for Laura's Dining.

57
00:05:43,779 --> 00:05:47,350
Did something happen between you guys
that I don't know about?

58
00:05:49,589 --> 00:05:50,689
Is that it?

59
00:06:03,769 --> 00:06:06,000
(Choi Jung Woo)

60
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,819
What are you doing?

61
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:05,459
Some dummy keeps going around
bumping into everything.

62
00:07:10,329 --> 00:07:12,540
I was planning on doing this.

63
00:07:12,569 --> 00:07:13,839
Don't look at me like that.

64
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:24,850
- What would people think--
- Hold on.

65
00:07:25,579 --> 00:07:26,980
My head hurts so much.

66
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:29,920
Are you okay?

67
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:32,420
Do Gun.

68
00:07:34,589 --> 00:07:35,629
There's...

69
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:38,629
a place I want to go with you.

70
00:08:12,529 --> 00:08:14,399
You wanted to ride this?

71
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,930
Yes. Let's go.

72
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,620
How pretty.

73
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:34,190
If you sit here and go around,

74
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,960
all the bitter feelings you have inside
go away.

75
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:47,529
It feels like time has stopped.

76
00:08:50,529 --> 00:08:52,299
It feels like it's just us two.

77
00:08:57,879 --> 00:09:01,009
I always wanted to come here
with someone I cared about.

78
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,549
Someone you care about?

79
00:09:08,789 --> 00:09:10,090
That sounds really nice.

80
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:15,059
I'm in trouble.

81
00:09:15,789 --> 00:09:19,460
I'm beginning to like everything
I do with you.

82
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,200
- Do Gun.
- Yes?

83
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,600
Let's not do the tasting...

84
00:11:07,409 --> 00:11:08,539
for the new dish.

85
00:11:09,139 --> 00:11:10,940
Why are you acting so weak
all of a sudden?

86
00:11:11,309 --> 00:11:13,980
I thought you liked to fight things
head-on.

87
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:18,549
The idea of fighting over something
that's originally yours is...

88
00:11:19,149 --> 00:11:20,419
This won't do.

89
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,350
I'm going to do it for your sake.

90
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,690
Do Gun, the thing is--

91
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,759
I'm really happy today.

92
00:11:29,929 --> 00:11:32,960
Let's just focus on us today.

93
00:12:41,769 --> 00:12:44,539
