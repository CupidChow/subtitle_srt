=My Sweet Dear=

4
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:21,289
You're not judging anything.
You just need to come and taste it.

5
00:00:22,059 --> 00:00:23,600
The winner has already been decided.

6
00:00:26,129 --> 00:00:28,699
Okay. I'll see you during the tasting.

7
00:00:32,869 --> 00:00:35,740
Hello. How have you been?

8
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:40,679
I'll give you a call back in a minute.

9
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:44,979
- What is it?
- Let's talk.

10
00:00:55,159 --> 00:00:57,329
I want it to be fair and square.

11
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:00,229
So that you and I don't have
anything to be ashamed of.

12
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:04,099
What if you end up losing then?

13
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,569
Then I should accept the results.

14
00:01:08,269 --> 00:01:09,969
You make it sound so simple.

15
00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:12,840
Why are you acting like this?

16
00:01:14,109 --> 00:01:15,209
Do Gun...

17
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,680
No, Chef Yoon is changing.

18
00:01:19,219 --> 00:01:21,090
That's what you wanted.

19
00:01:21,849 --> 00:01:23,349
I'm going to go as planned.

20
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:27,060
I've already spoken to all the judges.
How can I change things now--

21
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:32,859
We could have a happy ending
if we finish well.

22
00:01:34,069 --> 00:01:36,370
So stop trying to ruin it, Chef Choi.

23
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,209
Whose happy ending is it?

24
00:01:44,379 --> 00:01:45,980
Should I call Chef Yoon here?

25
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:50,010
Should I tell him that this competition
was all an act?

26
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:51,719
That Choi Jung Woo...

27
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:54,519
was just an actor to get rid of
Yoon Do Gun?

28
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:55,849
What if I told him that?

29
00:01:58,189 --> 00:02:00,019
Can you handle what will happen after?

30
00:02:02,129 --> 00:02:03,530
What if Chef Yoon found out...

31
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:07,200
that you didn't study abroad, that
you've never even left the country,

32
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,099
and that everything was a lie?

33
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:12,039
What would Chef Yoon look like
if he were to find out?

34
00:02:15,939 --> 00:02:18,840
Ms. Kim. Someone's asking for you.

35
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:21,050
Oh, okay.

36
00:02:33,729 --> 00:02:34,830
Ye Jun.

37
00:02:37,229 --> 00:02:38,629
Did you hear everything?

38
00:02:43,099 --> 00:02:45,740
Don't tell Do Gun anything. Please.

39
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,710
I'll tell him everything...

40
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,979
and explain everything myself.

41
00:03:15,699 --> 00:03:18,240
- Here.
- What is this?

42
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:19,939
A gift.

43
00:03:22,909 --> 00:03:24,009
Ta-da.

44
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:29,250
Goodness.

45
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:33,819
I'm moved, Choi Jung Woo.

46
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:39,219
Yoon Do Gun, who's stingy with
compliments, has given me high praise.

47
00:03:40,689 --> 00:03:41,930
I'm successful.

48
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,629
Here.

49
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:50,340
Goodness.

50
00:03:57,479 --> 00:04:00,909
I can't handle this look in your eyes.

51
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:03,879
Are you doing that on purpose?

52
00:04:04,819 --> 00:04:06,050
It's coming out naturally.

53
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,219
I don't think so.

54
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:47,430
Do Gun.

55
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:48,990
Yes?

56
00:04:54,129 --> 00:04:55,569
It makes me happy...

57
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:58,170
to see you that you like it.

58
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:04,709
I really like it.

59
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,290
Hey, Ye Jun.

60
00:05:42,579 --> 00:05:44,720
Hey, Choi Jung Woo.

61
00:05:47,689 --> 00:05:48,750
What's wrong?

62
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,089
Don't you have something to tell me?

63
00:05:54,029 --> 00:05:55,259
What?

64
00:05:55,529 --> 00:05:58,329
You really have nothing to say to me?
Really?

65
00:06:01,829 --> 00:06:03,629
Can you be more specific?

66
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:04,939
Specific?

67
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,610
Hey, Choi Jung Woo. You're so shameless.

68
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:13,610
Were you having fun watching me
fall for your lies?

69
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:14,910
Wasn't it exciting?

70
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:17,550
Wasn't it nice to make me into a fool?

71
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,220
No, Do Gun. That's a mistake.

72
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:23,089
A mistake? What kind of mistake?

73
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,959
You and Laura--

74
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:27,129
No. It's not like that!

75
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,829
Stop lying. Ye Jun told me everything.

76
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:36,399
I won't fall for it anymore.

77
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,439
I'll tell you everything.

78
00:06:51,949 --> 00:06:54,790
So please calm down.

79
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:00,490
No. I don't want to hear it anymore.

80
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:06,459
Don't show your face around me
ever again.

81
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,269
You and I are over.

82
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:54,639
I always wanted to come here
with someone I cared about.

83
00:08:56,509 --> 00:08:59,580
Someone you care about?
That sounds really nice.

84
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:22,559
(Your call cannot be connected.)

85
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:24,899
(You will be directed to voicemail
after the beep.)

86
00:10:24,929 --> 00:10:26,559
(You may face additional charges.)

87
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:29,029
Chef Choi.

88
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:31,440
We're really backed up in the kitchen.

89
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,539
Okay. I'll be there soon.

90
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:36,110
Gosh, Chef Yoon. What's wrong with him?

91
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:37,940
He's never been out before.

92
00:10:38,779 --> 00:10:40,509
What if he's really sick?

93
00:10:40,909 --> 00:10:43,350
I'll call him. Go inside.

94
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:52,090
(Yoon Do Gun)

95
00:10:56,059 --> 00:10:59,100
(I'm going to wait until you come.)

96
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:08,669
(Choi Jung Woo:
I'm going to wait until you come.)

97
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:18,019
Do you still hate me?

98
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:21,120
I never hated you.

99
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,620
I was just uncomfortable...

100
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:26,889
with having someone enter my kitchen.

101
00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:30,659
I like you.

102
00:11:36,929 --> 00:11:38,269
I like you too.

103
00:12:05,299 --> 00:12:06,929
I'm the bad guy.

104
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,070
I'm the bad guy.

105
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:41,700
What are you doing?
Why didn't you answer your phone?

106
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,899
You must've been worried.

107
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:47,840
You had to work with Laura
to screw me over,

108
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,570
- but you didn't know where I was.
- Hey, Yoon Do Gun!

109
00:12:53,409 --> 00:12:55,309
Are you being serious right now?

110
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,690
I hate you.

111
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,789
I really don't want to see you.

112
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:17,129
But I can't help but miss you.

113
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:22,240
Aren't I a fool?

114
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:26,909
The time we spent together...

115
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:32,379
Was that all a lie too?

116
00:13:42,389 --> 00:13:43,889
No. It was sincere.

117
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:48,330
Why did you do it?

118
00:13:49,299 --> 00:13:50,970
Were you that unsure of yourself?

119
00:14:01,149 --> 00:14:02,409
I'll quit.

120
00:14:03,049 --> 00:14:05,220
I'll reveal everything and step down.

121
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:08,789
No.

122
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:13,620
Show me who you really are this time.

123
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:18,059
The real Choi Jung Woo.

124
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:21,830
If other people acknowledge you,

125
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:25,039
then I'll forgive you.

126
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:42,450
I'm sorry.

127
