1
00:01:00,414 --> 00:01:01,594
What?

2
00:01:04,225 --> 00:01:05,515
Gosh. What did I just dream?

3
00:01:48,965 --> 00:01:51,025
Sir, are you all right?

4
00:01:54,504 --> 00:01:55,704
Yes.

5
00:02:01,885 --> 00:02:06,105
Our lifting patches are on the front line of our products.

6
00:02:06,114 --> 00:02:07,894
Is this the best you can do?

7
00:02:08,355 --> 00:02:09,775
As for this scene,

8
00:02:09,784 --> 00:02:12,424
this is exactly what your marketing team sent me.

9
00:02:12,425 --> 00:02:14,045
They gave that to you as a reference.

10
00:02:14,055 --> 00:02:15,965
You should develop the idea.

11
00:02:17,264 --> 00:02:19,164
You told us to use exactly what you gave us.

12
00:02:19,794 --> 00:02:23,064
How could you call yourself a writer when you have no imagination?

13
00:02:24,034 --> 00:02:25,534
I see. Is this your limit?

14
00:02:28,844 --> 00:02:29,974
All right.

15
00:02:29,974 --> 00:02:31,314
Why don't we wrap it up here?

16
00:02:31,314 --> 00:02:32,974
That's it for today's meeting.

17
00:02:36,215 --> 00:02:38,115
We'll give you an update after we settle it internally.

18
00:02:39,485 --> 00:02:40,655
And Team Leader Lee.

19
00:02:40,754 --> 00:02:42,194
We need to have a talk.

20
00:02:42,284 --> 00:02:43,854
I'm a director now.

21
00:02:43,854 --> 00:02:45,294
I'm not a team leader anymore!

22
00:02:47,824 --> 00:02:49,974
Seriously. She's so annoying.

23
00:03:50,724 --> 00:03:51,904
That jerk.

24
00:03:52,025 --> 00:03:53,285
Are you all right?

25
00:03:54,194 --> 00:03:55,494
Yes.

26
00:03:55,495 --> 00:03:58,465
Thank you.

27
00:03:59,634 --> 00:04:02,604
Sir, where are you coming from? Are you going somewhere?

28
00:04:02,604 --> 00:04:05,504
Me? Oh, no. Well,

29
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,604
I...

30
00:04:06,604 --> 00:04:09,444
- I should go now. I'll get going. - Okay.

31
00:04:09,444 --> 00:04:11,044
- No. I should go that way. - Bye.

32
00:04:11,044 --> 00:04:12,784
Bye.

33
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:39,475
You're her, right?

34
00:04:40,574 --> 00:04:42,204
- Ms. Oh Woo Ri Maria? - Yes?

35
00:04:42,204 --> 00:04:43,754
You're in the youth club at church, right?

36
00:04:44,274 --> 00:04:46,144
Yes. That's me. Why do you ask?

37
00:04:46,415 --> 00:04:47,905
We wanted to meet you.

38
00:04:47,915 --> 00:04:49,075
Pardon? Me?

39
00:04:50,084 --> 00:04:52,384
Could you give my wife a hug?

40
00:04:52,514 --> 00:04:54,554
Yes. Please give me a hug.

41
00:04:54,555 --> 00:04:56,075
Me? Why?

42
00:04:56,084 --> 00:04:58,254
Thank you!

43
00:04:58,524 --> 00:04:59,754
I did it!

44
00:04:59,894 --> 00:05:01,024
- Thank you. - Thank you.

45
00:05:05,095 --> 00:05:06,235
What was that?

46
00:05:07,295 --> 00:05:09,795
- I got it. - Goodness. I'm on a roll!

47
00:05:09,805 --> 00:05:12,465
All right. You don't have enough junk cards and bright cards.

48
00:05:12,475 --> 00:05:13,935
And I doubled my bet earlier.

49
00:05:14,404 --> 00:05:16,074
Look at my points.

50
00:05:16,074 --> 00:05:17,174
Hey. You brought cash, right?

51
00:05:17,175 --> 00:05:19,915
If I don't have cash, I'll wire it to you.

52
00:05:25,285 --> 00:05:26,615
Hey, Hyung Sik.

53
00:05:27,214 --> 00:05:29,254
Of course. I'm available.

54
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:30,724
Where in Gyeonggi Province?

55
00:05:30,725 --> 00:05:32,095
Is there a good restaurant in Gyeonggi Province?

56
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:34,145
There are a lot of good restaurants in Seoul too.

57
00:05:34,725 --> 00:05:36,365
I hope you don't have an ulterior motive.

58
00:05:38,894 --> 00:05:40,104
- Goodness. I'm cold. - Hey!

59
00:05:41,305 --> 00:05:43,365
Hyung Sik. Sorry. I'll call you back.

60
00:05:43,865 --> 00:05:45,265
Hey, have you gone mad?

61
00:05:45,274 --> 00:05:47,044
Do you know how much I won?

62
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:48,835
I'm home.

63
00:05:48,845 --> 00:05:50,105
Woo Ri, you're home.

64
00:05:51,615 --> 00:05:53,565
What is it? Is something wrong?

65
00:05:53,574 --> 00:05:56,214
Nothing is wrong. Did you have dinner?

66
00:05:56,214 --> 00:05:57,794
Let's play fair and square.

67
00:05:58,055 --> 00:06:00,805
Do your one million followers know how petty you are?

68
00:06:05,194 --> 00:06:07,064
Gosh. It's nothing.

69
00:06:07,154 --> 00:06:09,324
We were playing board games after dinner.

70
00:06:09,324 --> 00:06:11,134
And your mother seems sensitive today.

71
00:06:12,464 --> 00:06:14,094
You guys should try to get along.

72
00:06:14,095 --> 00:06:16,105
Your mother is the problem.

73
00:06:17,064 --> 00:06:18,974
Why is she so fussy all the time?

74
00:06:18,975 --> 00:06:20,735
- What about Mom? - It's nothing.

75
00:06:21,004 --> 00:06:23,774
It will be too complicated to understand her. All right.

76
00:06:24,774 --> 00:06:27,124
My daughter, tell me. Do you know how to play Go-Stop?

77
00:06:27,274 --> 00:06:28,584
How about a finger flick?

78
00:06:29,745 --> 00:06:31,485
I don't play unless there's money on the table.

79
00:06:35,084 --> 00:06:36,124
Get comfortable.

80
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:37,375
You are my daughter indeed.

81
00:06:39,555 --> 00:06:40,925
Gosh.

82
00:06:51,504 --> 00:06:53,044
Gosh. What's going on with me?

83
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:54,384
Is it because of the dream?

84
00:06:54,944 --> 00:06:57,384
I keep getting butterflies whenever I see your mom.

85
00:06:57,774 --> 00:06:59,374
I shouldn't like her, right?

86
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:00,875
Right. I shouldn't.

87
00:07:01,285 --> 00:07:03,375
I can't. Wait. Why can't I? Why not?

88
00:07:04,485 --> 00:07:05,645
Gummy Bear.

89
00:07:07,355 --> 00:07:08,485
You're not sure either?

90
00:07:09,185 --> 00:07:11,045
Right. Daddy isn't sure either.

91
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:12,795
What? What did you say? We should sleep? Yes, let's do that.

92
00:07:13,795 --> 00:07:15,055
We should just go to sleep.

93
00:07:16,524 --> 00:07:17,674
Gosh.

94
00:07:17,935 --> 00:07:19,685
Just go to sleep.

95
00:07:48,394 --> 00:07:49,504
What?

96
00:07:50,394 --> 00:07:51,764
What did I just dream?

97
00:07:55,935 --> 00:07:57,055
No.

98
00:07:57,535 --> 00:07:59,695
- What did you say? - What's gotten into you today?

99
00:07:59,834 --> 00:08:01,044
Are you not feeling well?

100
00:08:01,105 --> 00:08:03,045
- No. I just... - What?

101
00:08:03,845 --> 00:08:05,805
I just had a weird dream. That's all.

102
00:08:06,115 --> 00:08:07,875
A weird dream? What was it about?

103
00:08:08,714 --> 00:08:09,924
Well...

104
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:14,185
It's nothing.

105
00:08:14,584 --> 00:08:16,734
You know, it was just a weird dream.

106
00:08:16,925 --> 00:08:18,725
A dream that had nothing to do with my real life.

107
00:08:19,295 --> 00:08:21,125
A weird dream. That's all it was.

108
00:08:21,194 --> 00:08:22,864
- A plain, weird dream is all. - That's her!

109
00:08:22,865 --> 00:08:23,995
You're right!

110
00:08:24,365 --> 00:08:26,885
Hey, I have an exam next week.

111
00:08:27,134 --> 00:08:28,334
Can you give me a hug?

112
00:08:28,764 --> 00:08:29,834
What?

113
00:08:29,834 --> 00:08:31,504
- Me too! - Me too!

114
00:08:31,605 --> 00:08:33,035
Goodness.

115
00:08:34,675 --> 00:08:36,245
Good luck with the exam.

116
00:08:37,644 --> 00:08:39,014
But why do you want to hug me?

117
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:41,715
This is you, right? Oh Woo Ri.

118
00:08:44,544 --> 00:08:45,624
Gosh.

119
00:08:46,054 --> 00:08:47,254
Woo Ri.

120
00:08:47,254 --> 00:08:48,654
- What? - That's Woo Ri.

121
00:08:49,985 --> 00:08:51,745
You're behind this, aren't you?

122
00:08:52,054 --> 00:08:53,254
Sister Woo Ri.

123
00:08:54,455 --> 00:08:56,825
I was going to make it a surprise, but you found out.

124
00:08:57,495 --> 00:08:58,885
You're getting an award today.

125
00:08:59,034 --> 00:09:01,664
As the president of the youth club, I must show my support.

126
00:09:03,764 --> 00:09:05,034
- An award? - Yes.

127
00:09:08,605 --> 00:09:10,435
Why would get an award?

128
00:09:10,445 --> 00:09:11,615
Woo Ri.

129
00:09:12,715 --> 00:09:14,445
You made such a sacred decision.

130
00:09:14,815 --> 00:09:16,615
We are so proud of you...

131
00:09:16,715 --> 00:09:18,855
for protecting the baby.

132
00:09:19,254 --> 00:09:21,094
The Lord gave you a life.

133
00:09:22,325 --> 00:09:23,775
After hearing your story,

134
00:09:23,784 --> 00:09:26,834
the Guardian of Life Headquarters wants to give you an award.

135
00:09:27,725 --> 00:09:29,885
The members of our church put together an event to celebrate it.

136
00:09:29,894 --> 00:09:32,004
But still. This is...

137
00:09:32,235 --> 00:09:35,105
We shouldn't make a big deal out of this.

138
00:09:36,504 --> 00:09:38,384
And this is weird.

139
00:09:38,904 --> 00:09:40,384
What is this?

140
00:09:41,105 --> 00:09:43,335
I made them to celebrate the award.

141
00:09:43,345 --> 00:09:44,605
You punk.

142
00:09:44,715 --> 00:09:46,445
Woo Ri isn't some saintess from the Bible.

143
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:48,044
There's a limit to your jokes!

144
00:09:48,184 --> 00:09:50,984
Because of these weird badges you made,

145
00:09:50,985 --> 00:09:53,775
people kept asking me to hug them.

146
00:09:55,825 --> 00:09:56,915
- Woo Ri! - Woo Ri!

147
00:09:56,924 --> 00:09:58,054
- What? - Woo Ri!

148
00:09:58,154 --> 00:09:59,254
- Sister! - Gosh!

149
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:01,225
- Please go away! - Sister Woo Ri!

150
00:10:02,695 --> 00:10:04,085
- Hey! - Woo Ri!

151
00:10:04,095 --> 00:10:05,835
- Please calm down! - Woo Ri!

152
00:10:05,934 --> 00:10:08,244
- Goodness. Please calm down. - Oh, no.

153
00:10:09,034 --> 00:10:10,244
No!

154
00:10:37,725 --> 00:10:40,625
- Sister Woo Ri! - Stop it!

155
00:10:40,634 --> 00:10:42,004
Go away!

156
00:10:51,544 --> 00:10:53,124
Are you hurt?

157
00:10:53,715 --> 00:10:54,745
I'm fine.

158
00:11:00,985 --> 00:11:03,225
They look good together.

159
00:11:03,355 --> 00:11:04,915
Mom, the treatment must be done.

160
00:11:04,924 --> 00:11:07,694
Right. You and I should go over there.

161
00:11:07,695 --> 00:11:09,595
- Why? - Come here.

162
00:11:10,695 --> 00:11:11,925
Are you all right?

163
00:11:12,164 --> 00:11:14,374
I'm sorry. This is all my fault.

164
00:11:14,394 --> 00:11:16,434
No. Why are you sorry?

165
00:11:16,434 --> 00:11:18,434
It's my fault. I injured myself.

166
00:11:19,835 --> 00:11:22,935
By the way, what was going on? Are you getting an award?

167
00:11:22,945 --> 00:11:25,565
No. It's nothing.

168
00:11:25,575 --> 00:11:26,575
I see.

169
00:11:27,245 --> 00:11:28,945
But what were you doing at the church?

170
00:11:29,784 --> 00:11:33,784
Oh, you left something in the conference room.

171
00:11:33,784 --> 00:11:34,884
Here.

172
00:11:35,254 --> 00:11:36,334
I see.

173
00:11:37,284 --> 00:11:38,924
You could have given it to me later.

174
00:11:38,924 --> 00:11:40,924
Well, I just thought I could swing by.

175
00:11:42,664 --> 00:11:46,134
You're always there to help me. You already helped me twice.

176
00:11:46,134 --> 00:11:48,004
Twice isn't a lot.

177
00:11:48,404 --> 00:11:50,344
I wish I could always be with you.

178
00:11:50,934 --> 00:11:51,934
Pardon?

179
00:11:53,975 --> 00:11:57,495
No. I mean, you must be careful for the baby.

180
00:11:58,375 --> 00:11:59,405
Right.

181
00:12:13,894 --> 00:12:16,004
- Ms. Oh. - Yes?

182
00:12:17,595 --> 00:12:20,625
Actually, I...

183
00:12:21,934 --> 00:12:23,004
Excuse me.

184
00:12:25,504 --> 00:12:26,774
Yes. Hello?

185
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:29,875
What? The police station?

186
00:12:30,745 --> 00:12:32,615
What? Why? My father?

187
00:12:32,745 --> 00:12:35,445
I even had a meal...

188
00:12:36,115 --> 00:12:38,215
and went to the sauna with your chief here.

189
00:12:38,514 --> 00:12:39,964
But I'm not going to tell you that.

190
00:12:39,985 --> 00:12:41,375
We've been keeping things on the down-low...

191
00:12:41,384 --> 00:12:42,754
because a man died in my hospital.

192
00:12:42,754 --> 00:12:44,754
But how do you expect me to run a hospital...

193
00:12:44,754 --> 00:12:46,294
when a cop keeps showing up there?

194
00:12:46,294 --> 00:12:49,324
I'm sorry. I'll talk to him.

195
00:12:49,325 --> 00:12:50,955
He's making a mess at my hospital...

196
00:12:50,965 --> 00:12:53,025
to catch a suspect that doesn't exist!

197
00:12:53,934 --> 00:12:56,004
And look at this. What will you do with this?

198
00:12:56,205 --> 00:12:59,395
This is called the full moon, the best yellow chrysanthemum.

199
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:03,174
I looked after this for ten years as if I were my own child!

200
00:13:03,174 --> 00:13:05,944
Seriously. You know what? I'm going to...

201
00:13:05,945 --> 00:13:08,675
Should I turn this place upside down today?

202
00:13:08,914 --> 00:13:10,144
Call your chief.

203
00:13:10,144 --> 00:13:12,464
Dad. That's enough. Stop it.

204
00:13:13,914 --> 00:13:15,554
We don't want this to happen again.

205
00:13:16,085 --> 00:13:17,485
I'm so sorry.

206
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:31,264
You, Kang Jae!

207
00:13:31,904 --> 00:13:34,134
What on earth are you up to these days?

208
00:13:34,304 --> 00:13:37,904
What did you do at the hospital even without a warrant?

209
00:13:38,445 --> 00:13:40,265
Come on!

210
00:13:47,054 --> 00:13:48,964
Square your shoulders!

211
00:13:52,495 --> 00:13:54,015
Mother!

212
00:13:56,495 --> 00:13:58,655
You should have called first.

213
00:13:59,434 --> 00:14:01,204
I dropped by because I missed you.

214
00:14:02,164 --> 00:14:04,574
And I wanted to give you this too.

215
00:14:05,075 --> 00:14:07,925
My mom made jangjorim, and it made me think of you.

216
00:14:07,934 --> 00:14:09,714
You can finish two bowls of rice with this.

217
00:14:10,904 --> 00:14:11,984
Mother.

218
00:14:13,315 --> 00:14:15,305
Are you that touched by jangjorim?

219
00:14:15,315 --> 00:14:17,215
Thank you. I'll eat them.

220
00:14:19,684 --> 00:14:21,154
Why didn't you come to church?

221
00:14:22,085 --> 00:14:23,275
Because of Woo Ri?

222
00:14:25,254 --> 00:14:26,604
No.

223
00:14:27,695 --> 00:14:29,915
I'm investigating a case now.

224
00:14:31,565 --> 00:14:32,735
Kang Jae.

225
00:14:33,835 --> 00:14:35,455
Is it still hard?

226
00:14:35,465 --> 00:14:37,155
Gosh. No.

227
00:14:39,434 --> 00:14:43,274
I think Woo Ri is getting better little by little.

228
00:14:44,105 --> 00:14:47,345
So you need to get yourself together too.

229
00:14:48,014 --> 00:14:49,044
Okay?

230
00:14:50,284 --> 00:14:53,654
I'm all right too, Mother.

231
00:14:54,615 --> 00:14:55,725
Thank you.

232
00:14:58,054 --> 00:15:00,524
- All right. - You're leaving already?

233
00:15:01,325 --> 00:15:02,415
Kang Jae.

234
00:15:03,294 --> 00:15:04,924
Should I give you a hug?

235
00:15:05,235 --> 00:15:08,325
- No. It's all right. - No, you need one. Come here.

236
00:15:08,335 --> 00:15:10,425
- Gosh. - I'm like your mom. Come here.

237
00:15:10,434 --> 00:15:12,404
Gosh. You're way too young.

238
00:15:12,404 --> 00:15:14,934
- Gosh. Come here. - Hello.

239
00:15:14,934 --> 00:15:17,714
- I won't fall for that. - Mother.

240
00:15:18,414 --> 00:15:20,974
- Mother. - Stay strong. Okay.

241
00:15:20,975 --> 00:15:22,375
Okay.

242
00:15:24,615 --> 00:15:27,815
Gosh. The movie, "Oldboy", ruined it for everyone.

243
00:15:28,424 --> 00:15:30,584
Ma Ri, isn't that such a ridiculous stereotype...

244
00:15:30,585 --> 00:15:32,825
to give only dumplings to the person you're locking up?

245
00:15:33,394 --> 00:15:35,924
Be quiet and eat unless you want to starve to death!

246
00:15:35,924 --> 00:15:37,464
You get well-balanced meals,

247
00:15:37,465 --> 00:15:40,095
put together by nutritionists even in prison.

248
00:15:40,865 --> 00:15:43,355
Hey. Do you want to go back there for the well-balanced meals?

249
00:15:43,365 --> 00:15:45,265
Shut your mouth and watch the TV.

250
00:15:46,674 --> 00:15:49,004
Gosh. It's been so long since I touched a remote.

251
00:15:49,245 --> 00:15:50,375
Thank you.

252
00:16:01,054 --> 00:16:03,084
Chun Sa Da falls into Na Beom In's trap...

253
00:16:03,085 --> 00:16:04,085
and gets abducted.

254
00:16:06,294 --> 00:16:09,524
Chun Sa Da removes the steel handcuffs and escapes.

255
00:16:11,164 --> 00:16:13,104
Chun Sa Da will fight back soon.

256
00:16:14,195 --> 00:16:17,105
"Mask of Desire" will air at 9pm on Thursday.

257
00:16:17,634 --> 00:16:18,804
Look forward to the drama.

258
00:16:19,105 --> 00:16:21,945
It will air at 9pm on Thursday?

259
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:25,475
I'm going out.

260
00:16:26,575 --> 00:16:27,665
Woo Ri.

261
00:16:28,644 --> 00:16:30,354
Take this with you.

262
00:16:30,485 --> 00:16:32,145
What's this, Grandma?

263
00:16:32,154 --> 00:16:34,754
I made some ox bone soup. You should bring it to him.

264
00:16:34,754 --> 00:16:36,324
Raphael hurt his leg.

265
00:16:36,325 --> 00:16:38,085
Oh, for Raphael?

266
00:16:38,424 --> 00:16:39,994
You didn't have to do that.

267
00:16:39,995 --> 00:16:42,985
You should bring this to him. He got hurt, trying to help you.

268
00:16:42,995 --> 00:16:47,425
So bring this to him and tell him to recover with this soup. Okay?

269
00:16:47,664 --> 00:16:50,714
All those fancy meals can't be better than home-cooked meals.

270
00:16:50,804 --> 00:16:52,504
Those meals don't have love in them.

271
00:16:52,975 --> 00:16:54,865
Okay.

272
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:58,705
Go there after work and have a meal with him too. Okay?

273
00:16:58,715 --> 00:17:00,405
I won't put aside dinner for you.

274
00:17:01,245 --> 00:17:02,245
Wait.

275
00:17:06,414 --> 00:17:09,984
Please thank your grandmother for the food.

276
00:17:10,954 --> 00:17:12,134
It looks great.

277
00:17:13,454 --> 00:17:16,494
I'm sorry to make you go through this trouble because of me.

278
00:17:16,795 --> 00:17:19,335
You weren't able to go to work because of your leg today?

279
00:17:19,664 --> 00:17:21,194
Oh, no.

280
00:17:21,295 --> 00:17:23,895
I had already taken a day off today. It wasn't because of the injury.

281
00:17:24,234 --> 00:17:26,544
I'm all right. It doesn't hurt at all.

282
00:17:27,634 --> 00:17:28,944
That's a relief.

283
00:17:43,484 --> 00:17:46,754
One of my favorite writers published a new book.

284
00:17:46,755 --> 00:17:48,095
I was just reading that.

285
00:17:48,765 --> 00:17:50,115
It's a collection of short stories.

286
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:51,485
There's a story titled "The Heart of Summer".

287
00:17:51,825 --> 00:17:53,185
That one is my favorite.

288
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:26,065
Oh, I should get going now.

289
00:18:26,194 --> 00:18:29,434
You should finish your tea before you go.

290
00:18:32,535 --> 00:18:34,105
Take your time with it.

291
00:18:34,805 --> 00:18:37,545
And drink everything before you go.

292
00:18:43,244 --> 00:18:44,414
Okay.

293
00:19:18,015 --> 00:19:22,915
- She doesn't look in the mirror - She doesn't look in the mirror

294
00:19:22,924 --> 00:19:26,634
- She is a lonely woman - She is a lonely woman

295
00:19:27,795 --> 00:19:32,365
- Will you - Will you

296
00:19:32,494 --> 00:19:36,574
- Love me tonight? - Love me tonight?

297
00:19:40,035 --> 00:19:41,165
Thank you.

298
00:19:41,174 --> 00:19:42,854
- Can I borrow your marker? - Pardon?

299
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:45,345
I need an autograph from Hyung Sik too.

300
00:19:46,115 --> 00:19:50,285
- Goodness. You're so handsome. - I'm a huge fan.

301
00:19:51,884 --> 00:19:55,324
All right. We bought some snacks today!

302
00:19:58,085 --> 00:19:59,945
- That looks tasty. - It's over. Aren't you leaving?

303
00:19:59,954 --> 00:20:01,994
You said you needed to be at the shoot. I'm leaving now.

304
00:20:01,994 --> 00:20:03,394
Wait. Where are you going?

305
00:20:03,664 --> 00:20:06,194
To the hospital. Woo Ri's getting her sonogram today.

306
00:20:06,194 --> 00:20:07,464
Then, let's go together.

307
00:20:17,305 --> 00:20:18,665
The baby's doing great.

308
00:20:18,914 --> 00:20:20,024
Can you see this?

309
00:20:20,115 --> 00:20:23,375
These are the eyes, nose, and mouth.

310
00:20:23,384 --> 00:20:25,684
And can you see the arms and legs?

311
00:20:26,815 --> 00:20:29,375
You'll be able to hear the heartbeat since it's week eight.

312
00:21:09,095 --> 00:21:11,325
Raphael, are you crying?

313
00:21:11,525 --> 00:21:12,795
No, I'm not.

314
00:21:14,035 --> 00:21:16,825
I'm usually not that emotional.

315
00:21:16,835 --> 00:21:18,305
Gosh, why am I like this?

316
00:21:19,575 --> 00:21:21,695
It's okay. Many people cry.

317
00:21:22,404 --> 00:21:23,704
- Here you go. - Thank you.

318
00:21:24,444 --> 00:21:26,354
Gosh. I'm just...

319
00:21:26,845 --> 00:21:29,515
Are you okay?

320
00:21:29,585 --> 00:21:31,635
I'm okay...

321
00:21:33,855 --> 00:21:35,085
Oh gosh.

322
00:21:37,325 --> 00:21:38,885
Why is he crying like that?

323
00:21:39,154 --> 00:21:40,834
This isn't something to cry over like that.

324
00:21:41,224 --> 00:21:43,224
He's such a family man.

325
00:21:43,694 --> 00:21:46,374
He must be so fond of the baby to be that way.

326
00:21:46,795 --> 00:21:48,365
He's overreacting.

327
00:21:49,535 --> 00:21:51,765
They look good together.

328
00:21:52,835 --> 00:21:53,925
What do you mean?

329
00:21:53,934 --> 00:21:55,404
Woo Ri and the baby's father.

330
00:21:55,805 --> 00:21:57,165
They look good together.

331
00:21:57,375 --> 00:21:59,335
That's ridiculous.

332
00:21:59,345 --> 00:22:00,805
Why not?

333
00:22:00,815 --> 00:22:02,935
He's divorced and Woo Ri also...

334
00:22:02,944 --> 00:22:04,794
How will you ever see Kang Jae?

335
00:22:04,884 --> 00:22:06,614
Well, that is...

336
00:22:06,615 --> 00:22:07,775
If you haven't lost your mind,

337
00:22:07,785 --> 00:22:09,215
don't ever say such a thing to Woo Ri.

338
00:22:15,494 --> 00:22:16,634
By the way,

339
00:22:17,295 --> 00:22:19,185
I usually don't cry.

340
00:22:20,164 --> 00:22:23,014
I don't even cry when I watch a sad movie.

341
00:22:23,664 --> 00:22:26,704
But whenever I think about the baby...

342
00:22:30,674 --> 00:22:31,854
I'm sorry.

343
00:22:32,474 --> 00:22:34,944
It's okay. You don't have to apologize.

344
00:22:35,115 --> 00:22:36,405
Gosh.

345
00:22:36,944 --> 00:22:38,294
I feel like crying again.

346
00:22:39,914 --> 00:22:43,354
They said you could see a 3D sonogram picture in week 20.

347
00:22:43,355 --> 00:22:46,095
We can see the baby's face...

348
00:22:47,125 --> 00:22:49,295
in 3D.

349
00:22:50,424 --> 00:22:53,164
You might faint from crying if you see it.

350
00:22:55,535 --> 00:22:56,725
Right.

351
00:22:56,934 --> 00:22:59,234
I should get fully prepared for it.

352
00:23:14,414 --> 00:23:16,154
I have a plan to catch this guy.

353
00:23:19,095 --> 00:23:20,595
This is the police. Put your hands up.

354
00:23:21,154 --> 00:23:22,964
I'll pretend that I'm a maintenance guy...

355
00:23:22,964 --> 00:23:23,964
and go in the ward.

356
00:23:24,095 --> 00:23:25,255
I'll tear down the wall if I have to...

357
00:23:25,265 --> 00:23:27,095
Kang Jae, you need to stop.

358
00:23:28,934 --> 00:23:31,004
I told you I'm not mistaken.

359
00:23:31,005 --> 00:23:33,395
I know why you're doing this. So stop.

360
00:23:35,234 --> 00:23:36,704
- What? - I know why you broke up...

361
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:37,904
with Woo Ri,

362
00:23:38,444 --> 00:23:41,054
and why you are so obsessed over that hospital.

363
00:23:41,815 --> 00:23:42,975
I hear that Woo Ri...

364
00:23:43,515 --> 00:23:45,205
got pregnant because of medical malpractice.

365
00:23:45,755 --> 00:23:47,815
And the sperm belongs to Raphael.

366
00:23:48,015 --> 00:23:49,285
Isn't that why you're doing this?

367
00:23:51,825 --> 00:23:53,685
I would've done the same thing.

368
00:23:54,924 --> 00:23:56,334
But let's stop.

369
00:24:02,934 --> 00:24:04,314
It's not that.

370
00:24:05,335 --> 00:24:07,105
Chairman Kim is in that hospital.

371
00:24:08,805 --> 00:24:10,575
I definitely heard it when Shin Mi Young died.

372
00:24:11,904 --> 00:24:13,554
I can no longer help you.

373
00:24:14,575 --> 00:24:16,135
I feel like I'm walking on eggshells.

374
00:24:37,134 --> 00:24:38,234
Seriously.

375
00:24:39,835 --> 00:24:41,965
Ms. Lee, I've made the changes in the draft.

376
00:24:44,845 --> 00:24:47,335
It turned dark outside while I waited for this.

377
00:24:47,345 --> 00:24:49,405
You get off work at 4pm in Sweden.

378
00:24:49,615 --> 00:24:51,205
Can't you work faster?

379
00:24:54,755 --> 00:24:55,915
What's that?

380
00:24:57,585 --> 00:24:59,325
I got it at church.

381
00:24:59,755 --> 00:25:01,915
There's this pregnant woman who decided...

382
00:25:01,924 --> 00:25:04,104
to have a child like the Virgin Mary.

383
00:25:05,095 --> 00:25:06,265
Is that Oh Woo Ri?

384
00:25:06,694 --> 00:25:08,574
How do you know her? Do you go to church as well?

385
00:25:09,265 --> 00:25:11,225
People came from all over...

386
00:25:11,234 --> 00:25:12,974
because they said it was good luck to touch her.

387
00:25:12,974 --> 00:25:14,344
But she didn't like it.

388
00:25:18,775 --> 00:25:20,545
Of course, she wouldn't like it.

389
00:25:22,275 --> 00:25:24,805
The more people know about this,

390
00:25:24,815 --> 00:25:26,315
the more she wouldn't like it.

391
00:25:28,984 --> 00:25:31,924
What was the name of the streamer...

392
00:25:31,924 --> 00:25:33,304
we contacted for viral marketing?

393
00:25:33,355 --> 00:25:34,555
BJ Bbikku?

394
00:25:35,125 --> 00:25:36,515
He has a lot of viewers,

395
00:25:36,525 --> 00:25:38,915
but his reputation isn't good. So, we cut him out.

396
00:25:38,994 --> 00:25:40,164
That sounds good.

397
00:25:40,394 --> 00:25:42,274
What was his contact information?

398
00:25:51,545 --> 00:25:53,075
Seeing our baby's picture...

399
00:25:53,644 --> 00:25:56,094
reminded me of you. So I'm sending you a picture.

400
00:26:51,505 --> 00:26:52,865
This is the place.

401
00:26:52,875 --> 00:26:55,265
I'm sure you're curious about where I am.

402
00:26:55,275 --> 00:26:56,595
This is...

403
00:26:56,605 --> 00:26:58,495
I am at...

404
00:26:58,505 --> 00:27:00,805
the site of a miracle.

405
00:27:00,815 --> 00:27:02,505
This is an amazing place.

406
00:27:02,515 --> 00:27:03,905
The modern version of Mary.

407
00:27:03,914 --> 00:27:05,554
What I mean by that is...

408
00:27:05,714 --> 00:27:09,014
that a virgin is pregnant. Isn't that unbelievable?

409
00:27:09,015 --> 00:27:13,045
I will satisfy your curiosity, so stay tuned.

410
00:27:13,055 --> 00:27:15,145
Mister. What are you doing?

411
00:27:15,154 --> 00:27:17,964
Hello, there. Nice to meet you.

412
00:27:17,964 --> 00:27:19,374
Is Ms. Oh Woo Ri here?

413
00:27:19,464 --> 00:27:22,134
I heard that a virgin got pregnant.

414
00:27:22,134 --> 00:27:24,104
Gosh. Turn that camera off and leave.

415
00:27:24,105 --> 00:27:25,155
- Go. - Leave.

416
00:27:25,164 --> 00:27:27,734
What do you mean leave? My viewers are watching.

417
00:27:27,734 --> 00:27:28,804
Yes.

418
00:27:28,805 --> 00:27:31,335
The person of interest has appeared.

419
00:27:31,345 --> 00:27:32,505
What is this?

420
00:27:32,515 --> 00:27:34,345
I'm BJ Bbikku.

421
00:27:34,375 --> 00:27:35,705
Can I have an interview?

422
00:27:35,714 --> 00:27:37,544
- No, I won't. Leave. - Leave.

423
00:27:37,545 --> 00:27:39,075
- Leave. - Go.

424
00:27:39,085 --> 00:27:40,475
- Go. - Come on.

425
00:27:43,154 --> 00:27:45,684
Why did such a man come to visit?

426
00:27:45,684 --> 00:27:47,334
What is it? Who came to visit?

427
00:27:48,325 --> 00:27:51,595
Some BJ came to visit.

428
00:27:52,164 --> 00:27:53,394
He said his name was Bbikku.

429
00:27:54,234 --> 00:27:55,574
You mean BJ Bbikku?

430
00:27:55,694 --> 00:27:58,704
He's infamous for troll-baiting to earn money.

431
00:27:59,005 --> 00:28:00,195
But wait.

432
00:28:00,204 --> 00:28:02,334
He came for you? Why?

433
00:28:02,335 --> 00:28:04,305
He wanted to interview me.

434
00:28:05,105 --> 00:28:06,405
What is this?

435
00:28:06,775 --> 00:28:08,705
There are so many victims.

436
00:28:09,214 --> 00:28:10,684
You don't avoid such a person because he's scary,

437
00:28:11,144 --> 00:28:14,094
you avoid him because it's good to avoid him.

438
00:28:14,255 --> 00:28:15,405
Maria.

439
00:28:16,184 --> 00:28:17,424
- Hello. - Thank you.

440
00:28:17,424 --> 00:28:18,484
Thank you so much.

441
00:28:18,484 --> 00:28:19,724
I'm pregnant.

442
00:28:19,724 --> 00:28:21,924
We had trouble getting pregnant for five years.

443
00:28:21,924 --> 00:28:24,194
But we got pregnant after we met you.

444
00:28:24,394 --> 00:28:25,494
Thank you so much.

445
00:28:26,194 --> 00:28:27,304
Congratulations.

446
00:28:27,795 --> 00:28:30,295
But you're not pregnant because of me.

447
00:28:30,305 --> 00:28:33,535
No. I got pregnant after you gave me a hug.

448
00:28:33,704 --> 00:28:35,434
A miracle happened.

449
00:28:35,434 --> 00:28:38,514
Yes. There isn't a greater miracle than this.

450
00:28:38,575 --> 00:28:41,565
Okay.

451
00:28:41,575 --> 00:28:43,305
I've seen everything.

452
00:28:43,315 --> 00:28:44,935
You saw this, didn't you?

453
00:28:44,944 --> 00:28:49,154
The modern version of Mary finally worked miracles.

454
00:28:49,154 --> 00:28:51,364
Give me an interview. It's such a good day.

455
00:28:51,454 --> 00:28:54,024
And congratulations on getting pregnant, you two.

456
00:28:54,025 --> 00:28:55,415
Let's do an interview together.

457
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:57,224
Excuse me. Leave.

458
00:28:57,394 --> 00:28:59,564
This is the last warning. I won't let this go.

459
00:28:59,565 --> 00:29:00,685
Hey, mister.

460
00:29:00,694 --> 00:29:03,234
The police will arrest you if you trespass like this.

461
00:29:03,234 --> 00:29:05,134
I will call the police if you walk through that door...

462
00:29:05,134 --> 00:29:06,334
one more time.

463
00:29:06,335 --> 00:29:07,595
You came back.

464
00:29:07,605 --> 00:29:09,695
Leave now, or I will call the police.

465
00:29:09,704 --> 00:29:11,404
I haven't committed any crimes.

466
00:29:11,404 --> 00:29:13,784
No police officer can stop this live broadcast.

467
00:29:14,015 --> 00:29:16,605
- Leave now. - Leave.

468
00:29:16,615 --> 00:29:18,435
- Help me. - Leave.

469
00:29:18,444 --> 00:29:21,784
I came out early this morning to satisfy your curiosity...

470
00:29:21,785 --> 00:29:24,045
and get enough sleep...

471
00:29:24,055 --> 00:29:25,875
You're doing such a good job.

472
00:29:25,884 --> 00:29:28,094
You went there in the morning.

473
00:29:28,095 --> 00:29:29,685
I should send him some tokens.

474
00:29:29,694 --> 00:29:30,994
What are you watching?

475
00:29:32,025 --> 00:29:33,185
Nothing.

476
00:29:33,765 --> 00:29:35,025
- What is it? - It's nothing.

477
00:29:35,035 --> 00:29:36,065
Gosh, give me that.

478
00:29:36,605 --> 00:29:37,625
I'm here.

479
00:29:37,634 --> 00:29:39,804
If she comes out, I'll get to the bottom of this.

480
00:29:39,805 --> 00:29:40,895
But I won't do this for free.

481
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:43,444
I will only do as much as the love you show me.

482
00:29:44,045 --> 00:29:45,595
She's out.

483
00:29:45,605 --> 00:29:48,835
Everyone, finally the miraculous virgin has appeared.

484
00:29:48,845 --> 00:29:50,135
Please give us a hug.

485
00:29:50,144 --> 00:29:51,244
Everyone.

486
00:29:51,244 --> 00:29:53,084
She's the miraculous virgin.

487
00:29:53,085 --> 00:29:55,785
Everyone, this is a miracle of the modern Mary.

488
00:29:55,884 --> 00:29:57,564
Experience the miracle.

489
00:29:57,654 --> 00:29:58,794
It's a miracle everyone.

490
00:30:04,265 --> 00:30:06,625
- What are you doing? - An interview.

491
00:30:06,634 --> 00:30:08,494
- Move. - What's going on?

492
00:30:08,494 --> 00:30:10,734
What's this? We're in the middle of an interview.

493
00:30:11,464 --> 00:30:12,734
Hey.

494
00:30:12,734 --> 00:30:15,474
- Maria, where are you going? - Don't leave.

495
00:30:19,005 --> 00:30:20,435
What are you doing?

496
00:30:20,444 --> 00:30:21,884
You think driving an expensive car fixes everything?

497
00:30:22,615 --> 00:30:24,235
I also have one at home.

498
00:30:24,244 --> 00:30:25,714
- Don't touch. - Where are you going, Maria?

499
00:30:33,025 --> 00:30:34,625
How did you know?

500
00:30:37,625 --> 00:30:41,225
Well, someone told me about it from watching the live stream.

501
00:30:41,295 --> 00:30:42,385
Are you okay?

502
00:30:42,464 --> 00:30:45,514
Yes... I'm okay.

503
00:30:45,664 --> 00:30:48,114
He kept distracting me from yesterday.

504
00:30:48,234 --> 00:30:50,114
What's this all about?

505
00:30:50,674 --> 00:30:53,324
I'll look into ways of getting rid of those people.

506
00:30:53,375 --> 00:30:56,735
No, it's okay. I'll take care of it since it's my problem.

507
00:30:56,744 --> 00:30:58,544
I'm the baby's father.

508
00:30:58,545 --> 00:31:00,975
I'll do anything if it concerns you.

509
00:31:02,414 --> 00:31:06,094
I'm grateful that you helped me many times these days...

510
00:31:06,095 --> 00:31:08,445
because of the baby.

511
00:31:09,255 --> 00:31:11,525
But I don't want to burden you.

512
00:31:11,625 --> 00:31:13,655
I'll take care of my own problems.

513
00:31:17,265 --> 00:31:18,335
Ms. Oh,

514
00:31:19,505 --> 00:31:21,805
can't I just help you?

515
00:31:22,204 --> 00:31:23,854
It's not just for the baby...

516
00:31:26,515 --> 00:31:31,035
I mean, I don't know how to put this...

517
00:31:31,045 --> 00:31:34,115
You'd think weird of me whichever way I put it.

518
00:31:35,755 --> 00:31:39,175
But I had a dream.

519
00:31:39,994 --> 00:31:41,834
Excuse me? A dream?

520
00:31:45,224 --> 00:31:47,104
Ms. Oh, I...

521
00:31:49,035 --> 00:31:50,925
Actually, I...

522
00:31:51,265 --> 00:31:52,565
Your phone is ringing.

523
00:31:54,204 --> 00:31:57,504
No, it's nothing. Go ahead, answer your phone.

524
00:31:57,505 --> 00:31:58,575
Okay.

525
00:32:02,444 --> 00:32:03,684
Hello?

526
00:32:04,785 --> 00:32:05,785
Excuse me?

527
00:32:06,285 --> 00:32:08,845
Gosh, Mr. Kim.

528
00:32:08,855 --> 00:32:11,645
By the way, why did you say...

529
00:32:12,625 --> 00:32:14,815
that you won't give us the baby...

530
00:32:14,825 --> 00:32:17,625
if Ma Ri doesn't get a divorce? What did she do wrong?

531
00:32:18,994 --> 00:32:21,264
I don't want to judge...

532
00:32:21,265 --> 00:32:23,835
Ms. Lee's personal wrongdoings with my standards.

533
00:32:24,265 --> 00:32:28,025
I don't think she's fit to be the mother of the baby.

534
00:32:28,035 --> 00:32:29,735
That she was unfaithful in the marriage?

535
00:32:29,974 --> 00:32:31,874
No, that is a misunderstanding.

536
00:32:31,875 --> 00:32:33,775
I've made my decision very carefully.

537
00:32:34,115 --> 00:32:36,935
I think Mr. Raphael has the same opinion as me.

538
00:32:38,315 --> 00:32:41,875
You're more tenacious than I thought you were.

539
00:32:42,884 --> 00:32:46,084
Have you made a deal? I'll give you the baby, so get divorced.

540
00:32:46,085 --> 00:32:48,385
What do mean by a deal? That's not what it is...

541
00:32:48,394 --> 00:32:49,724
Okay. All right.

542
00:32:51,525 --> 00:32:53,795
What can I do if you're like this?

543
00:32:54,035 --> 00:32:58,365
I just didn't want my only son to raise a kid without a mother.

544
00:32:59,634 --> 00:33:01,544
The baby's inside of me.

545
00:33:01,904 --> 00:33:03,404
I'm the mother.

546
00:33:07,075 --> 00:33:09,235
Why did Ms. Oh Woo Ri come?

547
00:33:09,244 --> 00:33:10,354
Well...

548
00:33:11,815 --> 00:33:13,875
I called her to see if she was doing fine.

549
00:33:14,884 --> 00:33:17,094
Right. Is that so?

550
00:33:19,184 --> 00:33:22,194
She says she won't give us the baby if you don't divorce my son.

551
00:33:23,125 --> 00:33:25,385
Excuse me? What did you say?

552
00:33:25,394 --> 00:33:27,164
What can I do? That's the only grandchild I have.

553
00:33:28,394 --> 00:33:29,874
I think you need to get divorced.

554
00:33:31,734 --> 00:33:34,114
I think there is a misunderstanding.

555
00:33:34,734 --> 00:33:36,514
I'll look into it.

556
00:33:42,174 --> 00:33:43,814
They won't leave even when we asked them to.

557
00:33:43,815 --> 00:33:45,235
They're just sitting there.

558
00:33:45,244 --> 00:33:46,654
Did they order food?

559
00:33:46,654 --> 00:33:47,884
Of course, we did.

560
00:33:47,884 --> 00:33:51,254
Is it against the law to sit around after we finished our meal?

561
00:33:51,255 --> 00:33:55,185
How long are you going to sit there after ordering one dish?

562
00:33:55,394 --> 00:33:56,924
We can't do our business.

563
00:33:56,924 --> 00:33:59,544
Let the law decide.

564
00:34:02,365 --> 00:34:05,225
We wouldn't have sold the pork cutlet if it was him.

565
00:34:05,234 --> 00:34:06,344
Excuse me.

566
00:34:06,934 --> 00:34:09,314
You should leave if you're done with your meal.

567
00:34:09,474 --> 00:34:12,184
Why don't you all leave?

568
00:34:12,844 --> 00:34:14,644
Gosh, my legs.

569
00:34:14,644 --> 00:34:16,514
It hurt from before.

570
00:34:16,514 --> 00:34:18,414
I'm sitting here because my legs hurt.

571
00:34:18,414 --> 00:34:20,754
I'll leave when it gets better.

572
00:34:20,755 --> 00:34:23,675
I don't think we can force them out.

573
00:34:23,684 --> 00:34:26,694
When is Miracle Maria coming back?

574
00:34:26,695 --> 00:34:28,815
Shouldn't we wait for her until she comes?

575
00:34:28,824 --> 00:34:31,594
Yes, of course.

576
00:34:31,594 --> 00:34:33,664
Get out. Get out all of you.

577
00:34:35,364 --> 00:34:36,414
Gosh.

578
00:34:38,135 --> 00:34:40,595
Gosh, lady.

579
00:34:40,605 --> 00:34:43,375
Let go of me.

580
00:34:46,974 --> 00:34:49,244
Everyone, did you see that? Did you see her splash water on me?

581
00:34:49,244 --> 00:34:51,614
She just splashed water on me.

582
00:34:51,614 --> 00:34:54,684
- Gosh. She's making me upset. - Ma'am. Why don't you relax?

583
00:34:55,085 --> 00:34:57,775
You could get sued for this.

584
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:02,824
I'm the stupid one selling pork cutlets to you.

585
00:35:03,025 --> 00:35:05,815
I'm closing the restaurant. We're closed.

586
00:35:06,164 --> 00:35:07,394
Everyone, out!

587
00:35:10,164 --> 00:35:12,834
Pork Cutlet, what are you doing here at this hour?

588
00:35:12,835 --> 00:35:14,965
I closed early today.

589
00:35:15,034 --> 00:35:16,644
Why? What's wrong?

590
00:35:16,644 --> 00:35:18,284
Gosh, this is so frustrating.

591
00:35:18,775 --> 00:35:20,565
Isn't there anything fun?

592
00:35:21,375 --> 00:35:22,605
Shall we play Go-stop?

593
00:35:22,614 --> 00:35:26,094
Gosh, my back hurts from playing it too much.

594
00:35:27,315 --> 00:35:28,315
Is that so?

595
00:35:28,985 --> 00:35:32,425
Gosh. Look at this.

596
00:35:35,724 --> 00:35:38,304
Mister, why don't you wear this?

597
00:35:38,465 --> 00:35:39,655
I'm okay...

598
00:36:10,094 --> 00:36:12,894
Woo Ri, I found another one.

599
00:36:12,894 --> 00:36:15,364
Bbikku camped out in front of this house...

600
00:36:15,364 --> 00:36:18,034
asking for an interview so they couldn't have a normal life.

601
00:36:18,105 --> 00:36:21,525
Me too. The more I search, the more I find these stories.

602
00:36:21,675 --> 00:36:24,275
He's made so many mistakes during his live broadcast.

603
00:36:24,474 --> 00:36:27,114
He's made vulgar speeches and belittled weaker people.

604
00:36:27,744 --> 00:36:29,714
Why are people watching his streams?

605
00:36:29,715 --> 00:36:31,815
Exactly. They should be watching my dramas.

606
00:36:34,715 --> 00:36:35,945
Let's talk.

607
00:36:36,585 --> 00:36:39,255
I told you I had nothing to say to you.

608
00:36:39,385 --> 00:36:41,155
Seriously.

609
00:36:41,925 --> 00:36:43,655
You think you can be responsible for what you just said?

610
00:36:43,864 --> 00:36:46,064
Watch what you say.

611
00:36:46,065 --> 00:36:48,425
- What is your problem? - You really don't know?

612
00:36:48,434 --> 00:36:50,634
Who are you to say such things to others?

613
00:36:50,635 --> 00:36:52,495
You don't really want the baby.

614
00:36:52,505 --> 00:36:53,965
You keep on lying.

615
00:36:53,974 --> 00:36:56,114
What do you know about me?

616
00:36:56,375 --> 00:36:57,695
What?

617
00:36:58,445 --> 00:37:02,535
Team Leader Lee, what's wrong? You should calm down.

618
00:37:02,545 --> 00:37:04,085
I'm a director!

619
00:37:04,315 --> 00:37:06,975
Yes, Director Lee.

620
00:37:06,985 --> 00:37:09,045
Why don't you relax a bit...

621
00:37:09,284 --> 00:37:11,034
and talk later?

622
00:37:11,784 --> 00:37:15,264
You just wait and watch what I do next.

623
00:37:22,494 --> 00:37:26,034
Woo Ri, no. This is not the time.

624
00:37:30,474 --> 00:37:32,274
What brings you here?

625
00:37:32,275 --> 00:37:34,705
- I'm here to fix the water pipes. - Okay.

626
00:37:34,715 --> 00:37:35,715
Yes.

627
00:37:44,085 --> 00:37:45,545
Where could it be? Gosh.

628
00:37:52,065 --> 00:37:54,425
Don't do it. Why?

629
00:37:55,594 --> 00:37:56,764
Come on.

630
00:37:57,764 --> 00:37:59,244
Why are you back? Why?

631
00:37:59,335 --> 00:38:01,925
You think I wouldn't know if you come in like this?

632
00:38:02,105 --> 00:38:04,635
We have a security system, you know.

633
00:38:05,304 --> 00:38:08,054
I told you this before and this is too much.

634
00:38:08,175 --> 00:38:09,235
Please, leave.

635
00:38:09,375 --> 00:38:12,775
Sir, we really need to find the evidence in this room.

636
00:38:12,784 --> 00:38:16,224
But they won't issue a search warrant.

637
00:38:16,885 --> 00:38:19,425
There's a real dangerous criminal in this hospital.

638
00:38:19,684 --> 00:38:21,094
What is wrong with you?

639
00:38:21,094 --> 00:38:22,754
There isn't a person like that in the hospital.

640
00:38:22,755 --> 00:38:24,455
Two of your employees died.

641
00:38:24,465 --> 00:38:25,715
You said that was...

642
00:38:26,224 --> 00:38:28,434
because of gambling loans.

643
00:38:28,934 --> 00:38:30,734
Don't make a scene here and leave.

644
00:38:30,735 --> 00:38:33,525
We could get into trouble if the patients come back.

645
00:38:35,034 --> 00:38:36,884
Where did he go? What about the floor?

646
00:38:39,744 --> 00:38:42,014
- Leave. - I can't.

647
00:38:44,815 --> 00:38:45,815
Leave.

648
00:38:46,344 --> 00:38:47,554
I can't!

649
00:38:54,755 --> 00:38:56,695
What is this?

650
00:38:57,164 --> 00:38:59,364
Detective!

651
00:38:59,695 --> 00:39:00,835
Detective Lee.

652
00:39:07,675 --> 00:39:08,735
What is this?

653
00:39:13,474 --> 00:39:14,724
This was for real.

654
00:39:15,215 --> 00:39:17,105
Is this where that guy disappeared to?

655
00:39:18,445 --> 00:39:21,675
Chairman Kim is like a ghost. It's hard to detect his shadows.

656
00:39:22,054 --> 00:39:24,724
I'm sorry Kang Jae for not believing in you.

657
00:39:25,385 --> 00:39:27,525
I should have trusted my detective's hunch.

658
00:39:28,295 --> 00:39:29,385
Let's report this.

659
00:39:29,494 --> 00:39:31,764
Let's report it and do an official investigation.

660
00:39:32,324 --> 00:39:33,534
Not yet.

661
00:39:34,094 --> 00:39:35,664
We need to prove what they did here...

662
00:39:36,164 --> 00:39:38,614
and what connection there is to Chairman Kim.

663
00:39:39,804 --> 00:39:42,884
Otherwise, this is nothing more than an illegal extension.

664
00:39:43,704 --> 00:39:45,014
Have you found something?

665
00:39:46,474 --> 00:39:47,884
They got rid of everything.

666
00:39:48,844 --> 00:39:50,114
What did they do here?

667
00:39:50,114 --> 00:39:52,054
They probably smuggled in the ingredients...

668
00:39:53,144 --> 00:39:54,764
and synthesized drugs.

669
00:39:54,985 --> 00:39:57,385
Right. Chairman Kim is all about drugs.

670
00:39:57,724 --> 00:40:01,434
But there wasn't a tip about him distributing new drugs.

671
00:40:03,195 --> 00:40:05,085
If we interrogate a few junkies, they'll tell us.

672
00:40:05,925 --> 00:40:07,385
Now, we can catch Chairman Kim.

673
00:40:08,835 --> 00:40:10,565
"Chairman Kim"?

674
00:40:15,005 --> 00:40:16,695
Goodness.

675
00:40:17,045 --> 00:40:18,065
Darn it.

676
00:40:18,905 --> 00:40:20,135
- Are you all right? - Yes.

677
00:40:21,775 --> 00:40:23,005
Who is "Chairman Kim"?

678
00:40:25,485 --> 00:40:26,645
It's nothing.

679
00:40:26,655 --> 00:40:28,805
Did you really not know about this space?

680
00:40:28,815 --> 00:40:31,775
No. My team upstairs is looking into it,

681
00:40:32,324 --> 00:40:33,804
so I'll let you know what we find out.

682
00:40:35,195 --> 00:40:36,295
Okay.

683
00:40:40,695 --> 00:40:42,025
Do you know who "Chairman Kim" is?

684
00:40:42,065 --> 00:40:43,525
Which Chairman Kim? I know plenty.

685
00:40:43,605 --> 00:40:46,125
I think this "Chairman Kim" has done some illegal stuff.

686
00:40:46,135 --> 00:40:48,735
I know a truckload of outlaws who go by that name. Which one?

687
00:40:48,835 --> 00:40:50,465
Well, the detective said earlier...

688
00:40:51,074 --> 00:40:54,314
that someone called "Chairman Kim" might have something to do with it.

689
00:40:54,315 --> 00:40:57,175
I told you to keep that detective in check.

690
00:40:57,585 --> 00:40:59,375
He clearly has it out for us.

691
00:40:59,385 --> 00:41:01,175
He's trying to ruin the hospital's reputation!

692
00:41:06,795 --> 00:41:09,815
I suppose they don't know I served in the special forces.

693
00:41:11,664 --> 00:41:13,224
A piece of wire...

694
00:41:13,965 --> 00:41:16,905
is all I need to get out of handcuffs like these.

695
00:41:17,635 --> 00:41:20,775
I always carry one around for situations like this.

696
00:41:30,014 --> 00:41:33,144
Just straighten a paper clip like this.

697
00:41:34,054 --> 00:41:35,614
- Like this. - Nice.

698
00:41:35,614 --> 00:41:38,164
Straighten it out like this.

699
00:41:38,355 --> 00:41:42,085
You need a strong grip to be able to do this.

700
00:41:42,224 --> 00:41:44,224
Once it's all straight like this,

701
00:41:44,525 --> 00:41:47,355
find the lock on the handcuff right here.

702
00:41:47,994 --> 00:41:49,264
Then...

703
00:41:49,534 --> 00:41:50,804
- insert it into the hole. - Mom!

704
00:41:52,364 --> 00:41:54,244
And you'll hear the click...

705
00:41:56,034 --> 00:41:57,914
Hey, I was watching that.

706
00:41:58,405 --> 00:41:59,695
Shut your mouth.

707
00:41:59,804 --> 00:42:00,954
Ma Ri.

708
00:42:01,114 --> 00:42:03,344
I was enjoying the show. How could you just turn it off?

709
00:42:03,344 --> 00:42:05,444
This is not nice. I was watching the show!

710
00:42:05,445 --> 00:42:07,875
Gosh, why are you two fighting again?

711
00:42:07,885 --> 00:42:09,405
Just let him watch it.

712
00:42:09,655 --> 00:42:11,355
Keep your mouth shut and just watch TV.

713
00:42:12,155 --> 00:42:13,155
Mom.

714
00:42:13,394 --> 00:42:15,454
I'm so angry right now!

715
00:42:16,594 --> 00:42:18,704
I thought everything was going well. What should I do?

716
00:42:19,195 --> 00:42:22,185
Maybe we shouldn't have said that to the chairman. What do we do?

717
00:42:22,195 --> 00:42:23,655
What are you talking about?

718
00:42:23,934 --> 00:42:26,244
- Sit down and explain. - Are you all right?

719
00:42:26,565 --> 00:42:28,265
Darn it!

720
00:42:28,275 --> 00:42:30,795
That scene is over. I can't believe this!

721
00:42:30,804 --> 00:42:31,954
Hey.

722
00:42:32,605 --> 00:42:33,835
Be quiet, will you?

723
00:42:33,844 --> 00:42:37,394
Why? Why did you have to turn off the TV right at that moment?

724
00:42:38,184 --> 00:42:41,514
You idiot. Shut your mouth before I kill you!

725
00:42:42,014 --> 00:42:44,594
Stop messing with me!

726
00:42:50,565 --> 00:42:51,715
Oh Woo Ri.

727
00:42:52,824 --> 00:42:54,264
Just wait until I find some dirt on you.

728
00:42:54,994 --> 00:42:57,244
I will chew you to pieces.

729
00:43:04,545 --> 00:43:06,565
- Where is she? - It's getting late.

730
00:43:06,574 --> 00:43:08,944
- Just wait. She'll be here soon. - When?

731
00:43:08,945 --> 00:43:10,875
- It's chilly. - I'm freezing!

732
00:43:10,885 --> 00:43:13,085
- When will Maria be here? - I'm not even wearing a jacket!

733
00:43:14,155 --> 00:43:17,045
- We've been waiting for hours! - Keep waiting.

734
00:43:17,054 --> 00:43:18,954
- How much longer? - It's been hours.

735
00:43:19,824 --> 00:43:21,294
- Seriously. - Come on.

736
00:43:21,295 --> 00:43:22,795
Hey! What's the matter with...

737
00:43:23,494 --> 00:43:24,824
- There she is! Maria! - What?

738
00:43:24,965 --> 00:43:26,385
- Where? - Maria!

739
00:43:26,664 --> 00:43:29,094
- Could I please interview you? - Can you give me a hug?

740
00:43:29,094 --> 00:43:33,034
- Maria, let me hold your hand! - Me too! Hold my hand!

741
00:43:33,034 --> 00:43:35,304
- Hold on. Excuse me! - Maria!

742
00:43:35,304 --> 00:43:36,634
I'm the director of "Curious Stories".

743
00:43:36,635 --> 00:43:37,635
Are you Oh Woo Ri?

744
00:43:37,704 --> 00:43:38,774
I'm from "PD Note".

745
00:43:38,775 --> 00:43:40,545
Is it true that you're pregnant when you're a virgin?

746
00:43:45,485 --> 00:43:48,085
Please give me some time. I'll explain everything.

747
00:43:49,684 --> 00:43:50,994
Get out of my way.

748
00:43:51,255 --> 00:43:52,345
- Wait! - Maria!

749
00:43:52,355 --> 00:43:53,915
- Woo Ri! - Just a comment, please!

750
00:43:53,925 --> 00:43:55,545
Guys, did you see that?

751
00:43:55,554 --> 00:43:57,664
Even people from the national TV networks are here.

752
00:43:57,824 --> 00:43:59,864
I scored big today!

753
00:44:01,065 --> 00:44:02,785
My gosh.

754
00:44:02,795 --> 00:44:04,855
What is this ruckus?

755
00:44:05,105 --> 00:44:06,795
There are even more people here now.

756
00:44:07,235 --> 00:44:08,905
Even TV reporters are here?

757
00:44:12,844 --> 00:44:14,344
I contacted the TV networks.

758
00:44:15,114 --> 00:44:17,114
What? What do you mean?

759
00:44:17,385 --> 00:44:19,575
Will you agree to their interview requests? Don't.

760
00:44:19,585 --> 00:44:20,855
Raphael is here.

761
00:44:23,784 --> 00:44:24,864
Ms. Oh.

762
00:44:25,355 --> 00:44:27,085
Oh, what brings you by?

763
00:44:27,094 --> 00:44:28,394
I stopped by because I was worried,

764
00:44:28,625 --> 00:44:30,195
but it's gotten even worse than earlier.

765
00:44:30,764 --> 00:44:32,424
This is getting out of control.

766
00:44:32,425 --> 00:44:35,485
I even called the police, but they were useless.

767
00:44:35,594 --> 00:44:37,204
I booked a room at a hotel.

768
00:44:37,204 --> 00:44:38,604
Stay there for a few days.

769
00:44:38,605 --> 00:44:42,065
If no one is here, they'll leave soon.

770
00:44:42,675 --> 00:44:45,045
Thank you for trying to help,

771
00:44:45,445 --> 00:44:48,275
but I don't think that will solve anything.

772
00:44:48,815 --> 00:44:50,605
I can take care of this.

773
00:44:50,945 --> 00:44:53,005
What are you planning to do?

774
00:44:57,885 --> 00:44:59,085
Hello?

775
00:44:59,385 --> 00:45:01,885
Oh, yes. You'll be here soon?

776
00:45:02,094 --> 00:45:03,494
Okay.

777
00:45:06,894 --> 00:45:08,204
- What? - Ms. Oh!

778
00:45:09,635 --> 00:45:11,795
- Look! She came out. - Maria!

779
00:45:11,804 --> 00:45:13,534
- Maria! - Just a comment, please!

780
00:45:19,775 --> 00:45:20,945
Everyone.

781
00:45:21,244 --> 00:45:22,474
Do you want a miracle?

782
00:45:22,574 --> 00:45:23,994
- Yes! - Yes!

783
00:45:24,085 --> 00:45:25,105
Miracles...

784
00:45:26,585 --> 00:45:27,675
do not happen.

785
00:45:27,784 --> 00:45:28,854
- What? - Why not?

786
00:45:28,855 --> 00:45:30,415
- What's she saying? - Why not?

787
00:45:30,425 --> 00:45:32,675
The person who should be in the spotlight now isn't me.

788
00:45:32,684 --> 00:45:35,594
It's him, the man who creates victims like me!

789
00:45:36,155 --> 00:45:38,115
- Bbikku? - Bbikku?

790
00:45:38,125 --> 00:45:39,565
- Bbikku? - Why?

791
00:45:39,994 --> 00:45:42,894
All you TV reporters, I'll give you an idea for a great story.

792
00:45:43,065 --> 00:45:44,695
Here, I have a list of all the unsavory events...

793
00:45:44,704 --> 00:45:47,284
involving Bbikku and his controversial video channel.

794
00:45:49,005 --> 00:45:50,445
- I want one too. - What is this?

795
00:45:50,505 --> 00:45:51,565
- Here! - What did he do?

796
00:45:51,875 --> 00:45:54,305
I summarized the details of all the problems...

797
00:45:54,315 --> 00:45:56,805
and controversies he's caused and the complaints about him posted...

798
00:45:56,815 --> 00:45:58,675
by those who suffered because of him in the past.

799
00:45:59,284 --> 00:46:01,184
- Look at this. - My goodness.

800
00:46:01,184 --> 00:46:02,354
- Hey. - Gosh! Did you read this?

801
00:46:02,355 --> 00:46:06,125
The victims who suffered unjustly because of him are here.

802
00:46:07,954 --> 00:46:11,864
He wrongfully accused us of serving leftovers at our restaurant.

803
00:46:12,824 --> 00:46:14,594
The restaurant is about to shut down!

804
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:17,425
He beat me up, saying he had to teach a high school kid a lesson...

805
00:46:17,434 --> 00:46:18,764
for smoking.

806
00:46:19,335 --> 00:46:20,775
I'm an adult.

807
00:46:21,605 --> 00:46:23,265
He ordered fried chicken and complained in his live broadcast...

808
00:46:23,275 --> 00:46:25,335
that we intentionally left out drumsticks.

809
00:46:26,644 --> 00:46:27,644
It was not true.

810
00:46:28,045 --> 00:46:29,905
- What? - Let me explain!

811
00:46:29,914 --> 00:46:30,914
That's horrible.

812
00:46:30,915 --> 00:46:33,075
There are many other victims.

813
00:46:33,085 --> 00:46:34,775
Some have already sued him.

814
00:46:35,614 --> 00:46:38,664
I understand that it's his personal video channel, but is it okay...

815
00:46:39,355 --> 00:46:41,945
to do this just to grab people's attention?

816
00:46:41,954 --> 00:46:44,324
- Bbikku! - The newsroom should cover this.

817
00:46:44,324 --> 00:46:47,534
- Bbikku, can we interview you? - Sorry?

818
00:46:47,534 --> 00:46:50,534
The things on this list and what they said. Is it all true?

819
00:46:50,534 --> 00:46:51,964
Hey, put your cameras away.

820
00:46:51,965 --> 00:46:54,565
It's illegal to show my face without my consent!

821
00:46:54,905 --> 00:46:56,495
- Do you not admit it? - Turn your cameras off!

822
00:46:56,505 --> 00:46:58,235
- Darn it. - Do you admit everything?

823
00:46:58,244 --> 00:46:59,644
- Is it true? - Tell us!

824
00:46:59,644 --> 00:47:01,114
Tell us, Bbikku!

825
00:47:01,244 --> 00:47:02,344
The police are here.

826
00:47:02,914 --> 00:47:04,594
- What? - What's going on?

827
00:47:05,485 --> 00:47:07,505
- Hold on. - Make way.

828
00:47:07,715 --> 00:47:09,005
- Coming through. - Excuse me.

829
00:47:09,014 --> 00:47:10,894
- Make way. - Excuse me, coming through.

830
00:47:11,385 --> 00:47:13,175
- Mr. Park Chang Soo? - Yes.

831
00:47:13,184 --> 00:47:15,094
You had drinks at Night Pocha on the 21st, right?

832
00:47:15,094 --> 00:47:16,094
Yes, I did.

833
00:47:16,095 --> 00:47:18,485
They filed a report for vandalism. You'll have to come with us.

834
00:47:18,494 --> 00:47:19,594
What? They did?

835
00:47:19,594 --> 00:47:21,804
Guys! The cops are taking me again.

836
00:47:21,894 --> 00:47:25,034
Don't you worry. This can't bring me down.

837
00:47:25,034 --> 00:47:27,974
I was totally fine even when they tased me, you know?

838
00:47:28,474 --> 00:47:30,744
- Thanks for the tokens! - Just a comment, please!

839
00:47:30,744 --> 00:47:33,454
- So is it all true? - A comment, please!

840
00:47:33,715 --> 00:47:35,175
- Get in the car. - Oh, hold on.

841
00:47:35,545 --> 00:47:37,385
- Get in. - Gosh.

842
00:47:42,255 --> 00:47:43,545
So it's all true?

843
00:47:43,655 --> 00:47:45,655
I can't believe this.

844
00:47:46,425 --> 00:47:48,715
Everyone must leave at once.

845
00:47:49,195 --> 00:47:50,485
We've received a complaint.

846
00:47:51,025 --> 00:47:52,565
Leave at once.

847
00:47:53,695 --> 00:47:57,505
The police can use force to maintain public order and ensure safety.

848
00:47:57,864 --> 00:47:59,514
Leave at once.

849
00:47:59,934 --> 00:48:01,014
Let's just go.

850
00:48:11,244 --> 00:48:12,414
Let's go.

851
00:48:19,655 --> 00:48:20,815
Yes.

852
00:48:20,824 --> 00:48:22,394
Thank you so much.

853
00:48:23,054 --> 00:48:24,724
- I'll be in touch. - Okay.

854
00:48:24,894 --> 00:48:26,034
Bye.

855
00:48:26,994 --> 00:48:28,934
- Thank you for coming. - Well done.

856
00:48:31,704 --> 00:48:33,364
Good riddance!

857
00:48:33,905 --> 00:48:35,375
Now, I can breathe.

858
00:48:35,534 --> 00:48:37,344
They all left in a flash.

859
00:48:37,445 --> 00:48:38,965
I'm almost sad that they left so quickly.

860
00:48:40,304 --> 00:48:41,744
You took care of it in one blow.

861
00:48:41,744 --> 00:48:42,844
You rock.

862
00:48:44,344 --> 00:48:46,724
Thank you. I'm glad it went well.

863
00:48:46,914 --> 00:48:48,414
I'm so relieved.

864
00:48:48,985 --> 00:48:50,975
Raphael, have you eaten yet?

865
00:48:50,985 --> 00:48:52,175
Stay for dinner.

866
00:48:53,324 --> 00:48:54,554
Well...

867
00:48:54,755 --> 00:48:55,945
We have no rice left.

868
00:48:55,954 --> 00:48:57,824
Come on. We can whip up something.

869
00:48:57,824 --> 00:48:59,194
Come on in.

870
00:48:59,195 --> 00:49:01,085
- Let's go inside. Come on. - Mom.

871
00:49:01,335 --> 00:49:02,425
Well, I'm...

872
00:49:04,835 --> 00:49:05,905
Should I stay...

873
00:49:10,105 --> 00:49:11,505
Excuse me.

874
00:49:18,485 --> 00:49:19,985
Is it really not true?

875
00:49:22,155 --> 00:49:23,585
I'm sorry, ma'am.

876
00:49:25,855 --> 00:49:27,085
All right, then.

877
00:49:39,565 --> 00:49:40,695
Ma'am.

878
00:49:43,505 --> 00:49:45,735
What's the matter?

879
00:49:58,724 --> 00:50:01,154
This little child is putting up with treatment...

880
00:50:01,155 --> 00:50:02,715
that even adults struggle to endure.

881
00:50:03,295 --> 00:50:04,465
Ma'am.

882
00:50:05,025 --> 00:50:07,585
I can't make miracles happen.

883
00:50:08,534 --> 00:50:10,644
I cannot give you false hope.

884
00:50:10,835 --> 00:50:12,355
I know.

885
00:50:12,864 --> 00:50:15,574
But still, could you please give Min Ji a hug just once?

886
00:50:15,704 --> 00:50:19,514
If that cheers her up even just a little,

887
00:50:19,574 --> 00:50:21,054
I'll be happy.

888
00:50:26,244 --> 00:50:28,884
Grandma, who is she?

889
00:50:28,885 --> 00:50:31,245
Oh, this lady here...

890
00:50:31,255 --> 00:50:33,675
wanted to meet you, so I brought her here.

891
00:50:40,894 --> 00:50:42,304
Hi, Min Ji.

892
00:50:43,695 --> 00:50:47,105
Min Ji, I'm Catholic too.

893
00:50:47,375 --> 00:50:50,235
I'll pray for you so you can stay strong.

894
00:50:51,804 --> 00:50:53,004
Be strong.

895
00:50:53,005 --> 00:50:54,945
Thank you.

896
00:51:11,664 --> 00:51:14,644
You actually made a miracle happen.

897
00:51:15,465 --> 00:51:16,525
What?

898
00:51:16,594 --> 00:51:20,434
Showing strangers that you care and want to help.

899
00:51:20,704 --> 00:51:22,014
That creates a miracle.

900
00:51:24,175 --> 00:51:26,065
I really want to do something to help her.

901
00:51:27,244 --> 00:51:29,844
I wish I could make a miracle happen.

902
00:51:29,875 --> 00:51:31,985
I told you. You already did.

903
00:51:33,344 --> 00:51:35,554
I made some calls.

904
00:51:35,554 --> 00:51:37,784
There are some organizations that are happy to help.

905
00:51:37,784 --> 00:51:39,624
And Diamond Medical Foundation...

906
00:51:39,625 --> 00:51:43,045
has some funds set aside for children with rare diseases.

907
00:51:43,054 --> 00:51:44,764
We decided to use it for Min Ji.

908
00:51:44,894 --> 00:51:47,094
It looks like she can undergo surgery soon.

909
00:51:47,224 --> 00:51:48,534
I'm so happy for her.

910
00:51:50,195 --> 00:51:51,465
Raphael.

911
00:51:51,905 --> 00:51:54,395
You made a miracle happen.

912
00:51:54,405 --> 00:51:56,625
My gosh, I didn't even do anything.

913
00:51:56,635 --> 00:51:58,565
It was all you.

914
00:51:58,704 --> 00:52:01,344
You know, we have to use up the fund anyway...

915
00:52:01,344 --> 00:52:03,444
to reduce our taxes and stuff.

916
00:52:03,445 --> 00:52:06,585
We pay a lot of taxes...

917
00:52:07,144 --> 00:52:09,994
What? Do I have something on my face?

918
00:52:12,824 --> 00:52:16,764
You're so nice to me these days.

919
00:52:18,065 --> 00:52:21,735
You show up like a superhero and help me.

920
00:52:23,534 --> 00:52:26,914
Of course, I know you're trying to help the baby, not me.

921
00:52:27,775 --> 00:52:29,565
But still, thank you so much.

922
00:52:32,344 --> 00:52:33,554
Well...

923
00:52:34,815 --> 00:52:38,135
It did start with the baby,

924
00:52:38,885 --> 00:52:40,545
but to tell you the truth...

925
00:52:42,914 --> 00:52:45,264
- Ms. Oh. - Yes?

926
00:52:46,324 --> 00:52:48,224
I think I...

927
00:52:49,295 --> 00:52:51,385
Oh, you're still here.

928
00:52:52,094 --> 00:52:54,094
- Here, take this. - What is this?

929
00:52:54,094 --> 00:52:55,294
Rice punch.

930
00:52:55,295 --> 00:52:58,595
I made it myself because Min Ji loves it.

931
00:52:58,605 --> 00:53:01,125
Keep it in the fridge so you can drink it cold.

932
00:53:01,135 --> 00:53:03,275
You don't have to give me anything.

933
00:53:03,635 --> 00:53:04,675
Take it.

934
00:53:07,074 --> 00:53:09,054
Thank you. I know I'll enjoy this.

935
00:53:09,375 --> 00:53:10,635
Please cheer up.

936
00:53:10,644 --> 00:53:13,184
Lots of good things will happen from now on.

937
00:53:13,585 --> 00:53:15,905
Thank you for coming all the way here.

938
00:53:16,014 --> 00:53:18,864
You must be busy. I'm sorry for taking your time.

939
00:53:20,284 --> 00:53:22,854
I should thank your boyfriend too. Thank you.

940
00:53:22,855 --> 00:53:24,885
Oh, I'm...

941
00:53:26,164 --> 00:53:28,074
I'm not her boyfriend.

942
00:54:32,864 --> 00:54:35,194
Eun Ran, this is for you.

943
00:54:35,195 --> 00:54:37,385
I saw these flowers on my way here, and they reminded me of you.

944
00:54:38,835 --> 00:54:41,495
My gosh, thank you. They're beautiful.

945
00:54:41,505 --> 00:54:43,065
- Do you like them? - Yes.

946
00:54:48,545 --> 00:54:49,945
Hello.

947
00:54:51,085 --> 00:54:54,145
- Hello. - Oh, what brings you by?

948
00:54:54,155 --> 00:54:56,005
I'm here to see you, Gwi Nyeo.

949
00:54:56,014 --> 00:54:57,824
How do you know my name?

950
00:54:57,824 --> 00:55:00,594
People at the Senior Welfare Center told me.

951
00:55:00,655 --> 00:55:01,715
I see.

952
00:55:02,094 --> 00:55:03,694
I came to return this to you.

953
00:55:03,695 --> 00:55:04,985
I see.

954
00:55:06,625 --> 00:55:08,735
And here. Take this.

955
00:55:08,894 --> 00:55:10,264
What is this?

956
00:55:10,264 --> 00:55:12,404
Aren't the roses so beautiful?

957
00:55:12,405 --> 00:55:13,725
Why are you giving me flowers?

958
00:55:13,735 --> 00:55:17,235
Men give women flowers when they want to impress them.

959
00:55:18,074 --> 00:55:21,054
I wanted to impress you.

960
00:55:25,644 --> 00:55:28,054
My gosh. What's wrong, Gwi Nyeo?

961
00:55:28,085 --> 00:55:31,655
In my 69 years of life as a woman,

962
00:55:33,385 --> 00:55:35,755
no one has given me flowers before.

963
00:55:38,394 --> 00:55:40,304
I'm so glad I brought them.

964
00:55:55,514 --> 00:55:56,874
How beautiful.

965
00:55:56,875 --> 00:55:59,985
- I'm home. - Hey, you.

966
00:56:00,385 --> 00:56:02,585
What? What's with all the flowers?

967
00:56:02,985 --> 00:56:04,215
Did you go to the flower market today?

968
00:56:04,224 --> 00:56:06,584
A man gave me these flowers.

969
00:56:06,585 --> 00:56:08,545
Really? What about you, Grandma?

970
00:56:08,554 --> 00:56:11,364
Same here. Someone gave them to me as a gift.

971
00:56:11,494 --> 00:56:13,094
What? Who?

972
00:56:13,094 --> 00:56:14,864
A man!

973
00:56:15,335 --> 00:56:17,195
Woo Ri, your grandma's got a boyfriend.

974
00:56:17,335 --> 00:56:19,195
Really? Who?

975
00:56:19,434 --> 00:56:20,564
You don't know him.

976
00:56:20,565 --> 00:56:22,375
A gentleman I met at the Senior Welfare Center.

977
00:56:34,114 --> 00:56:36,684
I'll give you a ride when you need to go anywhere because of the baby.

978
00:56:36,815 --> 00:56:39,775
"No, don't worry. It's okay." Don't say stuff like that.

979
00:56:40,554 --> 00:56:41,594
Okay.

980
00:56:42,994 --> 00:56:44,724
By the way, why did you pull over?

981
00:56:44,724 --> 00:56:47,394
I just thought that the sunset looked so beautiful.

982
00:56:47,695 --> 00:56:49,355
Let's get out and admire it just for a minute.

983
00:56:51,405 --> 00:56:52,405
But...

984
00:57:16,525 --> 00:57:18,385
Ms. Oh, I've been meaning to tell you something...

985
00:57:19,065 --> 00:57:22,335
but couldn't find the right time to tell you.

986
00:57:22,764 --> 00:57:23,934
What is it?

987
00:57:26,105 --> 00:57:27,735
I think I...

988
00:57:38,085 --> 00:57:40,135
Actually, never mind.

989
00:57:40,344 --> 00:57:42,284
I just realized there was something more important.

990
00:57:43,355 --> 00:57:46,255
Doing my best as the father of the baby.

991
00:57:48,195 --> 00:57:50,525
Let's be there for each other, okay?

992
00:57:50,695 --> 00:57:51,755
Okay.

993
00:58:34,304 --> 00:58:36,204
Is this...

994
00:58:37,905 --> 00:58:39,135
a dream?

995
00:59:24,385 --> 00:59:26,045
Then we're a couple now.

996
00:59:26,054 --> 00:59:28,454
Can I take some time and think about it?

997
00:59:28,554 --> 00:59:29,724
I miss her.

998
00:59:29,724 --> 00:59:31,464
I'm against them dating.

999
00:59:31,465 --> 00:59:34,725
Everything's fine when it's just the two of us.

1000
00:59:34,735 --> 00:59:38,225
I think this is my first time introducing my boyfriend to my mom.

1001
00:59:38,235 --> 00:59:40,025
Father, the lady you're seeing is...

1002
00:59:40,034 --> 00:59:42,104
I don't have to call you "Ms. Oh" anymore, right?

1003
00:59:42,105 --> 00:59:44,095
Because I like you.

1004
00:59:44,105 --> 00:59:46,065
Who likes whom?

1005
00:59:46,074 --> 00:59:47,544
I'll secure evidence and find out...

1006
00:59:47,545 --> 00:59:49,005
what Chairman Kim did at the hospital.

1007
00:59:49,014 --> 00:59:51,784
They'll break up if the baby is gone, right?
