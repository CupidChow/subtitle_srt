1
00:00:18,958 --> 00:00:20,129
Sir.

2
00:00:20,398 --> 00:00:22,998
Were you at a beach by the east sea?

3
00:00:23,669 --> 00:00:24,828
What?

4
00:00:26,269 --> 00:00:27,739
We met, didn't we?

5
00:00:35,578 --> 00:00:36,909
What got into you?

6
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:40,319
She never went.

7
00:00:41,078 --> 00:00:43,289
She's never been to the east sea.

8
00:00:47,858 --> 00:00:50,459
You didn't go to the east sea
on a pre-graduation trip?

9
00:00:50,929 --> 00:00:52,298
She didn't.

10
00:00:52,759 --> 00:00:55,029
You met so many women
that you got confused.

11
00:00:55,569 --> 00:00:58,268
Woo ri, you never went, did you?

12
00:00:58,539 --> 00:00:59,699
What?

13
00:01:00,498 --> 00:01:01,869
Sorry to keep you waiting.

14
00:01:04,938 --> 00:01:06,877
Here's the highlight of
the east sea course,

15
00:01:06,878 --> 00:01:08,508
plump red snow crab.

16
00:01:08,509 --> 00:01:09,978
It looks delicious.

17
00:01:09,979 --> 00:01:12,419
The squid came in just today.

18
00:01:12,748 --> 00:01:14,649
The best seafood comes
from the east sea.

19
00:01:14,878 --> 00:01:18,289
I'm from there, so I think
highly of the east sea.

20
00:01:18,619 --> 00:01:21,158
Don't you all love the east sea?

21
00:01:21,658 --> 00:01:22,858
Right?

22
00:01:28,128 --> 00:01:29,529
I don't.

23
00:01:30,529 --> 00:01:32,238
I don't like the east sea.

24
00:01:33,238 --> 00:01:34,598
You don't?

25
00:01:39,378 --> 00:01:41,649
What was that about?
You met her before?

26
00:01:43,109 --> 00:01:44,248
A few years back.

27
00:01:45,478 --> 00:01:47,179
I knew she seemed familiar.

28
00:01:48,589 --> 00:01:49,787
What about it?

29
00:01:49,788 --> 00:01:51,489
Did something happen when you met?

30
00:01:51,918 --> 00:01:53,089
Not much.

31
00:01:55,559 --> 00:01:57,529
Then why did she deny it?

32
00:01:59,299 --> 00:02:01,359
It's weird that we met again.

33
00:02:02,829 --> 00:02:06,038
Is this the string of fate
people often talk about?

34
00:02:09,408 --> 00:02:11,038
What? What did you say?

35
00:02:11,209 --> 00:02:13,639
- What?
- You and woo ri are fated?

36
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:15,549
That's not what I meant.

37
00:02:16,149 --> 00:02:18,417
As if it's not. I heard you.

38
00:02:18,418 --> 00:02:20,748
No. You misheard me.

39
00:02:25,288 --> 00:02:26,519
I'm sorry.

40
00:02:27,688 --> 00:02:28,958
You don't have to be.

41
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:31,128
I didn't think he'd remember.

42
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:35,168
I don't mind it at all.

43
00:02:41,139 --> 00:02:42,438
I'm sorry.

44
00:02:48,679 --> 00:02:49,809
Sit up.

45
00:02:52,549 --> 00:02:53,818
It's fine.

46
00:03:06,698 --> 00:03:07,828
Sorry.

47
00:03:07,829 --> 00:03:09,228
We held hands for too long.

48
00:03:10,769 --> 00:03:11,868
Let's pray later.

49
00:03:11,869 --> 00:03:13,498
Choi sung il's kissing!

50
00:03:29,619 --> 00:03:30,818
Was it you?

51
00:03:32,489 --> 00:03:33,619
Sorry, mom.

52
00:03:33,859 --> 00:03:35,488
I found out only recently.

53
00:03:35,489 --> 00:03:36,688
He looks different now.

54
00:03:36,989 --> 00:03:38,458
Was it you?

55
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:40,597
What? Oh, yes. Yes, it's me.

56
00:03:40,598 --> 00:03:42,628
Are you the good-for-nothing punk?

57
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:43,968
Do you know...

58
00:03:44,269 --> 00:03:45,537
My eun ran...

59
00:03:45,538 --> 00:03:46,937
- Suffered so much...
- Ma'am!

60
00:03:46,938 --> 00:03:48,067
Because of you?

61
00:03:48,068 --> 00:03:49,139
Do you?

62
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:50,768
Will you stop it?

63
00:03:50,769 --> 00:03:52,477
He didn't even know about woo ri.

64
00:03:52,478 --> 00:03:53,939
I'm sorry, ma'am.

65
00:03:54,038 --> 00:03:57,407
I will be a good father from now on.

66
00:03:57,408 --> 00:03:58,548
You should be!

67
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,548
Make up for what my daughter
and granddaughter lost out on!

68
00:04:01,718 --> 00:04:02,788
But...

69
00:04:03,718 --> 00:04:05,488
I can't tell woo ri.

70
00:04:06,118 --> 00:04:07,959
- Why not?
- I lost the opportunity to.

71
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:11,058
Woo ri grew up thinking
her dad was dead.

72
00:04:11,228 --> 00:04:13,298
I can't tell her I lied
to her all her life.

73
00:04:13,459 --> 00:04:14,498
How shocked would she be...

74
00:04:14,499 --> 00:04:16,868
If she found out that
sung il was her dad?

75
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:18,537
She's stressed out already.

76
00:04:18,538 --> 00:04:19,699
Then what?

77
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:21,268
You won't tell her?

78
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:22,439
I should.

79
00:04:23,009 --> 00:04:24,538
I'm just waiting for the right time.

80
00:04:27,009 --> 00:04:29,009
I liked you so much.

81
00:04:29,808 --> 00:04:31,949
I watched all of your dramas.

82
00:04:32,249 --> 00:04:33,348
And you...

83
00:04:33,749 --> 00:04:35,348
You're my son-in-law?

84
00:04:35,618 --> 00:04:37,589
Mom? He's not your son-in-law.

85
00:04:38,389 --> 00:04:39,918
He's just woo ri's dad.

86
00:04:40,589 --> 00:04:42,228
- Yes.
- Is that how it is?

87
00:04:42,928 --> 00:04:44,129
Then...

88
00:04:44,488 --> 00:04:46,158
Why were you stuck together?

89
00:04:47,899 --> 00:04:48,999
That was...

90
00:04:49,129 --> 00:04:50,268
- An accident.
- Yes.

91
00:04:50,269 --> 00:04:51,498
You fools.

92
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:54,037
You're that much older but
you still haven't grown up?

93
00:04:54,038 --> 00:04:55,667
- Oh, gosh, no!
- Mom, no!

94
00:04:55,668 --> 00:04:57,008
- Please don't.
- Let go of me.

95
00:04:57,009 --> 00:04:58,808
Just not my face, please.

96
00:05:02,579 --> 00:05:03,749
When did you come in?

97
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:08,148
Hey, you're... byeon Jin.

98
00:05:08,149 --> 00:05:09,319
Don't call him that.

99
00:05:09,548 --> 00:05:11,959
Greet him properly. He's a CEO.

100
00:05:12,918 --> 00:05:15,259
You are? A CEO? Of what company?

101
00:05:18,389 --> 00:05:21,428
I'm jeon byeon Jin, CEO
of diamond cosmetics.

102
00:05:29,108 --> 00:05:30,807
- Father?
- I told you to...

103
00:05:30,808 --> 00:05:32,408
Focus on the hospital.

104
00:05:32,808 --> 00:05:34,307
You said you'd work on cosmetics too,

105
00:05:34,308 --> 00:05:37,009
but you ruined an event,

106
00:05:37,108 --> 00:05:39,249
someone died, and it was on the news.

107
00:05:39,678 --> 00:05:41,319
Hospital sales plummeted.

108
00:05:41,449 --> 00:05:45,318
Still, you can't replace a CEO so
fast, without a board meeting.

109
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:46,658
As of today, he's the CEO.

110
00:05:47,158 --> 00:05:48,829
You're an executive director.

111
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:53,098
Mr. Kim.

112
00:05:53,928 --> 00:05:55,269
I hope we get along.

113
00:05:59,139 --> 00:06:01,667
Father, you're taking
this prank too far.

114
00:06:01,668 --> 00:06:03,139
- It's not a prank.
- What?

115
00:06:03,368 --> 00:06:05,037
It's not, and you
really want a new CEO?

116
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:06,879
When I'm right here? I'm the CEO.

117
00:06:06,939 --> 00:06:08,948
Do you still think this is a game?

118
00:06:08,949 --> 00:06:11,917
Where you get what you
want by pleading?

119
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:13,617
I built up the hospital from scratch!

120
00:06:13,618 --> 00:06:15,649
You didn't build up anything!

121
00:06:17,048 --> 00:06:18,688
Mom opened the hospital.

122
00:06:18,689 --> 00:06:21,188
If it hadn't been for me, it
would still be a small clinic.

123
00:06:21,189 --> 00:06:23,928
I turned it into a
conglomerate, so it's mine!

124
00:06:27,529 --> 00:06:29,628
I have ideas too. Give me some time.

125
00:06:29,629 --> 00:06:31,298
On Monday, jeon byeon Jin...

126
00:06:32,168 --> 00:06:33,668
Will give a presentation
on entering China.

127
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:35,839
I offered him a position
in the hospital,

128
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,569
but he fancied being
the CEO of cosmetics.

129
00:06:37,968 --> 00:06:39,238
Are you interested?

130
00:06:39,608 --> 00:06:41,839
Good! Then we'll discuss it then.

131
00:06:42,249 --> 00:06:44,908
If you have an idea to
change my mind, even better.

132
00:06:46,779 --> 00:06:47,949
Jeon byeon Jin?

133
00:06:50,048 --> 00:06:51,348
What's that punk doing here?

134
00:06:52,488 --> 00:06:54,319
Why are you CEO?

135
00:06:54,658 --> 00:06:56,427
I'm CEO as of today.

136
00:06:56,428 --> 00:06:57,858
Your husband's an executive director.

137
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:01,098
Are you...

138
00:07:01,358 --> 00:07:03,699
Doing this to get back at me?

139
00:07:06,668 --> 00:07:08,738
You're getting ahead of yourself.

140
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:11,939
I'm no longer the loser who
tried to win you back.

141
00:07:28,858 --> 00:07:31,759
Didn't you ditch me for Raphael
because he was the chairman's son?

142
00:07:32,158 --> 00:07:33,629
That's nonsense!

143
00:07:33,699 --> 00:07:34,959
Things will get interesting.

144
00:07:35,529 --> 00:07:38,899
If I take over diamond cosmetics
and the hospital too,

145
00:07:39,168 --> 00:07:41,468
I wonder what look you'll
have on your face then.

146
00:07:42,509 --> 00:07:43,709
Dream on.

147
00:07:51,548 --> 00:07:52,648
Shall we check it out?

148
00:07:52,649 --> 00:07:53,749
- Excuse me.
- Okay.

149
00:07:54,478 --> 00:07:56,019
Did you drive?

150
00:07:56,118 --> 00:07:57,249
Shall I give you a ride?

151
00:07:59,988 --> 00:08:02,358
Is it you or me? Shall we bet?

152
00:08:03,058 --> 00:08:04,829
He's not in your age range.

153
00:08:09,369 --> 00:08:11,828
Sorry, but I have a boyfriend.

154
00:08:12,869 --> 00:08:14,067
And a baby.

155
00:08:14,068 --> 00:08:15,139
Excuse me.

156
00:08:15,969 --> 00:08:17,168
I asked your sister.

157
00:08:19,338 --> 00:08:20,438
See?

158
00:08:21,979 --> 00:08:23,748
I'm her mom...

159
00:08:23,749 --> 00:08:25,048
And soon-to-be grandma.

160
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,749
You're both great liars.

161
00:08:29,149 --> 00:08:30,349
Goodbye.

162
00:08:35,019 --> 00:08:37,058
Should we have let him give us a ride?

163
00:08:37,229 --> 00:08:38,999
Do you want to be like that?

164
00:08:39,729 --> 00:08:41,957
Why did you buy so much stuff?

165
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:43,769
What kind of food are you packing?

166
00:08:44,269 --> 00:08:47,639
Stuff keeps happening that I have
to apologize to Kang jae for.

167
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:51,269
I get it. He's a Buddhist Saint.

168
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:52,878
"Buddhist Saint"?

169
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:54,508
He goes to church.

170
00:08:54,509 --> 00:08:55,978
Think about it.

171
00:08:55,979 --> 00:08:58,548
Would it be easy to date a woman
carrying another man's baby?

172
00:08:59,649 --> 00:09:02,749
You're not Michael and
Jane who live in Florida.

173
00:09:02,818 --> 00:09:05,249
Do you think Koreans could accept this?

174
00:09:05,558 --> 00:09:06,859
I know.

175
00:09:07,318 --> 00:09:09,958
That's why I feel terrible
and grateful to Kang jae.

176
00:09:10,889 --> 00:09:13,359
He might as well be a living Buddha.

177
00:09:14,129 --> 00:09:15,398
Amen.

178
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:17,529
I can't say he's Jesus, can I?

179
00:09:21,668 --> 00:09:24,609
I don't get why there
are so many problems.

180
00:09:26,808 --> 00:09:28,009
Come on.

181
00:09:28,239 --> 00:09:30,879
Try to think on the bright side.

182
00:09:31,379 --> 00:09:32,578
Mom.

183
00:09:32,779 --> 00:09:35,379
I'm a virgin who got pregnant
because a doctor messed up.

184
00:09:35,749 --> 00:09:37,687
I confessed to being pregnant
when Kang jae proposed,

185
00:09:37,688 --> 00:09:38,958
and the baby's dad is...

186
00:09:42,058 --> 00:09:43,758
It's no small deal for me,

187
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:46,298
and it's a lot for the
people around me to take in.

188
00:09:46,629 --> 00:09:48,229
So what bright side are
you talking about?

189
00:09:49,269 --> 00:09:52,639
Oh. You don't have to
save yourself anymore.

190
00:09:52,869 --> 00:09:55,238
- What do you mean?
- Think about it.

191
00:09:55,239 --> 00:09:57,368
What saving is there to do
if you're already pregnant?

192
00:09:57,369 --> 00:09:59,338
You don't need to stay a virgin.

193
00:09:59,438 --> 00:10:01,078
People would laugh if they heard.

194
00:10:01,408 --> 00:10:04,708
Even if you're pregnant, if
you're careful, you can have fun.

195
00:10:05,548 --> 00:10:07,279
Don't be silly, mom.

196
00:10:13,158 --> 00:10:15,389
Wow. It's so pretty.

197
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:17,458
Eat the food already.

198
00:10:17,489 --> 00:10:19,058
I'll enjoy it. Thank you.

199
00:10:21,259 --> 00:10:22,298
Ta-da.

200
00:10:22,999 --> 00:10:24,328
It's too cute.

201
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:30,438
Kang jae. Did you watch "home alone"?

202
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:32,739
Yes. Every Christmas.

203
00:10:33,509 --> 00:10:34,908
The kid says...

204
00:10:35,379 --> 00:10:37,748
He didn't go skating
to save his skates,

205
00:10:37,749 --> 00:10:39,979
but then he grew out of them.

206
00:10:43,948 --> 00:10:45,719
That's how I feel right now.

207
00:10:45,989 --> 00:10:47,188
What do you mean?

208
00:10:48,759 --> 00:10:51,828
I don't get why I bothered
to save myself for marriage.

209
00:10:53,599 --> 00:10:56,899
Why... what are you saying, woo ri?

210
00:10:57,729 --> 00:11:01,139
No, I'm fine. I'll think
on the bright side.

211
00:11:02,038 --> 00:11:04,938
Right? That's my woo ri.

212
00:11:30,469 --> 00:11:32,739
So, woo ri.

213
00:11:33,599 --> 00:11:34,639
What?

214
00:11:34,899 --> 00:11:35,969
This.

215
00:11:39,338 --> 00:11:41,739
Oh, gosh. Sorry.

216
00:11:43,879 --> 00:11:46,349
You have something on there.

217
00:11:49,048 --> 00:11:50,418
I should go.

218
00:11:50,749 --> 00:11:52,118
You're leaving? Just like that?

219
00:11:52,119 --> 00:11:54,489
Bye. See you.

220
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:57,788
Pregnancy causes increased oestrogen,
heightening your sex drive. Shoot.

221
00:11:59,029 --> 00:12:00,099
An Adam's apple?

222
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:03,898
Isn't it weird to get turned
on by someone's Adam's apple?

223
00:12:03,899 --> 00:12:06,068
No. That's cool.

224
00:12:06,469 --> 00:12:08,437
There are people who
like Adam's apples?

225
00:12:08,438 --> 00:12:09,468
Or course.

226
00:12:09,469 --> 00:12:11,739
It's something only men have.

227
00:12:11,869 --> 00:12:14,178
Nice... the Adam's apple...

228
00:12:15,139 --> 00:12:16,678
It's kind of sexy.

229
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,749
Oh, it is. Thank goodness.

230
00:12:20,849 --> 00:12:23,249
Then how do we seduce na beom in?

231
00:12:23,818 --> 00:12:25,958
- Well.
- I mean...

232
00:12:26,259 --> 00:12:28,057
She has to...

233
00:12:28,058 --> 00:12:30,888
Seduce a man who isn't interested.

234
00:12:30,889 --> 00:12:32,729
Sex appeal.

235
00:12:33,338 --> 00:12:34,906
Yes, that.

236
00:12:34,907 --> 00:12:37,347
How can you not even
say the word "sex"?

237
00:12:37,348 --> 00:12:40,017
Listen to me. Here's the basic concept.

238
00:12:40,117 --> 00:12:43,687
It may be hard to find
true love with a man.

239
00:12:43,688 --> 00:12:46,117
But all you want is a physical tryst.

240
00:12:46,887 --> 00:12:50,828
A woman can get what she wants
if she just sets her mind to it.

241
00:12:50,987 --> 00:12:53,497
- How?
- Text a man three words.

242
00:12:53,897 --> 00:12:55,468
"Let's sleep together."

243
00:12:55,828 --> 00:12:59,197
Even a man in busan will take a
taxi to your door in three hours.

244
00:12:59,198 --> 00:13:01,967
That's way too direct.

245
00:13:01,968 --> 00:13:05,377
Well, of course, there are
more complicated ways.

246
00:13:06,137 --> 00:13:07,938
Shall I share my foolproof strategy?

247
00:13:08,308 --> 00:13:09,308
Yes.

248
00:13:12,948 --> 00:13:15,117
Assault him in this
order, nose, eyes, skin.

249
00:13:15,318 --> 00:13:16,387
First, attack his nose.

250
00:13:16,948 --> 00:13:19,657
Wear a subtle perfume.

251
00:13:19,858 --> 00:13:22,687
Don't drench yourself so you
smell from a mile away.

252
00:13:22,688 --> 00:13:25,698
He doesn't smell anything at
first, but when he gets close...

253
00:13:26,198 --> 00:13:28,527
And smells a subtle perfume,

254
00:13:28,897 --> 00:13:30,666
he'll wonder what it is.

255
00:13:30,667 --> 00:13:33,798
He'll sniff around to see what
it is and where it's from.

256
00:13:34,468 --> 00:13:36,867
Okay, what's the second one?

257
00:13:37,968 --> 00:13:40,537
Flip your hair and show
the side of your neck.

258
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:43,747
This is something I
don't tell just anyone.

259
00:13:44,548 --> 00:13:45,647
I'll tell just you.

260
00:13:46,718 --> 00:13:49,147
Cross your arms like this.

261
00:13:49,287 --> 00:13:52,487
Pull up your boobs and be sure
to put your soul into it.

262
00:13:53,157 --> 00:13:54,387
Just like this.

263
00:13:54,657 --> 00:13:55,828
Then lean in like this with this gaze.

264
00:14:00,858 --> 00:14:03,767
Number three, skin.

265
00:14:06,237 --> 00:14:07,467
This is confirmation.

266
00:14:07,468 --> 00:14:08,906
We just linked arms.

267
00:14:08,907 --> 00:14:10,167
It's not just that.

268
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:15,394
That's gross!

269
00:14:16,535 --> 00:14:19,834
That's the touchy-feely part. Okay?

270
00:14:20,405 --> 00:14:22,574
Are you sure about this?
Taken from experience?

271
00:14:23,535 --> 00:14:24,876
Put that in the script.

272
00:14:26,844 --> 00:14:29,174
Just type what I said.

273
00:14:29,745 --> 00:14:32,584
I'll work on the next plot line.

274
00:14:32,714 --> 00:14:34,714
Kang jae. Where are you going?

275
00:14:35,655 --> 00:14:37,554
To ask Lee ma ri to come in.

276
00:14:38,324 --> 00:14:39,924
Is that why you're so glum?

277
00:14:41,054 --> 00:14:43,654
Even I think it's not her.

278
00:14:43,655 --> 00:14:45,025
She has an alibi.

279
00:14:45,395 --> 00:14:47,094
It's chairman Kim.

280
00:14:47,694 --> 00:14:49,064
Do you have proof?

281
00:14:49,735 --> 00:14:51,035
It's a detective's hunch.

282
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:54,574
Didn't you see me get
chewed out for saying that?

283
00:14:55,035 --> 00:14:56,775
I can't back it up.

284
00:14:58,375 --> 00:15:00,474
I wish we could find
the camera hard drive.

285
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:03,115
- I'll keep looking.
- Don't bother.

286
00:15:03,544 --> 00:15:06,714
How can we find something that
wasn't even in the trash?

287
00:15:07,855 --> 00:15:08,954
I have to go.

288
00:15:11,054 --> 00:15:12,255
Hello.

289
00:15:12,885 --> 00:15:15,525
Thank you for visiting our hospital.

290
00:15:18,224 --> 00:15:19,525
What are you doing?

291
00:15:19,964 --> 00:15:21,495
What if someone sees?

292
00:15:22,434 --> 00:15:24,964
You need to come in tomorrow.

293
00:15:26,135 --> 00:15:27,573
Must you do this?

294
00:15:27,574 --> 00:15:29,505
You must agree to the investigation.

295
00:15:29,704 --> 00:15:31,004
There's no evidence.

296
00:15:31,005 --> 00:15:33,104
Find something, then.

297
00:15:33,105 --> 00:15:35,444
You have until tomorrow
before I must come in.

298
00:15:40,855 --> 00:15:43,214
Where's the waste from
diamond hospital?

299
00:15:43,855 --> 00:15:46,084
The police asked the exact same thing.

300
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:48,625
We don't know what hospital it is from.

301
00:15:49,054 --> 00:15:50,355
What are you looking for?

302
00:15:50,655 --> 00:15:52,865
It's a violent crimes case,
and I'm in need of evidence.

303
00:15:54,194 --> 00:15:57,665
We burn everything once a week,
so it could still be here.

304
00:15:58,765 --> 00:16:00,535
You can't look in there.

305
00:16:00,905 --> 00:16:03,834
Used syringes, bloody gauze,
there are all sorts of stuff.

306
00:16:04,474 --> 00:16:06,375
You could catch a lot
of things from it.

307
00:16:06,544 --> 00:16:08,015
It's not safe.

308
00:16:08,474 --> 00:16:11,184
If it's that kind of waste...

309
00:16:12,584 --> 00:16:14,584
I'm looking for a hard disk this big.

310
00:16:15,355 --> 00:16:16,785
Can I take a look?

311
00:16:25,924 --> 00:16:28,394
Who gave you permission to go in there?

312
00:16:28,395 --> 00:16:30,364
- Get out! It's not safe!
- Okay!

313
00:16:30,365 --> 00:16:32,304
Are you out of your mind?

314
00:16:32,564 --> 00:16:34,673
- I said to get out!
- Okay, I'm coming.

315
00:16:34,674 --> 00:16:35,934
I'm done looking.

316
00:16:38,505 --> 00:16:41,115
Will you get out already?

317
00:16:41,545 --> 00:16:42,575
Hang on.

318
00:16:59,224 --> 00:17:00,694
Do your best work.

319
00:17:02,694 --> 00:17:04,734
Kang jae. How does the drive look?

320
00:17:05,234 --> 00:17:08,105
It is the hard disk with footage
from the elevator cameras.

321
00:17:08,274 --> 00:17:10,804
Some data was lost, and it
was physically damaged,

322
00:17:10,805 --> 00:17:11,874
so it'll take a while.

323
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:13,044
Can it be restored?

324
00:17:13,045 --> 00:17:16,014
He said he'd do his best.
So let's wait and see.

325
00:17:17,744 --> 00:17:20,385
If we can get the files...

326
00:17:21,355 --> 00:17:23,684
Well done, Kang jae.

327
00:17:26,585 --> 00:17:28,324
Aren't you drinking too much?

328
00:17:28,325 --> 00:17:30,694
Let her be. She's off the clock.

329
00:17:30,865 --> 00:17:32,023
I'll drive today.

330
00:17:32,024 --> 00:17:34,165
You're the best, Kang jae.

331
00:17:34,534 --> 00:17:35,963
You should learn from him.

332
00:17:35,964 --> 00:17:39,304
What more must I learn? I
went to graduate school.

333
00:17:39,305 --> 00:17:42,504
Learn to be warm and caring
to your junior officers.

334
00:17:44,345 --> 00:17:45,845
I might as well say it.

335
00:17:46,974 --> 00:17:50,915
I volunteered to join violent
crimes because of you.

336
00:17:51,244 --> 00:17:53,684
Because of me? Why?

337
00:17:53,784 --> 00:17:57,085
I watched you when I was in traffic,

338
00:17:58,684 --> 00:18:01,825
and you looked like a wild stallion.

339
00:18:03,724 --> 00:18:06,325
You didn't look that well groomed,

340
00:18:06,924 --> 00:18:08,595
but your eyes shone brightly.

341
00:18:09,395 --> 00:18:12,034
"Yes. I want to be a
detective like that."

342
00:18:12,934 --> 00:18:15,174
"Not a civil servant that goes
through parking tickets."

343
00:18:15,974 --> 00:18:17,434
"Let's become a detective."

344
00:18:17,845 --> 00:18:19,974
You ruined her life.

345
00:18:20,545 --> 00:18:22,674
My life is not ruined.

346
00:18:23,214 --> 00:18:24,315
Oh, my head's ringing.

347
00:18:24,915 --> 00:18:25,984
What?

348
00:18:26,545 --> 00:18:29,014
It must be nice to be you.
You're so popular.

349
00:18:29,754 --> 00:18:32,125
Look at that grin. Enjoy
it while you can.

350
00:18:32,454 --> 00:18:34,125
You'll be my age soon.

351
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:38,263
Captain. Did I tell you why
I joined violent crimes?

352
00:18:38,264 --> 00:18:40,594
- I don't know.
- That time.

353
00:18:40,595 --> 00:18:42,764
You were the team's ace.

354
00:18:43,365 --> 00:18:45,665
I thought you were a wild stallion.

355
00:18:46,565 --> 00:18:49,605
I joined the team to be like you.

356
00:18:51,674 --> 00:18:52,774
It's yours.

357
00:18:53,004 --> 00:18:55,315
I was saved by the bell.

358
00:18:58,915 --> 00:19:00,953
If you sleep like that...

359
00:19:00,954 --> 00:19:03,284
You'll catch a cold.

360
00:19:12,994 --> 00:19:15,694
Yes, sure. Coming right up.

361
00:19:15,835 --> 00:19:17,493
- Yes?
- Hurry up.

362
00:19:17,494 --> 00:19:19,904
Well done, son.

363
00:19:19,905 --> 00:19:21,534
Keep going.

364
00:19:23,204 --> 00:19:26,105
Oh, did you? Good boy.

365
00:19:26,645 --> 00:19:28,075
Well done.

366
00:19:37,085 --> 00:19:38,184
Hey.

367
00:19:38,784 --> 00:19:40,854
You should go behind and
find out the escape route.

368
00:19:40,855 --> 00:19:41,894
I'll pick the lock and go in.

369
00:19:41,895 --> 00:19:42,994
You punk.

370
00:19:43,855 --> 00:19:45,365
I'm going in first.

371
00:19:45,964 --> 00:19:48,734
Kang jae, be careful.

372
00:19:51,704 --> 00:19:52,904
Wake up!

373
00:19:52,905 --> 00:19:55,635
Jun suk.

374
00:19:57,135 --> 00:19:58,645
Jun suk!

375
00:19:59,444 --> 00:20:01,014
Jun suk! Wake up.

376
00:20:05,385 --> 00:20:07,514
Jun suk.

377
00:20:11,385 --> 00:20:12,784
Chairman Kim!

378
00:20:13,924 --> 00:20:16,295
Chairman Kim!

379
00:20:32,704 --> 00:20:33,944
Don't cry.

380
00:20:37,984 --> 00:20:39,415
It's all right.

381
00:20:41,315 --> 00:20:42,484
Kang jae.

382
00:20:44,085 --> 00:20:46,454
Salute. Detective Lee, you're here.

383
00:20:46,754 --> 00:20:47,924
Hello, Ms. yu.

384
00:20:48,424 --> 00:20:50,625
Would you like to have dinner with us?

385
00:20:51,494 --> 00:20:54,665
There's a struggle between the one
who invited and the one who didn't.

386
00:20:55,835 --> 00:20:58,203
Ye ri, we'll just have
dinner, the two of us.

387
00:20:58,204 --> 00:21:00,135
All right, I'll go away.
Have fun you two.

388
00:21:00,734 --> 00:21:02,204
You can come with us...

389
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:03,605
Bye.

390
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:06,674
She can really come with us.

391
00:21:24,694 --> 00:21:26,424
I thought I was dying of thirst.

392
00:21:27,165 --> 00:21:28,365
You need to eat, don't you?

393
00:21:29,534 --> 00:21:31,334
What?

394
00:21:31,335 --> 00:21:32,635
Let's go eat dinner.

395
00:21:32,865 --> 00:21:34,234
Where shall we go? What
would you like to eat?

396
00:21:38,004 --> 00:21:40,375
Can we skip our regular place...

397
00:21:42,014 --> 00:21:44,013
And go to your place?

398
00:21:44,014 --> 00:21:45,284
My place? All of a sudden?

399
00:21:47,714 --> 00:21:50,055
You've never been to my place.

400
00:21:51,014 --> 00:21:53,183
Wait, there's nothing
to eat in my place.

401
00:21:53,184 --> 00:21:54,253
We can order in.

402
00:21:54,254 --> 00:21:55,724
We can't have delivery food.

403
00:21:58,865 --> 00:22:00,365
I have some clams at home.

404
00:22:00,825 --> 00:22:02,034
Should I make you some pasta?

405
00:22:02,295 --> 00:22:03,394
Yes.

406
00:22:03,395 --> 00:22:06,263
Gosh, I don't think that's going
to work. It's a mess at home.

407
00:22:06,264 --> 00:22:07,405
Let's go next time.

408
00:22:07,565 --> 00:22:08,605
It's okay.

409
00:22:09,504 --> 00:22:11,774
What is woo ri?

410
00:22:17,145 --> 00:22:19,444
How's it going, Kang jae?

411
00:22:19,545 --> 00:22:20,615
Do you want me to help you?

412
00:22:20,784 --> 00:22:22,184
Go and sit down.

413
00:22:24,315 --> 00:22:25,453
First, scent.

414
00:22:25,454 --> 00:22:27,385
Gently wear perfume.

415
00:22:30,994 --> 00:22:32,095
Kang jae,

416
00:22:32,865 --> 00:22:34,694
- can't you smell something?
- What?

417
00:22:37,335 --> 00:22:38,434
I'm sorry.

418
00:22:38,704 --> 00:22:41,034
I told you my place was a mess and
that we should come next time.

419
00:22:44,875 --> 00:22:46,943
I smell my burning heart.

420
00:22:46,944 --> 00:22:48,514
What? Something's burning?

421
00:22:52,645 --> 00:22:53,784
Is it burnt?

422
00:22:54,815 --> 00:22:55,915
Never mind.

423
00:22:56,415 --> 00:22:57,615
I'll sit over there.

424
00:22:58,085 --> 00:22:59,484
Right. I'll be there soon.

425
00:23:05,065 --> 00:23:06,164
Second, sight.

426
00:23:06,165 --> 00:23:07,595
Push up everything you can.

427
00:23:09,934 --> 00:23:11,264
Kang jae.

428
00:23:11,464 --> 00:23:12,504
Yes?

429
00:23:17,105 --> 00:23:19,075
- Kang jae.
- Right, I'm almost done.

430
00:23:21,615 --> 00:23:23,744
Woo ri, are you all right?

431
00:23:26,315 --> 00:23:27,645
- Get up. Are you okay?
- Yes.

432
00:23:29,315 --> 00:23:30,355
Are you hurt?

433
00:23:32,555 --> 00:23:33,885
This is a foldable table.

434
00:23:35,295 --> 00:23:37,254
How was it? Did you enjoy it?

435
00:23:37,494 --> 00:23:39,825
Yes. It's so delicious. I'm done.

436
00:23:41,024 --> 00:23:44,365
- Do you want more?
- It's okay. I'm full.

437
00:23:44,764 --> 00:23:46,105
Then, I'll go get you some tea.

438
00:23:47,934 --> 00:23:49,104
- Kang jae.
- Yes?

439
00:23:49,105 --> 00:23:50,174
Take a seat.

440
00:23:50,835 --> 00:23:51,974
What is it?

441
00:23:55,075 --> 00:23:56,375
Third, touch.

442
00:23:56,845 --> 00:23:59,244
Execution.

443
00:24:00,243 --> 00:24:02,713
I didn't know you were
so good at cooking.

444
00:24:06,284 --> 00:24:07,724
I should've asked you to
make me something earlier.

445
00:24:09,325 --> 00:24:11,024
I wanted to,

446
00:24:11,194 --> 00:24:12,994
but they said it was dangerous
for us to be alone at home.

447
00:24:14,494 --> 00:24:16,865
Why? What's so dangerous?

448
00:24:20,474 --> 00:24:22,774
Something just...

449
00:24:22,859 --> 00:24:23,988
Why?

450
00:24:26,545 --> 00:24:27,944
No, nothing.

451
00:24:29,034 --> 00:24:31,235
Woo ri, let's go.

452
00:24:31,264 --> 00:24:32,834
Let's have tea elsewhere.

453
00:24:32,905 --> 00:24:35,303
You said you'd make me some tea.

454
00:24:35,304 --> 00:24:37,574
No, we should leave quickly.

455
00:24:38,034 --> 00:24:41,175
Why? I want to stay here longer.

456
00:24:41,844 --> 00:24:44,145
I don't think it's a good day for me.

457
00:24:44,375 --> 00:24:45,485
I think I need to pray.

458
00:25:07,264 --> 00:25:08,574
What?

459
00:25:09,034 --> 00:25:10,333
Why? What is it?

460
00:25:10,334 --> 00:25:12,945
Something just came in...

461
00:25:13,475 --> 00:25:14,675
What?

462
00:25:22,385 --> 00:25:25,425
You know that scene where ji dok
sa tries to charm na beom in?

463
00:25:26,254 --> 00:25:28,994
What if na beom in is dense
and can't notice it?

464
00:25:29,455 --> 00:25:31,824
What if smell, sight, and
touch won't do the trick?

465
00:25:31,965 --> 00:25:33,594
Why would that be a problem?

466
00:25:33,994 --> 00:25:35,493
You just need to say it.

467
00:25:35,494 --> 00:25:37,094
"Let's sleep together". Done.

468
00:25:38,405 --> 00:25:39,533
That's a bit...

469
00:25:39,534 --> 00:25:40,735
Do you want to write a letter then?

470
00:25:40,834 --> 00:25:42,434
"My love for you is great..."

471
00:25:42,435 --> 00:25:44,905
"Hence I'd like to request
a sleepover on this date."

472
00:25:45,074 --> 00:25:46,244
What is this, joseon dynasty?

473
00:25:50,014 --> 00:25:51,314
Letter? That's a good idea.

474
00:25:51,784 --> 00:25:53,244
In scene 34,

475
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:56,284
could you add a line about...

476
00:25:56,415 --> 00:25:59,625
The brightening essence?

477
00:26:08,789 --> 00:26:09,889
That sounds good.

478
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:12,059
All right, I'll put in a
line about the product.

479
00:26:12,289 --> 00:26:15,429
Scene 34, a line about
brightening essence.

480
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:16,660
Add in a line about
brightening essence.

481
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:17,988
Why is she adding in everything?

482
00:26:17,989 --> 00:26:20,459
Everyone seems to be doing hard work.

483
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:23,070
Hello, chief, director,
and team leader.

484
00:26:24,370 --> 00:26:25,999
There are some new faces as well.

485
00:26:26,499 --> 00:26:27,640
Nice to meet you.

486
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:31,880
I'm the new CEO of diamond
cosmetics, jeon byeon Jin.

487
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,880
Have some while you are working.

488
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:36,880
Executive director Raphael,

489
00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:38,820
keep up the good work.

490
00:26:39,519 --> 00:26:40,620
How are things going?

491
00:26:46,019 --> 00:26:47,559
Ms. oh, you're still here.

492
00:26:48,019 --> 00:26:50,228
Ms. yu wanted to get a facial.

493
00:26:50,229 --> 00:26:52,359
Why didn't you get it as well?

494
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,799
No, I'm fine.

495
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,009
Ms. oh,

496
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:11,979
I put you in a difficult position...

497
00:27:12,779 --> 00:27:13,979
The other day, didn't I?

498
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,289
I was so worked up...

499
00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:18,719
And shouldn't have blurted
about our meeting before.

500
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:21,590
I'm sorry.

501
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:25,798
Did you recognize me,

502
00:27:25,799 --> 00:27:26,959
when you first saw me?

503
00:27:28,029 --> 00:27:29,170
- Yes.
- Oh...

504
00:27:30,999 --> 00:27:33,370
Who was that man that
brought coffee earlier?

505
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:37,269
He's the new management specialist.

506
00:27:39,809 --> 00:27:41,180
Were you fired?

507
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:46,018
That can't be changed that easily.

508
00:27:46,019 --> 00:27:47,549
We need to have an official
board meeting and all.

509
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,620
Right.

510
00:27:50,890 --> 00:27:52,190
Ms. oh,

511
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,389
would you like to write...

512
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:55,558
An introduction letter
for the hospital?

513
00:27:55,559 --> 00:27:58,659
Not the formal kind that
the marketing team writes,

514
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:01,229
but a creative one that is not
tied to a particular format.

515
00:28:01,999 --> 00:28:03,900
Can't you write a fun one for me?

516
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:07,239
Sure, it's not that difficult.

517
00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:08,639
Thanks.

518
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,309
And did you see the film crew?

519
00:28:11,469 --> 00:28:13,179
Hello.

520
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:15,080
Got you!

521
00:28:18,009 --> 00:28:19,748
- Hello.
- Hi.

522
00:28:19,749 --> 00:28:22,989
Ms. oh, we should meet more often.

523
00:28:23,719 --> 00:28:25,048
Right,

524
00:28:25,049 --> 00:28:27,289
I don't come out to shoots that often.

525
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:30,228
Bye, then.

526
00:28:30,229 --> 00:28:31,690
Wait.

527
00:28:38,999 --> 00:28:40,670
You'll have good things ahead of you.

528
00:28:41,239 --> 00:28:42,539
Cheer up.

529
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:43,739
Let's go!

530
00:28:44,039 --> 00:28:45,140
Let's go!

531
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:47,778
Bye.

532
00:28:47,779 --> 00:28:49,049
Wait.

533
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:54,420
Can...

534
00:28:59,959 --> 00:29:01,019
We take a picture together?

535
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:03,389
- Excuse me?
- You like it too, don't you?

536
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:05,258
No, I'm fine.

537
00:29:05,259 --> 00:29:06,359
It's okay. I'm okay.

538
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:07,529
You like taking pictures, don't you?

539
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,799
Here we go.

540
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:11,698
Have a good day everyone.

541
00:29:11,699 --> 00:29:13,299
See you, soon.

542
00:29:20,979 --> 00:29:22,149
Writer woo ri?

543
00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:23,279
First picture together?

544
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,218
Have you lost your mind?

545
00:29:25,219 --> 00:29:26,320
Woo ri is not a stranger.

546
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,120
Woo ri is my daughter.

547
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:29,650
Seriously, why are you being this way?

548
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:32,288
Just wait until I say something to her.

549
00:29:32,289 --> 00:29:33,518
How many times do I have to tell you?

550
00:29:33,519 --> 00:29:35,660
What did I say?

551
00:29:35,759 --> 00:29:37,189
I didn't go looking for her.

552
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:38,798
I just met her on set.

553
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:40,359
Can't I even do that?

554
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,968
Can I not meet her by coincidence?

555
00:29:41,969 --> 00:29:44,830
Don't make me so nervous. Bye.

556
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,779
Gosh.

557
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:56,380
I'm so lonely.

558
00:29:58,142 --> 00:29:59,311
I'm so lonely.

559
00:30:13,094 --> 00:30:14,604
I didn't think you'd come.

560
00:30:15,104 --> 00:30:17,005
You said you'd wait until I did.

561
00:30:19,334 --> 00:30:20,445
Ma ri.

562
00:30:21,245 --> 00:30:22,604
What is it that you want to say?

563
00:30:23,104 --> 00:30:25,874
I made a hard decision to
clear my feelings for you.

564
00:30:27,485 --> 00:30:30,954
But I'm having second thoughts,
seeing you like this.

565
00:30:30,955 --> 00:30:32,155
What's wrong with me?

566
00:30:33,084 --> 00:30:36,784
Didn't you say you were no longer
the loser jeon byeon Jin anymore?

567
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:38,895
What if I cling on?

568
00:30:39,854 --> 00:30:41,164
Will you take me back, then?

569
00:30:41,165 --> 00:30:42,593
I'm married.

570
00:30:42,594 --> 00:30:45,995
Didn't you get married to a
CEO and not to a husband?

571
00:30:46,064 --> 00:30:47,665
I'm the new CEO.

572
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:49,803
I'm going to take over this hospital.

573
00:30:49,804 --> 00:30:51,034
Come back to me.

574
00:30:53,304 --> 00:30:56,074
What is it? What is your plan?

575
00:30:56,745 --> 00:30:59,214
I heard you mentioned
expanding into China.

576
00:30:59,215 --> 00:31:02,384
There's this big hospital called
liang li mao Mei plastic surgery.

577
00:31:02,515 --> 00:31:04,755
They are helping us with the expansion.

578
00:31:04,884 --> 00:31:06,215
They want to do a joint
hospital with us.

579
00:31:06,755 --> 00:31:08,954
If I take over all the China shares,

580
00:31:08,955 --> 00:31:12,594
I'll get rid of Kim duk bae
and Raphael in no time.

581
00:31:16,064 --> 00:31:17,534
Are you sure?

582
00:31:17,634 --> 00:31:19,735
Yes, trust me.

583
00:31:39,515 --> 00:31:41,323
Let's start, then.

584
00:31:41,324 --> 00:31:42,884
Darn it, what a bad hand.

585
00:31:43,284 --> 00:31:46,123
Gosh, who's this?

586
00:31:46,124 --> 00:31:49,064
Aren't you the guy
from "make of desire"?

587
00:31:49,094 --> 00:31:50,225
No, I'm not.

588
00:31:51,265 --> 00:31:54,833
Mother, I came by to say hello.

589
00:31:54,834 --> 00:31:57,374
There's no reason for you to do that.

590
00:31:58,735 --> 00:32:00,874
I was right.

591
00:32:01,074 --> 00:32:02,405
Give us your autograph.

592
00:32:02,505 --> 00:32:03,873
I'm sorry.

593
00:32:03,874 --> 00:32:06,644
I only give out autographs
on my autograph-only paper.

594
00:32:06,645 --> 00:32:09,343
Come on.

595
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:10,515
What's that?

596
00:32:11,415 --> 00:32:12,755
Of course, I'll give out my autograph.

597
00:32:15,284 --> 00:32:16,984
- Autograph!
- Autograph!

598
00:32:19,255 --> 00:32:20,824
Thank you.

599
00:32:21,564 --> 00:32:22,593
Take a look at this.

600
00:32:22,594 --> 00:32:24,664
Look how wonderfully he autographs.

601
00:32:24,665 --> 00:32:27,133
He's so good-looking. Go
on and get his autograph.

602
00:32:27,134 --> 00:32:30,103
Praying for our children

603
00:32:30,104 --> 00:32:33,405
day and night

604
00:32:33,505 --> 00:32:40,044
my mother who lived like
a crane and an angel

605
00:32:40,445 --> 00:32:47,524
what shall we sacrifice

606
00:32:47,725 --> 00:32:50,754
besides our tears

607
00:32:50,755 --> 00:32:52,293
don't fool yourself.

608
00:32:52,294 --> 00:32:53,523
Being like this...

609
00:32:53,524 --> 00:32:56,323
Won't relieve my
thirty-year-long resentment.

610
00:32:56,324 --> 00:32:57,594
Of course.

611
00:32:58,195 --> 00:33:00,034
I'm sure you were deeply heartbroken.

612
00:33:01,304 --> 00:33:03,165
I'll do my best to make
up for it, mother.

613
00:33:04,034 --> 00:33:07,004
Why did you come only now?

614
00:33:07,005 --> 00:33:09,044
I'm not that kind of person, mother.

615
00:33:09,975 --> 00:33:11,813
I didn't even know eun
ran had a baby...

616
00:33:11,814 --> 00:33:13,475
Since she cut contact with me.

617
00:33:14,314 --> 00:33:16,645
I would never have looked the
other way if I knew about it.

618
00:33:17,215 --> 00:33:18,283
So?

619
00:33:18,284 --> 00:33:20,925
Mother, I don't want anything else.

620
00:33:21,854 --> 00:33:23,925
I only want to play
my role as a father.

621
00:33:24,255 --> 00:33:26,524
Something I couldn't
do all these years.

622
00:33:26,895 --> 00:33:28,225
Please trust me.

623
00:33:28,725 --> 00:33:32,364
First, I will just watch and see.

624
00:33:39,374 --> 00:33:41,374
Thank you, mother.

625
00:33:42,505 --> 00:33:45,515
It would have been great if you were
around when woo ri was a child.

626
00:33:46,814 --> 00:33:48,215
I wondered who's nose...

627
00:33:48,884 --> 00:33:51,585
Woo ri took after.

628
00:33:51,784 --> 00:33:53,754
She seems to take after you.

629
00:33:55,924 --> 00:33:58,795
Mother, I had a nose-job.

630
00:34:00,864 --> 00:34:01,895
Gosh.

631
00:34:09,234 --> 00:34:14,074
Let's sleep together.

632
00:34:20,745 --> 00:34:23,144
It won't work for me.

633
00:34:23,145 --> 00:34:25,915
It won't.

634
00:34:32,295 --> 00:34:34,295
A wizard didn't write "Harry Potter".

635
00:34:34,495 --> 00:34:35,823
I'm a writer.

636
00:34:35,824 --> 00:34:38,633
I lack experience, but I
can write erotic content.

637
00:34:38,634 --> 00:34:39,765
Let's go.

638
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:07,225
I'm done.

639
00:35:14,404 --> 00:35:15,605
Hello, sir.

640
00:35:15,835 --> 00:35:19,174
I'm sorry for calling so late.

641
00:35:19,375 --> 00:35:21,105
I just wanted to ask...

642
00:35:21,275 --> 00:35:24,315
How that hospital
introduction was coming.

643
00:35:24,444 --> 00:35:26,644
Right, I'm done with that.

644
00:35:26,645 --> 00:35:28,684
I was going to send it to you tomorrow.

645
00:35:28,685 --> 00:35:30,653
I need to send it urgently.

646
00:35:30,654 --> 00:35:33,084
So could you send it to me tonight?

647
00:35:33,085 --> 00:35:34,323
I'll take a look at it first
thing in the morning.

648
00:35:34,324 --> 00:35:36,253
Of course, I'll send it over.

649
00:35:36,254 --> 00:35:38,554
- Thank you.
- Bye.

650
00:35:45,665 --> 00:35:47,705
Did you read what I sent you?

651
00:35:48,565 --> 00:35:50,835
What? What did you send?

652
00:35:51,674 --> 00:35:53,634
I sent you an e-mail.

653
00:35:53,734 --> 00:35:57,004
Oh, the e-mail? I read it.

654
00:35:57,315 --> 00:36:00,545
But, I'm not sure about it.

655
00:36:02,284 --> 00:36:05,613
What? What do you mean you're not sure?

656
00:36:05,614 --> 00:36:07,884
It's not something I'm interested in.

657
00:36:08,254 --> 00:36:10,225
- You're not interested?
- I'm not.

658
00:36:10,355 --> 00:36:12,725
It's not something I come
to experience often.

659
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:16,624
Do you have a problem or something?

660
00:36:16,625 --> 00:36:19,294
Woo ri, I would like to help you...

661
00:36:19,295 --> 00:36:21,165
With what you do if I knew everything.

662
00:36:21,804 --> 00:36:24,534
But I can't help it if it's
something I don't know.

663
00:36:25,435 --> 00:36:28,375
I mean, I know how good the
diamond medical foundation is...

664
00:36:28,574 --> 00:36:30,975
And that they are leaders in k-beauty.

665
00:36:31,875 --> 00:36:34,045
But it's not something I
can give you advice on.

666
00:36:34,284 --> 00:36:35,745
What are you talking about?

667
00:36:36,185 --> 00:36:38,315
You wanted me to take a look
at the hospital introduction.

668
00:36:47,077 --> 00:36:48,947
You can't read that e-mail!

669
00:36:49,507 --> 00:36:51,745
Why? What's wrong?

670
00:36:51,746 --> 00:36:54,415
You can't read that e-mail.

671
00:36:54,416 --> 00:36:56,816
That e-mail has a virus...

672
00:36:58,016 --> 00:37:01,526
No, it's spam.

673
00:37:01,527 --> 00:37:03,657
It's a scam.

674
00:37:04,557 --> 00:37:07,626
It wasn't anything like that.
There was a letter, though.

675
00:37:13,197 --> 00:37:14,407
Did you read it?

676
00:37:14,737 --> 00:37:17,307
I didn't know you wanted
to get that close to me.

677
00:37:20,807 --> 00:37:22,307
That wasn't for me, was it?

678
00:37:23,507 --> 00:37:25,976
Since you are a writer...

679
00:37:26,847 --> 00:37:28,246
It was so eloquently written.

680
00:37:29,286 --> 00:37:30,955
While reading it, I was just...

681
00:37:30,956 --> 00:37:32,987
By the way,

682
00:37:33,956 --> 00:37:35,926
I sent the introduction letter, again.

683
00:37:35,927 --> 00:37:36,955
Please check.

684
00:37:36,956 --> 00:37:38,757
Yes, I read it.

685
00:37:38,956 --> 00:37:41,466
Since your writing was outstanding,

686
00:37:41,467 --> 00:37:43,226
I unconsciously clapped my
hands while reading it.

687
00:37:44,137 --> 00:37:46,396
It was really good. Good job.

688
00:37:49,467 --> 00:37:50,576
Thank you.

689
00:37:50,577 --> 00:37:52,736
Then, I'll get back to my writing.

690
00:37:52,737 --> 00:37:55,106
- Goodbye.
- Have a nice day.

691
00:38:11,757 --> 00:38:12,927
What is all this?

692
00:38:13,126 --> 00:38:14,725
Why are you here all the time?

693
00:38:14,726 --> 00:38:16,366
I brought some flowers.

694
00:38:16,367 --> 00:38:17,367
I don't need them.

695
00:38:17,566 --> 00:38:19,265
Let's keep some distance

696
00:38:19,266 --> 00:38:21,705
- these aren't for you.
- What?

697
00:38:21,706 --> 00:38:24,035
Sung il, you came.

698
00:38:24,036 --> 00:38:26,705
Yes, mother. I brought some flowers.

699
00:38:26,706 --> 00:38:29,576
And I brought all the
choi sung il souvenirs.

700
00:38:29,577 --> 00:38:31,975
- You should take them.
- Gosh, you shouldn't have.

701
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:33,816
I'll put them to good use.

702
00:38:34,016 --> 00:38:36,416
I made some braised ribs since
you told me you are coming.

703
00:38:37,916 --> 00:38:41,026
Mom, what is this between you two?
What are you doing?

704
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:43,526
He could stay when woo ri's not around.

705
00:38:43,527 --> 00:38:45,896
I'm such a fan.

706
00:38:46,257 --> 00:38:47,496
Mom, seriously...

707
00:38:49,867 --> 00:38:52,297
- Are you wearing perfume?
- It's the soap.

708
00:38:52,436 --> 00:38:54,566
I told him to come and eat.

709
00:38:55,307 --> 00:38:56,565
Do you contact each other privately?

710
00:38:56,566 --> 00:38:58,776
Eun ran, take care of the
restaurant for a bit.

711
00:38:58,777 --> 00:39:01,146
I'm going to the welfare
center with sung il.

712
00:39:01,407 --> 00:39:03,677
Can you sign a couple of autographs?

713
00:39:03,907 --> 00:39:04,947
Mom.

714
00:39:06,547 --> 00:39:08,286
- Kang jae.
- Yes?

715
00:39:09,387 --> 00:39:13,856
Do you remember me telling you
about "home alone" before?

716
00:39:14,586 --> 00:39:15,826
Right,

717
00:39:15,827 --> 00:39:19,027
about not being able to wear skates
after cherishing them for too long?

718
00:39:19,356 --> 00:39:20,396
Yes.

719
00:39:21,867 --> 00:39:25,496
I think we are like that.

720
00:39:33,206 --> 00:39:36,807
After all our plans changed,

721
00:39:37,206 --> 00:39:38,246
I think I know now.

722
00:39:39,577 --> 00:39:43,516
These moments that we share are
even more precious to me now.

723
00:39:46,487 --> 00:39:48,657
- Kang jae.
- Yes?

724
00:39:50,797 --> 00:39:51,927
I love you.

725
00:39:59,536 --> 00:40:01,307
I love you too, woo ri.

726
00:40:04,007 --> 00:40:05,137
Let's...

727
00:40:09,347 --> 00:40:10,717
Sleep together.

728
00:40:28,666 --> 00:40:29,766
Tomorrow,

729
00:40:30,737 --> 00:40:34,166
let's have dinner at the Chinese
restaurant in myeong-dong.

730
00:40:35,106 --> 00:40:36,206
What?

731
00:40:37,007 --> 00:40:39,206
The one I wanted to check out?

732
00:40:40,036 --> 00:40:41,277
The restaurant at the hotel?

733
00:40:42,206 --> 00:40:43,807
Yes. We'll have dinner there...

734
00:40:44,347 --> 00:40:45,916
And breakfast at the hotel.

735
00:40:50,646 --> 00:40:51,816
Okay.

736
00:41:00,057 --> 00:41:01,225
All right.

737
00:41:01,226 --> 00:41:02,867
Here you go.

738
00:41:05,036 --> 00:41:06,097
Sung il?

739
00:41:07,407 --> 00:41:09,206
I need to do something about this.

740
00:41:10,007 --> 00:41:11,237
I really want to see her.

741
00:41:13,376 --> 00:41:15,246
I have to see her today.

742
00:41:15,447 --> 00:41:16,646
Who?

743
00:41:17,246 --> 00:41:18,515
Mr. Kim.

744
00:41:18,516 --> 00:41:20,016
- Take me to the writer's office.
- What?

745
00:41:20,677 --> 00:41:22,016
You want to see the writer?

746
00:41:22,347 --> 00:41:23,617
Ms. oh!

747
00:41:25,286 --> 00:41:26,617
Mr. choi.

748
00:41:31,356 --> 00:41:32,527
Here.

749
00:41:33,396 --> 00:41:34,867
I brought you some snacks.

750
00:41:35,327 --> 00:41:36,867
Thank you.

751
00:41:37,697 --> 00:41:39,536
Ms. yu is upstairs. Let's go.

752
00:41:39,697 --> 00:41:40,967
Oh, that's okay.

753
00:41:42,436 --> 00:41:44,677
Can we talk? Just the two of us.

754
00:41:45,476 --> 00:41:46,606
Sorry?

755
00:41:48,606 --> 00:41:50,705
- Why don't we...
- How about the indoor playground?

756
00:41:50,706 --> 00:41:53,177
Yes. Let's go there. It'll
be so much fun, right?

757
00:41:53,347 --> 00:41:55,186
- Yes.
- Let's go.

758
00:41:58,916 --> 00:42:00,117
Sung il.

759
00:42:00,827 --> 00:42:03,286
No, don't do it. The age
gap is just too big.

760
00:42:04,257 --> 00:42:05,527
- Mr. Kim?
- My gosh!

761
00:42:06,027 --> 00:42:07,257
- Ms. yu.
- What are you doing here?

762
00:42:07,867 --> 00:42:09,527
What? Woo ri and sung il?

763
00:42:09,697 --> 00:42:11,035
- What are they doing?
- Come on.

764
00:42:11,036 --> 00:42:12,097
Ms. yu.

765
00:42:12,297 --> 00:42:14,807
Just pretend you never saw this.
I'll get it all sorted out.

766
00:42:15,336 --> 00:42:16,506
What are you talking about?

767
00:42:16,507 --> 00:42:17,606
I think...

768
00:42:18,436 --> 00:42:19,936
Sung il likes your assistant.

769
00:42:21,407 --> 00:42:22,507
What?

770
00:42:27,847 --> 00:42:30,416
Was there something you
wanted to talk to me about?

771
00:42:32,757 --> 00:42:34,086
No, I just...

772
00:42:35,186 --> 00:42:36,456
I was just in the area.

773
00:42:38,057 --> 00:42:39,257
I see.

774
00:42:40,297 --> 00:42:41,496
Well...

775
00:42:42,867 --> 00:42:44,066
Your father.

776
00:42:44,766 --> 00:42:46,137
I heard he passed away.

777
00:42:50,106 --> 00:42:51,307
It's a banned word in my family.

778
00:42:51,637 --> 00:42:52,836
The word, "dad".

779
00:42:53,077 --> 00:42:54,206
What?

780
00:42:55,277 --> 00:42:57,246
I heard he died before I was even born.

781
00:42:58,246 --> 00:43:00,146
He passed away when my mom
was pregnant with me.

782
00:43:01,117 --> 00:43:03,617
So I never pressed her for details.

783
00:43:05,186 --> 00:43:06,956
It must've been so devastating.

784
00:43:08,057 --> 00:43:11,126
It must've been so hard for my mom.

785
00:43:15,766 --> 00:43:17,065
Actually,

786
00:43:17,066 --> 00:43:20,967
I remember asking her about
dad when I was little.

787
00:43:21,766 --> 00:43:23,106
But when I was in middle school,

788
00:43:25,036 --> 00:43:26,336
I realized...

789
00:43:28,007 --> 00:43:30,606
That hearing me say the word, "dad",

790
00:43:31,547 --> 00:43:32,717
always made my mom cry.

791
00:43:36,186 --> 00:43:38,887
That's why, in my family,

792
00:43:39,686 --> 00:43:41,527
that word simply doesn't exist.

793
00:43:41,856 --> 00:43:43,027
The word, "dad".

794
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:50,597
What was my mom like
when she was young?

795
00:43:55,507 --> 00:43:56,666
She was pretty.

796
00:43:58,907 --> 00:44:00,436
Very pretty.

797
00:44:06,876 --> 00:44:08,145
Mr. choi?

798
00:44:08,146 --> 00:44:09,217
Yes.

799
00:44:10,646 --> 00:44:11,786
Let's go.

800
00:44:14,987 --> 00:44:16,827
I'm meeting someone. Let's go.

801
00:44:18,427 --> 00:44:20,057
Enjoy the snacks!

802
00:44:29,007 --> 00:44:31,577
- Just for one night?
- Yes.

803
00:44:32,706 --> 00:44:36,277
Why are you so excited to pull
an all-nighter at the office?

804
00:44:37,646 --> 00:44:39,776
No, I'm not excited.

805
00:44:39,777 --> 00:44:40,915
It's okay.

806
00:44:40,916 --> 00:44:43,585
Whatever you do, just enjoy it.

807
00:44:43,586 --> 00:44:44,987
- And have fun while at it.
- Okay.

808
00:44:45,856 --> 00:44:47,626
- Bye.
- Bye.

809
00:44:56,197 --> 00:44:57,737
- Bye.
- What? What's this about?

810
00:45:00,166 --> 00:45:02,265
Booked under Mr. Lee Kang jae, right?

811
00:45:02,266 --> 00:45:03,737
It's room 2301.

812
00:45:12,976 --> 00:45:14,586
- Have some.
- Okay.

813
00:45:14,847 --> 00:45:16,617
You should eat too.

814
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:18,117
Okay.

815
00:45:36,666 --> 00:45:37,777
What's taking her so long?

816
00:45:42,847 --> 00:45:45,875
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe

817
00:45:45,876 --> 00:45:48,746
catch a tiger by the toe

818
00:45:53,016 --> 00:45:54,117
woo ri.

819
00:45:54,686 --> 00:45:56,557
Yes? What is it?

820
00:45:56,686 --> 00:45:59,626
Hey, you've been in there for an hour.

821
00:46:00,297 --> 00:46:01,597
Is everything okay?

822
00:46:02,066 --> 00:46:03,666
Yes, I'll be out in a minute.

823
00:46:04,467 --> 00:46:05,597
Okay.

824
00:46:12,706 --> 00:46:13,807
Did you shower?

825
00:46:18,976 --> 00:46:20,815
Hey, are you all right?

826
00:46:20,816 --> 00:46:22,686
Yes, I'm fine.

827
00:46:45,976 --> 00:46:47,077
Whose phone is it?

828
00:46:47,376 --> 00:46:49,277
- Mine. It's my phone.
- Okay.

829
00:46:51,947 --> 00:46:53,347
Hello, sir.

830
00:46:54,717 --> 00:46:56,217
The hospital introduction?

831
00:46:57,146 --> 00:46:59,456
I see. It got good feedback in China?

832
00:47:00,887 --> 00:47:04,057
I'm sorry, but I'm busy at the moment.

833
00:47:04,856 --> 00:47:07,097
Yes, okay.

834
00:47:11,297 --> 00:47:12,496
Was that Raphael?

835
00:47:13,036 --> 00:47:14,297
Yes.

836
00:47:15,737 --> 00:47:18,077
It was about the hospital
introduction I wrote for them.

837
00:47:41,166 --> 00:47:42,367
Whose phone is it?

838
00:47:42,697 --> 00:47:43,896
I think it's mine this time.

839
00:47:46,637 --> 00:47:48,666
Hello, Raphael. What's up?

840
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:51,507
Right.

841
00:47:52,336 --> 00:47:55,507
Oh, that. I'll have the
investigator in charge call you.

842
00:47:56,507 --> 00:47:58,947
Yes. I'm busy at the moment.

843
00:47:59,376 --> 00:48:00,476
All right.

844
00:48:03,847 --> 00:48:05,057
Was that Raphael?

845
00:48:05,586 --> 00:48:07,717
Yes, it was about the investigation.

846
00:48:33,376 --> 00:48:34,476
What's this sound?

847
00:48:34,786 --> 00:48:35,847
What's going on?

848
00:48:36,487 --> 00:48:37,916
We apologize.

849
00:48:38,786 --> 00:48:41,186
It's a false fire alarm.

850
00:48:42,626 --> 00:48:45,456
- What? It gave me such a scare.
- You can go back inside.

851
00:48:45,657 --> 00:48:46,797
Let's go inside.

852
00:48:48,327 --> 00:48:49,666
Sorry, our apologies.

853
00:48:52,036 --> 00:48:53,297
- Kang jae?
- Yes?

854
00:48:53,797 --> 00:48:55,066
What are you thinking?

855
00:48:56,066 --> 00:48:57,106
Well...

856
00:48:58,376 --> 00:49:00,677
I think someone is...

857
00:49:01,277 --> 00:49:02,577
Giving me a sign.

858
00:49:02,807 --> 00:49:04,376
A sign? Like what?

859
00:49:04,677 --> 00:49:05,717
Well...

860
00:49:07,577 --> 00:49:08,646
Woo ri.

861
00:49:09,016 --> 00:49:10,416
Let's just go home.

862
00:49:11,516 --> 00:49:13,487
- Why?
- Let's just go home tonight.

863
00:49:15,186 --> 00:49:16,986
We'll spend time together
then, not tonight.

864
00:49:16,987 --> 00:49:18,057
I think that'll be better.

865
00:49:20,526 --> 00:49:21,735
When?

866
00:49:21,836 --> 00:49:22,965
What?

867
00:49:23,336 --> 00:49:24,396
Hey.

868
00:49:24,936 --> 00:49:26,465
You said you were working all night.

869
00:49:28,035 --> 00:49:30,675
The plan got cancelled,
so I got to leave early.

870
00:49:30,905 --> 00:49:33,276
- Did you have dinner?
- Yes.

871
00:49:35,546 --> 00:49:37,146
- Mom.
- Yes?

872
00:49:37,646 --> 00:49:40,345
- Grandma.
- Yes? What is it?

873
00:49:43,255 --> 00:49:45,126
I'm getting married.

874
00:49:45,586 --> 00:49:47,896
- What? Really?
- Really?

875
00:49:48,695 --> 00:49:49,796
Yes.

876
00:49:57,796 --> 00:50:01,735
Kang jae wants to get married
after the baby is born.

877
00:50:08,546 --> 00:50:12,215
We're deviating a little from
the plan we had for our future,

878
00:50:13,385 --> 00:50:15,115
but we'll always be together, you know?

879
00:50:17,086 --> 00:50:18,825
So let's be patient.

880
00:50:20,385 --> 00:50:21,456
Okay?

881
00:50:25,026 --> 00:50:27,526
- Okay.
- Good.

882
00:50:30,836 --> 00:50:32,964
- That's amazing!
- I'm so happy for you!

883
00:50:32,965 --> 00:50:34,605
- Congratulations!
- My gosh.

884
00:50:34,606 --> 00:50:36,475
I've been waiting for this news.

885
00:50:36,476 --> 00:50:38,645
- Show us your ring.
- Let's see.

886
00:50:38,646 --> 00:50:40,975
- Oh, my.
- She has such nice hands.

887
00:50:40,976 --> 00:50:42,944
I'll pull the all-nighter then.

888
00:50:42,945 --> 00:50:44,984
My gosh! Isn't it so beautiful, mom?

889
00:50:44,985 --> 00:50:46,615
- Yes, it is.
- Let's see.

890
00:50:52,526 --> 00:50:53,755
- Hello.
- Hello.

891
00:50:53,825 --> 00:50:56,254
- Is it done?
- Yes, almost.

892
00:50:56,255 --> 00:50:57,296
Okay.

893
00:51:04,666 --> 00:51:06,305
Shin mi young, age 35.

894
00:51:06,465 --> 00:51:08,735
A nurse in diamond's
plastic surgery clinic.

895
00:51:08,976 --> 00:51:10,875
She was off that day, so she
wasn't one of our suspects.

896
00:51:10,876 --> 00:51:13,746
Don't tell me you think
she's chairman Kim.

897
00:51:13,845 --> 00:51:16,944
The time lines don't match up at all.

898
00:51:16,945 --> 00:51:19,884
Captain, it's possible that
chairman Kim ordered shin to...

899
00:51:19,885 --> 00:51:21,784
Kang jae. Find out if shin mi young...

900
00:51:21,785 --> 00:51:24,055
Was holding a grudge
against no man chul, okay?

901
00:51:25,356 --> 00:51:27,425
Okay, got it.

902
00:51:30,726 --> 00:51:31,865
That'd be all.

903
00:51:35,396 --> 00:51:37,035
Great! That is impressive.

904
00:51:37,695 --> 00:51:39,836
Now, if that came true, I'd
have nothing more to wish for.

905
00:51:42,476 --> 00:51:44,574
- I have a question.
- Sure, ask away.

906
00:51:44,575 --> 00:51:46,904
Did you go to China and have
an in-person meeting...

907
00:51:46,905 --> 00:51:48,345
With liang li mao Mei plastic surgery?

908
00:51:48,916 --> 00:51:51,344
Not yet. But I've already
negotiated the details...

909
00:51:51,345 --> 00:51:52,714
With the headman who's in Korea.

910
00:51:52,715 --> 00:51:54,885
The head of the company?

911
00:51:55,816 --> 00:51:56,816
You mean, this man?

912
00:51:59,255 --> 00:52:00,425
What?

913
00:52:00,686 --> 00:52:02,924
The one who ran tabs at bars with
a business card that said...

914
00:52:02,925 --> 00:52:05,526
He was a Chinese
businessman and got sued?

915
00:52:05,695 --> 00:52:06,695
What?

916
00:52:06,696 --> 00:52:09,765
He had nothing to do with liang
li mao Mei plastic surgery.

917
00:52:09,766 --> 00:52:12,865
What's that word?
Right, he's a swindler.

918
00:52:13,505 --> 00:52:15,935
- No, let me explain.
- Oh, boy.

919
00:52:15,936 --> 00:52:19,074
I was wondering how you landed such
a huge deal so easily. Forget it.

920
00:52:19,075 --> 00:52:22,476
- Sir.
- The video call just got connected.

921
00:52:22,575 --> 00:52:23,945
Sir, say hello.

922
00:52:24,175 --> 00:52:27,445
Mr. li won ming, the CEO of liang
li mao Mei plastic surgery.

923
00:52:31,456 --> 00:52:32,984
Hello.

924
00:52:32,985 --> 00:52:36,026
I read the business
proposal from diamond.

925
00:52:36,095 --> 00:52:39,725
I have tried diamond's
cosmetic products myself,

926
00:52:39,726 --> 00:52:41,226
and they were amazing.

927
00:52:41,496 --> 00:52:44,665
We would like to order all
cosmetics and skincare products...

928
00:52:44,666 --> 00:52:48,305
From diamond to use them at
liang li mao Mei hospital.

929
00:52:48,376 --> 00:52:49,405
What did he say?

930
00:52:49,675 --> 00:52:51,476
They want to use our cosmetics.

931
00:52:52,945 --> 00:52:55,574
The hospital introduction
Raphael sent to me...

932
00:52:55,575 --> 00:52:57,615
Was surprisingly entertaining.

933
00:52:57,845 --> 00:53:00,085
I look forward to meeting the man...

934
00:53:00,086 --> 00:53:02,614
Who works with such enthusiasm.

935
00:53:02,615 --> 00:53:06,455
Thank you, Mr. li. I'll schedule
a time as soon as possible.

936
00:53:06,456 --> 00:53:09,955
I look forward to hearing from you.
Thank you.

937
00:53:09,956 --> 00:53:10,996
Thank you.

938
00:53:11,965 --> 00:53:13,194
Look at you, Raphael.

939
00:53:13,195 --> 00:53:15,396
I see that your English has improved.

940
00:53:15,735 --> 00:53:17,265
It wasn't so good when you
returned from overseas.

941
00:53:17,266 --> 00:53:18,505
Come on.

942
00:53:19,436 --> 00:53:20,865
So? Will you just pack up and leave?

943
00:53:21,405 --> 00:53:22,776
Want the executive director position?

944
00:53:23,376 --> 00:53:26,476
Executive director jeon byeon Jin.

945
00:53:27,945 --> 00:53:29,246
It's hard to pronounce.

946
00:53:30,646 --> 00:53:34,856
A peck of pickled peppers.
Jeon byeon Jin. Jeon...

947
00:53:36,615 --> 00:53:39,385
It's such a tongue twister.
Just get out.

948
00:53:41,956 --> 00:53:43,026
Fire him.

949
00:53:43,726 --> 00:53:44,965
That's it for the meeting.

950
00:53:48,965 --> 00:53:50,595
Ma ri! Hey, ma ri.

951
00:53:50,836 --> 00:53:53,206
What happened? Did you tell him?

952
00:53:53,505 --> 00:53:55,475
I'm a member of the diamond family.

953
00:53:55,476 --> 00:53:57,335
Of course, I should look out for them.

954
00:53:57,336 --> 00:54:00,405
But you said you and Raphael
weren't on good terms.

955
00:54:00,606 --> 00:54:04,575
All married couples fight and make up.

956
00:54:04,746 --> 00:54:07,845
Well, pack up your things
and be on your way.

957
00:54:08,615 --> 00:54:10,686
- Ma ri.
- Let go! People are watching.

958
00:54:11,526 --> 00:54:12,726
Ma ri.

959
00:54:13,885 --> 00:54:16,026
- Thanks.
- No problem at all.

960
00:54:16,255 --> 00:54:17,824
I work for the hospital too, you know.

961
00:54:17,825 --> 00:54:19,066
Still.

962
00:54:19,425 --> 00:54:22,266
Had we not looked into it, the
damage would've been huge.

963
00:54:23,066 --> 00:54:26,005
I heard he never told anyone.
How did you find out?

964
00:54:26,936 --> 00:54:28,106
Just somehow.

965
00:54:29,535 --> 00:54:32,005
Anyway, I'm so glad it's
all been sorted out now.

966
00:54:32,476 --> 00:54:35,445
I'm happy because things seem
to be going well for us.

967
00:54:36,416 --> 00:54:38,016
You know, with the baby too.

968
00:54:39,285 --> 00:54:40,285
Right?

969
00:54:40,286 --> 00:54:41,655
- Ma ri.
- Yes?

970
00:54:43,055 --> 00:54:44,186
Here.

971
00:54:49,026 --> 00:54:51,055
- What's this?
- Let's get a divorce.

972
00:54:51,896 --> 00:54:54,626
What? You're at it again? Why?

973
00:55:06,746 --> 00:55:09,215
I found out that you were meeting
jeon byeon Jin, so I looked into it.

974
00:55:10,215 --> 00:55:12,146
I must say, I was
surprised to see this.

975
00:55:12,485 --> 00:55:14,985
- When did you find out?
- Is that important?

976
00:55:15,615 --> 00:55:17,555
If you knew, why didn't you tell me?

977
00:55:18,285 --> 00:55:19,425
Because of the baby.

978
00:55:20,686 --> 00:55:23,726
I thought long and hard to figure out
what would be best for the baby.

979
00:55:24,555 --> 00:55:25,796
But this is just wrong.

980
00:55:26,465 --> 00:55:29,195
It's over. We're really through now.

981
00:55:29,566 --> 00:55:31,035
But what if she doesn't
give you the baby?

982
00:55:31,496 --> 00:55:33,634
What if she refuses to give you
the baby because we're divorced?

983
00:55:33,635 --> 00:55:36,305
I was a fool for letting you
use the baby to sway me.

984
00:55:37,876 --> 00:55:39,146
I will protect...

985
00:55:40,206 --> 00:55:41,575
My gummy bear.

986
00:55:45,016 --> 00:55:46,445
I can totally do it alone.

987
00:55:51,626 --> 00:55:52,925
It's so cute.

988
00:55:58,766 --> 00:55:59,924
Hey, duk chil.

989
00:55:59,925 --> 00:56:02,595
Hey. Someone's in a
good mood for a change.

990
00:56:02,836 --> 00:56:05,766
You see, woo ri... my
daughter is getting married.

991
00:56:05,865 --> 00:56:07,066
What? She's getting married?

992
00:56:07,635 --> 00:56:09,674
- Really? When?
- After the baby is born.

993
00:56:09,675 --> 00:56:11,174
Is she pregnant now?

994
00:56:11,175 --> 00:56:12,776
Really? When did that happen?

995
00:56:12,976 --> 00:56:15,345
Well, it's...

996
00:56:15,516 --> 00:56:17,615
It's a long story.

997
00:56:17,715 --> 00:56:19,015
That's all you need to know.

998
00:56:19,016 --> 00:56:20,115
What? Why...

999
00:56:20,686 --> 00:56:23,614
Why won't you tell me anything?

1000
00:56:23,615 --> 00:56:27,054
Hold on. Then I should
walk her down the aisle.

1001
00:56:27,055 --> 00:56:28,795
I'll hold her hand and
walk her down the aisle.

1002
00:56:28,796 --> 00:56:30,194
You? Why?

1003
00:56:30,195 --> 00:56:31,665
I'm her father. That's why.

1004
00:56:31,666 --> 00:56:33,324
Gosh, whatever.

1005
00:56:33,325 --> 00:56:34,996
Let's talk about it another time.
It's complicated.

1006
00:56:35,496 --> 00:56:37,996
You see, her pregnancy
was totally unexpected.

1007
00:56:38,766 --> 00:56:41,436
That's all you need to know for now.
I'll explain later.

1008
00:56:41,566 --> 00:56:44,134
- I'm getting a headache. Bye.
- Wait, eun ran.

1009
00:56:44,135 --> 00:56:46,376
What? Hey. Eun ran!

1010
00:56:46,976 --> 00:56:48,106
Goodness.

1011
00:56:49,276 --> 00:56:52,484
All right. I'll take you home, sung il.

1012
00:56:52,485 --> 00:56:53,615
Take me to bukgajwa-dong.

1013
00:56:55,155 --> 00:56:56,215
What?

1014
00:56:57,115 --> 00:56:58,555
Seo gwi nyeo's pork cutlet. Let's go.

1015
00:57:08,529 --> 00:57:09,629
I'm...

1016
00:57:11,430 --> 00:57:12,899
Getting a divorce.

1017
00:57:14,339 --> 00:57:17,569
Sorry? Divorce? Why?

1018
00:57:18,009 --> 00:57:21,710
It's personal, so I can't
tell you everything.

1019
00:57:23,310 --> 00:57:27,120
I know that you want to find
the perfect home for the baby,

1020
00:57:28,020 --> 00:57:30,549
so I came here to tell
you this in person.

1021
00:57:31,149 --> 00:57:32,520
Although I'm getting a divorce,

1022
00:57:32,989 --> 00:57:35,060
I'll make sure to create the
perfect environment for the baby.

1023
00:57:35,830 --> 00:57:38,089
So please put your trust in me,

1024
00:57:39,430 --> 00:57:41,600
and I truly hope that you
won't change your mind.

1025
00:57:43,169 --> 00:57:46,069
I'm sorry for causing you concern.

1026
00:57:58,049 --> 00:57:59,279
Woo ri.

1027
00:58:02,390 --> 00:58:04,790
- Woo ri!
- Is he out of his mind?

1028
00:58:04,850 --> 00:58:06,790
- Hey.
- Woo ri.

1029
00:58:07,189 --> 00:58:09,060
- Hey, no.
- Woo ri.

1030
00:58:09,290 --> 00:58:11,460
I'm your father.

1031
00:58:13,899 --> 00:58:15,629
Woo ri, I am your father.

1032
00:58:17,029 --> 00:58:18,100
Dad?

1033
00:58:56,410 --> 00:58:58,939
How am I going to face you from now on?

1034
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:00,079
Someone reported...

1035
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:01,579
- Domestic violence.
- What?

1036
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:03,649
I don't want to get a divorce.

1037
00:59:03,810 --> 00:59:05,519
Then Raphael is...

1038
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:07,620
I don't think you should keep the baby.

1039
00:59:07,750 --> 00:59:10,850
You call, telling the whole
country I'm pregnant, help?

1040
00:59:10,890 --> 00:59:13,989
Let's just go back to being strangers.

1041
00:59:14,060 --> 00:59:15,858
Of course, we should.

1042
00:59:15,859 --> 00:59:17,588
You investigating the hospital.

1043
00:59:17,589 --> 00:59:19,959
Are you trying to get back at
me for getting her pregnant?

1044
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:22,028
As long as we remain sincere,

1045
00:59:22,029 --> 00:59:24,299
we can take it slow and get close.

1046
00:59:24,945 --> 00:59:27,545
I feel like there's no one else in
the world but just the two of us.
