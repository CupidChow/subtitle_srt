1
00:00:38,141 --> 00:00:39,411
We're over.

2
00:00:42,011 --> 00:00:43,111
I mean it.

3
00:00:47,522 --> 00:00:48,682
Woo ri.

4
00:00:50,622 --> 00:00:52,552
You say we're over.

5
00:00:54,291 --> 00:00:56,121
And you're getting farther away.

6
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:00,091
But I can't seem to stop you.

7
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:03,402
I'm just watching you walk away.

8
00:01:13,942 --> 00:01:15,382
- What about Raphael?
- I see.

9
00:01:16,882 --> 00:01:19,212
- I had to clean up afterward.
- Okay.

10
00:01:20,451 --> 00:01:23,321
- You should debut as a singer.
- Wasn't she amazing?

11
00:01:23,321 --> 00:01:25,051
- Seriously.
- Was I good?

12
00:01:26,321 --> 00:01:28,391
- Should we go to karaoke?
- Sounds good.

13
00:01:28,392 --> 00:01:29,892
- Sounds good, right?
- Sure.

14
00:01:29,892 --> 00:01:32,732
You take after your mother. Of
course, you're a great singer.

15
00:01:32,731 --> 00:01:34,131
That's a great idea.

16
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:36,531
By the way, aren't you hungry?

17
00:01:36,632 --> 00:01:38,132
Hey, Kang jae!

18
00:01:40,032 --> 00:01:41,842
- Hey.
- Kang jae.

19
00:01:43,442 --> 00:01:45,472
I'm glad Kang jae could make it.

20
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:46,972
Me too.

21
00:01:47,582 --> 00:01:49,382
Work ended later than I expected.

22
00:01:50,612 --> 00:01:53,182
Woo ri. Can you show me the video too?

23
00:01:53,311 --> 00:01:54,351
Sure.

24
00:01:54,582 --> 00:01:56,422
It must have been a lot of
work to put this together.

25
00:01:56,421 --> 00:01:58,421
No. I didn't do much.

26
00:01:58,621 --> 00:02:01,221
I'm grateful that Raphael
helped me put this together.

27
00:02:02,821 --> 00:02:04,221
Woo ri. Eat a lot.

28
00:02:04,222 --> 00:02:05,832
Raphael wanted to come here...

29
00:02:05,832 --> 00:02:07,332
Because beef is good
for pregnant women.

30
00:02:08,132 --> 00:02:09,332
Eat a lot.

31
00:02:09,502 --> 00:02:11,372
It's hard to make a reservation
at this restaurant.

32
00:02:11,371 --> 00:02:13,801
But I was able to snatch a
table thanks to my connection.

33
00:02:14,571 --> 00:02:16,541
It's melting in my mouth.

34
00:02:16,801 --> 00:02:18,241
It's expensive meat.

35
00:02:18,741 --> 00:02:21,481
Should I proactively order more?
How about tenderloin?

36
00:02:21,741 --> 00:02:23,641
Should we order a few servings
to see how it tastes?

37
00:02:23,641 --> 00:02:25,111
- Sure.
- Yes.

38
00:02:26,682 --> 00:02:27,852
- Let's do that.
- Great.

39
00:02:29,122 --> 00:02:30,992
- Eat a lot, mom.
- Okay.

40
00:02:30,991 --> 00:02:32,191
- It's so good.
- Raphael.

41
00:02:32,722 --> 00:02:34,362
Raphael, did you pay for the meal?

42
00:02:34,761 --> 00:02:36,291
Of course. I invited you here.

43
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:37,891
Why did you do it? I
should have paid for it!

44
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:39,061
This was a family meal.

45
00:02:39,062 --> 00:02:40,332
Gosh. Don't mention it.

46
00:02:40,331 --> 00:02:43,531
Ms. oh and the baby ate the food.

47
00:02:44,701 --> 00:02:46,801
Thank you for the meal.

48
00:02:47,032 --> 00:02:49,902
Ms. oh, we should have
seafood next time.

49
00:02:49,972 --> 00:02:51,842
Seafood is great for
pregnant women too.

50
00:02:51,842 --> 00:02:54,242
I know an excellent chef who
cooks Japanese cuisine.

51
00:02:54,241 --> 00:02:55,641
Really? Where is the restaurant?

52
00:02:55,712 --> 00:02:58,952
Gangnam? It already
sounds so delicious.

53
00:02:59,682 --> 00:03:01,882
- It'll be my treat then.
- No, it'll be my treat.

54
00:03:02,852 --> 00:03:04,322
- Don't fight.
- Okay.

55
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:09,321
- Of course.
- Gosh.

56
00:03:09,421 --> 00:03:11,291
- Just set a date.
- Of course.

57
00:03:11,532 --> 00:03:12,662
You.

58
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:14,602
I made myself clear. My answer is no.

59
00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:17,831
What are you talking about
after you just barged in here?

60
00:03:17,932 --> 00:03:19,032
No divorce.

61
00:03:20,801 --> 00:03:22,471
Gosh. Dad.

62
00:03:22,972 --> 00:03:25,812
Should I tell you
everything she's done?

63
00:03:25,812 --> 00:03:26,912
She already told me everything.

64
00:03:27,241 --> 00:03:29,181
No man chul was hitting on her.

65
00:03:29,282 --> 00:03:32,052
Jerks like him hit on her
because she's so pretty.

66
00:03:32,051 --> 00:03:33,051
That's not all.

67
00:03:33,152 --> 00:03:35,182
She almost sued me!

68
00:03:35,182 --> 00:03:36,252
She told me that too.

69
00:03:36,252 --> 00:03:38,952
Imagine how desperate she
must have been to do so!

70
00:03:38,951 --> 00:03:39,951
Seriously?

71
00:03:39,952 --> 00:03:41,892
You'll just side with
her whatever she does?

72
00:03:42,122 --> 00:03:43,422
Why are you so lenient with her?

73
00:03:44,321 --> 00:03:45,761
The star cafe building
in nonhyeon-dong.

74
00:03:46,692 --> 00:03:48,332
I'll transfer the deed to her.

75
00:03:49,132 --> 00:03:50,962
What? Why all of a sudden?

76
00:03:50,962 --> 00:03:52,402
If you don't take care of her,

77
00:03:52,701 --> 00:03:54,171
I will.

78
00:03:54,171 --> 00:03:55,441
Have you gone mad?

79
00:03:55,671 --> 00:03:58,241
Why do you like someone who
threatened me and cheated on me?

80
00:03:58,241 --> 00:03:59,471
Of course, I do.

81
00:03:59,541 --> 00:04:01,211
I like her more than you by a mile.

82
00:04:01,212 --> 00:04:04,512
I have never liked anyone
as much as this in my life.

83
00:04:04,511 --> 00:04:06,451
Then why don't you live with her?

84
00:04:06,451 --> 00:04:07,881
You little...

85
00:04:07,882 --> 00:04:10,122
You ungrateful punk!

86
00:04:14,491 --> 00:04:16,321
You're a poor judge of character!

87
00:04:16,421 --> 00:04:20,191
Where do you think you can meet
a beautiful girl like her?

88
00:04:20,191 --> 00:04:22,501
She's beautiful and kind.

89
00:04:22,501 --> 00:04:24,231
A jerk like you doesn't deserve...

90
00:04:26,231 --> 00:04:27,371
No divorce.

91
00:04:32,642 --> 00:04:34,212
Do you know what just happened?

92
00:04:34,212 --> 00:04:36,842
Gosh. This is amazing!

93
00:04:36,842 --> 00:04:39,112
I guess there's always
a way out of trouble.

94
00:04:42,022 --> 00:04:43,152
Mom?

95
00:04:43,621 --> 00:04:44,821
Hello?

96
00:04:45,222 --> 00:04:48,122
I need you to come home.

97
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:50,691
Now? Why?

98
00:04:51,462 --> 00:04:52,632
Is something wrong?

99
00:05:06,611 --> 00:05:08,981
What are you doing? Have you gone mad?

100
00:05:08,981 --> 00:05:10,181
Mal ja.

101
00:05:10,311 --> 00:05:11,811
Be nice.

102
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:15,282
Your husband is here to say hello
to his dear mother-in-law.

103
00:05:17,582 --> 00:05:20,592
Listen. I was going to apologize
for what I did to her legs...

104
00:05:22,462 --> 00:05:24,222
And get an apology for making me
rot in there for three years.

105
00:05:25,532 --> 00:05:27,132
Your current husband should be here...

106
00:05:27,431 --> 00:05:29,061
To witness this touching moment.

107
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:30,762
Right?

108
00:05:31,131 --> 00:05:32,901
Get out before I call the cops!

109
00:05:32,902 --> 00:05:34,802
You should've done that before then.
You can't call the cops.

110
00:05:34,871 --> 00:05:37,101
If you do, your little
con here will be ruined.

111
00:05:37,171 --> 00:05:38,511
Fine. Okay.

112
00:05:39,171 --> 00:05:40,441
Let's end it all.

113
00:05:40,741 --> 00:05:42,541
This is the end for both of us.

114
00:05:53,491 --> 00:05:54,591
You!

115
00:05:57,421 --> 00:05:58,531
Darn it.

116
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:14,582
Come on!

117
00:06:15,012 --> 00:06:16,182
Seriously.

118
00:06:56,152 --> 00:06:57,852
We found the drug bottle at the scene.

119
00:06:57,852 --> 00:06:59,892
The autopsy report says there
are no signs of a homicide.

120
00:07:00,152 --> 00:07:01,522
Shin mi young killed herself...

121
00:07:01,522 --> 00:07:03,222
Out of guilt for killing no man chul.

122
00:07:03,522 --> 00:07:06,092
We're going to close the case with that.
What's the problem?

123
00:07:06,731 --> 00:07:07,831
Captain.

124
00:07:08,561 --> 00:07:09,561
I've been thinking.

125
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:10,902
But what she said right
before she died...

126
00:07:11,202 --> 00:07:12,332
Hospital...

127
00:07:13,032 --> 00:07:14,572
Chairman Kim...

128
00:07:15,671 --> 00:07:16,871
I think she was trying to tell us...

129
00:07:16,871 --> 00:07:18,071
Chairman Kim was at diamond
medical foundation.

130
00:07:18,611 --> 00:07:20,071
Do you investigate based
on your opinions?

131
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:21,512
You said you weren't sure at the scene.

132
00:07:21,611 --> 00:07:22,741
Captain.

133
00:07:23,981 --> 00:07:25,081
Come on.

134
00:07:25,811 --> 00:07:27,651
Consider even the smallest possibility,

135
00:07:27,981 --> 00:07:29,481
and let me investigate
diamond medical foundation.

136
00:07:29,481 --> 00:07:31,221
Do you think you can
find chairman Kim...

137
00:07:31,222 --> 00:07:32,822
By investigating an
irrelevant hospital?

138
00:07:33,392 --> 00:07:34,792
Hey, it's obvious...

139
00:07:35,222 --> 00:07:38,162
That she killed him because of
money and poisoned herself.

140
00:07:38,392 --> 00:07:40,592
It's abnormal to think otherwise.

141
00:07:41,702 --> 00:07:44,232
I'm sorry about what happened to Ms.
Shin mi young.

142
00:07:45,301 --> 00:07:46,671
You must be devastated.

143
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:20,571
Knock, knock.

144
00:08:22,202 --> 00:08:23,572
Hello.

145
00:08:24,072 --> 00:08:25,912
Ms. yu stepped out for a moment.

146
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:28,281
I'm here to see my daughter.

147
00:08:29,811 --> 00:08:30,941
Here.

148
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:34,312
I took this photo for
a scene in the drama.

149
00:08:34,952 --> 00:08:36,282
And I photoshopped your face.

150
00:08:38,192 --> 00:08:40,152
Thank you.

151
00:08:41,361 --> 00:08:43,391
I'll take this home.

152
00:08:44,761 --> 00:08:46,161
Is this why you came?

153
00:08:46,261 --> 00:08:47,531
No.

154
00:08:49,401 --> 00:08:50,531
Woo ri.

155
00:08:50,761 --> 00:08:52,571
I won't tell you what to do...

156
00:08:52,572 --> 00:08:54,372
With your life now.

157
00:08:54,842 --> 00:08:56,472
Including your pregnancy
and giving birth.

158
00:08:57,572 --> 00:09:00,642
I understood you gave it a lot of
thought to make this decision.

159
00:09:01,781 --> 00:09:03,141
By the way,

160
00:09:03,281 --> 00:09:06,511
could we discuss the lawsuit
against the hospital again?

161
00:09:07,611 --> 00:09:10,281
Let's meet with Raphael
when we have time. Okay?

162
00:09:10,682 --> 00:09:13,652
Pregnancy, giving birth,
Raphael, and lawsuit?

163
00:09:14,621 --> 00:09:16,261
Seoung il. What are you talking about?

164
00:09:16,991 --> 00:09:18,231
Nothing.

165
00:09:18,231 --> 00:09:19,561
You must have misheard me.

166
00:09:19,962 --> 00:09:22,032
Nonsense. I heard everything.

167
00:09:22,202 --> 00:09:24,932
I came by too often. Didn't I?

168
00:09:25,001 --> 00:09:27,401
I'm only getting in your way.

169
00:09:28,342 --> 00:09:29,602
Bye, my daughter.

170
00:09:32,741 --> 00:09:34,311
You're great, but learn
to read the room!

171
00:09:35,281 --> 00:09:37,241
Seoung il!

172
00:09:37,741 --> 00:09:38,851
Woo ri's father!

173
00:09:39,651 --> 00:09:42,321
I know you can't understand
me, but that's my decision.

174
00:09:42,322 --> 00:09:44,422
So please don't try
to talk me out of it.

175
00:09:45,922 --> 00:09:47,352
Are you sure about this?

176
00:09:48,361 --> 00:09:50,021
Are your mother and
grandmother okay with this?

177
00:09:51,062 --> 00:09:53,432
They couldn't understand me at first.

178
00:09:53,432 --> 00:09:55,502
But now, they do. And they
are being supportive.

179
00:09:57,361 --> 00:09:59,131
I don't think I can
ever understand you.

180
00:09:59,871 --> 00:10:01,271
What about Kang jae? What did he say?

181
00:10:01,572 --> 00:10:02,872
He said he supported my decision.

182
00:10:03,271 --> 00:10:04,401
But still.

183
00:10:05,111 --> 00:10:07,841
He respected his girlfriend's
pledge and abstained for her.

184
00:10:07,911 --> 00:10:09,681
But she got pregnant with
another man's child.

185
00:10:09,812 --> 00:10:12,652
And he kept seeing the baby's
father around his girlfriend.

186
00:10:14,011 --> 00:10:17,321
Gosh. Kang jae must be so frustrated.

187
00:10:34,942 --> 00:10:36,242
- Hey.
- You startled me.

188
00:10:37,472 --> 00:10:38,972
What was that?

189
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:40,612
You startled me. Did you get off work?

190
00:10:40,611 --> 00:10:42,411
Yes. What is that?

191
00:10:42,411 --> 00:10:44,211
You didn't even notice
me sneaking up on you.

192
00:10:44,212 --> 00:10:46,282
It's a lead I couldn't figure out.

193
00:10:46,352 --> 00:10:48,422
- What is it?
- It's evidence for a case.

194
00:10:48,422 --> 00:10:49,852
But I can't figure out the numbers.

195
00:10:51,422 --> 00:10:52,522
Me neither.

196
00:10:53,891 --> 00:10:55,821
- If I figure it out, I'll tell you.
- Okay.

197
00:10:58,861 --> 00:11:00,261
- Kang jae.
- Yes.

198
00:11:01,361 --> 00:11:02,661
This is tough on you, right?

199
00:11:03,361 --> 00:11:05,771
Gosh. Was it that obvious?

200
00:11:06,501 --> 00:11:08,571
I'm having a hard time
with the current case.

201
00:11:08,972 --> 00:11:10,272
Not that.

202
00:11:12,572 --> 00:11:15,212
I just thought you must have a
hard time because of my situation.

203
00:11:15,442 --> 00:11:18,042
Why do you say that? Why
would that be tough on me?

204
00:11:18,852 --> 00:11:21,682
Seeing you brings me a lot of
energy even when I'm tired.

205
00:11:24,422 --> 00:11:27,092
- Thank you.
- Why are you thanking me?

206
00:11:27,621 --> 00:11:29,591
Thank you for staying by my side...

207
00:11:29,592 --> 00:11:31,762
And asking me why I'm thanking you.

208
00:11:31,761 --> 00:11:33,791
Come on. What was that?

209
00:11:35,062 --> 00:11:37,032
- Kang jae. Grandma cooked us food.
- Yes?

210
00:11:37,031 --> 00:11:39,931
- Let's go eat.
- Really? What did she cook?

211
00:11:40,172 --> 00:11:41,902
I want to guess it.

212
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:43,701
Kimchi stew. It's kimchi stew, right?

213
00:11:43,702 --> 00:11:45,272
I don't know. Let's just go inside.

214
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:47,271
Come on. Just tell me.

215
00:12:08,802 --> 00:12:10,402
Why did park du pal...

216
00:12:10,501 --> 00:12:12,231
Why did he come here?

217
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:14,501
Should I have just given him
money and sent him on his way?

218
00:12:14,501 --> 00:12:17,001
He asked for a million dollars!
We don't have that kind of money!

219
00:12:17,442 --> 00:12:19,972
Without the money, he would've
caused trouble for ruining his life.

220
00:12:19,972 --> 00:12:23,042
Ruin his life? He doesn't
get to say that!

221
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:25,352
He's responsible for what
happened to your legs!

222
00:12:25,682 --> 00:12:28,052
Don't get so worked up.

223
00:12:28,052 --> 00:12:31,082
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm okay.

224
00:12:34,092 --> 00:12:37,362
Mom, what about you? Are you all right?

225
00:12:37,422 --> 00:12:39,532
I'm all right.

226
00:12:40,731 --> 00:12:42,361
But is he going to be okay?

227
00:12:53,141 --> 00:12:54,911
- What about Kang jae?
- He left.

228
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:56,881
He should have had some
fruit before he went.

229
00:12:56,881 --> 00:12:58,041
He has work.

230
00:13:00,781 --> 00:13:04,051
Mom, it's about Kang jae.

231
00:13:04,422 --> 00:13:06,622
What is it? Did something
happen to him?

232
00:13:06,852 --> 00:13:09,322
No. It's me.

233
00:13:09,761 --> 00:13:12,661
It will be hard to understand
my decision to have this baby.

234
00:13:12,891 --> 00:13:16,001
Whenever we see Raphael,
he'll be uncomfortable.

235
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,302
This must not be easy
for him in many ways.

236
00:13:18,602 --> 00:13:20,202
Obviously.

237
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:22,642
Didn't I tell you? He's a Saint.

238
00:13:23,001 --> 00:13:25,711
No men in Korea would be able
to understand your decision.

239
00:13:25,712 --> 00:13:28,212
My goodness. If you knew that, why
did you enjoy beef so much...

240
00:13:28,212 --> 00:13:30,042
When Raphael bought us the meal?

241
00:13:30,042 --> 00:13:31,542
Mom, you ate more than me.

242
00:13:31,542 --> 00:13:35,622
He always tells me he's okay,
but that makes me feel worse.

243
00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:39,492
Woo ri. In life, there
will be difficult times.

244
00:13:39,491 --> 00:13:41,151
Life isn't all sunshine and rainbows.

245
00:13:41,592 --> 00:13:43,922
At times like this, you're
supposed to take things easy.

246
00:13:44,261 --> 00:13:46,361
Some fresh air and a break...

247
00:13:46,361 --> 00:13:47,761
Will bring you energy.

248
00:13:49,031 --> 00:13:51,601
Kang jae wanted to go camping.

249
00:13:54,702 --> 00:13:55,802
Woo ri.

250
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:59,311
Gosh. Give me that. It's heavy.
How did you carry that?

251
00:13:59,442 --> 00:14:02,442
Gosh. Kang jae, the tent
looks so beautiful.

252
00:14:03,212 --> 00:14:05,182
And the view here is amazing too.

253
00:14:05,312 --> 00:14:06,382
Right?

254
00:14:06,812 --> 00:14:09,482
A senior colleague who loves camping
told me about this amazing spot.

255
00:14:09,881 --> 00:14:12,091
The view is superb, but not a
lot of people know this spot.

256
00:14:12,092 --> 00:14:13,392
So it's quiet. It's the
best camping spot.

257
00:14:13,722 --> 00:14:15,192
Seriously. I love it here.

258
00:14:17,962 --> 00:14:20,192
Wait. Kang jae.

259
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:22,202
- Yes?
- Is it going to rain today?

260
00:14:22,202 --> 00:14:25,202
No. The weather is great today.
What do you mean?

261
00:14:26,702 --> 00:14:28,502
Hey.

262
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:30,601
It is raining.

263
00:14:33,011 --> 00:14:34,471
It's raining too hard.

264
00:14:34,641 --> 00:14:36,511
Kang jae, come in. Don't
stand in the rain.

265
00:14:36,511 --> 00:14:37,541
It should stop soon.

266
00:14:38,182 --> 00:14:40,552
The supercomputer at the
forecast center is useless.

267
00:14:40,552 --> 00:14:41,922
You must be cold.

268
00:14:44,582 --> 00:14:47,492
Hey, you still wear that.

269
00:14:47,491 --> 00:14:48,491
What?

270
00:14:49,161 --> 00:14:50,821
This? What about this?

271
00:14:50,991 --> 00:14:53,761
You were wearing that
when we first met.

272
00:14:54,592 --> 00:14:56,832
Gosh. You remember what I wore?

273
00:14:56,832 --> 00:14:58,972
How could I forget?

274
00:15:01,031 --> 00:15:04,871
Right. We had a spark even
from our first meeting.

275
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:06,971
We must catch this
woman no matter what.

276
00:15:07,212 --> 00:15:09,042
Seriously? Robber beauty?

277
00:15:09,582 --> 00:15:13,182
Hey. Look. Isn't she the robber?

278
00:15:14,682 --> 00:15:17,582
Yes, that's her. She is pretty indeed.

279
00:15:17,822 --> 00:15:18,992
Ms. oh na hyun.

280
00:15:21,422 --> 00:15:23,192
I'm not oh na hyun.

281
00:15:23,962 --> 00:15:25,192
Wait.

282
00:15:34,932 --> 00:15:37,472
- Drop it.
- I want to go home.

283
00:15:37,472 --> 00:15:38,812
Drop it.

284
00:15:43,281 --> 00:15:45,351
You left this.

285
00:15:47,212 --> 00:15:49,752
Again, I'm really sorry. I mean it.

286
00:15:52,391 --> 00:15:56,161
I have a question. Why were
you carrying a big knife?

287
00:15:57,761 --> 00:15:59,631
When I saw the knife, it startled me.

288
00:16:00,761 --> 00:16:03,031
My grandma cuts pork
cutlets with this knife.

289
00:16:03,802 --> 00:16:05,172
She wanted me to sharpen the knife.

290
00:16:05,771 --> 00:16:07,901
I see.

291
00:16:09,271 --> 00:16:12,541
Are you sure you don't want to
report this at the station?

292
00:16:13,771 --> 00:16:15,711
I just want to go home now.

293
00:16:15,712 --> 00:16:19,212
I'm sorry. Please get home safely.

294
00:16:29,161 --> 00:16:31,761
Seriously. I thought I
was going to get fired.

295
00:16:31,761 --> 00:16:33,291
But I could keep my job when
you said you were okay.

296
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:35,232
No, I wasn't okay.

297
00:16:35,231 --> 00:16:37,631
That day, I really didn't
care about anything else...

298
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:39,271
Than getting home right away.

299
00:16:40,072 --> 00:16:41,972
- But I ended up saving your job.
- Yes.

300
00:16:42,741 --> 00:16:45,641
You saved my job, so I'll
bring home the bacon.

301
00:16:46,241 --> 00:16:49,241
Right. You should. I'm getting hungry.

302
00:16:50,481 --> 00:16:51,951
We can't have a barbecue today.

303
00:16:53,911 --> 00:16:55,151
Right.

304
00:16:56,151 --> 00:16:59,051
It's unfortunate we
can't have a barbecue,

305
00:16:59,292 --> 00:17:01,522
but eating outdoors makes
everything taste better.

306
00:17:02,692 --> 00:17:06,692
I'll make you my special pork belly
ramyeon with perilla leaves.

307
00:17:06,792 --> 00:17:09,532
All right. Let's see.

308
00:17:09,532 --> 00:17:12,232
Where's the gas for the portable stove?

309
00:17:15,131 --> 00:17:16,201
What?

310
00:17:17,072 --> 00:17:19,142
What is it? Did we run out of gas?

311
00:17:22,381 --> 00:17:23,881
Why...

312
00:17:24,312 --> 00:17:26,382
I'm sure I packed a gas cartridge.

313
00:17:32,592 --> 00:17:33,692
Woo ri.

314
00:17:35,762 --> 00:17:37,762
Should we wrap up here
and go to a restaurant?

315
00:17:39,562 --> 00:17:40,632
No.

316
00:17:42,131 --> 00:17:44,661
When the rain stops, let's stargaze.

317
00:17:45,062 --> 00:17:46,472
I'm not hungry at all.

318
00:17:52,242 --> 00:17:54,372
- Kang jae.
- Yes?

319
00:17:55,342 --> 00:17:57,712
After that incident,

320
00:17:57,711 --> 00:17:59,751
why did you start coming to church?

321
00:18:01,151 --> 00:18:02,451
Was it to see me?

322
00:18:02,721 --> 00:18:04,181
Oh, that?

323
00:18:05,992 --> 00:18:08,522
Sister, did you like the sermon today?

324
00:18:08,522 --> 00:18:11,692
I happened to see you at
church when I was passing by.

325
00:18:14,691 --> 00:18:16,061
Are you new here?

326
00:18:16,832 --> 00:18:18,632
- Pardon?
- This is great.

327
00:18:18,631 --> 00:18:21,941
Our teaching for new members
will begin this week.

328
00:18:22,971 --> 00:18:24,741
Then someone caught me there,

329
00:18:24,742 --> 00:18:26,442
so I ended up signing up for the class.

330
00:18:26,441 --> 00:18:28,541
- Where do I write my name?
- Write the date first.

331
00:18:28,542 --> 00:18:29,712
Stop lying.

332
00:18:29,982 --> 00:18:31,812
You came to my grandma's
restaurant every day.

333
00:18:31,951 --> 00:18:34,211
If you need more food, let me know.
You're a regular here.

334
00:18:34,211 --> 00:18:37,421
Ma'am, your pork cutlet is tasty.
I can't stay away.

335
00:18:37,552 --> 00:18:38,592
Thanks.

336
00:18:38,592 --> 00:18:40,292
I explained that to you.

337
00:18:40,292 --> 00:18:42,522
I went to the restaurant often
because her pork cutlet was tasty.

338
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:43,991
- I'm home.
- And it happened to be...

339
00:18:44,522 --> 00:18:45,732
Your grandma's restaurant.

340
00:18:45,732 --> 00:18:46,792
What?

341
00:18:47,631 --> 00:18:49,461
- Hey.
- Do you know him?

342
00:18:49,701 --> 00:18:52,201
He comes to our church.

343
00:18:52,201 --> 00:18:55,001
What? Do you go to our church?

344
00:18:57,042 --> 00:18:58,472
I'll go inside.

345
00:19:09,151 --> 00:19:11,851
I see. The knife for the pork cutlets.

346
00:19:14,951 --> 00:19:16,261
She's never had a boyfriend?

347
00:19:16,361 --> 00:19:18,191
I'm not sure she's
never had a boyfriend.

348
00:19:18,992 --> 00:19:20,662
But I've known her since
elementary school.

349
00:19:21,191 --> 00:19:23,131
But she rarely talks to men.

350
00:19:24,861 --> 00:19:26,531
Because of the abstinence pledge?

351
00:19:26,701 --> 00:19:28,501
It's a doctrine of our religion.

352
00:19:28,502 --> 00:19:31,002
But it's not easy to follow
it in our modern times.

353
00:19:31,171 --> 00:19:34,571
Sister Maria is such a pure soul.

354
00:19:35,072 --> 00:19:36,682
She's the pride of our church!

355
00:19:41,052 --> 00:19:42,252
So you get the gist.

356
00:19:48,421 --> 00:19:50,661
How did you feel when you
find out about the pledge?

357
00:19:51,492 --> 00:19:53,862
I just thought that you
were a devout catholic.

358
00:19:55,092 --> 00:19:56,832
I thought you would never date men.

359
00:19:58,262 --> 00:20:01,672
Then why did you ask me
out after two years?

360
00:20:03,002 --> 00:20:07,112
Whenever I saw you at church, I
thought you were a nice person.

361
00:20:08,572 --> 00:20:09,742
So,

362
00:20:09,782 --> 00:20:12,912
I liked seeing you once
a week like that...

363
00:20:14,151 --> 00:20:16,051
Wait.

364
00:20:17,381 --> 00:20:19,421
So, you liked me first?

365
00:20:19,421 --> 00:20:20,591
You liked me before I liked you.

366
00:20:22,562 --> 00:20:23,992
Yes.

367
00:20:25,492 --> 00:20:27,532
I think I really liked you at the time.

368
00:20:28,461 --> 00:20:29,631
Kang jae.

369
00:20:32,371 --> 00:20:34,501
Kang jae, have you heard?

370
00:20:34,901 --> 00:20:36,801
- Maria...
- What about woo ri?

371
00:20:36,802 --> 00:20:39,612
Finally decided to join the convent.

372
00:20:41,871 --> 00:20:43,141
I had no idea.

373
00:20:43,282 --> 00:20:44,912
But thinking I wouldn't be
able to see you anymore,

374
00:20:45,451 --> 00:20:46,581
I could let it go.

375
00:20:58,421 --> 00:20:59,591
Woo ri,

376
00:20:59,992 --> 00:21:01,162
I like you.

377
00:21:02,232 --> 00:21:03,332
Go on a date with me.

378
00:21:11,802 --> 00:21:13,972
So, you liked me first, right?

379
00:21:14,441 --> 00:21:17,441
Yes, I liked you first. I did.

380
00:21:21,611 --> 00:21:25,121
I wasn't going to tell you this.

381
00:21:26,492 --> 00:21:28,892
- But actually...
- What is it?

382
00:21:30,391 --> 00:21:31,791
Well...

383
00:21:32,592 --> 00:21:33,892
Wait, what was that?

384
00:21:35,661 --> 00:21:37,501
The pouring rain.

385
00:21:42,901 --> 00:21:44,541
- What do we do?
- It's raining too much...

386
00:21:44,542 --> 00:21:45,572
That the roof might cave in.

387
00:21:45,572 --> 00:21:47,242
I'm going to drain out the water.
Hold on.

388
00:21:47,272 --> 00:21:48,442
- Be careful.
- Be careful.

389
00:21:50,082 --> 00:21:51,312
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

390
00:21:53,151 --> 00:21:54,211
Are you okay?

391
00:21:56,451 --> 00:21:57,581
Oh, no.

392
00:21:58,082 --> 00:21:59,892
I don't think this will work.
Let's get in the car first.

393
00:21:59,891 --> 00:22:01,621
This won't work. Let's go.

394
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:04,162
Kang jae, you should get some sleep.

395
00:22:04,421 --> 00:22:05,861
Didn't you work late last night?

396
00:22:06,292 --> 00:22:07,462
No, it's okay.

397
00:22:08,062 --> 00:22:10,662
However, it is nice and warm.

398
00:22:14,201 --> 00:22:17,501
The rain needs to stop soon.

399
00:22:18,641 --> 00:22:20,411
To wait until it stops...

400
00:22:23,742 --> 00:22:24,842
Kang jae...

401
00:22:27,312 --> 00:22:28,452
I...

402
00:22:29,651 --> 00:22:31,081
Actually...

403
00:22:40,431 --> 00:22:41,561
It's nothing. Go to sleep.

404
00:22:54,971 --> 00:22:56,141
Help!

405
00:22:56,542 --> 00:22:57,682
Help!

406
00:22:58,242 --> 00:22:59,352
What happened?

407
00:22:59,681 --> 00:23:00,981
She was tased.

408
00:23:00,982 --> 00:23:02,582
Doctor yoo, get the bed ready. Quick.

409
00:23:14,461 --> 00:23:15,761
Hello, Maria.

410
00:23:16,431 --> 00:23:17,601
Wait.

411
00:23:18,701 --> 00:23:20,071
That guy over there.

412
00:23:20,272 --> 00:23:21,672
I think he's here for the first time.

413
00:23:48,492 --> 00:23:49,602
Sister.

414
00:23:50,131 --> 00:23:51,701
Yes, Maria. What is it?

415
00:23:51,961 --> 00:23:54,001
Can I have another...

416
00:23:54,002 --> 00:23:55,402
Volunteer application for the convent?

417
00:23:56,901 --> 00:23:58,271
You just got one earlier.

418
00:23:59,342 --> 00:24:00,612
Well...

419
00:24:03,611 --> 00:24:05,311
Someone just ripped it.

420
00:24:09,052 --> 00:24:10,182
Woo ri.

421
00:24:10,951 --> 00:24:12,151
Woo ri.

422
00:24:13,792 --> 00:24:14,992
Yes?

423
00:24:15,992 --> 00:24:17,122
The rain stopped.

424
00:24:19,992 --> 00:24:21,962
It did.

425
00:24:22,762 --> 00:24:24,002
Let's go outside.

426
00:24:25,262 --> 00:24:26,472
Okay.

427
00:24:29,671 --> 00:24:30,971
Woo ri, let's go quickly.

428
00:24:31,502 --> 00:24:33,512
It's cold.

429
00:25:19,191 --> 00:25:20,351
My head.

430
00:25:23,322 --> 00:25:24,462
What is this?

431
00:25:26,262 --> 00:25:27,732
What is this?

432
00:25:29,232 --> 00:25:30,902
- Mom.
- Yes?

433
00:25:31,631 --> 00:25:33,301
- He woke up.
- Hey.

434
00:25:33,832 --> 00:25:34,902
Let me free.

435
00:25:35,971 --> 00:25:37,601
You think you'll get away with this?

436
00:25:39,512 --> 00:25:41,212
I should have covered his mouth.

437
00:25:42,211 --> 00:25:43,481
I forgot to do that.

438
00:25:43,482 --> 00:25:44,982
Should I knock him out again?

439
00:25:45,111 --> 00:25:46,281
Let me see that.

440
00:26:00,792 --> 00:26:04,062
- Did you just hit me?
- He fainted the last time I hit.

441
00:26:04,762 --> 00:26:05,932
Why don't you try it?

442
00:26:09,641 --> 00:26:10,771
- Take that.
- Gosh.

443
00:26:10,971 --> 00:26:12,971
That won't do the trick!

444
00:26:13,042 --> 00:26:15,442
You need to hit him
harder to put him out.

445
00:26:15,471 --> 00:26:16,611
Give it to me.

446
00:26:16,611 --> 00:26:19,151
No, stop it. It hurts.

447
00:26:21,852 --> 00:26:24,282
Darn it. Isn't there something else?

448
00:26:26,292 --> 00:26:27,552
What about a hammer?

449
00:26:27,852 --> 00:26:28,952
A hammer?

450
00:26:29,161 --> 00:26:30,391
Wouldn't a golf club be better?

451
00:26:30,492 --> 00:26:31,822
- No, wait. I'll just bring both.
- Wait!

452
00:26:36,861 --> 00:26:38,031
Stop hitting me.

453
00:26:39,631 --> 00:26:40,701
I'm sorry.

454
00:26:42,941 --> 00:26:48,071
How did she live?

455
00:26:49,342 --> 00:26:51,342
Even when I ask her

456
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:54,911
for the reason

457
00:26:56,951 --> 00:27:03,721
ok gyeong yi has her head down

458
00:27:06,232 --> 00:27:08,232
gosh. Isn't that choi seoung il?

459
00:27:10,232 --> 00:27:11,362
Is that really choi seoung il?

460
00:27:11,361 --> 00:27:12,771
Is that really choi seoung il?

461
00:27:16,242 --> 00:27:18,242
Who's this? Aren't you choi seoung il?

462
00:27:18,371 --> 00:27:19,511
It is.

463
00:27:19,671 --> 00:27:20,971
What brings you here?

464
00:27:21,242 --> 00:27:22,942
Please, have some of this.

465
00:27:28,352 --> 00:27:29,682
How come you are here?

466
00:27:29,822 --> 00:27:31,722
Are you shooting a scene here?

467
00:27:31,721 --> 00:27:32,991
No, I'm not.

468
00:27:33,522 --> 00:27:34,622
I'm...

469
00:27:37,592 --> 00:27:40,032
Friends with Ms. oh eun ran.

470
00:27:42,361 --> 00:27:44,431
How do you know each other?

471
00:27:45,232 --> 00:27:46,772
Well, in middle school...

472
00:27:48,802 --> 00:27:50,042
Actually,

473
00:27:50,072 --> 00:27:52,002
I really liked her in middle school.

474
00:27:56,181 --> 00:27:58,441
One thing led to another,

475
00:27:58,711 --> 00:28:01,251
I became more famous than eun ran.

476
00:28:01,252 --> 00:28:04,452
But eun ran was a star back then.

477
00:28:04,852 --> 00:28:06,922
She's pretty...

478
00:28:06,921 --> 00:28:08,051
And good at singing.

479
00:28:09,052 --> 00:28:11,592
Boys from other schools...

480
00:28:11,592 --> 00:28:12,692
Came to see her.

481
00:28:12,792 --> 00:28:14,032
Gosh.

482
00:28:14,961 --> 00:28:16,031
As for me,

483
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:18,761
I was just happy...

484
00:28:20,232 --> 00:28:23,172
- When she talked to me.
- That's so sweet.

485
00:28:23,471 --> 00:28:24,671
That's nice.

486
00:28:30,881 --> 00:28:32,211
- This is nice.
- It is?

487
00:28:32,881 --> 00:28:34,481
- Look.
- Oh, how cute.

488
00:28:34,482 --> 00:28:35,982
- They are so cute.
- Hi.

489
00:28:50,961 --> 00:28:52,401
- It looks so good.
- It does.

490
00:28:58,641 --> 00:28:59,741
Whose is it?

491
00:28:59,742 --> 00:29:01,342
- Mister.
- Kang jae, here.

492
00:29:01,342 --> 00:29:02,942
Haven't you lost your wallet?

493
00:29:03,042 --> 00:29:04,182
Gosh, it's gone.

494
00:29:04,812 --> 00:29:06,412
- That looks like mine.
- Here you go.

495
00:29:06,512 --> 00:29:07,612
Thank you.

496
00:29:19,992 --> 00:29:21,562
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

497
00:29:26,332 --> 00:29:27,702
I like this about you.

498
00:29:27,931 --> 00:29:29,031
What's there to like about me?

499
00:29:29,032 --> 00:29:31,302
You're so kind and don't lie.

500
00:29:31,671 --> 00:29:32,971
And that's why you have all the luck.

501
00:29:33,371 --> 00:29:35,241
No, you're kinder.

502
00:29:35,542 --> 00:29:36,712
And you're the one who doesn't lie.

503
00:29:37,441 --> 00:29:40,251
Yes, I like that we don't hide
anything from each other.

504
00:29:41,082 --> 00:29:43,682
If I didn't tell you about
meeting Raphael before,

505
00:29:43,921 --> 00:29:46,521
you wouldn't have known about it.

506
00:29:46,721 --> 00:29:48,021
But I didn't want to keep it from you.

507
00:29:48,621 --> 00:29:50,121
You did the right thing.

508
00:29:50,921 --> 00:29:52,931
There's nothing to fight about
if we don't lie to each other.

509
00:29:54,961 --> 00:29:56,531
Oh, right. Listen to this.

510
00:29:56,532 --> 00:29:57,832
Ms. Lee ma ri had an affair...

511
00:29:57,832 --> 00:30:00,272
With the guy that was
murdered at the hospital.

512
00:30:00,302 --> 00:30:01,602
I think that's why they're
getting a divorce.

513
00:30:01,871 --> 00:30:03,041
Did you know?

514
00:30:06,272 --> 00:30:08,142
What? Did you already know about it?

515
00:30:08,471 --> 00:30:10,041
No, I didn't.

516
00:30:10,641 --> 00:30:12,281
That's shocking.

517
00:30:12,282 --> 00:30:15,882
Kang jae, let's not hide
anything from each other...

518
00:30:15,881 --> 00:30:18,551
And not lie to each other.

519
00:30:19,891 --> 00:30:21,591
I will.

520
00:30:24,562 --> 00:30:28,832
Kang jae, I'll try not to meet Raphael.

521
00:30:28,931 --> 00:30:29,931
Why?

522
00:30:30,131 --> 00:30:31,731
I think you would meet him
often because of the baby.

523
00:30:32,062 --> 00:30:35,332
Well, I think I can
sympathize with you.

524
00:30:36,141 --> 00:30:37,741
I'll try to minimize the meetings.

525
00:30:37,742 --> 00:30:40,412
But if I do, I'll tell you about it.

526
00:30:40,742 --> 00:30:42,782
That way I think you
won't feel bad about it.

527
00:30:44,111 --> 00:30:45,711
Thank you for thinking about me.

528
00:30:45,982 --> 00:30:48,352
You think about me more.

529
00:30:49,482 --> 00:30:52,322
Having a trip with you is so nice.

530
00:30:52,322 --> 00:30:53,552
- You like it?
- Yes.

531
00:30:53,552 --> 00:30:55,352
Where shall we go the next time?

532
00:30:58,092 --> 00:31:00,562
We took a lot of pictures on our trip.

533
00:31:01,532 --> 00:31:02,902
Thinking about it,

534
00:31:02,961 --> 00:31:04,931
I don't think we take as
much as other couples.

535
00:31:05,732 --> 00:31:08,972
We can go on more trips and
take more pictures from now on.

536
00:31:09,802 --> 00:31:11,902
Yes, let's do that.

537
00:31:12,342 --> 00:31:15,112
I think I'll remember this
trip for a long time.

538
00:31:15,111 --> 00:31:16,211
Why is that?

539
00:31:16,681 --> 00:31:19,611
Is it because we got
drenched in the rain?

540
00:31:19,611 --> 00:31:20,681
Yes.

541
00:31:23,121 --> 00:31:26,921
Well, it's because it's
our first trip together.

542
00:31:27,252 --> 00:31:28,422
Me too.

543
00:31:29,092 --> 00:31:30,892
I think I'll remember
this for a long time.

544
00:31:31,861 --> 00:31:34,061
Kang jae, should we take
a picture together?

545
00:31:34,062 --> 00:31:35,862
- Now?
- No.

546
00:31:35,861 --> 00:31:39,261
You know couples get their picture
taken at a studio these days.

547
00:31:39,701 --> 00:31:41,371
- They looked pretty.
- I saw it on social media.

548
00:31:41,371 --> 00:31:42,431
They were pretty.

549
00:31:42,431 --> 00:31:44,141
Yes, let's do it.

550
00:31:44,842 --> 00:31:46,772
I like pictures...

551
00:31:47,242 --> 00:31:50,512
Because people take pictures
when they are happy.

552
00:31:51,211 --> 00:31:55,581
But when you live life, you'll
have difficult moments.

553
00:31:55,951 --> 00:31:59,181
Then you can look at the pictures
and remember the happy moments...

554
00:31:59,181 --> 00:32:00,351
To get motivated again.

555
00:32:01,092 --> 00:32:03,862
I want to take lots of
happy pictures with you.

556
00:32:05,721 --> 00:32:08,491
Yes, let's do that.

557
00:32:15,332 --> 00:32:16,372
What?

558
00:32:16,871 --> 00:32:18,101
Look at that.

559
00:32:18,342 --> 00:32:19,342
What is it?

560
00:32:19,441 --> 00:32:21,211
Isn't that the number you said before?

561
00:32:32,022 --> 00:32:33,092
Na hee.

562
00:32:33,891 --> 00:32:36,161
Kang jae, aren't you
on leave until today?

563
00:32:36,292 --> 00:32:38,792
- Take a look at this.
- What is it?

564
00:32:38,792 --> 00:32:41,692
The memo I showed you last time
was written by shin mi young.

565
00:32:41,691 --> 00:32:42,731
I found what it was.

566
00:32:43,701 --> 00:32:46,031
Look, it's a number for
shipping containers.

567
00:32:46,772 --> 00:32:49,502
There is something in the container
coming in at pier 3 in incheon.

568
00:32:49,502 --> 00:32:52,072
I'm certain that products related
to chairman Kim will arrive.

569
00:32:53,242 --> 00:32:55,012
We can confiscate it
after we report it.

570
00:32:56,842 --> 00:32:58,412
I think we can reveal
what it is right away.

571
00:32:58,411 --> 00:33:01,481
- No, we can't report it.
- Excuse me?

572
00:33:01,482 --> 00:33:03,682
If we report it, it will go to
customs and get investigated.

573
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:06,552
Then, we lose another chance of
getting evidence on chairman Kim.

574
00:33:07,352 --> 00:33:09,222
Let's first see what is in it.

575
00:33:09,721 --> 00:33:11,791
And when we can prove it has
something to do with him,

576
00:33:12,062 --> 00:33:13,262
we can report it then.

577
00:33:14,292 --> 00:33:15,332
All right.

578
00:33:16,262 --> 00:33:17,562
I'll help you out that day.

579
00:33:17,661 --> 00:33:19,331
I trust your detective's hunch.

580
00:33:20,532 --> 00:33:23,642
Here we go. Sorry to keep you waiting.

581
00:33:24,842 --> 00:33:27,772
I said I'd cook for you.
You didn't have to cook.

582
00:33:27,772 --> 00:33:30,882
Mother, this is Western noodles.

583
00:33:30,881 --> 00:33:34,151
It's spaghetti. You
think I wouldn't know?

584
00:33:34,151 --> 00:33:36,921
Mother, you're so modern.

585
00:33:37,582 --> 00:33:39,652
Go ahead, try it.

586
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:42,352
- What's this?
- What?

587
00:33:43,322 --> 00:33:44,692
Did you wash the pasta noodles?

588
00:33:44,691 --> 00:33:46,831
The sauce won't go with the
noodles if you wash them.

589
00:33:46,832 --> 00:33:49,032
I have certifications
for Western cuisine.

590
00:33:49,131 --> 00:33:52,731
Eun ran, why did I say I'd cook?

591
00:33:52,732 --> 00:33:55,072
That's why I told you
we should eat out.

592
00:33:55,072 --> 00:33:57,742
- Maybe we should’ve.
- You should've listened to me.

593
00:33:59,141 --> 00:34:00,711
I'm home.

594
00:34:02,272 --> 00:34:05,482
- You came.
- Yes, I heard you went on a trip.

595
00:34:05,482 --> 00:34:07,352
- How was it?
- It was good.

596
00:34:08,552 --> 00:34:12,082
Did you eat? I cooked.

597
00:34:12,482 --> 00:34:14,192
Why don't you try some?

598
00:34:14,192 --> 00:34:16,292
No, it's okay. I ate already.

599
00:34:16,522 --> 00:34:19,262
- Okay.
- Then why don't you go in and rest?

600
00:34:20,661 --> 00:34:23,961
I just want to sit here
together, that's all.

601
00:34:24,732 --> 00:34:26,032
Right.

602
00:34:26,371 --> 00:34:28,671
Sitting here all together...

603
00:34:28,672 --> 00:34:30,772
Feels good like we're a family.

604
00:34:32,772 --> 00:34:36,712
Mother, we're not like a family,
we are a complete family.

605
00:34:38,942 --> 00:34:42,752
I wish nothing but for
you two to find success.

606
00:34:43,422 --> 00:34:44,952
- Seoung il...
- Yes?

607
00:34:44,951 --> 00:34:47,091
Why did you kiss her before?

608
00:34:48,352 --> 00:34:49,352
Excuse me?

609
00:34:49,692 --> 00:34:51,822
Who? Someone kissed?

610
00:34:51,891 --> 00:34:54,461
Mom, stop talking nonsense.

611
00:34:55,362 --> 00:34:56,902
We don't have pickles.

612
00:34:56,902 --> 00:34:58,662
Yes, go and get some.

613
00:35:00,531 --> 00:35:04,441
- Did you kiss her?
- What? Gosh, no.

614
00:35:04,701 --> 00:35:06,611
Did you kiss him on your
trip to gangwon-do?

615
00:35:06,612 --> 00:35:09,042
- Out of the blue?
- Out of the blue?

616
00:35:09,172 --> 00:35:11,642
Mother, have you kissed recently?

617
00:35:13,482 --> 00:35:14,882
Me? Why do you ask?

618
00:35:19,252 --> 00:35:20,392
Do you want me to bring
it to you right now?

619
00:35:20,391 --> 00:35:22,491
No, it's okay. I don't
need it right now.

620
00:35:23,062 --> 00:35:24,762
You must be tired. Go and rest.

621
00:35:25,422 --> 00:35:27,032
You can give it to me later.

622
00:35:27,132 --> 00:35:29,062
All right.

623
00:35:31,502 --> 00:35:32,632
What are you going to do now?

624
00:35:33,701 --> 00:35:35,801
I'll tidy up and go to bed.

625
00:35:37,871 --> 00:35:39,771
Kang jae, I have a call coming in.

626
00:35:39,772 --> 00:35:41,642
All right, bye.

627
00:35:41,641 --> 00:35:43,141
Bye. Good night.

628
00:35:49,352 --> 00:35:50,422
Hello?

629
00:35:50,422 --> 00:35:53,222
Ms. oh, I'm here.

630
00:35:53,221 --> 00:35:55,021
Excuse me? Where?

631
00:35:56,862 --> 00:35:57,892
Hey.

632
00:35:58,062 --> 00:35:59,962
Sir.

633
00:36:01,991 --> 00:36:04,661
Hello. Please, sit down.

634
00:36:04,931 --> 00:36:06,061
Sure.

635
00:36:08,602 --> 00:36:10,072
I told him to come.

636
00:36:10,341 --> 00:36:11,941
I wanted to discuss something with you.

637
00:36:13,511 --> 00:36:17,241
No matter how I look at it,
something still bothers me.

638
00:36:17,712 --> 00:36:20,112
- What is it?
- More than anything,

639
00:36:20,112 --> 00:36:22,352
I think we should sue...

640
00:36:23,752 --> 00:36:25,682
The ob-gyn doctor.

641
00:36:32,221 --> 00:36:34,231
It'll be all right.
Things will get better.

642
00:36:34,562 --> 00:36:38,032
And since we have Raphael on your side.

643
00:36:39,672 --> 00:36:41,402
With you next to her...

644
00:36:52,911 --> 00:36:54,251
Thank you.

645
00:36:57,181 --> 00:36:59,551
- Did Raphael leave?
- Yes.

646
00:37:00,821 --> 00:37:02,521
Are they suing the hospital?

647
00:37:03,091 --> 00:37:04,121
Yes.

648
00:37:05,292 --> 00:37:07,932
You have to take care of this
so woo ri won't get hurt.

649
00:37:09,192 --> 00:37:10,262
I will.

650
00:37:12,301 --> 00:37:13,671
It's nice to have you around.

651
00:37:15,832 --> 00:37:16,902
What?

652
00:37:18,471 --> 00:37:20,171
You are of help to my daughter.

653
00:37:20,871 --> 00:37:22,871
And you're nice to my mom.

654
00:37:23,582 --> 00:37:24,612
Sure.

655
00:37:26,212 --> 00:37:29,312
I just regret the fact I
couldn't do this earlier.

656
00:37:47,832 --> 00:37:49,942
- It's getting late. You should go.
- I should.

657
00:37:51,071 --> 00:37:52,171
Go.

658
00:37:54,511 --> 00:37:56,411
You're the one who held my hand first.

659
00:37:57,442 --> 00:37:58,482
Bye.

660
00:38:02,281 --> 00:38:03,681
Why isn't he answering?

661
00:38:05,982 --> 00:38:08,352
Do you know how many times
you're calling today?

662
00:38:08,352 --> 00:38:09,692
I'm sorry.

663
00:38:10,161 --> 00:38:12,661
This never happened before.

664
00:38:12,721 --> 00:38:15,461
If you're that worried,
go see him after work.

665
00:38:16,931 --> 00:38:18,961
And buy some his favorite
tteokbokki on your way there.

666
00:38:21,272 --> 00:38:23,972
Hello.

667
00:38:24,371 --> 00:38:26,301
- Hello.
- Woo ri?

668
00:38:26,301 --> 00:38:29,781
Hello. Please, share
this with everyone.

669
00:38:29,781 --> 00:38:30,941
Thank you.

670
00:38:32,181 --> 00:38:33,651
Where's Kang jae?

671
00:38:34,152 --> 00:38:36,552
I think he went somewhere.

672
00:38:36,551 --> 00:38:37,751
Why don't you call him?

673
00:38:38,852 --> 00:38:40,852
I couldn't get a hold of him today.

674
00:38:42,051 --> 00:38:44,361
I don't think he's on
his good side today.

675
00:38:45,192 --> 00:38:46,662
He was given a reprimand.

676
00:38:47,062 --> 00:38:49,132
- Why?
- You are a witness as well...

677
00:38:49,132 --> 00:38:50,962
In the diamond medical
foundation murder case.

678
00:38:51,431 --> 00:38:53,971
No man chul's mistress was Lee ma ri,

679
00:38:54,071 --> 00:38:55,971
the foundation's son's wife.

680
00:38:56,031 --> 00:38:57,401
And he didn't report it.

681
00:38:58,801 --> 00:39:00,171
Ms. Lee ma ri had an affair...

682
00:39:00,172 --> 00:39:02,642
With the guy that was
murdered at the hospital.

683
00:39:02,641 --> 00:39:04,241
I think that's why they
are getting a divorce.

684
00:39:04,241 --> 00:39:05,611
Did you know?

685
00:39:05,612 --> 00:39:07,212
No, I didn't.

686
00:39:07,652 --> 00:39:09,552
That is shocking.

687
00:39:10,882 --> 00:39:13,252
He even took pictures
of them together...

688
00:39:13,352 --> 00:39:15,052
But received disciplinary action
because he didn't report it.

689
00:39:15,522 --> 00:39:17,262
I think he'll be upset.

690
00:39:17,891 --> 00:39:18,961
Woo ri.

691
00:39:26,031 --> 00:39:28,031
Woo ri.

692
00:39:29,172 --> 00:39:30,542
Why did you lie about it?

693
00:39:30,542 --> 00:39:32,042
It's about an open case.

694
00:39:32,042 --> 00:39:33,372
I can't tell you everything.

695
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:34,571
Did you lie...

696
00:39:35,172 --> 00:39:37,582
Because you thought I
wouldn't hand over the baby?

697
00:39:40,712 --> 00:39:41,782
Woo ri.

698
00:39:42,451 --> 00:39:43,581
That's not it, right?

699
00:39:44,221 --> 00:39:45,621
That can't be.

700
00:39:45,752 --> 00:39:47,822
You can't lie.

701
00:39:51,462 --> 00:39:52,562
I'm sorry.

702
00:39:55,062 --> 00:39:56,492
It was my bad.

703
00:39:58,602 --> 00:40:01,172
So please, don't be upset.

704
00:40:09,141 --> 00:40:11,041
I'm not angry.

705
00:40:12,741 --> 00:40:14,481
I'm not mad at you.

706
00:40:16,681 --> 00:40:20,091
I don't know what I'm
feeling right now,

707
00:40:22,422 --> 00:40:23,862
but I want to be alone.

708
00:40:39,871 --> 00:40:40,941
What was that?

709
00:40:40,942 --> 00:40:42,672
Was that woo ri just now?

710
00:40:43,781 --> 00:40:44,941
It was woo ri, right?

711
00:40:48,482 --> 00:40:49,682
Woo ri.

712
00:40:50,422 --> 00:40:51,582
What's the matter?

713
00:40:51,681 --> 00:40:53,121
- Did something happen?
- What is it?

714
00:40:53,522 --> 00:40:54,652
What's wrong?

715
00:40:57,192 --> 00:40:58,492
Stop crying!

716
00:40:59,022 --> 00:41:00,662
Calm down and tell us what happened.

717
00:41:00,792 --> 00:41:02,632
Kang jae...

718
00:41:03,701 --> 00:41:06,461
Lied to me.

719
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:10,172
What should I do?

720
00:41:10,741 --> 00:41:13,871
Woo ri, it's completely normal
for couples to argue and fight.

721
00:41:13,871 --> 00:41:15,171
I mean, it's only natural.

722
00:41:15,612 --> 00:41:17,482
You guys were the odd
ones for never fighting.

723
00:41:17,582 --> 00:41:19,012
It's okay, woo ri.

724
00:41:19,141 --> 00:41:20,851
Did you two fight
because he lied to you?

725
00:41:21,181 --> 00:41:23,181
Are you mad at him because
you feel deceived?

726
00:41:25,382 --> 00:41:26,652
No.

727
00:41:27,321 --> 00:41:29,691
That's not why I'm upset.

728
00:41:30,091 --> 00:41:31,321
It's the opposite.

729
00:41:32,562 --> 00:41:35,232
I feel so bad for Kang jae.

730
00:41:35,991 --> 00:41:39,061
He lied because of me.

731
00:41:39,301 --> 00:41:41,331
I feel horrible.

732
00:41:41,931 --> 00:41:46,571
I feel so bad that I don't
even know what to do.

733
00:42:00,352 --> 00:42:02,922
You can't resolve this by
just avoiding me like this.

734
00:42:03,051 --> 00:42:04,061
Sign the divorce papers now.

735
00:42:06,591 --> 00:42:07,891
I'm sorry,

736
00:42:07,891 --> 00:42:09,331
but I don't want to.

737
00:42:09,462 --> 00:42:11,932
If you refuse to sign the
papers, I will sue you.

738
00:42:12,462 --> 00:42:13,802
Let's just get a divorce!

739
00:42:13,801 --> 00:42:15,971
If we let this go to court,
it'll be very stressful.

740
00:42:15,971 --> 00:42:17,641
It'll bring out the worst in us,

741
00:42:17,641 --> 00:42:19,471
and it'll take a while for
the case to be resolved.

742
00:42:19,641 --> 00:42:21,411
If the baby is born during
the legal battle...

743
00:42:24,141 --> 00:42:26,281
Maybe I should sue you to get
full custody of the baby.

744
00:42:28,951 --> 00:42:30,621
Have you really lost your mind?

745
00:42:31,652 --> 00:42:34,022
Just change your mind.
That'd be much faster.

746
00:42:36,152 --> 00:42:38,292
Well, then...

747
00:42:39,192 --> 00:42:40,632
I'm off.

748
00:42:46,402 --> 00:42:47,572
How did it go?

749
00:42:47,632 --> 00:42:49,132
What do you think?

750
00:42:49,531 --> 00:42:52,901
Like you said, he has no
choice but to follow my lead.

751
00:42:53,071 --> 00:42:55,511
I've snatched up the steering wheel.

752
00:42:55,511 --> 00:42:56,881
Nice, that's great.

753
00:42:56,882 --> 00:42:58,712
Sounds like everything's
going smoothly.

754
00:42:58,712 --> 00:43:00,752
Well done, my princess.

755
00:43:07,051 --> 00:43:08,591
Now, I just need him gone.

756
00:43:08,821 --> 00:43:10,091
One thing at a time.

757
00:43:11,091 --> 00:43:13,561
We must get rid of those
who should be gone.

758
00:43:14,431 --> 00:43:15,591
Get rid of him?

759
00:43:16,332 --> 00:43:17,502
Mom.

760
00:43:20,232 --> 00:43:21,302
Can you do it?

761
00:43:22,071 --> 00:43:24,771
The first time won't
be easy for anyone.

762
00:43:25,571 --> 00:43:26,811
However,

763
00:43:27,942 --> 00:43:29,872
if it must be done,

764
00:43:29,871 --> 00:43:32,011
anyone can and will do it.

765
00:43:44,792 --> 00:43:45,922
Is this your relative's place?

766
00:43:46,321 --> 00:43:48,631
How... how did you find me here?

767
00:43:50,602 --> 00:43:52,032
Seriously, don't be like this.

768
00:43:52,761 --> 00:43:54,631
I'm afraid I'd turn
into you at this rate.

769
00:43:57,902 --> 00:43:59,072
Let's get a divorce.

770
00:43:59,942 --> 00:44:01,172
Darn it.

771
00:44:01,172 --> 00:44:02,412
Seriously!

772
00:44:07,752 --> 00:44:08,912
You little...

773
00:44:09,712 --> 00:44:12,252
- Help!
- Shut it!

774
00:44:14,221 --> 00:44:15,391
What's that sound?

775
00:44:16,221 --> 00:44:18,291
What? I didn't hear anything.

776
00:44:18,292 --> 00:44:19,762
Didn't someone call out for help...

777
00:44:19,761 --> 00:44:20,961
What are you talking about?

778
00:44:20,962 --> 00:44:22,432
I didn't hear anything.

779
00:44:24,031 --> 00:44:25,501
Help!

780
00:44:25,632 --> 00:44:26,802
- See? I heard it again...
- No!

781
00:44:26,801 --> 00:44:28,831
It's the TV.

782
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:29,872
No, just now...

783
00:44:29,871 --> 00:44:32,141
Seriously! What's the matter with you?

784
00:44:32,641 --> 00:44:33,871
Hey, what's with you?

785
00:44:34,141 --> 00:44:35,911
Let's talk inside. Who
else is home with you?

786
00:44:35,911 --> 00:44:38,641
No one! It's just me.

787
00:44:38,641 --> 00:44:40,481
- Let's talk inside.
- Gosh, seriously!

788
00:44:40,911 --> 00:44:42,181
Give me that.

789
00:44:44,152 --> 00:44:46,582
Here! We're good now, right?

790
00:44:46,652 --> 00:44:47,852
Leave!

791
00:45:00,832 --> 00:45:01,932
Did he leave?

792
00:45:02,732 --> 00:45:04,942
Park du pal! It's all your fault!

793
00:45:05,641 --> 00:45:07,611
Mom, what do I do?

794
00:45:07,971 --> 00:45:10,441
- Did he find out?
- I'm doomed now.

795
00:45:10,442 --> 00:45:12,912
I signed the divorce papers!

796
00:45:13,042 --> 00:45:14,652
Why did you do that?

797
00:45:15,681 --> 00:45:16,951
Give me that.

798
00:45:20,991 --> 00:45:22,891
You moron!

799
00:45:22,891 --> 00:45:25,791
You ruined everything!

800
00:46:18,582 --> 00:46:20,282
Hello, sir.

801
00:46:23,882 --> 00:46:27,322
Is it something you can't
tell me over the phone?

802
00:46:29,652 --> 00:46:30,722
Oh, really?

803
00:46:32,062 --> 00:46:33,222
Come on in.

804
00:46:34,031 --> 00:46:35,531
But why...

805
00:46:35,531 --> 00:46:37,701
This way. This will only take a moment.

806
00:46:40,301 --> 00:46:41,901
- It's this room here.
- Okay.

807
00:46:43,301 --> 00:46:44,571
Come in.

808
00:46:48,212 --> 00:46:50,012
I wanted to show you this room.

809
00:46:50,241 --> 00:46:52,281
It's so cute!

810
00:46:53,082 --> 00:46:54,652
I decorated the room myself.

811
00:46:54,911 --> 00:46:57,421
Every day after work, I went
shopping to buy things one by one...

812
00:46:57,422 --> 00:46:58,552
And decorated the room.

813
00:46:59,022 --> 00:47:00,722
I did everything myself.

814
00:47:02,252 --> 00:47:04,222
This must've been a lot of work.

815
00:47:04,221 --> 00:47:06,461
You did an amazing job.

816
00:47:08,491 --> 00:47:09,631
Ms. oh.

817
00:47:10,502 --> 00:47:11,732
My wife and I got a divorce.

818
00:47:12,562 --> 00:47:14,632
But I made the decision
for the baby's sake.

819
00:47:15,502 --> 00:47:18,342
I promise you that I'll create the
best environment for the baby.

820
00:47:18,741 --> 00:47:20,341
I will make sure to
build an environment...

821
00:47:20,971 --> 00:47:23,981
That's much better than the one my
wife and I could've given the child.

822
00:47:25,482 --> 00:47:26,612
Okay.

823
00:47:28,482 --> 00:47:29,812
I'll do my best too.

824
00:47:33,582 --> 00:47:34,692
Look at this.

825
00:47:36,221 --> 00:47:37,521
It's so cute!

826
00:47:42,161 --> 00:47:43,831
You should see this too.

827
00:48:08,591 --> 00:48:10,521
- Hi, Kang jae.
- Hey, woo ri.

828
00:48:11,321 --> 00:48:12,591
Can you talk now?

829
00:48:12,721 --> 00:48:14,631
- Yes.
- Great.

830
00:48:14,632 --> 00:48:16,792
- What were you up to?
- Me?

831
00:48:17,362 --> 00:48:18,502
I was...

832
00:48:19,002 --> 00:48:21,902
I came out to do some research.

833
00:48:23,102 --> 00:48:25,072
I see. Well...

834
00:48:25,741 --> 00:48:27,211
Are you free this evening?

835
00:48:28,411 --> 00:48:29,571
Can we meet and talk?

836
00:48:29,571 --> 00:48:31,841
What? Sure.

837
00:48:32,982 --> 00:48:34,212
I'll call you when I get off.

838
00:48:34,781 --> 00:48:35,881
Okay.

839
00:48:43,862 --> 00:48:44,922
Woo ri.

840
00:48:46,792 --> 00:48:47,932
Do you want a ride?

841
00:48:50,232 --> 00:48:51,602
I'm going to take the subway.

842
00:48:55,971 --> 00:48:57,841
Let's talk.

843
00:48:57,942 --> 00:48:59,742
I have nothing to say to you.

844
00:49:00,471 --> 00:49:01,641
Why?

845
00:49:01,911 --> 00:49:03,411
Because it's my fault that we split up?

846
00:49:03,942 --> 00:49:05,282
So you don't even want to talk?

847
00:49:10,352 --> 00:49:12,052
You said you wanted the baby.

848
00:49:12,051 --> 00:49:14,191
You said you were desperate.
So why did you do that?

849
00:49:14,652 --> 00:49:15,852
Woo ri.

850
00:49:16,522 --> 00:49:18,522
Don't run your mouth if you
don't know what's going on.

851
00:49:18,522 --> 00:49:20,492
You cheated on your husband
and faked an assault.

852
00:49:20,862 --> 00:49:23,032
You said you wanted the baby.
Was it all an act?

853
00:49:24,402 --> 00:49:25,562
An act?

854
00:49:26,201 --> 00:49:27,901
This is ridiculous.

855
00:49:28,531 --> 00:49:30,501
Clearly, you don't know
who's putting on an act.

856
00:49:30,902 --> 00:49:32,002
Hey.

857
00:49:33,042 --> 00:49:35,612
I bet you don't know that
your boyfriend helped me.

858
00:49:36,241 --> 00:49:37,811
Lee Kang jae...

859
00:49:37,882 --> 00:49:40,712
Covered it up, fully knowing that
I had an affair with no man chul.

860
00:49:41,951 --> 00:49:43,051
What did you say?

861
00:49:43,051 --> 00:49:44,581
Of course, you didn't know.

862
00:49:44,752 --> 00:49:46,552
I heard he didn't even
tell his higher-ups.

863
00:49:46,882 --> 00:49:48,822
Why do you think he did that?

864
00:49:49,292 --> 00:49:51,162
Obviously, he was afraid...

865
00:49:51,161 --> 00:49:53,721
He'd have to raise the child
should you decide to keep it.

866
00:49:54,562 --> 00:49:56,892
I guess he really didn't
want to raise the child.

867
00:49:58,862 --> 00:50:00,002
Are you surprised?

868
00:50:01,272 --> 00:50:04,002
See? He's the one who
got you real good.

869
00:50:05,272 --> 00:50:06,602
What a relief.

870
00:50:07,971 --> 00:50:09,071
What?

871
00:50:10,582 --> 00:50:13,282
I'm truly relieved that my baby...

872
00:50:14,482 --> 00:50:16,052
Will not have a mother like you.

873
00:50:19,582 --> 00:50:20,892
That little...

874
00:50:23,121 --> 00:50:24,161
Darn it.

875
00:51:01,161 --> 00:51:02,261
Woo ri.

876
00:51:04,661 --> 00:51:05,901
I'm sorry.

877
00:51:07,801 --> 00:51:09,601
I should've been honest with you.

878
00:51:12,241 --> 00:51:14,611
I was just being a coward.
I guess I'm scared.

879
00:51:16,641 --> 00:51:18,441
You see, if you end
up raising the baby,

880
00:51:19,612 --> 00:51:22,182
all our promises and plans...

881
00:51:24,582 --> 00:51:26,752
We wouldn't be able to do any
of that, and I didn't like it.

882
00:51:29,022 --> 00:51:30,692
That's why I couldn't tell you.

883
00:51:37,402 --> 00:51:39,532
We never kept secrets from each other.

884
00:51:41,402 --> 00:51:43,802
And before this, I had
never once lied to you.

885
00:51:47,542 --> 00:51:49,012
What happened to us?

886
00:51:53,141 --> 00:51:54,581
It's all my fault.

887
00:52:00,281 --> 00:52:01,491
I'm sorry.

888
00:52:02,852 --> 00:52:04,962
I'm sorry, woo ri. I should've
been more thoughtful.

889
00:52:06,292 --> 00:52:07,492
Why do you...

890
00:52:09,661 --> 00:52:11,701
Always say that
everything's your fault?

891
00:52:13,902 --> 00:52:15,972
You did nothing wrong.

892
00:52:17,102 --> 00:52:19,302
Why are you saying it's your fault?

893
00:52:27,911 --> 00:52:29,651
You know,

894
00:52:30,951 --> 00:52:32,921
we're supposed to take
pictures together tomorrow.

895
00:52:35,551 --> 00:52:37,151
Let's only take happy
pictures from now on.

896
00:53:27,102 --> 00:53:28,312
You're here again?

897
00:53:29,241 --> 00:53:30,611
What's with the flowers?

898
00:53:31,382 --> 00:53:32,442
Oh, this.

899
00:53:33,582 --> 00:53:34,812
Are you here alone?

900
00:53:35,482 --> 00:53:37,482
My, you look stunning today.

901
00:53:40,382 --> 00:53:43,052
I thought long and hard
before coming here today.

902
00:53:44,161 --> 00:53:45,261
About what?

903
00:53:48,091 --> 00:53:50,031
I like you a lot.

904
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:54,472
From the time when you were the
uhm jung hwa of bukgajwa-dong...

905
00:53:54,471 --> 00:53:55,731
Back in middle school...

906
00:53:56,931 --> 00:54:00,301
To now, as the mother of
my child 30 years later.

907
00:54:01,542 --> 00:54:04,442
I have liked you every single
moment all through the years.

908
00:54:07,341 --> 00:54:08,481
Let's...

909
00:54:09,681 --> 00:54:11,121
Get back together.

910
00:54:13,882 --> 00:54:15,152
Seoung il.

911
00:54:17,491 --> 00:54:18,591
I'm sorry.

912
00:54:19,962 --> 00:54:21,032
What?

913
00:54:21,591 --> 00:54:22,731
I don't think I can do it.

914
00:54:22,792 --> 00:54:24,502
Why not?

915
00:54:25,562 --> 00:54:27,102
I've also thought a lot...

916
00:54:27,232 --> 00:54:29,772
About what we should do.

917
00:54:30,332 --> 00:54:33,502
But you see, my longest relationship
only lasted six months.

918
00:54:33,772 --> 00:54:35,512
I've never been in a
long-term relationship.

919
00:54:36,272 --> 00:54:37,812
So if we do this, and if
it doesn't work out...

920
00:54:37,812 --> 00:54:41,212
Why worry about it not working
out when it hasn't even begun?

921
00:54:41,212 --> 00:54:42,282
That's not right.

922
00:54:42,281 --> 00:54:44,221
Anyway, okay.

923
00:54:44,951 --> 00:54:48,191
I promise you that I'll
make you and woo ri happy.

924
00:54:48,192 --> 00:54:49,952
I'm confident, so let's do it.

925
00:54:49,951 --> 00:54:51,991
It may work out, or it may not.

926
00:54:52,692 --> 00:54:54,592
I mean, I understand...

927
00:54:54,591 --> 00:54:57,031
We'll be hurt if things go wrong.
And that's okay.

928
00:54:57,292 --> 00:54:59,532
But what about woo ri?

929
00:55:00,201 --> 00:55:02,731
- What about her?
- If it doesn't work out,

930
00:55:03,672 --> 00:55:06,372
my daughter will be hurt, yet again.

931
00:55:07,141 --> 00:55:10,311
It's too big a gamble,
and I can't do it.

932
00:55:36,902 --> 00:55:39,942
Could you fix your hair right here?

933
00:55:41,071 --> 00:55:42,471
Oh, it's probably this right here.

934
00:55:43,542 --> 00:55:46,382
- Better?
- No, the other side.

935
00:55:47,241 --> 00:55:49,611
Woo ri, you should check
it in the mirror. Hold on.

936
00:55:51,681 --> 00:55:54,391
Here, check.

937
00:55:57,152 --> 00:55:58,192
Better?

938
00:55:59,821 --> 00:56:02,191
- Okay, it's fixed.
- Great.

939
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:10,531
- We're ready.
- Okay.

940
00:56:10,801 --> 00:56:12,401
All right, let's take some shots now.

941
00:56:13,571 --> 00:56:14,771
Here we go!

942
00:56:15,971 --> 00:56:18,211
In 1, 2.

943
00:56:19,112 --> 00:56:21,252
Nice. One more time.

944
00:56:22,482 --> 00:56:25,582
Well, could you smile a little more?

945
00:56:30,591 --> 00:56:31,591
Smile.

946
00:56:41,272 --> 00:56:42,532
Are you all right?

947
00:56:48,042 --> 00:56:49,572
I'm sorry.

948
00:56:50,312 --> 00:56:51,312
Woo ri.

949
00:56:53,281 --> 00:56:54,481
Woo ri.

950
00:56:55,451 --> 00:56:56,481
Woo ri, wait.

951
00:56:57,152 --> 00:56:59,182
What's wrong, all of a sudden?
Did something happen?

952
00:56:59,951 --> 00:57:00,991
Kang jae.

953
00:57:03,121 --> 00:57:04,661
Let's end it here.

954
00:57:07,522 --> 00:57:08,832
End what?

955
00:57:10,732 --> 00:57:12,532
I thought long and hard.

956
00:57:13,862 --> 00:57:15,132
Let's break up.

957
00:57:16,371 --> 00:57:18,741
What are you talking
about all of a sudden?

958
00:57:18,801 --> 00:57:21,071
I keep thinking of the
moment when you lied to me,

959
00:57:21,071 --> 00:57:24,171
so I can't believe anything you say.

960
00:57:25,641 --> 00:57:26,681
I'm sorry.

961
00:57:27,241 --> 00:57:28,811
I won't lie to you ever again.
I promise, woo ri.

962
00:57:29,852 --> 00:57:32,252
It's better this way for you too.

963
00:57:34,022 --> 00:57:36,022
This way, I won't ruin your life.

964
00:57:37,862 --> 00:57:40,022
You should've told me that
you really didn't want me...

965
00:57:40,891 --> 00:57:41,931
To keep the baby.

966
00:57:41,931 --> 00:57:44,301
I did think that for a
moment, but I was wrong.

967
00:57:44,301 --> 00:57:45,801
I don't think that anymore, woo ri.

968
00:57:45,902 --> 00:57:47,632
Human emotion is a funny thing.

969
00:57:48,571 --> 00:57:50,271
Suddenly, I can't even
stand the sight of you.

970
00:57:52,641 --> 00:57:53,941
Let's break up.

971
00:58:17,292 --> 00:58:18,332
Hey.

972
00:58:20,832 --> 00:58:22,232
If you really mean it,

973
00:58:23,332 --> 00:58:24,642
look me in the eye and say it.

974
00:58:27,301 --> 00:58:29,341
Look me straight in the eye and say it.

975
00:58:36,082 --> 00:58:37,482
We're over.

976
00:58:40,681 --> 00:58:41,851
I mean it.

977
00:59:36,241 --> 00:59:38,011
She broke up with her boyfriend.

978
00:59:38,011 --> 00:59:40,581
I heard a mother's emotions
are transferred to her baby.

979
00:59:40,911 --> 00:59:42,411
We should catch the one he's meeting.

980
00:59:42,411 --> 00:59:43,581
I'll go get it.

981
00:59:43,582 --> 00:59:45,282
I'll throw the hospital upside down.

982
00:59:45,281 --> 00:59:46,981
- What did you say?
- What is all this?

983
00:59:46,982 --> 00:59:49,152
You seem to be having a hard time.
I want to help.

984
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:50,652
Why do we have to be like this?

985
00:59:50,792 --> 00:59:53,222
- She could miscarry the baby.
- A miscarriage?

986
00:59:53,221 --> 00:59:56,131
I feel so bad for Kang jae.

987
00:59:56,132 --> 00:59:57,932
Should we just not do this?
