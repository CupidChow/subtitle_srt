1
00:00:09,949 --> 00:00:11,919
Is this...

2
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:14,919
a dream?

3
00:00:49,249 --> 00:00:50,619
What did I just do?

4
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:52,889
- Well... - What did I do?

5
00:00:53,889 --> 00:00:55,789
- What on earth did I do? - I was thinking the same...

6
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:57,858
- What on earth did I just do? - Ms. Oh!

7
00:00:57,859 --> 00:00:59,199
What on earth did I just do?

8
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:14,839
What was that? I can't believe I did that!

9
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:17,180
What the heck was that?

10
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:37,570
Woo Ri, are you not feeling well?

11
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:41,199
Did something happen? What's wrong?

12
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:43,370
I thought life...

13
00:01:44,569 --> 00:01:48,680
was all about swimming toward your destination,

14
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:50,809
but I guess I was wrong.

15
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:55,089
This world is like a vast ocean,

16
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:57,189
so you don't even know where you're going.

17
00:01:58,189 --> 00:02:01,520
I suppose all you can do is go with the tide.

18
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:02,729
What's she saying?

19
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:05,799
Woo Ri, have dinner first.

20
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,258
We can talk about this later.

21
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:09,370
- Come out. - Come on. Hurry.

22
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:16,110
You kissed him? All of a sudden?

23
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:18,509
Even though nothing happened before that?

24
00:02:20,309 --> 00:02:22,680
- Yes. - I wonder why you did it.

25
00:02:24,279 --> 00:02:26,080
Is it because you're pregnant with his child?

26
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:28,279
You got pregnant without sleeping with him,

27
00:02:28,749 --> 00:02:32,590
but is it possible that you want him now that you're carrying his child?

28
00:02:35,189 --> 00:02:36,390
Do you like him?

29
00:02:38,529 --> 00:02:39,628
I guess, a little.

30
00:02:39,629 --> 00:02:42,469
Right, it'd be weird if you didn't.

31
00:02:42,569 --> 00:02:44,300
On top of being handsome and competent,

32
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:45,640
he's the father of your baby.

33
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:48,640
He is the father of the baby.

34
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:53,610
Hey. If things work out, it'll be amazing for the baby.

35
00:02:53,979 --> 00:02:55,509
And if you two end up together,

36
00:02:55,749 --> 00:02:58,249
I can get the facial treatments even after the drama ends.

37
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:05,419
If you want an ending that is even more dramatic...

38
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:07,020
than what we see in dramas,

39
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:09,090
you must create it for yourself...

40
00:03:09,629 --> 00:03:10,960
because it's your life.

41
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:14,099
I'm always on your side.

42
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,800
Thank you, Ms. Yu.

43
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:22,009
By the way, has Raphael gotten everything sorted out yet?

44
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,309
- Sorry? - He's divorced now, right?

45
00:03:35,689 --> 00:03:39,460
We got a divorce as you'd wanted, but my feelings won't change.

46
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:41,120
Just know that.

47
00:03:41,289 --> 00:03:42,429
Enough, seriously.

48
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,789
Just move on and live your life. You're still young.

49
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:46,029
I'm off.

50
00:03:47,259 --> 00:03:48,300
What?

51
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,430
Let's grab a bite to eat.

52
00:03:51,669 --> 00:03:53,669
Why should I eat with you? We're divorced now.

53
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:55,609
I'm off.

54
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:00,510
Is it right that I agreed to divorce?

55
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:03,409
Maybe I should've stayed stubborn and held out until the end.

56
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,918
Even the chairman isn't on your side.

57
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:07,080
What else could you have done?

58
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:09,689
You would've gotten kicked out empty-handed.

59
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:12,560
- Then it's all over now. - No!

60
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,788
This is only a strategic retreat.

61
00:04:14,789 --> 00:04:17,428
The Star CafÃ© building is within our reach!

62
00:04:17,429 --> 00:04:20,899
Mom, how will we get our hands on it in this situation?

63
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:24,330
Raphael will come back to you unless he meets another woman.

64
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:25,969
What?

65
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:27,940
Ma Ri.

66
00:04:30,669 --> 00:04:32,440
Raphael is a man too.

67
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:35,249
When men see a beautiful woman,

68
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:38,149
their bodies automatically react.

69
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:41,478
You can keep men wrapped around your little finger,

70
00:04:41,479 --> 00:04:43,090
for years to come!

71
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:47,060
It's true that your daughter is beautiful.

72
00:04:49,729 --> 00:04:52,599
All men are the same.

73
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:56,599
What's the animal whose body reacts before its brain does?

74
00:04:56,669 --> 00:04:57,869
Men!

75
00:04:58,029 --> 00:05:01,939
Then since Raphael is a man too, his body will react first.

76
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,969
That's right!

77
00:05:15,349 --> 00:05:16,520
Gummy Bear.

78
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,520
Was that a dream?

79
00:05:21,359 --> 00:05:23,289
Did I dream about the thing that happened with your mom?

80
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,700
Is this...

81
00:05:29,599 --> 00:05:30,799
a dream?

82
00:05:35,409 --> 00:05:37,539
Gosh, I miss her.

83
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:43,149
Please, Ms. Yu. I really can't run into him.

84
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:44,778
Hey, I already checked.

85
00:05:44,779 --> 00:05:48,079
Raphael is away on a work trip. That's why I brought you along.

86
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,019
Wait! You're sure, right?

87
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:52,260
Do you have trust issues? Come on!

88
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:54,820
See you, Woo Ri!

89
00:06:05,669 --> 00:06:07,000
Hello.

90
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,909
Well...

91
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:14,379
You know, the other day. That was rude of me.

92
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:16,279
I sincerely apologize.

93
00:06:16,679 --> 00:06:17,750
Ms. Oh.

94
00:06:19,119 --> 00:06:20,650
That wasn't a dream.

95
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:23,690
Right, it wasn't.

96
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:28,119
I'm pregnant, you know. It must be the hormones.

97
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,929
I like you.

98
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:31,729
Sorry?

99
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:35,400
My feelings for you kept growing,

100
00:06:36,869 --> 00:06:39,770
but I thought it'd make you uncomfortable,

101
00:06:40,099 --> 00:06:41,369
so I couldn't tell you.

102
00:06:45,979 --> 00:06:49,210
I always felt that there was someone out there...

103
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:52,820
who I was destined to be with.

104
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:56,919
I think that person was you.

105
00:07:02,229 --> 00:07:05,429
Why does this feel so surreal?

106
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:11,900
Am I dreaming right now?

107
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:15,539
No, I told you this wasn't a dream.

108
00:07:19,179 --> 00:07:20,239
I'll...

109
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:22,810
show you.

110
00:08:01,479 --> 00:08:04,689
- Hello? - Sir, we need you here now.

111
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:06,159
The police are here again.

112
00:08:07,619 --> 00:08:11,089
No. Look at that ventilation fan. That tells it all.

113
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:12,498
They manufactured illicit drugs here.

114
00:08:12,499 --> 00:08:14,959
That vent fan is way too small for that.

115
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,129
When you make drugs,

116
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:18,329
you need something to remove all the fumes.

117
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:19,669
Had they done it here,

118
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:22,239
everyone would've known because of the odour.

119
00:08:23,139 --> 00:08:26,440
Dr. Jang, I know you retired from the manufacturing side long ago.

120
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:29,378
The synthetic drugs they make these days...

121
00:08:29,379 --> 00:08:31,950
don't produce any odours during the manufacturing process.

122
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,919
It doesn't look like your information is up to date.

123
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,889
It doesn't matter what kind of drug we're talking about.

124
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:39,889
I don't think that's what this room was made for.

125
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,960
Then what?

126
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,459
What do you think they used this space for?

127
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:46,160
Well, this is a hospital. An operating room, I guess?

128
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:54,599
Detective Lee, you're here again.

129
00:08:55,739 --> 00:08:57,739
Do you need help with something?

130
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:01,340
Sir, spare me a moment.

131
00:09:01,509 --> 00:09:03,579
We're still investigating it, so we can't tell you everything.

132
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,420
But please cooperate for the time being.

133
00:09:05,649 --> 00:09:09,849
Look. What's going on?

134
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,858
Last time, I overheard you talking about Chairman Kim.

135
00:09:12,859 --> 00:09:14,389
Is it related to that person?

136
00:09:15,219 --> 00:09:17,859
Who is Chairman Kim?

137
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,499
"Chairman Kim"?

138
00:09:25,269 --> 00:09:26,469
Darn it.

139
00:09:26,769 --> 00:09:28,738
Don't you know him? He's called Chairman Kim, the drug dealer.

140
00:09:28,739 --> 00:09:31,210
I have my hands on one of the lists that'll make money.

141
00:09:31,769 --> 00:09:34,340
If I sell it, I'll make a killing.

142
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:37,609
Have you heard of the name?

143
00:09:39,479 --> 00:09:41,820
No, never.

144
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:44,118
Who is this person?

145
00:09:44,119 --> 00:09:45,790
I can't tell you anything at the moment,

146
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,719
so please pretend you heard nothing. Okay?

147
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,700
Well, Detective Lee.

148
00:09:58,269 --> 00:09:59,340
If you need anything...

149
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:01,999
You'll need my help, and I will cooperate.

150
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:03,468
Please wrap it up quickly.

151
00:10:03,469 --> 00:10:05,210
Okay, sure.

152
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:14,979
Wait, Ms. Oh!

153
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:18,820
Oh, sir.

154
00:10:21,619 --> 00:10:23,259
Well, you see...

155
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:26,529
We couldn't finish our conversation earlier.

156
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:28,800
You could've just called me.

157
00:10:28,899 --> 00:10:30,700
Then I can't see your face.

158
00:10:30,769 --> 00:10:32,499
You can video-call me.

159
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,300
Well, may I... Give me your hand.

160
00:10:36,009 --> 00:10:37,170
Ms. Oh.

161
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:39,680
You know,

162
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:43,210
we like each other. Right?

163
00:10:45,249 --> 00:10:46,379
Yes.

164
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,119
I guess so.

165
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,759
Then we're a couple now.

166
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,119
Starting today, okay?

167
00:10:55,759 --> 00:10:56,889
Well...

168
00:10:58,236 --> 00:10:59,545
Can I...

169
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:01,969
Can I take some time and think about it?

170
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:06,594
Gosh, I'm sorry. I know I started it.

171
00:11:06,895 --> 00:11:08,625
No, don't be sorry.

172
00:11:09,365 --> 00:11:11,495
Okay, let's take it slow.

173
00:11:12,694 --> 00:11:13,964
I'll wait for your answer.

174
00:11:23,905 --> 00:11:25,104
Woo Ri, you're home.

175
00:11:26,115 --> 00:11:27,275
Grandma.

176
00:11:28,674 --> 00:11:32,115
- Where is the tide taking me? - What?

177
00:11:32,985 --> 00:11:34,985
Why do you keep talking about the tide?

178
00:11:40,924 --> 00:11:42,054
What?

179
00:11:43,495 --> 00:11:44,665
Sir.

180
00:11:45,995 --> 00:11:47,964
You're always the first one to arrive at every meeting.

181
00:11:48,905 --> 00:11:50,333
I bet you always sat in the first row...

182
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:52,134
of the classroom back in school,

183
00:11:52,135 --> 00:11:54,074
right in front of your teacher. Like this.

184
00:11:54,674 --> 00:11:55,804
Yes.

185
00:11:56,505 --> 00:11:57,645
Oh, right.

186
00:11:59,574 --> 00:12:01,974
I don't have to call you "Ms. Oh" anymore, right?

187
00:12:03,015 --> 00:12:04,184
Sorry?

188
00:12:08,924 --> 00:12:11,754
I'll call you Woo Ri from now on.

189
00:12:11,755 --> 00:12:14,354
Because I like you.

190
00:12:19,434 --> 00:12:20,735
Okay.

191
00:12:23,334 --> 00:12:24,464
What?

192
00:12:27,275 --> 00:12:29,074
Who likes whom?

193
00:12:29,974 --> 00:12:31,244
Hey, Ma Ri.

194
00:12:31,245 --> 00:12:32,674
I misheard you just now, right?

195
00:12:33,775 --> 00:12:35,115
You like her?

196
00:12:37,184 --> 00:12:38,285
You like her?

197
00:12:39,814 --> 00:12:40,885
It's...

198
00:12:41,285 --> 00:12:42,525
You tell me.

199
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:44,884
- Tell me! - Hey, Ma Ri.

200
00:12:44,885 --> 00:12:47,294
Let's talk outside. Come on.

201
00:12:47,295 --> 00:12:48,655
Come on. Let's go.

202
00:12:50,265 --> 00:12:51,464
Woo Ri and I...

203
00:12:52,665 --> 00:12:54,165
like each other.

204
00:12:56,834 --> 00:12:58,265
- I don't believe this. - Ma Ri.

205
00:13:00,035 --> 00:13:01,704
Don't say anything to Woo Ri.

206
00:13:02,005 --> 00:13:03,674
You have no right to.

207
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:05,714
Do not even meet her. Do you understand?

208
00:13:06,814 --> 00:13:08,073
Don't make me repeat myself.

209
00:13:08,074 --> 00:13:09,285
I don't believe this.

210
00:13:11,915 --> 00:13:13,385
This has got to be a lie!

211
00:13:14,354 --> 00:13:16,324
You're lying, right?

212
00:13:17,224 --> 00:13:20,025
You're lying! This is a lie.

213
00:13:22,464 --> 00:13:23,594
You're lying.

214
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:25,224
You're lying...

215
00:13:29,735 --> 00:13:30,964
Ma Ri.

216
00:13:31,665 --> 00:13:32,834
Ma Ri.

217
00:13:33,674 --> 00:13:35,005
Why did you go to the hospital?

218
00:13:35,745 --> 00:13:37,005
What's wrong with you?

219
00:13:39,245 --> 00:13:40,415
Mom.

220
00:13:40,645 --> 00:13:42,645
Raphael has another woman now.

221
00:13:43,915 --> 00:13:45,515
We can break them up.

222
00:13:47,015 --> 00:13:48,985
He's seeing the woman who's pregnant with his child.

223
00:13:50,485 --> 00:13:52,854
He is seeing Oh Woo Ri, the pregnant woman?

224
00:13:54,295 --> 00:13:56,694
Who knew the situation would take such a turn?

225
00:13:56,724 --> 00:13:57,895
Let's just give up.

226
00:13:58,795 --> 00:14:00,194
There's nothing we can do now.

227
00:14:00,934 --> 00:14:03,103
And I can't take this anymore.

228
00:14:03,104 --> 00:14:04,265
What are you talking about?

229
00:14:04,334 --> 00:14:07,634
Go pull her hair out and slap her in the face!

230
00:14:07,635 --> 00:14:09,444
I don't want to!

231
00:14:11,204 --> 00:14:13,244
There is a way.

232
00:14:13,245 --> 00:14:14,545
No, there isn't.

233
00:14:15,275 --> 00:14:17,314
Stop trying to force things.

234
00:14:18,684 --> 00:14:20,184
They'll break up...

235
00:14:20,785 --> 00:14:22,655
if the baby is gone, right?

236
00:14:24,755 --> 00:14:25,954
What do you mean?

237
00:14:26,454 --> 00:14:28,354
We just need the baby gone.

238
00:15:15,275 --> 00:15:16,974
So they're dating?

239
00:15:19,674 --> 00:15:20,844
It ended up happening.

240
00:15:20,915 --> 00:15:22,275
You won't just leave them be, right?

241
00:15:25,115 --> 00:15:26,255
I have no choice.

242
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:28,755
I mean, what could I do now?

243
00:15:28,854 --> 00:15:32,155
Do you think they actually love each other?

244
00:15:32,495 --> 00:15:35,155
Clearly, they're just confused because of the baby.

245
00:15:36,064 --> 00:15:37,664
It won't work out.

246
00:15:37,665 --> 00:15:39,765
We should stop them, for their own sakes.

247
00:15:45,334 --> 00:15:46,674
Whatever she decides to do,

248
00:15:47,574 --> 00:15:48,834
I have no say in it.

249
00:15:50,174 --> 00:15:51,474
I'm busy. I have to go.

250
00:16:01,015 --> 00:16:02,184
I'm saying this just in case.

251
00:16:03,155 --> 00:16:04,485
You'd better not stress her out.

252
00:16:18,704 --> 00:16:20,304
It has no colour or smell.

253
00:16:20,804 --> 00:16:23,344
Put it in some kind of beverage and make her drink it.

254
00:16:25,045 --> 00:16:27,145
Thank you. This is so delicious.

255
00:16:27,338 --> 00:16:31,071
Just seeing you makes me so happy, Woo Ri.

256
00:16:31,747 --> 00:16:34,747
It's only natural that you're happy to see your own daughter.

257
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:36,660
He doesn't know yet, right?

258
00:16:37,234 --> 00:16:38,405
The good news.

259
00:16:41,474 --> 00:16:42,705
What's going on?

260
00:16:43,004 --> 00:16:44,145
What happened?

261
00:16:44,612 --> 00:16:45,846
Tell me.

262
00:17:03,695 --> 00:17:04,925
I saw you...

263
00:17:05,626 --> 00:17:08,096
in the baby nursery with Raphael.

264
00:17:09,566 --> 00:17:11,465
That was the first time I wondered,

265
00:17:13,106 --> 00:17:15,106
"What's that woman doing in that room?"

266
00:17:16,306 --> 00:17:18,475
"I should be in that room with him."

267
00:17:24,515 --> 00:17:26,846
Try putting yourself in my shoes.

268
00:17:27,685 --> 00:17:30,286
You're pregnant with the child that I should be carrying...

269
00:17:30,556 --> 00:17:33,955
and even stole my husband from me. How do you think I feel?

270
00:17:35,155 --> 00:17:36,495
- Look. - Let's put things...

271
00:17:36,826 --> 00:17:38,126
back to where they should be.

272
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:41,195
Us too. Let's go back to where we should be.

273
00:17:41,836 --> 00:17:43,995
You were engaged to Detective Lee Kang Jae.

274
00:17:44,536 --> 00:17:46,866
You shouldn't be with Raphael.

275
00:17:47,336 --> 00:17:50,076
You're just confused because of the baby.

276
00:17:51,745 --> 00:17:53,205
Why are you doing this to me?

277
00:17:54,146 --> 00:17:55,775
Don't do this to me, please!

278
00:17:55,776 --> 00:17:57,316
That's enough, please.

279
00:17:58,046 --> 00:18:00,944
It's not like I'm his mistress who ruined your marriage.

280
00:18:00,945 --> 00:18:02,955
I don't understand why I should be listening to this now.

281
00:18:03,185 --> 00:18:05,826
You don't have the right to tell me what to do.

282
00:18:06,326 --> 00:18:08,826
I'll do what I think is right and follow my heart.

283
00:18:10,356 --> 00:18:11,495
Okay.

284
00:18:11,925 --> 00:18:13,796
I'm sorry for everything.

285
00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:15,396
Don't be mad.

286
00:18:15,796 --> 00:18:17,896
Let's talk it out, okay?

287
00:18:23,505 --> 00:18:25,546
I was going to hand the baby over to you.

288
00:18:25,776 --> 00:18:27,576
But you lied to me.

289
00:18:27,806 --> 00:18:29,576
I bet you never wanted the baby in the first place.

290
00:18:39,455 --> 00:18:40,586
Woo Ri.

291
00:18:43,796 --> 00:18:44,856
Raphael.

292
00:18:45,326 --> 00:18:46,896
What are you two doing here?

293
00:18:47,725 --> 00:18:50,066
Ma Ri, what are you two doing here?

294
00:18:51,036 --> 00:18:52,165
What?

295
00:18:52,665 --> 00:18:54,505
I had to talk to her about something.

296
00:19:02,215 --> 00:19:03,376
Ma Ri.

297
00:19:04,646 --> 00:19:07,346
I understand that you're upset.

298
00:19:07,485 --> 00:19:08,586
But as you know,

299
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:10,556
Woo Ri is pregnant right now.

300
00:19:11,086 --> 00:19:13,455
Don't say anything that would make her uncomfortable.

301
00:19:13,556 --> 00:19:14,625
Just...

302
00:19:14,626 --> 00:19:15,855
talk to me.

303
00:19:15,856 --> 00:19:17,096
Please.

304
00:19:17,856 --> 00:19:20,195
For the baby's sake. Okay?

305
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,580
What's wrong with you?

306
00:19:44,151 --> 00:19:46,851
What unruly behaviour is this?

307
00:19:48,391 --> 00:19:50,020
Woo Ri, are you okay?

308
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:52,430
Are you really going to be like this?

309
00:19:52,431 --> 00:19:53,661
Aren't you going to apologize?

310
00:20:02,841 --> 00:20:05,270
Woo Ri, are you okay? That must have surprised you.

311
00:20:06,941 --> 00:20:08,141
I'm sorry.

312
00:20:08,881 --> 00:20:09,941
No, it's okay.

313
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,381
You don't need to apologize for this.

314
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,121
But since I am...

315
00:20:18,921 --> 00:20:20,490
was Ma Ri's husband.

316
00:20:24,391 --> 00:20:26,260
There's a lot to consider.

317
00:20:27,431 --> 00:20:30,601
The people around us and the various situations.

318
00:20:33,901 --> 00:20:37,040
It would be nice if we only needed to think about ourselves.

319
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:51,851
How did it go? Did you give her the drug?

320
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:53,990
I can't do it.

321
00:20:56,961 --> 00:20:58,020
Why?

322
00:20:58,631 --> 00:21:00,191
It's Raphael's baby.

323
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:04,201
So what?

324
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:09,240
Raphael can no longer have children.

325
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,841
He looks dearly at the sonogram picture on his desk.

326
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:20,580
Are you seriously in love with Raphael by any chance?

327
00:21:20,851 --> 00:21:22,151
I don't know.

328
00:21:23,881 --> 00:21:25,391
I don't like Oh Woo Ri...

329
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:28,820
or how the baby got conceived.

330
00:21:30,121 --> 00:21:31,520
But if something goes wrong with the baby,

331
00:21:32,461 --> 00:21:34,490
I think Raphael would really have a hard time.

332
00:21:36,161 --> 00:21:39,730
You must be out of your mind now that you're comfortable.

333
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,441
How can you prey on him if you really like him?

334
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:44,740
Does that make sense?

335
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:48,881
How can you act the landlord's part with such a weak heart?

336
00:21:51,911 --> 00:21:52,951
Mom,

337
00:21:56,951 --> 00:21:58,280
that baby...

338
00:22:05,091 --> 00:22:07,461
could have been mine.

339
00:22:26,411 --> 00:22:27,580
Hello, Mr. Choi.

340
00:22:27,951 --> 00:22:29,819
I heard you've been waiting. Is there something wrong?

341
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:32,421
What's going on, Raphael?

342
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:34,120
Excuse me?

343
00:22:34,121 --> 00:22:37,090
I heard that things worked out between you and Woo Ri.

344
00:22:37,091 --> 00:22:39,431
Right. Yes, it happened that way.

345
00:22:41,461 --> 00:22:42,700
That's good news.

346
00:22:42,701 --> 00:22:46,570
I trusted and liked you from the beginning.

347
00:22:46,701 --> 00:22:51,100
It would be better if you get along and become a family.

348
00:22:51,101 --> 00:22:53,941
Well, we need to take things slow.

349
00:22:55,171 --> 00:22:57,641
- What's all this about? - You came.

350
00:22:58,010 --> 00:22:59,810
Well, Father...

351
00:23:00,911 --> 00:23:04,150
You and the baby's mother are getting along well together?

352
00:23:04,151 --> 00:23:06,490
That's correct, Mr. Kim. We're in-laws.

353
00:23:06,951 --> 00:23:07,990
In-laws?

354
00:23:09,461 --> 00:23:11,121
You...

355
00:23:14,661 --> 00:23:17,661
My son finally made it.

356
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:20,631
You had a plan all along.

357
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:23,140
Well, it's not like I had a plan.

358
00:23:23,141 --> 00:23:25,769
- You'll get married, right? - It's not like that.

359
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:28,710
Why don't we all gather to have a meal together first?

360
00:23:28,711 --> 00:23:31,211
That's a great idea. Call her right away.

361
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:33,450
I want to take a look at her carefully again.

362
00:23:33,451 --> 00:23:36,250
Relax, the both of you.

363
00:23:36,881 --> 00:23:38,890
We only found out we have feelings for each other.

364
00:23:38,891 --> 00:23:41,050
Things are still very cautious for both of us.

365
00:23:41,121 --> 00:23:42,920
So please wait a bit longer.

366
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:45,591
Of course. But promise you'll do it.

367
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:50,059
Gosh, you. You take after me.

368
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:52,570
Well, I don't know about taking after you.

369
00:23:53,671 --> 00:23:55,070
I'm home.

370
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:57,640
Gosh, that's good news.

371
00:23:57,641 --> 00:24:00,370
Thank you, Lord.

372
00:24:00,371 --> 00:24:02,070
Are you really dating Raphael?

373
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:03,740
Seoung Il told me about it.

374
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,950
Gosh, Ye Ri.

375
00:24:05,951 --> 00:24:07,509
Are you really dating him? Why?

376
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:08,779
What do you mean why?

377
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:11,420
What more is there for a young man and woman liking each other?

378
00:24:11,421 --> 00:24:14,390
We just found out that we have feelings for each other.

379
00:24:14,391 --> 00:24:15,690
We're nothing yet.

380
00:24:15,691 --> 00:24:17,920
That's good. That's right.

381
00:24:17,921 --> 00:24:20,090
That's how you start things.

382
00:24:20,091 --> 00:24:22,600
That's how you get married.

383
00:24:22,601 --> 00:24:23,701
Mom.

384
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,570
Do you really have feelings for him?

385
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:29,000
Just because he's the father of the baby?

386
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,670
Didn't you make that decision because of the baby?

387
00:24:30,671 --> 00:24:31,969
What do you mean?

388
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:34,140
Isn't that better for the baby?

389
00:24:34,141 --> 00:24:36,880
Mom, you shouldn't pressure her into this.

390
00:24:36,881 --> 00:24:39,310
No, I'm not pressured into anything.

391
00:24:39,451 --> 00:24:40,711
It's my feelings.

392
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:43,351
I'm going to be honest about my feelings.

393
00:24:43,421 --> 00:24:44,851
Yes, that's good.

394
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,650
Why are you being this way,

395
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:47,921
when you should be congratulating her?

396
00:24:48,591 --> 00:24:49,820
Then what about Kang Jae?

397
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,760
Are you really done with Kang Jae? Are you really going to end it?

398
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,201
Does he know about this as well?

399
00:25:01,131 --> 00:25:02,201
I...

400
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,300
I will tell him myself.

401
00:25:07,941 --> 00:25:10,641
Kang Jae, I can't find anything.

402
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,780
There is no one that did the drugs Chairman Kim distributed.

403
00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:16,520
We need to look into it a bit more.

404
00:25:17,451 --> 00:25:18,780
It definitely is Chairman Kim.

405
00:25:19,591 --> 00:25:22,490
We found the secret space with related leads on Chairman Kim.

406
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,091
We looked everywhere.

407
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:27,290
We even contacted a retired drug manufacturer and still nothing.

408
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:30,060
I don't think this is about drugs.

409
00:25:33,431 --> 00:25:34,871
Are you the singer for the day?

410
00:25:35,131 --> 00:25:36,270
Hello.

411
00:25:37,201 --> 00:25:38,670
I'm singer Oh Eun Ran.

412
00:25:38,671 --> 00:25:40,469
- You're late. - She says she's a singer.

413
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:41,769
I'll get ready soon.

414
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:44,080
I need to change and get the stage ready.

415
00:25:44,141 --> 00:25:45,181
Where can I do it?

416
00:25:50,851 --> 00:25:51,951
Gosh.

417
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,100
- Ms. Oh Eun ran. - Yes?

418
00:26:04,101 --> 00:26:05,431
This way.

419
00:26:05,871 --> 00:26:07,871
Right. Thank you.

420
00:26:11,601 --> 00:26:14,570
- Just a second. Excuse me. - Oh gosh.

421
00:26:14,941 --> 00:26:17,881
- They must be her bodyguards. - What is that?

422
00:26:18,211 --> 00:26:20,911
- She must be some special singer. - Is that so?

423
00:26:21,181 --> 00:26:24,519
I'm not familiar with trot singers, but she must be famous.

424
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:26,421
She must be a great singer.

425
00:26:26,921 --> 00:26:29,019
- Let's see how she does. - I wonder if she's any good.

426
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:31,320
- Is she? - She must be a celebrity.

427
00:26:31,421 --> 00:26:34,030
- I think she is. - I think I'm right.

428
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:40,970
Hello, everyone.

429
00:26:41,171 --> 00:26:44,670
I'm here today to congratulate the opening of Romance Sauna.

430
00:26:44,671 --> 00:26:47,570
I'm singer Oh Eun Ran. It's nice to see you all.

431
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,911
- Eun Ran. - Gosh, Hyung Sik.

432
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:56,520
I was so surprised. You should've told me earlier.

433
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:58,151
I came to surprise you on purpose.

434
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,920
Ms. Oh Eun Ran.

435
00:27:01,651 --> 00:27:04,691
Your singing was great today.

436
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:08,730
It's an honour to have you at our opening today.

437
00:27:09,901 --> 00:27:12,830
- Thank you for having me. - Thank you.

438
00:27:14,701 --> 00:27:16,900
- Eun Ran! - Eun Ran!

439
00:27:16,901 --> 00:27:18,641
We love you.

440
00:27:43,661 --> 00:27:45,901
What's wrong, Gwi Nyeo?

441
00:27:46,701 --> 00:27:49,100
It's nothing, why did you come out?

442
00:27:49,101 --> 00:27:50,141
You should watch the movie.

443
00:27:50,841 --> 00:27:53,040
Are you crying? Why?

444
00:27:54,141 --> 00:27:57,881
I just feel bad about the time passing.

445
00:27:58,111 --> 00:27:59,911
What do you mean by that all of a sudden?

446
00:28:00,411 --> 00:28:03,080
I watched this movie when I was young.

447
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:07,420
I thought I'd visit Europe...

448
00:28:07,421 --> 00:28:10,790
and meet a great guy watching the movie.

449
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,631
Audrey Hepburn in the movie is still the same.

450
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:18,760
But why have I turned into an old lady?

451
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:23,841
Such a thought made me tear up suddenly.

452
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:27,470
You're still a girl in my eyes, Gwi Nyeo.

453
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:30,141
- Let's go. - What?

454
00:28:32,651 --> 00:28:34,911
- Gwi Nyeo! - Yes?

455
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:36,851
Let's go.

456
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:44,391
That man sounds great.

457
00:28:44,961 --> 00:28:47,290
I was deeply touched today.

458
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:51,000
By the way, isn't sending bodyguards great as well?

459
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:53,371
Why did I only meet such a guy now?

460
00:28:53,931 --> 00:28:55,940
Me too, why did I only meet him now?

461
00:28:55,941 --> 00:28:59,240
It would have been better if I met him when I was younger.

462
00:28:59,841 --> 00:29:01,970
You should be grateful that you met him now.

463
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,739
There are many who don't get to meet their love until they die.

464
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:08,510
Eun Ran, would you like to meet him?

465
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:10,920
Really? Do you want to introduce him to me?

466
00:29:10,921 --> 00:29:12,490
Yes, I want to meet him.

467
00:29:12,651 --> 00:29:15,120
Mom, would you like to meet Hyung Sik?

468
00:29:15,121 --> 00:29:17,421
- He's such a great guy. - Me?

469
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:21,091
Wait, should all four of us meet together?

470
00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:24,260
- All four of us? - Yes, a double date.

471
00:29:28,601 --> 00:29:30,101
Yes, that sounds great.

472
00:29:34,841 --> 00:29:36,411
Hello, I'm with the police.

473
00:29:36,681 --> 00:29:38,309
Do you know anyone who built...

474
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:40,351
Diamond Plastic Surgery in Gangnam a few years ago?

475
00:29:40,411 --> 00:29:42,480
Do you know someone who built Diamond Plastic Surgery?

476
00:29:42,921 --> 00:29:44,180
- No. - You don't know?

477
00:29:44,181 --> 00:29:45,220
I don't know.

478
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:48,320
Detective.

479
00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:50,789
Were looking for someone who built Diamond Plastic Surgery?

480
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:51,790
Yes.

481
00:29:51,791 --> 00:29:53,290
There's a Mr. Choi who sells construction materials.

482
00:29:53,861 --> 00:29:56,000
He bought a new car after the construction.

483
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:57,201
Is anyone there?

484
00:29:57,661 --> 00:29:58,830
Hello?

485
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:25,320
Kang Jae, are you all right?

486
00:30:28,691 --> 00:30:29,700
Who attacked me?

487
00:30:29,701 --> 00:30:32,401
The owner of the store of course.

488
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:35,131
He was on alert since he kept getting robbed.

489
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:37,200
He called the police saying that he caught the thief.

490
00:30:37,201 --> 00:30:39,040
I think he was involved in the hospital construction.

491
00:30:39,171 --> 00:30:41,211
- We need to investigate it. - I'll look into it.

492
00:30:43,181 --> 00:30:44,381
Kang Jae,

493
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:46,711
I was worried,

494
00:30:47,111 --> 00:30:48,510
thinking you might get hurt doing this.

495
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:50,651
I was really scared.

496
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:54,421
What if something happens when I'm not with you?

497
00:30:56,121 --> 00:30:57,620
I was afraid.

498
00:30:57,621 --> 00:30:59,760
Don't worry about me.

499
00:31:15,563 --> 00:31:16,692
Are you okay?

500
00:31:17,363 --> 00:31:18,893
Yes.

501
00:31:19,762 --> 00:31:21,063
I'm fine.

502
00:31:22,432 --> 00:31:23,572
What brings you here?

503
00:31:23,573 --> 00:31:25,373
The emergency contact network for immediate family members.

504
00:31:26,472 --> 00:31:29,043
My number was written there.

505
00:31:31,143 --> 00:31:32,512
I'm sorry.

506
00:31:32,782 --> 00:31:34,313
I haven't changed it yet. I'm sorry.

507
00:31:36,083 --> 00:31:37,512
You need to be careful.

508
00:31:38,053 --> 00:31:39,482
And don't get hurt.

509
00:31:39,823 --> 00:31:40,883
Right.

510
00:31:41,883 --> 00:31:42,992
I should.

511
00:31:44,192 --> 00:31:45,353
How about you?

512
00:31:46,093 --> 00:31:47,422
How are things with you?

513
00:31:47,663 --> 00:31:48,823
I'm good.

514
00:31:50,732 --> 00:31:51,793
Good.

515
00:31:54,232 --> 00:31:55,762
- Kang Jae. - Yes?

516
00:31:56,532 --> 00:31:58,532
I had something to tell you when I met you.

517
00:32:04,573 --> 00:32:05,982
Today's not a good day.

518
00:32:07,712 --> 00:32:08,913
Next time.

519
00:32:09,752 --> 00:32:10,952
I'll tell you next time.

520
00:32:14,383 --> 00:32:15,722
Take care of yourself.

521
00:32:16,323 --> 00:32:17,492
And don't get hurt.

522
00:32:18,653 --> 00:32:19,762
I'll get going.

523
00:32:25,192 --> 00:32:26,363
Woo Ri.

524
00:32:39,742 --> 00:32:42,413
I only have one thing I can do for you now.

525
00:32:44,182 --> 00:32:46,522
To pray that you are happy.

526
00:32:48,952 --> 00:32:50,492
Don't worry about me...

527
00:32:51,992 --> 00:32:53,422
and if you have someone you like,

528
00:32:56,333 --> 00:32:57,563
date him as you wish.

529
00:33:19,583 --> 00:33:20,951
Ms. Yu.

530
00:33:20,952 --> 00:33:23,222
Let's go out. Let's go and enjoy the fresh air.

531
00:33:23,452 --> 00:33:24,751
What? Where are we going?

532
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:26,892
The film crew. They're shooting at a resort in Gangwon-do Province.

533
00:33:26,893 --> 00:33:29,392
They are giving us a room as well. Let's work there.

534
00:33:29,393 --> 00:33:31,293
Suddenly? I have nothing on me.

535
00:33:31,363 --> 00:33:33,562
It's not like we're going abroad. It's just for the night.

536
00:33:33,563 --> 00:33:36,031
They even sell underwear at convenience stores these days.

537
00:33:36,032 --> 00:33:38,172
We only need to be there.

538
00:33:38,173 --> 00:33:40,942
Isn't this your luggage?

539
00:33:40,943 --> 00:33:42,341
I just have a few simple things.

540
00:33:42,342 --> 00:33:43,511
Let's go.

541
00:33:43,512 --> 00:33:45,042
The production crew is coming to get us.

542
00:33:45,043 --> 00:33:46,482
Go!

543
00:33:46,483 --> 00:33:49,353
Quick.

544
00:33:59,362 --> 00:34:00,522
What are you thinking?

545
00:34:00,523 --> 00:34:02,393
Let's go, quick.

546
00:34:03,563 --> 00:34:04,862
Where are we going?

547
00:34:05,032 --> 00:34:06,361
It's been so long.

548
00:34:06,362 --> 00:34:09,602
It's been so long. This is so nice.

549
00:34:09,603 --> 00:34:10,971
Let's take a picture.

550
00:34:10,972 --> 00:34:12,333
One, two, three.

551
00:34:15,572 --> 00:34:17,142
This is awesome.

552
00:34:17,143 --> 00:34:18,443
Wait.

553
00:34:19,213 --> 00:34:20,412
Wait.

554
00:34:20,413 --> 00:34:23,512
Woo Ri. Hold my hand.

555
00:34:25,612 --> 00:34:28,051
Woo Ri, drink this water and live a long life.

556
00:34:28,052 --> 00:34:29,393
- Cheers. - Cheers.

557
00:34:32,322 --> 00:34:34,592
This was refreshing thanks to you, Ms. Yu.

558
00:34:36,492 --> 00:34:37,833
Shall we go now?

559
00:34:37,862 --> 00:34:39,032
We need to work as well.

560
00:34:39,432 --> 00:34:41,801
Woo Ri, since we're in Gangwon, let's go see the sea.

561
00:34:41,802 --> 00:34:43,401
It's not far from here. It's close.

562
00:34:43,402 --> 00:34:45,132
What? What about work?

563
00:34:45,673 --> 00:34:48,443
Let's pass that on to tomorrow's Ye Ri and Woo Ri.

564
00:34:48,543 --> 00:34:49,572
- Let's go. - Gosh.

565
00:34:49,873 --> 00:34:51,313
- Move it. - Gosh.

566
00:34:55,685 --> 00:34:58,355
Ms. Yu, where are you? Why aren't you coming?

567
00:34:58,426 --> 00:35:01,655
Woo Ri, enjoy some time on your own.

568
00:35:01,656 --> 00:35:03,495
I'm going to spend some time on my own as well.

569
00:35:05,266 --> 00:35:08,095
- Are you taking a dump? - No. I ran into someone here.

570
00:35:08,096 --> 00:35:10,036
So be on your own for a while. Bye.

571
00:35:11,105 --> 00:35:12,266
What was that?

572
00:35:47,321 --> 00:35:48,581
It is you.

573
00:35:48,582 --> 00:35:50,021
I wondered if it was you.

574
00:35:50,022 --> 00:35:51,391
What are you doing here?

575
00:35:51,392 --> 00:35:52,792
I was just passing by.

576
00:35:57,162 --> 00:36:00,161
I was passing and saw a yellow dot.

577
00:36:00,162 --> 00:36:01,601
The yellow dot...

578
00:36:01,602 --> 00:36:04,002
The yellow dot looked strangely pretty.

579
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:06,789
You're here for work.

580
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:07,859
Aren't you busy?

581
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:10,730
I only need to go to a meeting in the evening.

582
00:36:11,103 --> 00:36:13,429
I still have a lot of time. What about you, Woo Ri?

583
00:36:14,056 --> 00:36:16,155
Ms. Yu said we should work here,

584
00:36:16,586 --> 00:36:17,985
and suddenly she's meeting someone.

585
00:36:18,556 --> 00:36:20,286
So I've decided to take a day off today.

586
00:36:20,795 --> 00:36:22,056
Is that so?

587
00:36:22,525 --> 00:36:26,125
It's amazing that we met here by coincidence,

588
00:36:26,126 --> 00:36:27,496
- isn't it? - It is.

589
00:36:29,965 --> 00:36:31,065
By the way,

590
00:36:31,365 --> 00:36:34,905
we met here once before.

591
00:36:36,275 --> 00:36:37,376
Yes.

592
00:36:38,045 --> 00:36:39,175
We did.

593
00:36:39,905 --> 00:36:42,246
It amazed me when I found out by chance...

594
00:36:42,315 --> 00:36:44,045
that I met you here.

595
00:36:44,945 --> 00:36:46,485
It's strange. Relationships.

596
00:36:47,956 --> 00:36:49,516
It was my first kiss.

597
00:36:49,715 --> 00:36:50,884
What?

598
00:36:50,885 --> 00:36:52,385
Why? Then?

599
00:36:55,056 --> 00:36:57,364
Your first kiss came quite late for you.

600
00:36:57,365 --> 00:36:59,725
No, wait. Is that average?

601
00:36:59,726 --> 00:37:02,694
You said you wanted to meet again the next day.

602
00:37:02,695 --> 00:37:03,806
Yes.

603
00:37:04,306 --> 00:37:05,436
I did.

604
00:37:05,766 --> 00:37:08,306
But why didn't we meet?

605
00:37:08,376 --> 00:37:10,404
I was there the next day.

606
00:37:10,405 --> 00:37:12,146
But you were with another woman.

607
00:37:12,905 --> 00:37:14,016
Me?

608
00:37:14,945 --> 00:37:17,785
That must have been my relative.

609
00:37:17,786 --> 00:37:19,286
My cousin probably.

610
00:37:19,385 --> 00:37:20,516
You were kissing together.

611
00:37:21,385 --> 00:37:22,615
That wasn't my relative.

612
00:37:22,885 --> 00:37:24,155
And not my cousin.

613
00:37:24,755 --> 00:37:26,984
Well, that was...

614
00:37:26,985 --> 00:37:28,626
It's okay.

615
00:37:29,025 --> 00:37:30,396
Such a thing can happen.

616
00:37:30,525 --> 00:37:34,496
What if I told you that I met my ex-girlfriend by coincidence,

617
00:37:34,735 --> 00:37:37,904
found out that we still had feelings, got carried away,

618
00:37:37,905 --> 00:37:39,965
and forgot the promise I made with you?

619
00:37:40,836 --> 00:37:42,005
I wouldn't believe it.

620
00:37:42,505 --> 00:37:44,844
Look at the time.

621
00:37:44,845 --> 00:37:46,806
Didn't you say you have a lot of time?

622
00:37:54,115 --> 00:37:57,786
Back then, it wasn't long since I was back from the US.

623
00:37:59,726 --> 00:38:01,496
I was a bit like that.

624
00:38:03,056 --> 00:38:05,795
It's okay. It's all in the past.

625
00:38:06,295 --> 00:38:09,295
This space was built at No Man Chul's request.

626
00:38:10,336 --> 00:38:12,106
It's not like we can ask him since he's dead.

627
00:38:13,106 --> 00:38:14,734
That man who hit you...

628
00:38:14,735 --> 00:38:16,805
didn't seem to know anything more.

629
00:38:16,806 --> 00:38:19,476
We found nothing even after we found the construction guy.

630
00:38:21,545 --> 00:38:24,215
If Chairman Kim is hiding in Diamond Medical Foundation,

631
00:38:25,786 --> 00:38:28,056
what would he have done with such a space?

632
00:38:29,315 --> 00:38:32,826
What would a drug dealer do hiding in a hospital?

633
00:38:33,755 --> 00:38:34,956
Kang Jae.

634
00:38:35,996 --> 00:38:37,295
Kang Jae.

635
00:38:38,065 --> 00:38:39,766
You know that thing we were talking about before, the karaoke...

636
00:38:40,295 --> 00:38:42,135
- I mean this is... - What is this?

637
00:38:43,536 --> 00:38:45,165
You guys are strange.

638
00:38:45,166 --> 00:38:47,004
What? What's strange now?

639
00:38:47,005 --> 00:38:49,235
I'm a detective. If I say it's strange, it's strange.

640
00:38:49,936 --> 00:38:51,274
What are you doing behind my back?

641
00:38:51,275 --> 00:38:53,246
I told you it was nothing.

642
00:38:53,476 --> 00:38:54,576
Are you two...

643
00:38:56,746 --> 00:38:57,985
dating?

644
00:38:59,786 --> 00:39:00,916
You guys are dating, aren't you?

645
00:39:00,956 --> 00:39:02,056
That's not it.

646
00:39:02,315 --> 00:39:04,425
You really have no sense.

647
00:39:05,626 --> 00:39:06,856
That's really strange.

648
00:39:07,456 --> 00:39:09,925
You need to go to the hospital in Incheon.

649
00:39:10,056 --> 00:39:11,964
A Chinese gangster got into trouble.

650
00:39:11,965 --> 00:39:15,065
We need to investigate whether it's related to the karaoke case.

651
00:39:15,095 --> 00:39:17,735
Don't even mention it. It was so scary.

652
00:39:18,135 --> 00:39:19,266
He was stabbed in the stomach...

653
00:39:20,505 --> 00:39:22,205
He came in bleeding so much.

654
00:39:22,206 --> 00:39:26,045
- He ran away after the treatment? - Yes.

655
00:39:26,545 --> 00:39:28,375
He was Chinese.

656
00:39:28,376 --> 00:39:29,516
He couldn't speak Korean.

657
00:39:29,715 --> 00:39:32,645
Let's secure the CCTV and check his face first.

658
00:39:32,646 --> 00:39:34,755
You won't be able to see his face in the footage.

659
00:39:35,186 --> 00:39:36,654
- Why not? - He had plastic surgery...

660
00:39:36,655 --> 00:39:37,726
all over his face.

661
00:39:37,885 --> 00:39:40,555
His eyes, nose, and face shape too.

662
00:39:40,556 --> 00:39:42,525
He had bandages wrapped around his face.

663
00:39:42,595 --> 00:39:45,195
- Plastic surgery? - Right. And this.

664
00:39:47,936 --> 00:39:49,666
He left this behind.

665
00:39:51,635 --> 00:39:52,905
Look at that bag.

666
00:39:53,065 --> 00:39:55,135
If he's holding drugs, that's worth millions.

667
00:39:56,735 --> 00:39:59,005
It's the bag he was carrying that night.

668
00:40:03,646 --> 00:40:06,815
What? It looks like an overnight bag.

669
00:40:07,956 --> 00:40:09,056
Pumpkin juice?

670
00:40:09,356 --> 00:40:10,686
He must have drunk this for the swelling.

671
00:40:11,885 --> 00:40:13,154
Kang Jae.

672
00:40:13,155 --> 00:40:14,925
He really must have been here to get plastic surgery.

673
00:40:15,456 --> 00:40:17,326
This had nothing to do with drugs.

674
00:40:18,195 --> 00:40:20,095
Gosh. We were wrong.

675
00:40:22,195 --> 00:40:24,106
He had plastic surgery.

676
00:40:25,405 --> 00:40:28,005
But he couldn't get it done in a regular hospital.

677
00:40:28,905 --> 00:40:30,005
What?

678
00:40:33,505 --> 00:40:34,615
Na Hee.

679
00:40:36,045 --> 00:40:37,985
- I figured it out. - Figure what out?

680
00:40:38,646 --> 00:40:40,516
What Chairman Kim did at the hospital.

681
00:40:42,615 --> 00:40:43,686
I figured it out.

682
00:40:45,025 --> 00:40:48,996
Seriously. You really have a generous heart.

683
00:40:49,326 --> 00:40:52,425
I'm kind of petty, so I tend to hold onto these things.

684
00:40:53,166 --> 00:40:56,666
No. It's really okay. It's all in the past.

685
00:40:57,465 --> 00:41:00,536
You and I have both changed since that day.

686
00:41:02,905 --> 00:41:04,576
I'm elated right now.

687
00:41:05,275 --> 00:41:07,476
I think I will remember this moment for a long time.

688
00:41:07,815 --> 00:41:10,015
We met here by chance.

689
00:41:10,016 --> 00:41:11,746
And no one here knows about us.

690
00:41:12,615 --> 00:41:14,155
Just being here together.

691
00:41:16,286 --> 00:41:18,155
I had a lot on my mind too.

692
00:41:19,056 --> 00:41:20,556
But you're right.

693
00:41:21,396 --> 00:41:24,425
There won't be any problems when it's just the two of us.

694
00:41:25,896 --> 00:41:27,996
Woo Ri, do you want to come up to my room?

695
00:41:28,336 --> 00:41:30,396
We can have dinner together and talk all we want.

696
00:41:31,505 --> 00:41:32,536
Well...

697
00:41:33,836 --> 00:41:34,905
What is it?

698
00:41:35,936 --> 00:41:38,706
You asked me the same thing before.

699
00:41:39,845 --> 00:41:41,115
I did?

700
00:41:41,845 --> 00:41:45,746
But I decided to wait until marriage.

701
00:41:46,586 --> 00:41:48,056
So we should talk outside.

702
00:41:49,115 --> 00:41:50,755
Wait, what?

703
00:41:50,885 --> 00:41:52,255
I'll abstain until marriage.

704
00:41:56,396 --> 00:41:57,726
You didn't know that?

705
00:41:59,996 --> 00:42:01,765
Then you ended up getting pregnant...

706
00:42:01,766 --> 00:42:03,595
when you had been waiting until marriage?

707
00:42:06,106 --> 00:42:07,806
You didn't know.

708
00:42:09,606 --> 00:42:11,505
I didn't know.

709
00:42:26,385 --> 00:42:27,795
Hey, what is this place?

710
00:42:31,396 --> 00:42:33,425
You found this secret place?

711
00:42:33,826 --> 00:42:35,035
Why didn't you report this to me?

712
00:42:35,036 --> 00:42:36,794
There was no point. The only violation I could find...

713
00:42:36,795 --> 00:42:38,405
was an illegal expansion of the building.

714
00:42:38,606 --> 00:42:40,435
- Then what? - We've been following a man...

715
00:42:40,436 --> 00:42:42,135
who illegally entered Korea through a shipping container.

716
00:42:42,476 --> 00:42:43,774
This is where we lost him.

717
00:42:43,775 --> 00:42:47,106
But that guy gave us a clue on what Chairman Kim...

718
00:42:47,576 --> 00:42:48,815
had been up to.

719
00:42:49,246 --> 00:42:50,345
Na Hee.

720
00:42:52,985 --> 00:42:54,056
Gosh.

721
00:42:57,056 --> 00:42:58,326
What's this?

722
00:42:59,425 --> 00:43:01,456
Hey, is this a hideout for a serial killer?

723
00:43:01,595 --> 00:43:03,326
He got plastic surgery here.

724
00:43:04,326 --> 00:43:05,425
What's this?

725
00:43:09,195 --> 00:43:12,305
What? This guy just wanted to look handsome?

726
00:43:12,306 --> 00:43:13,905
We won't be able to find him now...

727
00:43:14,106 --> 00:43:15,976
because we don't know what he looks like now.

728
00:43:16,675 --> 00:43:19,344
Chairman Kim stopped selling drugs over the past two years...

729
00:43:19,345 --> 00:43:21,045
and has been running a new business.

730
00:43:21,476 --> 00:43:24,385
He's been fixing up the faces of these criminals.

731
00:43:24,786 --> 00:43:27,855
Change their faces? To assume a new identity?

732
00:43:27,856 --> 00:43:30,985
His clients must be criminals who would be in jail for decades.

733
00:43:32,155 --> 00:43:33,456
Hold on a second.

734
00:43:34,556 --> 00:43:37,255
So he changed their faces and gave them a place to hide?

735
00:43:37,396 --> 00:43:40,395
He must be raking in a lot of money from the sound of it.

736
00:43:40,396 --> 00:43:43,536
Chairman Kim found another business that pays better than drugs.

737
00:43:43,695 --> 00:43:46,735
But how can we be certain Chairman Kim is involved?

738
00:43:47,775 --> 00:43:49,404
We don't know how these criminals look now,

739
00:43:49,405 --> 00:43:50,405
so we can't catch them.

740
00:43:50,945 --> 00:43:52,145
I bet it was more than just the faces.

741
00:43:52,146 --> 00:43:54,146
They probably got new identities and went into hiding.

742
00:43:56,746 --> 00:44:00,315
I'm sure there's a list that shows their before and after photos.

743
00:44:00,885 --> 00:44:03,254
Captain, some of the felons...

744
00:44:03,255 --> 00:44:05,226
vanished into thin air.

745
00:44:05,786 --> 00:44:07,595
This is a chance to round up all of them.

746
00:44:07,925 --> 00:44:10,495
Right. But where is the list?

747
00:44:10,496 --> 00:44:12,864
We must have solid evidence.

748
00:44:12,865 --> 00:44:14,064
The chairman complained to the higher-ups...

749
00:44:14,065 --> 00:44:15,396
about our investigation.

750
00:44:15,565 --> 00:44:16,795
So they've been on my back.

751
00:44:17,936 --> 00:44:19,206
The list...

752
00:44:21,936 --> 00:44:23,536
We'll find evidence no matter what.

753
00:44:30,746 --> 00:44:32,416
You have a message.

754
00:44:54,005 --> 00:44:55,036
Okay.

755
00:44:55,536 --> 00:44:57,706
We should go.

756
00:45:05,286 --> 00:45:06,345
Woo Ri.

757
00:45:06,686 --> 00:45:10,416
I'm sorry.

758
00:45:11,726 --> 00:45:14,755
Running into you at the beach was nice.

759
00:45:16,056 --> 00:45:17,195
But...

760
00:45:18,565 --> 00:45:20,395
just like our first meeting,

761
00:45:20,396 --> 00:45:22,565
we ended up getting reminded of my mistake.

762
00:45:22,896 --> 00:45:24,766
Gosh. That's awful.

763
00:45:26,405 --> 00:45:29,775
You don't have to feel that way. I told you I was fine.

764
00:45:31,045 --> 00:45:33,905
My decision to abstain made you uncomfortable, right?

765
00:45:34,615 --> 00:45:38,445
No. This isn't about that at all.

766
00:45:38,646 --> 00:45:42,056
Woo Ri, you are a lot more understanding...

767
00:45:42,556 --> 00:45:44,586
than I thought.

768
00:45:45,056 --> 00:45:46,424
You were waiting until you got married...

769
00:45:46,425 --> 00:45:48,024
but accidentally got pregnant.

770
00:45:48,025 --> 00:45:49,195
Despite that,

771
00:45:50,056 --> 00:45:52,396
you decided to have the baby.

772
00:45:53,525 --> 00:45:56,536
I felt like I didn't deserve to like you.

773
00:45:57,036 --> 00:45:58,135
Gosh.

774
00:45:59,206 --> 00:46:01,475
That means you're uncomfortable.

775
00:46:01,476 --> 00:46:02,775
No.

776
00:46:03,175 --> 00:46:05,844
In that logic, you must be more uncomfortable.

777
00:46:05,845 --> 00:46:09,245
I was a total player.

778
00:46:09,246 --> 00:46:10,345
And now,

779
00:46:11,345 --> 00:46:13,115
I'm divorced.

780
00:46:17,726 --> 00:46:19,525
You should go inside. It's getting cold.

781
00:46:20,326 --> 00:46:21,655
Gosh. Right.

782
00:46:22,595 --> 00:46:24,525
Here. Take this.

783
00:46:28,195 --> 00:46:29,536
What's this?

784
00:46:31,905 --> 00:46:35,175
- A letter? - Gosh, no. It's like a memo.

785
00:46:35,936 --> 00:46:36,936
That's it.

786
00:46:38,275 --> 00:46:40,246
You should go inside. And sleep tight.

787
00:46:40,545 --> 00:46:42,445
It's cold. Gosh, it's freezing.

788
00:47:02,166 --> 00:47:03,694
When I'm with you,

789
00:47:03,695 --> 00:47:07,206
you make me strive to become a better person.

790
00:47:08,635 --> 00:47:12,845
You and the baby help me be a better man.

791
00:47:13,945 --> 00:47:15,345
I'd like to thank you from the bottom of my heart.

792
00:47:31,896 --> 00:47:33,266
By the way,

793
00:47:33,396 --> 00:47:37,336
this is my first time introducing my boyfriend to my mom.

794
00:47:37,666 --> 00:47:39,536
I see.

795
00:47:40,936 --> 00:47:44,405
I also thought about what this meeting would mean.

796
00:47:44,706 --> 00:47:48,516
But it didn't matter if this meeting was casual or serious.

797
00:47:48,775 --> 00:47:49,976
I'm fine with whatever happens.

798
00:47:51,445 --> 00:47:53,215
- Hyung Sik. - Yes.

799
00:47:54,516 --> 00:47:56,815
You have very long eyelashes.

800
00:48:14,536 --> 00:48:15,836
Dad.

801
00:48:16,235 --> 00:48:17,376
"Dad"?

802
00:48:17,675 --> 00:48:20,175
Mom. Is this...

803
00:48:20,376 --> 00:48:21,445
"Mom"?

804
00:48:22,876 --> 00:48:24,246
Is he your son?

805
00:48:25,016 --> 00:48:26,146
Is she your daughter?

806
00:48:26,916 --> 00:48:28,715
The woman you are seeing...

807
00:48:28,815 --> 00:48:31,956
Mom. You've been seeing Hyung Sik's father?

808
00:48:39,425 --> 00:48:41,065
Were you guys kissing just now?

809
00:48:41,595 --> 00:48:44,635
Mom! That's not important right now.

810
00:48:48,405 --> 00:48:51,075
Come with us, Ms. Yu.

811
00:48:51,076 --> 00:48:54,044
I said no. Why don't you two just go together?

812
00:48:54,045 --> 00:48:55,774
Just join us.

813
00:48:55,775 --> 00:48:59,245
Hey, there are only two seats. Should I sit on your lap?

814
00:48:59,246 --> 00:49:02,515
I should have brought a bigger car. I'm sorry.

815
00:49:02,516 --> 00:49:04,585
Gosh. Don't apologize. I'm fine.

816
00:49:04,586 --> 00:49:06,885
She can be dull at times. Goodness.

817
00:49:06,956 --> 00:49:09,194
- Bye! - Ms. Yu!

818
00:49:09,195 --> 00:49:10,226
Gosh.

819
00:49:11,056 --> 00:49:13,365
Goodness. She's so fast.

820
00:49:22,376 --> 00:49:23,904
Thank you for the ride.

821
00:49:23,905 --> 00:49:25,275
I should thank you.

822
00:49:25,345 --> 00:49:28,115
We had a chance to talk on our way here. I liked it.

823
00:49:38,726 --> 00:49:41,226
Woo Ri. What is it?

824
00:49:41,896 --> 00:49:42,956
What's going on?

825
00:49:43,226 --> 00:49:44,595
What is it?

826
00:49:45,326 --> 00:49:47,226
Mine got picked.

827
00:49:47,766 --> 00:49:48,995
Pardon? What?

828
00:49:48,996 --> 00:49:50,564
I applied to a children's story contest.

829
00:49:50,565 --> 00:49:51,865
And mine got chosen.

830
00:49:52,036 --> 00:49:53,166
Really?

831
00:49:53,235 --> 00:49:54,876
Congratulations! That's great news.

832
00:49:55,275 --> 00:49:56,376
Gosh.

833
00:49:57,135 --> 00:49:59,175
It's not a big contest.

834
00:50:00,206 --> 00:50:01,476
I was lucky.

835
00:50:03,376 --> 00:50:04,985
Woo Ri,

836
00:50:05,445 --> 00:50:06,845
why do you think you got lucky?

837
00:50:07,885 --> 00:50:08,955
Pardon?

838
00:50:08,956 --> 00:50:10,686
You won that with your hard work.

839
00:50:11,525 --> 00:50:14,255
You might think everything that happened might be out of luck.

840
00:50:14,695 --> 00:50:17,595
But maybe, all of your hard work...

841
00:50:18,666 --> 00:50:20,425
brought you good results.

842
00:50:22,336 --> 00:50:24,396
- Ms. Lee. I need your approval. - Later.

843
00:50:25,365 --> 00:50:27,306
Come on. Move!

844
00:50:37,275 --> 00:50:38,385
Woo Ri.

845
00:50:41,215 --> 00:50:42,254
Raphael.

846
00:50:42,255 --> 00:50:43,985
So you'll film in Gangwon Province.

847
00:50:44,215 --> 00:50:45,885
Are the writers joining you there?

848
00:50:45,956 --> 00:50:47,786
The writers work in their studio.

849
00:50:48,025 --> 00:50:50,254
But if you get them a room there,

850
00:50:50,255 --> 00:50:51,865
can't they work in the room?

851
00:50:51,996 --> 00:50:53,295
They can get some fresh air too.

852
00:50:55,036 --> 00:50:56,094
Are you taking a dump?

853
00:50:56,095 --> 00:50:57,904
No. I ran into someone here.

854
00:50:57,905 --> 00:51:00,166
So be on your own for a while. Bye.

855
00:51:01,576 --> 00:51:02,936
You can go to her now.

856
00:51:10,775 --> 00:51:12,214
Congratulations, Woo Ri.

857
00:51:12,215 --> 00:51:13,445
Go in and get some rest.

858
00:51:14,686 --> 00:51:16,815
Thank you. Bye.

859
00:51:27,565 --> 00:51:28,936
Raphael.

860
00:51:54,286 --> 00:51:55,425
Wait.

861
00:51:59,525 --> 00:52:01,125
What?

862
00:52:01,126 --> 00:52:02,365
Gosh. That was my chance.

863
00:52:05,065 --> 00:52:07,735
Everything that's happening to me now...

864
00:52:08,135 --> 00:52:09,836
feels surreal to me.

865
00:52:11,106 --> 00:52:13,175
After time passes by,

866
00:52:13,576 --> 00:52:15,675
when I'm old and Gray,

867
00:52:16,976 --> 00:52:19,485
I hope reminiscing these moments...

868
00:52:22,385 --> 00:52:25,626
will bring me happiness.

869
00:52:30,025 --> 00:52:31,425
It will.

870
00:52:32,626 --> 00:52:34,126
I'll make it so.

871
00:52:47,945 --> 00:52:50,976
- Mom. What are you going to do? - What?

872
00:52:51,146 --> 00:52:52,685
He's Hyung Sik's father.

873
00:52:52,686 --> 00:52:54,186
And you are my daughter.

874
00:52:54,246 --> 00:52:55,815
That can't be.

875
00:52:56,115 --> 00:52:57,516
What do we call this?

876
00:52:57,615 --> 00:52:59,626
It's like an in-law is dating another in-law.

877
00:52:59,786 --> 00:53:02,195
Anyway, this can't happen.

878
00:53:03,425 --> 00:53:04,665
Mom.

879
00:53:04,666 --> 00:53:06,626
You're not going to see Mr. Jung Chun Sam again, right?

880
00:53:07,295 --> 00:53:08,536
I will see him.

881
00:53:08,735 --> 00:53:11,865
He's the first romantic guy I've met in my life.

882
00:53:12,635 --> 00:53:14,735
I don't want to break up with Hyung Sik either.

883
00:53:15,576 --> 00:53:17,274
You can date someone else.

884
00:53:17,275 --> 00:53:19,306
You can just date anyone you see on the street.

885
00:53:19,706 --> 00:53:20,905
Mom.

886
00:53:21,775 --> 00:53:24,045
So that's your opinion of me.

887
00:53:24,786 --> 00:53:27,645
- What? - A woman who dates any man.

888
00:53:27,646 --> 00:53:30,056
What are you talking about? Don't pick at my words.

889
00:53:30,485 --> 00:53:31,825
You can date Seoung Il.

890
00:53:31,826 --> 00:53:33,555
That's good for everyone.

891
00:53:33,556 --> 00:53:35,825
Why must I think about other people?

892
00:53:35,826 --> 00:53:37,655
I must follow my heart.

893
00:53:37,726 --> 00:53:39,024
I just want to date a man.

894
00:53:39,025 --> 00:53:40,365
Why must I think about everyone else?

895
00:53:41,025 --> 00:53:44,234
You said you didn't want Woo Ri to date Raphael for the baby's sake.

896
00:53:44,235 --> 00:53:45,365
You...

897
00:53:46,536 --> 00:53:48,404
Gosh. You are still immature.

898
00:53:48,405 --> 00:53:50,036
Isn't that what moms are supposed to do?

899
00:53:50,576 --> 00:53:52,875
Shouldn't they yield for their daughter's happiness?

900
00:53:52,876 --> 00:53:54,044
Isn't that what moms do?

901
00:53:54,045 --> 00:53:55,274
No.

902
00:53:55,275 --> 00:53:56,945
I don't want to yield this time.

903
00:53:57,815 --> 00:53:59,315
I hate that I'm your daughter too.

904
00:54:01,016 --> 00:54:02,715
I'm home.

905
00:54:10,655 --> 00:54:12,095
What's up with the mood here?

906
00:54:19,005 --> 00:54:21,135
You're so pathetic.

907
00:54:25,706 --> 00:54:26,775
What's this?

908
00:54:29,115 --> 00:54:30,944
Throw that out. It's bad luck.

909
00:54:30,945 --> 00:54:31,945
What's this?

910
00:54:31,946 --> 00:54:33,645
No Man Chul gave it to me.

911
00:54:33,646 --> 00:54:35,355
It's bad luck. So throw it out.

912
00:54:35,356 --> 00:54:37,016
This isn't silver.

913
00:54:37,686 --> 00:54:38,885
Is it white gold?

914
00:54:39,126 --> 00:54:40,655
We can sell it.

915
00:54:43,909 --> 00:54:45,378
Throw it out.

916
00:54:52,405 --> 00:54:53,635
What's that?

917
00:54:58,806 --> 00:54:59,975
What is this?

918
00:55:02,876 --> 00:55:04,615
Murder. Rape.

919
00:55:06,016 --> 00:55:08,286
It doesn't look like it's a hospital-related document.

920
00:55:08,715 --> 00:55:09,885
Mom.

921
00:55:10,615 --> 00:55:12,485
No Man Chul was hiding this.

922
00:55:12,925 --> 00:55:15,856
This jerk knew he was in danger, so he left it with me.

923
00:55:16,695 --> 00:55:18,595
Don't you know him? He's called Chairman Kim, the drug dealer.

924
00:55:19,025 --> 00:55:21,326
I have my hands on one of the lists that'll make money.

925
00:55:21,936 --> 00:55:23,166
Chairman Kim?

926
00:55:23,695 --> 00:55:24,905
That Chairman Kim?

927
00:55:25,465 --> 00:55:26,634
Mom, you know him?

928
00:55:26,635 --> 00:55:28,806
I've heard of him too.

929
00:55:29,876 --> 00:55:31,606
Doesn't he sell drugs?

930
00:55:31,876 --> 00:55:32,975
Right.

931
00:55:32,976 --> 00:55:34,505
The faceless chairman.

932
00:55:34,976 --> 00:55:37,315
No one has seen him.

933
00:55:38,385 --> 00:55:39,615
Look.

934
00:55:40,385 --> 00:55:43,615
The hospital was laundering the criminals' identities.

935
00:55:43,755 --> 00:55:46,326
These criminals got new faces and identities.

936
00:55:46,786 --> 00:55:49,125
No Man Chul probably threatened him with this list...

937
00:55:49,126 --> 00:55:50,295
in exchange for a big sum of cash.

938
00:55:51,025 --> 00:55:52,524
That's how he got killed. Right?

939
00:55:52,525 --> 00:55:53,595
Right.

940
00:55:54,065 --> 00:55:55,396
Then...

941
00:55:56,496 --> 00:55:57,964
this list will make us money.

942
00:55:57,965 --> 00:55:59,405
Don't you get any stupid ideas!

943
00:55:59,905 --> 00:56:01,505
No Man Chul died because of this.

944
00:56:02,235 --> 00:56:03,405
Throw this out.

945
00:56:03,635 --> 00:56:05,505
You keep the list with you.

946
00:56:05,775 --> 00:56:08,106
Give the necklace to someone.

947
00:56:09,275 --> 00:56:10,476
Like who?

948
00:56:10,715 --> 00:56:13,646
Give it to the woman you hate for making you miserable.

949
00:56:14,045 --> 00:56:15,856
Give it to her.

950
00:56:16,615 --> 00:56:17,715
Oh Woo Ri?

951
00:56:18,755 --> 00:56:20,925
What if she gets hurt?

952
00:56:21,556 --> 00:56:22,625
Mom.

953
00:56:22,626 --> 00:56:25,065
I told you I didn't want anything to happen to the baby.

954
00:56:25,996 --> 00:56:27,396
My daughter, Mal Ja.

955
00:56:27,865 --> 00:56:30,496
You're worried about someone else getting hurt.

956
00:56:30,635 --> 00:56:32,005
But what about my legs?

957
00:56:32,965 --> 00:56:34,936
You don't care what happened to my legs.

958
00:56:37,275 --> 00:56:40,445
No. That's not what I meant, Mom.

959
00:56:41,246 --> 00:56:43,146
I do everything you tell me to do.

960
00:56:45,115 --> 00:56:47,385
We're just going to scare her a bit.

961
00:56:48,045 --> 00:56:50,586
I doubt Chairman Kim will senselessly kill people like that.

962
00:56:51,016 --> 00:56:53,385
He won't hurt the baby like that.

963
00:56:54,425 --> 00:56:56,695
We're just having some fun.

964
00:56:57,056 --> 00:56:58,425
Nothing will happen to her.

965
00:56:59,166 --> 00:57:00,365
Besides,

966
00:57:00,766 --> 00:57:04,094
what if she finds out that the hospital is helping...

967
00:57:04,095 --> 00:57:05,935
these criminals?

968
00:57:05,936 --> 00:57:08,505
"Raphael is a dangerous man."

969
00:57:08,876 --> 00:57:11,206
Wouldn't she be scared of him?

970
00:57:12,005 --> 00:57:13,905
We need to cause a rift between them...

971
00:57:14,476 --> 00:57:16,016
and get them to break up.

972
00:57:16,876 --> 00:57:18,545
Do you understand?

973
00:57:20,315 --> 00:57:21,544
Then...

974
00:57:21,545 --> 00:57:23,086
what do I do first?

975
00:58:19,313 --> 00:58:21,114
Where's the necklace?

976
00:59:02,267 --> 00:59:05,096
Grandma!

977
00:59:05,466 --> 00:59:07,366
It's because of me.

978
00:59:09,136 --> 00:59:11,207
I'll take care of Woo Ri.

979
00:59:11,607 --> 00:59:13,036
During those two years Chairman Kim kept quiet,

980
00:59:13,037 --> 00:59:14,675
Raphael was fighting cancer.

981
00:59:14,676 --> 00:59:16,747
As soon as he came back to work, Chairman Kim struck again.

982
00:59:16,877 --> 00:59:19,247
There's a lady I like.

983
00:59:19,346 --> 00:59:21,746
Lately, she's been having a hard time.

984
00:59:21,747 --> 00:59:24,416
So I hope this will entertain her even if it's brief.

985
00:59:24,417 --> 00:59:25,686
We can catch Chairman Kim now.

986
00:59:25,687 --> 00:59:26,957
We have a warrant.

987
00:59:27,287 --> 00:59:28,356
Woo Ri!

988
00:59:28,357 --> 00:59:29,957
You can't be with this man!
