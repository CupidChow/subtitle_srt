1
00:00:07,625 --> 00:00:09,765
I can't believe I gave
birth to this angel.

2
00:00:10,366 --> 00:00:12,036
You did. Who else?

3
00:00:12,165 --> 00:00:13,635
This little angel...

4
00:00:13,705 --> 00:00:16,405
Brought me into this
world, a whole new world.

5
00:00:16,835 --> 00:00:18,745
Your mother brought
you into this world,

6
00:00:18,746 --> 00:00:20,246
and I brought her into this world.

7
00:00:22,845 --> 00:00:24,046
How come he's not here yet?

8
00:00:24,985 --> 00:00:26,014
Who?

9
00:00:26,015 --> 00:00:28,046
Right, you said he'd be here early.

10
00:00:28,155 --> 00:00:29,185
Who?

11
00:00:29,186 --> 00:00:30,455
- Your husband.
- Your husband.

12
00:00:32,455 --> 00:00:33,585
There he is.

13
00:00:48,536 --> 00:00:49,706
Will you...

14
00:00:50,605 --> 00:00:51,845
Marry me?

15
00:00:57,846 --> 00:00:59,685
Kang jae. I'm pregnant.

16
00:01:03,385 --> 00:01:05,156
You're pregnant?

17
00:01:05,786 --> 00:01:07,355
She's pregnant, over.

18
00:01:07,555 --> 00:01:08,625
She's pregnant?

19
00:01:08,626 --> 00:01:10,495
- Pregnant?
- What's going on?

20
00:01:11,525 --> 00:01:14,096
Who's the father?

21
00:01:15,935 --> 00:01:18,505
He's asking who the father is.

22
00:01:18,506 --> 00:01:20,206
Mission failed. We're pulling out. Go!

23
00:01:57,506 --> 00:01:58,605
Don't tell me...

24
00:01:59,976 --> 00:02:01,445
You're going to keep the baby.

25
00:02:05,915 --> 00:02:07,186
I'm not an idiot.

26
00:02:08,686 --> 00:02:10,256
Why would I jeopardize my own future?

27
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:15,355
I'll take care of it.

28
00:02:20,966 --> 00:02:22,195
I'll take care of everything.

29
00:02:25,536 --> 00:02:26,566
What do you mean?

30
00:02:33,876 --> 00:02:35,376
I'll take you to the hospital...

31
00:02:36,316 --> 00:02:37,515
So you can get an abortion.

32
00:02:38,945 --> 00:02:41,515
I'll sue the doctor and
the hospital as well.

33
00:02:42,686 --> 00:02:43,786
Well...

34
00:02:45,556 --> 00:02:46,885
I'll take care of everything for you.

35
00:02:48,186 --> 00:02:49,695
Just think that nothing ever happened.

36
00:02:50,455 --> 00:02:51,596
Yes.

37
00:02:52,325 --> 00:02:55,295
It was just an accident, so
we'll get it sorted out.

38
00:02:56,096 --> 00:02:57,365
I'll do all the work.

39
00:02:58,036 --> 00:02:59,265
We're still the same.

40
00:03:00,306 --> 00:03:01,775
Nothing's changed.

41
00:03:01,776 --> 00:03:03,105
I'll make it work.

42
00:03:04,436 --> 00:03:05,806
When it's all sorted out,

43
00:03:08,445 --> 00:03:09,816
you will marry me, right?

44
00:03:36,635 --> 00:03:37,775
Get going.

45
00:03:37,776 --> 00:03:39,006
Go inside.

46
00:03:47,286 --> 00:03:48,685
You should get going.

47
00:03:48,686 --> 00:03:50,556
After you go inside. Go on.

48
00:04:18,886 --> 00:04:21,586
Woo ri, you're home.
Have you eaten yet?

49
00:04:22,185 --> 00:04:23,415
Yes, I have.

50
00:04:23,786 --> 00:04:24,985
My gosh.

51
00:04:25,386 --> 00:04:27,255
What happened to you, sweetheart?

52
00:04:27,526 --> 00:04:28,826
Are you coming down with something?

53
00:04:28,925 --> 00:04:30,625
No, I'm fine.

54
00:04:31,226 --> 00:04:32,565
I'm a little tired. That's all.

55
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:34,994
I should go to bed.

56
00:04:34,995 --> 00:04:36,165
All right.

57
00:04:37,935 --> 00:04:41,636
I should order some herbal
medicine for her every season.

58
00:04:42,206 --> 00:04:44,576
She's been constantly catching
a cold since last fall.

59
00:04:48,005 --> 00:04:49,615
- Mom.
- What?

60
00:04:51,115 --> 00:04:54,016
What? Do you want some
herbal medicine too?

61
00:04:54,716 --> 00:04:56,485
Your granddaughter is healthy.

62
00:04:56,555 --> 00:04:57,956
She's so healthy that...

63
00:04:58,386 --> 00:04:59,485
What?

64
00:05:01,286 --> 00:05:02,555
Just look after your own health.

65
00:05:21,776 --> 00:05:26,185
How would it feel to be pregnant
with a stranger's child...

66
00:05:26,516 --> 00:05:28,245
Due to an artificial
insemination mix-up?

67
00:05:28,915 --> 00:05:30,855
I'm an aspiring writer.

68
00:05:39,165 --> 00:05:41,095
You've got a wild imagination.

69
00:05:41,096 --> 00:05:43,294
I don't even want to imagine what
it'd be like. It's too awful.

70
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:44,835
Talk about a bad soap opera.

71
00:05:44,836 --> 00:05:46,234
It'll be one ridiculous story.

72
00:05:46,235 --> 00:05:48,036
I might do it if I could
get paid a fortune.

73
00:05:52,305 --> 00:05:54,605
How much? How much do you want?

74
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:56,446
It's got to be more than six figures.

75
00:05:56,516 --> 00:05:59,184
I'd go to jail for 10 months if
someone offered me 500,000 dollars,

76
00:05:59,185 --> 00:06:00,684
but I can't carry a
baby for ten months!

77
00:06:00,685 --> 00:06:02,086
I won't even do it for
a million dollars.

78
00:06:02,315 --> 00:06:04,716
There are many apartments in seoul
that go for over a million dollars.

79
00:06:05,386 --> 00:06:06,855
If it's two million,
I'd think about it.

80
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:11,554
Two million dollars in ten months.
Then I'm set for life.

81
00:06:11,555 --> 00:06:12,696
I'd be totally up for that.

82
00:06:17,365 --> 00:06:18,536
Two million dollars...

83
00:06:29,846 --> 00:06:30,976
Do you want to join me?

84
00:06:32,685 --> 00:06:34,586
I can't drink. I'm pregnant.

85
00:06:37,685 --> 00:06:38,925
I'm sorry about earlier.

86
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:43,196
You should've gotten an abortion today.

87
00:06:44,096 --> 00:06:45,396
You couldn't because I caused a scene.

88
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:49,336
What's wrong with you, seriously?

89
00:06:49,865 --> 00:06:51,395
I can't believe you hit her.

90
00:06:51,396 --> 00:06:53,266
She earned it, didn't she?

91
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:57,706
Get an abortion first
thing tomorrow morning.

92
00:06:59,545 --> 00:07:00,706
Mom.

93
00:07:02,915 --> 00:07:04,846
I want to ask you something.

94
00:07:06,586 --> 00:07:07,685
What?

95
00:07:09,415 --> 00:07:10,685
Why did you...

96
00:07:15,086 --> 00:07:16,254
Never mind.

97
00:07:16,255 --> 00:07:17,494
Just say it.

98
00:07:17,495 --> 00:07:18,565
I said, never mind.

99
00:07:19,565 --> 00:07:20,596
Okay.

100
00:07:21,766 --> 00:07:23,266
You must have a lot on your mind now.

101
00:07:25,805 --> 00:07:28,136
They say most daughters suffer
the same fate as their mothers'.

102
00:07:29,805 --> 00:07:32,675
Why must this happen to you too?

103
00:07:41,216 --> 00:07:42,355
Go to bed.

104
00:07:49,555 --> 00:07:50,755
How can I sleep right now?

105
00:07:57,295 --> 00:07:58,805
There was something...

106
00:07:59,105 --> 00:08:01,505
I had always wanted to ask
mom since I was little,

107
00:08:03,206 --> 00:08:05,505
but I couldn't bring myself to do it.

108
00:08:09,875 --> 00:08:10,976
Mom.

109
00:08:12,946 --> 00:08:14,245
Why did you...

110
00:08:15,885 --> 00:08:17,155
Decide to keep me?

111
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:29,365
My mom gave birth to me when
she was still a schoolgirl.

112
00:08:29,966 --> 00:08:31,765
My dad died in an accident,

113
00:08:32,365 --> 00:08:35,375
but she still decided to keep me
when she was just a young girl.

114
00:08:35,735 --> 00:08:37,836
If I didn't have woo ri back then...

115
00:08:38,306 --> 00:08:40,145
If I didn't...

116
00:08:42,245 --> 00:08:44,976
Oh, dear.

117
00:08:46,745 --> 00:08:47,985
Why did you keep me?

118
00:08:50,056 --> 00:08:51,755
If you were going to
regret it that much,

119
00:08:52,755 --> 00:08:54,255
you shouldn't have kept me.

120
00:09:22,515 --> 00:09:23,555
Honey.

121
00:09:23,556 --> 00:09:25,086
What are you doing here?

122
00:09:25,216 --> 00:09:27,485
I called him.

123
00:09:27,655 --> 00:09:29,725
I thought I should tell
you the results...

124
00:09:29,726 --> 00:09:31,455
When you were here together.

125
00:09:31,456 --> 00:09:32,726
I see.

126
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:37,235
Wait, I haven't gotten
any tests done yet.

127
00:09:43,275 --> 00:09:44,535
I'm sorry.

128
00:09:46,645 --> 00:09:48,245
You can't just leave like this!

129
00:09:49,676 --> 00:09:50,715
Let's sue them.

130
00:09:50,716 --> 00:09:53,046
We'll sue the doctor
and this hospital too!

131
00:09:53,086 --> 00:09:54,215
Ma ri.

132
00:09:54,216 --> 00:09:57,315
How could she give your
last sperm to a stranger?

133
00:09:57,316 --> 00:09:58,826
Ma ri!

134
00:10:03,447 --> 00:10:06,077
This must've been exhausting for you.

135
00:10:07,218 --> 00:10:10,748
All your desperate antics
must've taken a lot out of you.

136
00:10:12,817 --> 00:10:14,388
It's really over now.

137
00:10:15,388 --> 00:10:16,457
We're done.

138
00:10:25,098 --> 00:10:29,008
I only have one chance to make a baby.

139
00:10:31,738 --> 00:10:33,807
And thinking about that...

140
00:10:36,008 --> 00:10:39,547
Made me feel like there could
be someone out there...

141
00:10:40,547 --> 00:10:42,077
Who I'm destined to be with.

142
00:10:56,768 --> 00:10:59,937
What's wrong? Are you not pregnant?

143
00:11:00,398 --> 00:11:02,337
Someone else is.

144
00:11:03,008 --> 00:11:05,407
- What are you talking about?
- The doctor...

145
00:11:05,677 --> 00:11:08,337
Injected the sperm
into the wrong person.

146
00:11:11,047 --> 00:11:12,378
That's nuts.

147
00:11:13,718 --> 00:11:15,987
Mom, it's all over now.

148
00:11:15,988 --> 00:11:17,517
No, it's not!

149
00:11:17,518 --> 00:11:19,718
We can't let our three years'
worth of work go down the drain.

150
00:11:21,057 --> 00:11:23,286
But we have no other option!

151
00:11:23,287 --> 00:11:25,327
"Option"? That's...

152
00:11:26,258 --> 00:11:27,497
We'll find a way.

153
00:11:27,498 --> 00:11:29,727
You're always so pessimistic.
You see, that's your problem.

154
00:11:29,728 --> 00:11:34,437
I told you to be more
positive about everything.

155
00:11:37,037 --> 00:11:39,107
Mom, I'm exhausted.

156
00:11:39,108 --> 00:11:40,207
Oh, my sweetheart.

157
00:11:41,008 --> 00:11:44,207
Are you tired of doing
all the work now?

158
00:11:45,047 --> 00:11:47,877
Then let the bear do all the work...

159
00:11:47,878 --> 00:11:51,087
So we can just sit back
and enjoy the show.

160
00:11:52,758 --> 00:11:53,817
What?

161
00:11:54,817 --> 00:11:58,657
Remember, the power of positive
thinking. "I can do it."

162
00:11:58,898 --> 00:12:00,358
"I got this."

163
00:12:03,667 --> 00:12:05,468
- Who is it?
- My gosh! Who?

164
00:12:05,768 --> 00:12:08,368
That woman. The one who's pregnant!

165
00:12:08,537 --> 00:12:09,967
Why do you ask?

166
00:12:09,968 --> 00:12:12,138
I cannot disclose patient information.

167
00:12:12,807 --> 00:12:15,877
You have a red pill and a
blue pill in front of you.

168
00:12:15,878 --> 00:12:17,647
- Which one will you take?
- Sorry?

169
00:12:17,648 --> 00:12:19,217
If you take the red one,

170
00:12:19,218 --> 00:12:20,916
you'll have to share a tiny cell...

171
00:12:20,917 --> 00:12:22,786
And even a toilet with eight cellmates.

172
00:12:22,787 --> 00:12:24,218
If you choose the blue one,

173
00:12:24,718 --> 00:12:26,718
you can continue working as a doctor.

174
00:12:26,817 --> 00:12:29,327
The blue one. I'll take the blue pill.

175
00:12:29,557 --> 00:12:30,957
I just need her to give
birth to the baby.

176
00:12:31,157 --> 00:12:34,327
I just need that woman to deliver
the baby safe and sound!

177
00:12:34,998 --> 00:12:36,098
One moment, please.

178
00:12:39,437 --> 00:12:40,498
Here.

179
00:12:44,108 --> 00:12:46,207
"Oh woo ri"?

180
00:12:47,207 --> 00:12:49,176
Gosh, the name rings a bell.

181
00:12:49,177 --> 00:12:52,778
She's coming in today for an abortion.

182
00:12:53,177 --> 00:12:54,547
No way!

183
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:57,717
- My gosh.
- Reschedule it.

184
00:12:57,718 --> 00:12:59,817
- Okay.
- Try to buy some time.

185
00:13:00,018 --> 00:13:01,287
Yes, ma'am.

186
00:13:06,858 --> 00:13:10,066
Hey, what's wrong?

187
00:13:10,067 --> 00:13:12,197
Didn't you see a doctor?
Are you not feeling well?

188
00:13:13,468 --> 00:13:16,037
- I'm okay.
- You don't look okay.

189
00:13:16,807 --> 00:13:18,008
What's wrong? Tell me.

190
00:13:19,177 --> 00:13:20,378
Ms. yu.

191
00:13:22,648 --> 00:13:23,907
Ye ri.

192
00:13:24,577 --> 00:13:25,577
What is it?

193
00:13:27,278 --> 00:13:28,648
Nowadays,

194
00:13:29,917 --> 00:13:31,787
abortions are legal, right?

195
00:13:32,457 --> 00:13:33,757
What are you talking about?

196
00:13:33,758 --> 00:13:36,858
If you get pregnant due to an
artificial insemination mix-up...

197
00:13:38,228 --> 00:13:39,297
You...

198
00:13:40,427 --> 00:13:41,728
You're...

199
00:13:43,297 --> 00:13:45,468
Finally beginning to understand
the charm of bad soap operas.

200
00:13:45,768 --> 00:13:47,337
I like that story!

201
00:13:48,537 --> 00:13:49,537
Thanks.

202
00:13:50,407 --> 00:13:53,436
It wouldn't be a sin to get an
abortion in that case, right?

203
00:13:53,437 --> 00:13:55,906
An abortion... no, let's not do that.

204
00:13:55,907 --> 00:13:57,978
How about... two million dollars?

205
00:13:58,047 --> 00:14:01,748
If a rich family asks her to keep
the baby for two million dollars,

206
00:14:01,817 --> 00:14:03,387
then you have a classic story.

207
00:14:03,388 --> 00:14:07,618
The thing is, no one would
actually offer that much money.

208
00:14:07,758 --> 00:14:09,586
Both the mother and the baby
would have a hard time.

209
00:14:09,587 --> 00:14:11,926
Hey, she can just give
the baby to that family,

210
00:14:11,927 --> 00:14:14,728
get the two million dollars,
and turn her life around!

211
00:14:15,327 --> 00:14:16,368
However,

212
00:14:16,728 --> 00:14:19,537
it'll turn into a tragedy
because of the maternal bond.

213
00:14:20,098 --> 00:14:22,638
"I am your birth mother."

214
00:14:23,608 --> 00:14:25,907
Come on. That's too old-fashioned.

215
00:14:26,238 --> 00:14:28,238
What? You're the one who started this.

216
00:14:29,608 --> 00:14:30,648
Come in.

217
00:14:30,907 --> 00:14:32,378
Hello, director.

218
00:14:32,748 --> 00:14:35,518
Ms. yu, sung il wanted to
talk to you about something,

219
00:14:35,988 --> 00:14:38,718
- in person.
- Yes. Sit down.

220
00:14:39,388 --> 00:14:40,518
You too, sit down.

221
00:14:41,787 --> 00:14:43,528
Well, Ms. yu.

222
00:14:44,888 --> 00:14:46,897
In the 28th and 29th episodes,

223
00:14:46,898 --> 00:14:49,898
chun sa da shows no emotion.

224
00:14:49,998 --> 00:14:52,737
He's not human. He's like a robot.

225
00:14:52,738 --> 00:14:54,738
A robot, I see.

226
00:14:55,067 --> 00:14:57,206
But last time, you mentioned...

227
00:14:57,207 --> 00:15:01,176
That you wanted to protect ji dok
sa like daddy-long-legs would.

228
00:15:01,177 --> 00:15:03,347
That's why I wrote those
two episodes like that.

229
00:15:03,348 --> 00:15:04,677
He's like a sunflower.

230
00:15:05,047 --> 00:15:07,478
A sunflower isn't human. It's a plant.

231
00:15:07,677 --> 00:15:10,148
I see, it's a plant.

232
00:15:10,687 --> 00:15:14,086
Ms. yu is already planning
to include some scenes...

233
00:15:14,087 --> 00:15:16,758
Where chun sa da is taking action
starting with the 30th episode.

234
00:15:17,457 --> 00:15:20,557
Chun sa da shouldn't
stand out just yet.

235
00:15:24,228 --> 00:15:25,367
Who is she?

236
00:15:25,368 --> 00:15:27,238
Oh, she is Ms. yu's assistant.

237
00:15:27,498 --> 00:15:29,267
Woo ri, haven't you
introduced yourself yet?

238
00:15:29,268 --> 00:15:31,368
I say hello to him
every time I see him.

239
00:15:32,108 --> 00:15:35,377
These days, I guess it's okay
for a mere assistant writer...

240
00:15:35,378 --> 00:15:38,478
To cut me off during an
important meeting like this.

241
00:15:39,278 --> 00:15:41,378
Is this the latest trend or something?

242
00:15:41,778 --> 00:15:43,416
My apologies. I'm sorry.

243
00:15:43,417 --> 00:15:46,017
The script for the 30th
episode will be out tomorrow.

244
00:15:46,018 --> 00:15:47,387
Go over it, and we can
discuss this again.

245
00:15:47,388 --> 00:15:48,717
- Really?
- Yes, just do that.

246
00:15:48,718 --> 00:15:50,627
Your character's doing great,

247
00:15:50,628 --> 00:15:52,387
and the story will revolve around you.

248
00:15:52,388 --> 00:15:54,398
You can't be in the spotlight
every day, you know.

249
00:15:55,457 --> 00:15:57,666
I'm not bringing this up
because I want to stand out.

250
00:15:57,667 --> 00:15:59,566
If the characters are not consistent,

251
00:15:59,567 --> 00:16:01,537
the viewers will react right away.

252
00:16:01,968 --> 00:16:03,108
In an instant!

253
00:16:03,508 --> 00:16:06,437
I swear, I'm bringing this up
for the sake of the drama.

254
00:16:06,537 --> 00:16:07,637
Of course.

255
00:16:07,638 --> 00:16:10,378
Thanks to you, the drama has
been getting good feedback.

256
00:16:10,478 --> 00:16:14,176
All thanks to your concern
and hard work. Thank you.

257
00:16:14,177 --> 00:16:16,687
- Sung il, you're the best.
- I know.

258
00:16:17,417 --> 00:16:18,447
Hello?

259
00:16:19,718 --> 00:16:21,857
You found the address? Where?

260
00:16:21,858 --> 00:16:23,427
Wait, hold on.

261
00:16:24,587 --> 00:16:26,926
Something's come up. I have to go.

262
00:16:26,927 --> 00:16:29,296
And let's keep our spirits up.

263
00:16:29,297 --> 00:16:31,326
This drama has to do well, you know?

264
00:16:31,327 --> 00:16:32,468
Let's do our very best.

265
00:16:33,398 --> 00:16:34,868
- You can do it!
- Thank you.

266
00:16:36,638 --> 00:16:39,408
You're feisty. Real feisty.

267
00:16:40,137 --> 00:16:42,647
- Have a good day.
- My goodness.

268
00:16:43,547 --> 00:16:46,117
Hello? Where?

269
00:16:53,287 --> 00:16:54,458
My goodness.

270
00:16:54,817 --> 00:16:56,658
Who is it, this time?

271
00:16:59,228 --> 00:17:01,396
One bottle of this
sells every second...

272
00:17:01,397 --> 00:17:03,126
Where I used to live.

273
00:17:03,127 --> 00:17:05,097
It's the most famous vitamin
supplement in Sweden.

274
00:17:06,168 --> 00:17:07,967
You should take better
care of your health.

275
00:17:07,968 --> 00:17:10,367
I got it just for you.

276
00:17:11,307 --> 00:17:12,537
Thank you.

277
00:17:14,107 --> 00:17:17,647
I was going to stop by the hospital
for the marketing meeting.

278
00:17:19,178 --> 00:17:21,248
Oh, this isn't about the drama.

279
00:17:23,287 --> 00:17:25,688
You go to rosy ob-gyn
clinic, don't you?

280
00:17:26,188 --> 00:17:27,258
How did you know?

281
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:29,087
The thing is,

282
00:17:30,357 --> 00:17:33,758
I was supposed to be injected
with the sperm they gave you.

283
00:17:34,758 --> 00:17:35,826
Sorry?

284
00:17:35,827 --> 00:17:38,027
My husband and I had been preparing
for artificial insemination,

285
00:17:38,028 --> 00:17:40,337
but they made the mistake
of giving it to you.

286
00:17:40,698 --> 00:17:41,768
What...

287
00:17:43,837 --> 00:17:45,408
But how...

288
00:17:47,908 --> 00:17:49,607
How did you know that I
was the one who got it?

289
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:53,346
By pure chance... I happened
to see the chart...

290
00:17:53,347 --> 00:17:54,917
And realized it was someone I knew.

291
00:17:54,918 --> 00:17:58,247
Since I know you, I can't just
pretend not to know about it.

292
00:17:58,248 --> 00:17:59,418
So here I am.

293
00:18:00,758 --> 00:18:01,887
I...

294
00:18:04,087 --> 00:18:05,627
I'll just pretend it never happened.

295
00:18:10,498 --> 00:18:13,837
You see, my husband and I
are in a bit of a bind.

296
00:18:14,938 --> 00:18:17,307
My husband had stomach cancer.

297
00:18:17,468 --> 00:18:20,536
He froze his sperm before
he began his chemotherapy.

298
00:18:20,537 --> 00:18:22,178
Luckily, he's recovered now,

299
00:18:22,537 --> 00:18:25,408
but the sperm you got
was the very last one.

300
00:18:27,317 --> 00:18:30,418
You've met my husband. Raphael.

301
00:18:32,518 --> 00:18:34,587
CEO Raphael?

302
00:18:35,258 --> 00:18:36,826
He's your husband?

303
00:18:36,827 --> 00:18:38,287
We will...

304
00:18:38,758 --> 00:18:41,498
Never conceive a child.

305
00:18:44,198 --> 00:18:45,768
Please help us.

306
00:18:45,998 --> 00:18:48,967
Gosh, what could I do...

307
00:18:48,968 --> 00:18:50,168
Our baby.

308
00:18:51,067 --> 00:18:52,738
Could you please keep the baby?

309
00:18:53,807 --> 00:18:55,508
Will you kill our baby?

310
00:18:56,307 --> 00:18:57,908
That was his last sperm.

311
00:18:59,107 --> 00:19:00,978
What am I supposed to do?

312
00:19:07,218 --> 00:19:08,787
What am I supposed to do?

313
00:19:11,158 --> 00:19:12,188
Sorry?

314
00:19:14,258 --> 00:19:16,028
What about my life?

315
00:19:45,428 --> 00:19:46,698
Hello...

316
00:20:10,347 --> 00:20:11,647
I thought...

317
00:20:14,158 --> 00:20:15,817
It was something that
only existed in movies.

318
00:20:17,728 --> 00:20:18,728
What?

319
00:20:18,928 --> 00:20:20,698
You know, private detectives
who track down people.

320
00:20:22,768 --> 00:20:24,498
- Why are you here?
- What about you?

321
00:20:25,228 --> 00:20:26,537
Why did you come to see me?

322
00:20:28,337 --> 00:20:30,007
I just happened to be there.

323
00:20:30,008 --> 00:20:31,637
Then why did you suddenly
leave me back then?

324
00:20:32,107 --> 00:20:33,537
I couldn't reach you.
Why did you do that?

325
00:20:35,938 --> 00:20:37,277
It's been so long that
I don't even remember.

326
00:20:37,278 --> 00:20:38,306
You shouldn't have come...

327
00:20:38,307 --> 00:20:39,616
If you were going to leave like that.

328
00:20:39,617 --> 00:20:40,877
It's been thirty years...

329
00:20:45,018 --> 00:20:46,117
Why did you show up?

330
00:20:52,857 --> 00:20:54,028
Duk chil...

331
00:20:55,057 --> 00:20:56,468
It's you, isn't it?

332
00:20:57,268 --> 00:20:58,366
Mom.

333
00:20:58,367 --> 00:20:59,567
It's you, isn't it?

334
00:20:59,797 --> 00:21:01,167
You're choi sung il, right?

335
00:21:01,168 --> 00:21:02,297
Yes, hello.

336
00:21:04,137 --> 00:21:05,238
She must be your mother.

337
00:21:05,738 --> 00:21:08,377
It's you. It's choi sung il.

338
00:21:09,137 --> 00:21:11,207
I'm such a fan.

339
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:12,846
I watch all your dramas.

340
00:21:12,847 --> 00:21:14,778
I've watched them all. My goodness.

341
00:21:14,847 --> 00:21:16,017
Thank you.

342
00:21:16,018 --> 00:21:17,748
Thanks to fans like you,

343
00:21:18,047 --> 00:21:20,458
I'm able to do what I do.

344
00:21:21,587 --> 00:21:23,857
By the way, what are you doing here?

345
00:21:25,057 --> 00:21:26,258
Well...

346
00:21:26,557 --> 00:21:27,896
He's here for the pork cutlet.

347
00:21:27,897 --> 00:21:29,057
- Yes.
- Is that so?

348
00:21:29,567 --> 00:21:32,126
My pork cutlets are famous here.

349
00:21:32,127 --> 00:21:33,566
It's the soul food of bukgajwa-dong.

350
00:21:33,567 --> 00:21:35,237
They try it in their childhood...

351
00:21:35,238 --> 00:21:37,037
And come back for it when they grow up.

352
00:21:37,168 --> 00:21:38,807
I'll go make some for you.

353
00:21:44,008 --> 00:21:45,278
Are you done?

354
00:21:45,807 --> 00:21:46,877
Yes.

355
00:21:49,748 --> 00:21:51,287
No man chul filed a complaint.

356
00:21:51,347 --> 00:21:52,687
I was called in for it.

357
00:21:52,688 --> 00:21:53,688
What are you going to do about it now?

358
00:21:54,218 --> 00:21:55,817
He ran away all of a sudden.

359
00:21:55,887 --> 00:21:57,687
You are always calm
when you're working.

360
00:21:57,688 --> 00:22:00,357
But why do you turn all crazy
when it comes to chairman Kim?

361
00:22:00,698 --> 00:22:02,056
Did you think if no man
chul got to chairman Kim...

362
00:22:02,057 --> 00:22:04,467
He'd just hand you chairman
Kim on a silver platter?

363
00:22:04,468 --> 00:22:05,468
He'd run away.

364
00:22:06,168 --> 00:22:08,137
Na hee, you remind us
who chairman Kim is.

365
00:22:10,508 --> 00:22:13,708
He exclusively supplied
ecstasy known as "sugar".

366
00:22:14,107 --> 00:22:15,737
No one's actually seen him,

367
00:22:15,738 --> 00:22:17,377
so he's known as the
faceless drug king.

368
00:22:17,508 --> 00:22:19,717
He killed the only
officer who saw him...

369
00:22:19,718 --> 00:22:20,978
And hasn't shown for two years.

370
00:22:23,587 --> 00:22:26,586
Sergeant Kim jun hyuk, who
was Kang jae's partner,

371
00:22:26,587 --> 00:22:28,918
died in the line of duty
while chasing chairman Kim.

372
00:22:29,258 --> 00:22:32,357
I also wake up in the middle of
the night thinking of jun hyuk.

373
00:22:32,958 --> 00:22:34,928
It upsets me too, you know.

374
00:22:35,297 --> 00:22:37,668
Yes, we need to catch chairman Kim.

375
00:22:37,728 --> 00:22:39,367
But don't move a muscle before
you have hard evidence.

376
00:22:39,637 --> 00:22:42,337
You won't catch him with that attitude.
Do you understand?

377
00:22:44,968 --> 00:22:47,137
Don't you go anywhere near no man chul.

378
00:22:48,307 --> 00:22:50,347
Then, I'll get going now.

379
00:22:58,248 --> 00:22:59,617
Can you really trust that one?

380
00:22:59,887 --> 00:23:01,488
Why would the police react
like that for no reason?

381
00:23:02,057 --> 00:23:04,757
I looked into it, and
there is no problem.

382
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:06,528
So why do a cosmetics event?

383
00:23:06,728 --> 00:23:09,157
It's just the start. So,
please, just wait and watch.

384
00:23:09,158 --> 00:23:11,396
Hey. Didn't I tell you
I'll start a hospital...

385
00:23:11,397 --> 00:23:13,198
In China in three years?

386
00:23:13,537 --> 00:23:15,498
China has a population of 1.4 billion.

387
00:23:15,897 --> 00:23:17,137
How much is that compared to Korea?

388
00:23:17,268 --> 00:23:18,707
If you just divide 50 million,

389
00:23:18,708 --> 00:23:21,076
I could have that enormous
amount of people...

390
00:23:21,077 --> 00:23:22,408
Get the double eyelid surgery...

391
00:23:22,537 --> 00:23:23,978
And nose jobs.

392
00:23:24,908 --> 00:23:27,918
So, I need you to focus on the
hospital work from now on.

393
00:23:28,018 --> 00:23:29,886
Plastic surgery is our leading product.

394
00:23:29,887 --> 00:23:31,418
You can just tie in the cosmetics.

395
00:23:33,918 --> 00:23:35,057
Gosh, my blood pressure.

396
00:23:37,387 --> 00:23:38,587
Get out all of you.

397
00:23:43,528 --> 00:23:44,827
Father.

398
00:23:44,998 --> 00:23:46,837
What is it ma ri?

399
00:23:47,037 --> 00:23:50,637
Actually, I have something
to discuss with you.

400
00:23:51,238 --> 00:23:52,367
Let's go.

401
00:23:52,668 --> 00:23:54,778
Father...

402
00:24:01,077 --> 00:24:02,347
What were you thinking?

403
00:24:03,988 --> 00:24:07,087
Are you going to make a big deal out
of your mishap by blurting it out?

404
00:24:07,387 --> 00:24:08,458
Well...

405
00:24:08,988 --> 00:24:10,528
Father should know about it as well.

406
00:24:11,528 --> 00:24:13,428
Although I didn't get pregnant,

407
00:24:13,728 --> 00:24:15,397
we have your baby.

408
00:24:16,097 --> 00:24:17,728
I met with the woman who got pregnant.

409
00:24:18,528 --> 00:24:19,738
Are you crazy?

410
00:24:20,097 --> 00:24:21,597
Why would you meet with her?

411
00:24:21,637 --> 00:24:23,007
Because it's our child.

412
00:24:23,008 --> 00:24:24,507
What do you mean?

413
00:24:24,508 --> 00:24:26,508
That was a medical mishap.
There is no child of ours.

414
00:24:26,877 --> 00:24:28,177
Honey.

415
00:24:28,178 --> 00:24:30,948
In Sweden or northern Europe where
I lived, surrogate mothers...

416
00:24:31,077 --> 00:24:32,408
- My gosh...
- It's quite normal.

417
00:24:34,647 --> 00:24:36,018
Are we in northern Europe?

418
00:24:36,317 --> 00:24:37,817
Is this Sweden?

419
00:24:38,748 --> 00:24:40,356
This is Korea.

420
00:24:40,357 --> 00:24:43,326
How can you ask a complete
stranger to bear our child?

421
00:24:43,327 --> 00:24:44,988
She's not a stranger.

422
00:24:46,158 --> 00:24:47,497
What?

423
00:24:47,498 --> 00:24:49,258
We both know her.

424
00:24:52,028 --> 00:24:53,097
Who is it?

425
00:24:53,897 --> 00:24:55,438
Attention, please.

426
00:24:55,567 --> 00:24:58,938
We ask for your cooperation as we
inform you of the visitations.

427
00:24:59,107 --> 00:25:02,607
For patient safety and prevention
of external infections,

428
00:25:02,708 --> 00:25:05,877
we are limiting visitation hours...

429
00:25:16,587 --> 00:25:19,028
Why do you need the courage
to say something you want?

430
00:25:20,057 --> 00:25:22,458
How can you achieve your dream
if you can't say what it is?

431
00:25:23,567 --> 00:25:24,797
Say it to me.

432
00:25:26,097 --> 00:25:28,567
My dream is to become
a drama screenwriter.

433
00:25:30,268 --> 00:25:32,208
My dream is to become
a drama screenwriter.

434
00:25:32,408 --> 00:25:35,178
That's it. You should say
it aloud so it comes true.

435
00:25:36,708 --> 00:25:37,908
Say it again.

436
00:25:37,948 --> 00:25:39,208
My dream is to become...

437
00:25:40,018 --> 00:25:41,278
A drama screenwriter.

438
00:25:44,418 --> 00:25:46,887
My dream is to become
a drama screenwriter!

439
00:25:47,617 --> 00:25:50,228
Writer oh woo ri!

440
00:25:51,327 --> 00:25:52,528
Yes!

441
00:26:19,218 --> 00:26:23,258
But I still want you to find out
patients' inconveniences...

442
00:26:23,758 --> 00:26:24,957
Then, keep up the hard work.

443
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:26,087
Yes, sir.

444
00:26:43,847 --> 00:26:46,147
After I heard you went
through all that,

445
00:26:47,077 --> 00:26:48,347
I was shocked.

446
00:26:49,117 --> 00:26:51,347
I also heard that the marketing
team leader came to see you.

447
00:26:52,387 --> 00:26:57,087
So I was pondering whether
to go and apologize to you.

448
00:26:59,327 --> 00:27:02,198
But I thought it was right
that no one bothered you.

449
00:27:03,768 --> 00:27:05,567
I will make sure no one
bothers you from now on.

450
00:27:06,397 --> 00:27:07,567
I'm sorry.

451
00:27:11,468 --> 00:27:12,837
What about you?

452
00:27:15,778 --> 00:27:16,908
Me?

453
00:27:17,508 --> 00:27:20,278
I heard you could no
longer have children.

454
00:27:21,317 --> 00:27:23,387
Your wife sounded desperate.

455
00:27:24,188 --> 00:27:27,617
I'm curious about your thoughts.

456
00:27:31,928 --> 00:27:33,087
Well...

457
00:27:34,258 --> 00:27:36,528
Being given a chance to live again...

458
00:27:37,067 --> 00:27:38,468
After realizing I could die,

459
00:27:40,198 --> 00:27:41,866
the first thing that came to mind...

460
00:27:41,867 --> 00:27:44,367
Was that I wanted to
start my own family.

461
00:27:45,867 --> 00:27:47,008
Yes.

462
00:27:47,208 --> 00:27:49,678
I really want a child.

463
00:27:50,708 --> 00:27:52,047
But this isn't the right way.

464
00:27:54,418 --> 00:27:56,847
You should only think
of yourself, Ms. oh.

465
00:27:57,188 --> 00:27:58,718
Pretend you haven't heard
about our problems.

466
00:28:00,188 --> 00:28:01,387
It was an accident.

467
00:28:02,188 --> 00:28:03,857
I know you're going through a
lot because of the accident,

468
00:28:04,087 --> 00:28:07,097
so I'll do anything
to help you fix this.

469
00:28:13,468 --> 00:28:15,066
I had the baby back then.

470
00:28:15,067 --> 00:28:17,467
- I thought you had an abortion.
- It's a long story to tell.

471
00:28:17,468 --> 00:28:19,437
You said you had an abortion.

472
00:28:19,438 --> 00:28:21,036
You wanted to end the relationship.

473
00:28:21,037 --> 00:28:23,137
You said you didn't want to see
me and that I should go away.

474
00:28:23,508 --> 00:28:25,547
And now you tell me, there's a child?

475
00:28:36,188 --> 00:28:39,557
What's the reason for revealing
this after 30 years?

476
00:28:40,198 --> 00:28:41,458
Well...

477
00:28:48,698 --> 00:28:50,107
She's the assistant
writer for your drama.

478
00:28:53,478 --> 00:28:54,738
The assistant writer?

479
00:28:59,248 --> 00:29:01,077
I wondered what kind of fate this was.

480
00:29:01,748 --> 00:29:03,748
You would have met once or
twice while working together.

481
00:29:03,817 --> 00:29:05,846
The thought of you two
in the same space...

482
00:29:05,847 --> 00:29:07,117
Not knowing each other...

483
00:29:07,718 --> 00:29:09,287
Seemed too harsh.

484
00:29:09,718 --> 00:29:11,028
That's why I decided to tell you.

485
00:29:11,258 --> 00:29:13,927
- I should go meet her right away.
- I'll tell her.

486
00:29:13,928 --> 00:29:15,326
Let's go right now.
We'll tell her then.

487
00:29:15,327 --> 00:29:18,396
She's going through a lot now.
Give her some time.

488
00:29:18,397 --> 00:29:20,268
What is it? What is she going through?

489
00:29:21,097 --> 00:29:22,468
How can this happen?

490
00:29:23,508 --> 00:29:25,267
This is big for us,

491
00:29:25,268 --> 00:29:27,007
but you said something bigger
happened to our daughter.

492
00:29:27,008 --> 00:29:28,036
So what is that?

493
00:29:28,037 --> 00:29:30,747
Yes, something big happened.

494
00:29:30,748 --> 00:29:32,008
Not us, but our daughter!

495
00:29:32,147 --> 00:29:34,077
Your daughter's name is woo ri.
Oh woo ri.

496
00:29:34,877 --> 00:29:36,077
Oh...

497
00:29:36,317 --> 00:29:39,418
That artificial insemination
accident story I told you about...

498
00:29:40,158 --> 00:29:42,757
What if the girl knew who
the sperm belonged to?

499
00:29:42,758 --> 00:29:45,228
What would she feel like?

500
00:29:46,928 --> 00:29:48,927
Yes, that's how you
should approach this.

501
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:51,228
Gosh. You really are talented
for outlandish stories.

502
00:29:51,528 --> 00:29:54,468
You should say that he turned
out to be her first love.

503
00:29:55,537 --> 00:29:57,408
And the girl should have
secrets about her birth.

504
00:29:58,067 --> 00:29:59,207
Excuse me?

505
00:29:59,208 --> 00:30:00,707
What did you learn from writer wang?

506
00:30:00,708 --> 00:30:03,107
Secrets about one's birth are a given.

507
00:30:03,748 --> 00:30:07,677
The middle-aged man she knows
turns out to be the father.

508
00:30:07,678 --> 00:30:09,217
That's absurd.

509
00:30:09,218 --> 00:30:10,688
Hey, what's your problem?

510
00:30:11,448 --> 00:30:13,687
You're the one who brought it up.

511
00:30:13,688 --> 00:30:14,718
Hello.

512
00:30:15,918 --> 00:30:17,258
Mr. choi.

513
00:30:17,688 --> 00:30:19,488
Hello, sung il.

514
00:30:20,458 --> 00:30:23,528
I brought something to eat.
Some snacks.

515
00:30:23,668 --> 00:30:25,027
Thank you.

516
00:30:25,028 --> 00:30:26,997
I'll work on the script revision.

517
00:30:26,998 --> 00:30:27,998
No need for that.

518
00:30:27,999 --> 00:30:30,708
I took a look at the script
again, and it's perfect.

519
00:30:30,837 --> 00:30:32,307
I don't know what got into me earlier.

520
00:30:32,537 --> 00:30:34,607
No need for revisions. It's perfect.

521
00:30:34,938 --> 00:30:37,376
Are you sure we don't
need to revise it?

522
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:39,807
Of course.

523
00:30:39,978 --> 00:30:43,347
I think I was a bit rude earlier.

524
00:30:44,887 --> 00:30:47,617
I wanted to apologize as well.

525
00:30:47,857 --> 00:30:49,518
And to our assistant writer.

526
00:30:50,458 --> 00:30:53,057
Ms. oh woo ri.

527
00:30:54,097 --> 00:30:55,258
Yes?

528
00:30:55,357 --> 00:30:57,397
I don't know what got into me earlier.

529
00:30:57,597 --> 00:31:00,536
I mean you work so hard.

530
00:31:00,537 --> 00:31:02,897
And you're so beautiful.

531
00:31:03,668 --> 00:31:06,036
Didn't you say you didn't have
any scenes to shoot today?

532
00:31:06,037 --> 00:31:07,978
Your outfit changed.

533
00:31:08,208 --> 00:31:10,508
It's all about self-maintenance.

534
00:31:11,508 --> 00:31:14,817
I've always done my best in
all the shows I've done.

535
00:31:16,077 --> 00:31:19,688
That's why I was able to
get to where I am today.

536
00:31:20,958 --> 00:31:25,587
I have 957,000 followers so far.

537
00:31:27,158 --> 00:31:30,198
I'm by far the best amongst
all the middle-aged stars.

538
00:31:31,367 --> 00:31:33,537
Dicaprio of the provocative dramas.

539
00:31:35,837 --> 00:31:39,137
You also follow me, don't you?

540
00:31:39,208 --> 00:31:41,807
Yes... sure.

541
00:31:47,577 --> 00:31:49,948
How have you been?

542
00:31:50,748 --> 00:31:52,647
- Excuse me?
- Any troubles?

543
00:31:53,958 --> 00:31:55,157
You don't look so well.

544
00:31:55,158 --> 00:31:56,826
No, that's not it.

545
00:31:56,827 --> 00:31:58,987
I just don't feel myself
today, that's all.

546
00:31:58,988 --> 00:32:01,657
Yes, woo ri doesn't feel so good today.

547
00:32:01,658 --> 00:32:03,257
She was going to leave early today.

548
00:32:03,258 --> 00:32:05,967
Would you like to leave early? We
don't need to revise the script.

549
00:32:05,968 --> 00:32:08,437
Yes, would that be okay?

550
00:32:08,438 --> 00:32:10,167
- Of course.
- Then...

551
00:32:10,168 --> 00:32:12,967
I'll give you a ride if you're sick.
I was about to leave now.

552
00:32:12,968 --> 00:32:15,208
No, that's okay.

553
00:32:15,637 --> 00:32:18,576
Why don't we talk about the script?

554
00:32:18,577 --> 00:32:21,178
What's there to talk about?
It's perfect.

555
00:32:21,748 --> 00:32:25,688
You just need to write it as you want.

556
00:32:25,748 --> 00:32:28,957
- Hey, wait...
- But since you are here...

557
00:32:28,958 --> 00:32:32,126
I think I can write it properly
once you tell me precisely.

558
00:32:32,127 --> 00:32:34,626
What should chun sa da
do to ji dok sa here?

559
00:32:34,627 --> 00:32:36,528
I told you it was perfect!

560
00:32:43,508 --> 00:32:44,807
I heard you knew the girl already.

561
00:32:45,067 --> 00:32:47,077
It's someone who works for
the drama that we sponsor.

562
00:32:49,908 --> 00:32:51,508
Father should know about it as well.

563
00:32:53,547 --> 00:32:54,917
Ma ri made a big mistake.

564
00:32:54,918 --> 00:32:56,816
What mistake? She did well.

565
00:32:56,817 --> 00:32:59,146
Ma ri went over her head and
caused this medical mishap.

566
00:32:59,147 --> 00:33:00,586
Both of you need to get it straight.

567
00:33:00,587 --> 00:33:02,087
You should be the one
to get this straight.

568
00:33:02,158 --> 00:33:03,687
We can't have our family
line cut off here.

569
00:33:03,688 --> 00:33:05,188
It already has!

570
00:33:13,537 --> 00:33:15,867
It won't work. Nothing works.

571
00:33:16,097 --> 00:33:18,107
No matter what I do, it won't work.

572
00:33:18,867 --> 00:33:20,037
What's wrong now?

573
00:33:20,678 --> 00:33:23,807
Raphael just hates me.

574
00:33:30,617 --> 00:33:32,718
Nothing is easy.

575
00:33:33,758 --> 00:33:37,056
You need to think positively.

576
00:33:37,057 --> 00:33:38,928
What do you want me to do
when nothing is working?

577
00:33:46,627 --> 00:33:48,167
Stop crying...

578
00:33:49,538 --> 00:33:51,408
And do as your mother tells you to.

579
00:33:52,638 --> 00:33:55,106
If Raphael won't cooperate,

580
00:33:55,107 --> 00:33:56,508
you need to work with
someone that will.

581
00:33:57,678 --> 00:33:59,877
The chairman is on our side, isn't he?

582
00:34:01,078 --> 00:34:03,687
You need to work with
your father-in-law.

583
00:34:05,047 --> 00:34:06,147
Father?

584
00:34:12,127 --> 00:34:13,187
Darn it.

585
00:34:13,957 --> 00:34:15,057
Who is it?

586
00:34:15,058 --> 00:34:17,027
You can't ignore me.

587
00:34:17,028 --> 00:34:19,368
If you want me to keep
calling you ma'am...

588
00:34:19,897 --> 00:34:21,437
You need to listen to me.

589
00:34:30,908 --> 00:34:32,747
Make sure you keep
this necklace on you.

590
00:34:33,647 --> 00:34:35,218
Only then I'll feel relaxed.

591
00:34:36,448 --> 00:34:39,247
You're still mine.

592
00:35:01,408 --> 00:35:03,437
Don't you know him? He's called
chairman Kim, the drug dealer.

593
00:35:03,948 --> 00:35:07,348
I have my hands on one of the
lists that'll make money.

594
00:35:09,377 --> 00:35:11,618
There was a reason why
the police came for you.

595
00:35:23,198 --> 00:35:24,627
Right, I didn't tell you.

596
00:35:25,227 --> 00:35:26,496
My shift changed.

597
00:35:26,497 --> 00:35:28,038
I'll come with you to
the hospital tomorrow.

598
00:35:28,738 --> 00:35:30,467
What hospital?

599
00:35:30,468 --> 00:35:32,066
Well...

600
00:35:32,067 --> 00:35:34,437
She has dry eyes. She's going
in for a prescription.

601
00:35:35,278 --> 00:35:36,777
Yes, that's it.

602
00:35:36,778 --> 00:35:38,107
Okay. Let's go.

603
00:35:41,747 --> 00:35:43,047
That was close.

604
00:35:44,448 --> 00:35:45,888
- Hello.
- Hello.

605
00:35:47,288 --> 00:35:48,317
Hello.

606
00:35:56,227 --> 00:35:57,598
Let's see.

607
00:36:03,937 --> 00:36:05,067
Gosh.

608
00:36:06,207 --> 00:36:07,308
Gosh.

609
00:36:12,948 --> 00:36:15,517
Gosh. That feels so good.

610
00:36:17,247 --> 00:36:18,848
Anna, you should try it as well.

611
00:36:19,218 --> 00:36:21,987
I don't need to. My shoulders are fine.

612
00:36:21,988 --> 00:36:23,016
How?

613
00:36:23,017 --> 00:36:26,956
I'm healed when I see my
granddaughter woo ri.

614
00:36:26,957 --> 00:36:28,828
I have no pain.

615
00:36:28,957 --> 00:36:31,427
If I had a granddaughter like that...

616
00:36:31,428 --> 00:36:33,598
I'd be full without eating.

617
00:36:34,267 --> 00:36:37,267
Veronica, you should
take care of yourself.

618
00:36:37,408 --> 00:36:39,037
You had pain all over your body...

619
00:36:39,038 --> 00:36:41,078
When your daughter got
divorced last year.

620
00:36:42,308 --> 00:36:45,046
Our Maria hasn't even gone on a trip...

621
00:36:45,047 --> 00:36:47,717
Being abstinent.

622
00:36:47,718 --> 00:36:48,747
Anna.

623
00:36:50,817 --> 00:36:52,517
- Anna.
- Yes?

624
00:36:52,848 --> 00:36:55,618
- Maria...
- What about woo ri?

625
00:36:56,597 --> 00:36:58,067
She's pregnant.

626
00:37:00,685 --> 00:37:03,755
Lee Kang jae, you jerk.

627
00:37:06,424 --> 00:37:07,763
Gosh.

628
00:37:07,764 --> 00:37:09,025
You jerk!

629
00:37:09,094 --> 00:37:11,133
How dare you do this
to my granddaughter?

630
00:37:11,134 --> 00:37:13,493
- Grandma, what are you doing?
- You good for nothing jerk.

631
00:37:13,494 --> 00:37:16,204
- Grandma.
- How dare you touch her?

632
00:37:16,205 --> 00:37:18,473
- What?
- What did I do?

633
00:37:18,474 --> 00:37:21,474
It's all over the church
that woo ri is pregnant.

634
00:37:22,145 --> 00:37:23,844
- What?
- Pregnant?

635
00:37:24,244 --> 00:37:26,743
You promised. How could you?

636
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:30,485
- Grandma. It's not Kang jae.
- What?

637
00:37:30,585 --> 00:37:32,314
What do you mean?

638
00:37:32,315 --> 00:37:36,024
I am pregnant, but it's not Kang jae.

639
00:37:36,025 --> 00:37:37,094
What?

640
00:37:38,324 --> 00:37:40,295
Then, who?

641
00:37:45,335 --> 00:37:46,735
What's all this?

642
00:37:46,965 --> 00:37:50,304
How could this happen to a girl
who has been kind all her life?

643
00:37:51,174 --> 00:37:53,474
Say something.

644
00:37:59,614 --> 00:38:00,884
Anna.

645
00:38:01,614 --> 00:38:03,755
I heard the story,

646
00:38:04,815 --> 00:38:06,783
but it's out of the ordinary.

647
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:08,525
Should we keep the child
since it's new life?

648
00:38:09,284 --> 00:38:12,624
Or have my granddaughter have an
abortion and make her a sinner?

649
00:38:12,625 --> 00:38:14,565
What should I do?

650
00:38:15,224 --> 00:38:17,965
Is this why I've been
to church all my life?

651
00:38:18,034 --> 00:38:20,364
To have my granddaughter
go through such a thing?

652
00:38:20,735 --> 00:38:23,065
What do I do with woo ri?

653
00:38:23,304 --> 00:38:27,244
I feel sorry for my woo ri.

654
00:38:29,505 --> 00:38:30,545
Anna.

655
00:38:50,665 --> 00:38:51,895
Have some tea.

656
00:38:52,965 --> 00:38:54,005
Yes.

657
00:38:54,965 --> 00:38:56,064
But...

658
00:38:56,065 --> 00:38:59,304
I know it's rude coming
to you so suddenly,

659
00:38:59,835 --> 00:39:01,404
but it's such an urgent matter.

660
00:39:02,744 --> 00:39:04,915
Please have my grandchild.

661
00:39:05,844 --> 00:39:07,314
- Excuse me?
- My son is the only child...

662
00:39:07,315 --> 00:39:08,884
But he can no longer make babies.

663
00:39:11,685 --> 00:39:13,384
I can't believe my son has no sperm.

664
00:39:14,324 --> 00:39:15,824
He's the eldest son.

665
00:39:15,924 --> 00:39:17,855
It's up to you...

666
00:39:18,154 --> 00:39:19,494
Whether my family lives on.

667
00:39:20,324 --> 00:39:21,895
This old man is begging you.

668
00:39:22,795 --> 00:39:23,964
Shall I kneel?

669
00:39:23,965 --> 00:39:26,895
No, this is not that kind of matter.

670
00:39:28,264 --> 00:39:31,774
I understand your
unfortunate circumstance.

671
00:39:31,775 --> 00:39:34,074
But as I told you before, I
have my circumstances as well.

672
00:39:37,415 --> 00:39:38,974
No need for a longer conversation.
Get rid of this.

673
00:39:39,545 --> 00:39:42,114
- Yes?
- Get rid of the fruit basket.

674
00:39:42,915 --> 00:39:43,915
Right.

675
00:40:01,764 --> 00:40:03,034
You should take this.

676
00:40:04,705 --> 00:40:06,605
We have enough apples
as well, thank you.

677
00:40:08,705 --> 00:40:10,444
It was difficult in such
situations back in the day.

678
00:40:10,775 --> 00:40:12,645
There weren't any 50-dollar bills.

679
00:40:13,315 --> 00:40:15,315
Stuffing the box with
ten-dollar bills...

680
00:40:15,645 --> 00:40:16,784
Barely came up to 200,000 dollars.

681
00:40:17,315 --> 00:40:18,585
It became more convenient now.

682
00:40:19,215 --> 00:40:21,854
I filled up this box with
one million dollars...

683
00:40:21,855 --> 00:40:23,025
For you to take.

684
00:40:23,485 --> 00:40:25,223
- Excuse me?
- I, Kim duk bae,

685
00:40:25,224 --> 00:40:27,724
do not behave that
indecently in my old age.

686
00:40:28,125 --> 00:40:30,224
I'm not trying to ruin your life.

687
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:32,263
We are in a difficult situation...

688
00:40:32,264 --> 00:40:34,104
And ask for a difficult favour.

689
00:40:34,105 --> 00:40:35,364
If you would just have the child,

690
00:40:36,404 --> 00:40:38,804
we will make the right
compensation for it.

691
00:40:40,105 --> 00:40:42,375
I'm sorry, Ms. woo ri.

692
00:40:42,574 --> 00:40:45,215
I kept on telling you our
side of the story...

693
00:40:45,474 --> 00:40:49,145
And left out what we would do for you.

694
00:40:50,985 --> 00:40:53,485
Stay abroad for about ten months.

695
00:40:53,585 --> 00:40:57,924
Think of it as going
to a language school.

696
00:40:58,094 --> 00:41:00,593
I'll give you a million now and
a million more after the baby.

697
00:41:00,594 --> 00:41:02,125
I'll give you two million in total.

698
00:41:08,835 --> 00:41:10,205
Two million dollars...

699
00:41:11,423 --> 00:41:12,583
If that's not enough,

700
00:41:12,784 --> 00:41:14,253
just tell me how much you want.

701
00:41:14,654 --> 00:41:16,493
I'll give you as much as you want.

702
00:41:16,494 --> 00:41:18,594
Just have our child, that's all.

703
00:41:21,793 --> 00:41:23,332
She can just give the
baby to that family,

704
00:41:23,333 --> 00:41:25,934
get the two million dollars,
and turn her life around!

705
00:41:26,634 --> 00:41:29,573
Two million dollars in ten months.
Then I'm set for life.

706
00:41:29,574 --> 00:41:30,873
I'd be totally up for that.

707
00:41:31,943 --> 00:41:33,203
It's a private loan.

708
00:41:33,204 --> 00:41:34,574
If you don't pay back,

709
00:41:34,914 --> 00:41:37,283
the interest becomes
larger than the principal.

710
00:41:37,284 --> 00:41:39,442
With 50,000 dollars,

711
00:41:39,443 --> 00:41:41,614
I'm confident I can make an
album and become a big hit.

712
00:41:53,293 --> 00:41:54,534
You don't want any apples?

713
00:41:56,463 --> 00:41:57,804
At least take the fruit basket.

714
00:42:05,904 --> 00:42:07,273
Father, what do we do?

715
00:42:07,643 --> 00:42:09,244
If she turns down money...

716
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:10,614
That's how they are at first.

717
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:13,914
They have their pride in not
accepting money right away.

718
00:42:18,583 --> 00:42:20,123
Money solves everything.

719
00:42:29,233 --> 00:42:30,364
Goodness.

720
00:42:31,204 --> 00:42:33,063
What should we do, woo ri?

721
00:42:33,233 --> 00:42:34,403
What else is there to talk about?

722
00:42:34,404 --> 00:42:35,804
She'll get an abortion
tomorrow at the hospital.

723
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:38,602
She'll be committing a sin then.

724
00:42:38,603 --> 00:42:40,543
What are you talking about?
That's not a sin.

725
00:42:41,114 --> 00:42:42,373
Don't talk like that in front of her.

726
00:42:43,074 --> 00:42:45,184
How could something like this
happen to my granddaughter?

727
00:42:45,784 --> 00:42:47,613
Oh, no. What do we do?

728
00:42:47,614 --> 00:42:50,184
Abortion is considered a sin
in the eyes of the lord.

729
00:42:51,224 --> 00:42:52,483
Enough.

730
00:42:52,724 --> 00:42:54,023
Then you expect her to
carry out the pregnancy?

731
00:42:54,123 --> 00:42:56,154
Will the lord give her an award?
Will the government give her money?

732
00:42:57,193 --> 00:42:58,864
It's not a sin. She has
the right to do so.

733
00:42:59,923 --> 00:43:01,333
Woo ri's life can't be ruined.

734
00:43:01,434 --> 00:43:02,563
Mom. What about you?

735
00:43:03,634 --> 00:43:05,134
Did I ruin your life?

736
00:43:06,864 --> 00:43:07,872
What?

737
00:43:07,873 --> 00:43:09,333
I won't have the baby, so don't worry.

738
00:43:10,304 --> 00:43:12,003
Why would I complicate
my life with a burden?

739
00:43:13,574 --> 00:43:16,244
I will never do something I'll
regret for the rest of my life.

740
00:43:19,344 --> 00:43:20,614
Right.

741
00:43:21,054 --> 00:43:22,684
You should get an abortion, right?

742
00:43:23,414 --> 00:43:26,423
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that.

743
00:43:27,594 --> 00:43:30,224
I'm all right, grandma. Don't worry.

744
00:43:32,523 --> 00:43:33,693
Okay.

745
00:44:17,304 --> 00:44:18,543
Should I turn on the radio?

746
00:44:19,543 --> 00:44:22,414
- Love isn't a joke - goodness.

747
00:44:27,213 --> 00:44:28,414
I'm sorry.

748
00:44:36,293 --> 00:44:38,623
Thank you for coming all the way here.

749
00:44:38,793 --> 00:44:41,034
Please come this way.

750
00:44:45,404 --> 00:44:46,563
This way.

751
00:44:47,264 --> 00:44:48,503
Ma'am, here.

752
00:44:48,634 --> 00:44:50,773
Ma'am. Woo ri.

753
00:44:55,914 --> 00:44:57,543
What are you doing here?

754
00:44:58,614 --> 00:44:59,884
Who are they?

755
00:45:00,384 --> 00:45:01,613
I would like to...

756
00:45:01,614 --> 00:45:03,483
Discuss something with you.

757
00:45:05,853 --> 00:45:08,853
So you want my daughter
to have the baby. Right?

758
00:45:09,154 --> 00:45:10,962
Yes. But...

759
00:45:10,963 --> 00:45:12,693
Get up. We don't need to hear it.

760
00:45:12,994 --> 00:45:14,462
Gosh. Please.

761
00:45:14,463 --> 00:45:16,733
I'm sorry. Please sit down.

762
00:45:17,193 --> 00:45:18,634
I'm sorry, ma'am.

763
00:45:21,134 --> 00:45:22,233
You know,

764
00:45:22,404 --> 00:45:26,344
I worked day and night and
became successful all on my own.

765
00:45:27,173 --> 00:45:28,713
I don't want much at this age.

766
00:45:29,614 --> 00:45:32,384
I only have one son. But my son...

767
00:45:35,054 --> 00:45:36,684
I can't believe he has no sperm.

768
00:45:38,054 --> 00:45:39,684
He's the eldest son.

769
00:45:39,954 --> 00:45:41,523
That's your problem.

770
00:45:41,623 --> 00:45:43,553
That's none of our business.

771
00:45:43,554 --> 00:45:45,293
How could you be so harsh?

772
00:45:45,594 --> 00:45:47,864
What if there's no one left to
hold a memorial service for you?

773
00:45:48,364 --> 00:45:49,563
Would you be happy with that?

774
00:45:49,963 --> 00:45:51,264
We are catholic.

775
00:45:53,563 --> 00:45:55,034
Then should I let my lineage stop here?

776
00:45:55,804 --> 00:45:57,073
Do you want my granddaughter...

777
00:45:57,074 --> 00:45:58,744
To ruin her life just for your lineage?

778
00:45:59,003 --> 00:46:00,573
Well, you see,

779
00:46:00,574 --> 00:46:02,773
we don't plan to make
a ridiculous demand.

780
00:46:03,074 --> 00:46:05,542
We offered reasonable
compensation to your daughter.

781
00:46:05,543 --> 00:46:06,683
Reasonable compensation?

782
00:46:06,684 --> 00:46:09,053
How can you reasonably compensate
her for ruining her life?

783
00:46:09,054 --> 00:46:11,554
You can stay abroad for
as long as you want.

784
00:46:11,753 --> 00:46:13,622
We will make sure it
stays confidential.

785
00:46:13,623 --> 00:46:15,692
And we will also compensate
her financially too.

786
00:46:15,693 --> 00:46:17,493
You're asking my daughter
to be a surrogate mother.

787
00:46:17,494 --> 00:46:18,763
You want her to sell
the baby for money.

788
00:46:18,764 --> 00:46:19,993
They are unbelievable.

789
00:46:19,994 --> 00:46:21,293
Two million dollars.

790
00:46:21,833 --> 00:46:23,333
We offered two million dollars.

791
00:46:24,164 --> 00:46:25,833
We can give you more if you request it.

792
00:46:26,729 --> 00:46:29,157
That money will not ruin your life.

793
00:46:29,158 --> 00:46:31,269
It can give you a new chance at life.

794
00:46:32,468 --> 00:46:33,999
It's the kind of money...

795
00:46:34,738 --> 00:46:36,568
Even your mother and grandmother
won't ever get to make.

796
00:46:37,908 --> 00:46:39,809
It's two million dollars.

797
00:46:52,448 --> 00:46:54,657
I told you I needed 50,000
dollars to make my album.

798
00:46:54,658 --> 00:46:57,628
They won't let a single
mom become a singer.

799
00:46:57,629 --> 00:46:58,959
I had to give that up to raise you.

800
00:47:00,689 --> 00:47:02,698
It would've been better if
I were ten years younger.

801
00:47:02,959 --> 00:47:05,129
If I didn't have woo ri back then...

802
00:47:09,669 --> 00:47:10,868
Two million dollars?

803
00:47:12,309 --> 00:47:13,568
You want her to carry
out the pregnancy?

804
00:47:15,138 --> 00:47:16,278
Two million dollars?

805
00:47:18,778 --> 00:47:20,749
The answer is no even if you
offer 20 million dollars.

806
00:47:21,079 --> 00:47:22,218
Why?

807
00:47:22,379 --> 00:47:23,778
Woo ri is my daughter.

808
00:47:25,189 --> 00:47:26,888
You think money can solve
everything, right?

809
00:47:27,919 --> 00:47:29,419
There are things you
can't do with money.

810
00:47:29,959 --> 00:47:31,229
Not my daughter.

811
00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:32,689
You can't ruin her life...

812
00:47:33,988 --> 00:47:35,258
Even if it can save my life.

813
00:47:40,428 --> 00:47:42,068
Ma'am. Why are you so unreasonable?

814
00:47:42,698 --> 00:47:44,039
Will she die from it?

815
00:47:44,309 --> 00:47:46,709
We're simply asking
her to have the baby.

816
00:47:47,068 --> 00:47:49,177
Should we kill the baby in her womb?

817
00:47:49,178 --> 00:47:50,278
Will you commit murder?

818
00:47:50,508 --> 00:47:51,948
Hey! Watch your mouth!

819
00:47:52,778 --> 00:47:54,479
If you bring up money again,

820
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:56,578
I'll arrest you all for violating
clause 3 of article 23...

821
00:47:56,579 --> 00:47:59,088
Of the enforcement rule of
bioethics and safety act.

822
00:47:59,089 --> 00:48:00,918
Who are you? A lawyer?

823
00:48:00,919 --> 00:48:01,988
When did you get here?

824
00:48:05,789 --> 00:48:07,129
What are you doing?

825
00:48:07,598 --> 00:48:09,499
Why are you meeting with them?

826
00:48:11,098 --> 00:48:12,868
I told you this was illegal.

827
00:48:15,638 --> 00:48:16,798
I'm sorry.

828
00:48:17,468 --> 00:48:21,309
I would like to apologize
to you and your family.

829
00:48:22,008 --> 00:48:24,408
Please forget everything...

830
00:48:24,979 --> 00:48:26,278
They told you.

831
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:32,048
Well, sir.

832
00:48:33,789 --> 00:48:34,888
Yes?

833
00:48:38,589 --> 00:48:39,729
Woo ri.

834
00:48:41,559 --> 00:48:42,859
This way. Let's go.

835
00:49:18,957 --> 00:49:20,497
Goodness.

836
00:49:23,059 --> 00:49:24,230
Did it go well?

837
00:49:24,329 --> 00:49:25,829
You said it was a simple procedure.

838
00:49:26,659 --> 00:49:27,699
What?

839
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:30,130
- Ma'am.
- Mother.

840
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:32,630
- Are you all right?
- Are you okay?

841
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:37,170
- Be careful.
- I can't believe this.

842
00:49:55,234 --> 00:49:59,374
My mother had me as a teenager
when she was still in school.

843
00:50:01,205 --> 00:50:03,075
Even I don't know what
to do at the age of 29.

844
00:50:03,675 --> 00:50:05,945
She must have had a lot on her mind.

845
00:50:07,414 --> 00:50:08,945
How scared she must have been.

846
00:50:10,984 --> 00:50:15,385
But she must have had a reason
when she decided to have me.

847
00:50:16,524 --> 00:50:18,995
There must be a reason
why I'm in this world...

848
00:50:20,195 --> 00:50:23,725
And why something like
this happened to me too.

849
00:50:25,195 --> 00:50:26,595
There must be a reason for that.

850
00:50:37,245 --> 00:50:38,644
She's still not answering her phone.

851
00:50:40,175 --> 00:50:41,914
Where did she go?

852
00:50:44,115 --> 00:50:46,084
Woo ri. Where have you been?

853
00:50:46,555 --> 00:50:47,825
Why didn't you go through
with the surgery?

854
00:50:48,124 --> 00:50:49,424
Woo ri.

855
00:50:49,425 --> 00:50:51,495
You're not considering
their offer, right?

856
00:50:51,725 --> 00:50:54,564
Don't give a thought to
what those jerks said.

857
00:50:56,064 --> 00:50:57,325
Mom.

858
00:50:57,595 --> 00:50:59,535
Grandma. Kang jae.

859
00:51:00,495 --> 00:51:01,635
I'm going to...

860
00:51:02,564 --> 00:51:03,834
Have this baby.

861
00:51:08,504 --> 00:51:10,274
What do you mean? Why would you?

862
00:51:10,675 --> 00:51:12,374
You were a victim of
a medical accident.

863
00:51:12,714 --> 00:51:14,745
This is the same as getting
infected at the hospital.

864
00:51:15,345 --> 00:51:16,544
Then what about me?

865
00:51:17,214 --> 00:51:18,354
Was I an accident too?

866
00:51:18,885 --> 00:51:20,055
Was I an infection?

867
00:51:21,325 --> 00:51:22,483
What?

868
00:51:22,484 --> 00:51:24,024
Why did you have me?

869
00:51:25,195 --> 00:51:26,595
Do you regret having me?

870
00:51:27,155 --> 00:51:29,424
What are you talking about? Why
would I regret having you?

871
00:51:29,425 --> 00:51:30,495
Mom.

872
00:51:31,035 --> 00:51:32,564
When I was in middle school,

873
00:51:33,434 --> 00:51:34,764
I heard you say...

874
00:51:34,765 --> 00:51:36,365
You shouldn't have given birth to me.

875
00:51:36,964 --> 00:51:38,675
You couldn't be a singer because of me.

876
00:51:40,205 --> 00:51:43,445
What you said had scarred
me my entire life.

877
00:51:45,044 --> 00:51:46,345
It didn't go away.

878
00:51:47,644 --> 00:51:49,345
I was a burden to you.

879
00:51:51,515 --> 00:51:53,714
I didn't want people
to look down on me.

880
00:51:54,285 --> 00:51:56,484
I didn't want to make
even a single mistake.

881
00:51:57,425 --> 00:51:59,325
That's why I pledged to abstain.

882
00:52:00,794 --> 00:52:01,964
Woo ri.

883
00:52:03,164 --> 00:52:04,434
I thought...

884
00:52:05,834 --> 00:52:07,563
You went through with the pledge...

885
00:52:07,564 --> 00:52:09,405
Because you were embarrassed
that I had you at 16.

886
00:52:10,464 --> 00:52:12,975
I never thought I couldn't
be a singer because of you.

887
00:52:13,934 --> 00:52:15,974
I wanted to be a successful singer...

888
00:52:15,975 --> 00:52:18,774
Because I wanted to be a
mom you could be proud of.

889
00:52:20,274 --> 00:52:22,814
I don't care what my job is.
I have you.

890
00:52:24,115 --> 00:52:25,754
There were so many moments...

891
00:52:26,584 --> 00:52:29,024
You made me happy ever
since you were born.

892
00:52:31,595 --> 00:52:35,225
It's quite the opposite. I
always felt bad for you.

893
00:52:36,265 --> 00:52:38,234
The thing you tell me the most is...

894
00:52:39,234 --> 00:52:43,205
"Mom, why do you live like that?"

895
00:52:44,874 --> 00:52:46,405
I'm not good at anything.

896
00:52:47,035 --> 00:52:48,404
I always cause trouble.

897
00:52:48,405 --> 00:52:50,305
I'm far from being a perfect mother.

898
00:52:51,774 --> 00:52:53,745
You're embarrassed of me.

899
00:52:56,914 --> 00:52:58,515
No, mom.

900
00:52:59,714 --> 00:53:01,785
Why would I be embarrassed of you?

901
00:53:07,865 --> 00:53:09,664
I'm so proud...

902
00:53:10,294 --> 00:53:13,294
That you are working so
hard to achieve your dream.

903
00:53:15,504 --> 00:53:17,205
You're my mom.

904
00:53:17,975 --> 00:53:20,234
You brought me into this world.

905
00:53:22,274 --> 00:53:25,914
I wouldn't trade you for
anything in the world.

906
00:53:35,925 --> 00:53:39,425
You just healed the scar in my heart.

907
00:53:40,794 --> 00:53:42,964
You don't have to tell me
why you decided to keep me.

908
00:53:43,894 --> 00:53:45,765
I know why.

909
00:53:47,365 --> 00:53:49,205
I'm the reason why.

910
00:53:51,305 --> 00:53:52,434
Woo ri.

911
00:54:01,245 --> 00:54:02,345
Mom.

912
00:54:04,484 --> 00:54:06,615
You gave me a chance.

913
00:54:07,655 --> 00:54:10,084
So I'm loved by so many
people in my life.

914
00:54:13,024 --> 00:54:16,964
Now, I want to give a
chance to this baby.

915
00:54:23,035 --> 00:54:24,365
Why you?

916
00:54:25,905 --> 00:54:27,675
Why did this happen to you?

917
00:54:44,894 --> 00:54:46,655
Do you think having a baby is easy?

918
00:54:46,925 --> 00:54:48,124
You think it will just come to you?

919
00:54:48,495 --> 00:54:50,163
It's a huge responsibility.

920
00:54:50,164 --> 00:54:52,635
I know that too. I'm ready for it.

921
00:54:53,564 --> 00:54:55,163
When your mother told me...

922
00:54:55,164 --> 00:54:58,535
She was pregnant 30 years ago,
I didn't think about anything.

923
00:54:59,104 --> 00:55:02,404
A 16-year-old girl was pregnant.
I told her to get rid of it.

924
00:55:02,405 --> 00:55:05,414
I dragged her to the hospital
to get an abortion right away.

925
00:55:06,115 --> 00:55:09,584
But your mother ran away.

926
00:55:10,914 --> 00:55:12,955
She's a good runner.

927
00:55:13,155 --> 00:55:15,184
If she wasn't a good runner,

928
00:55:18,624 --> 00:55:21,595
it would have been a huge problem.

929
00:55:22,524 --> 00:55:26,434
I don't know why I was
so against it back then.

930
00:55:26,995 --> 00:55:30,564
I prayed and repented all my life.

931
00:55:33,934 --> 00:55:37,374
But you and your mother
are in different shoes.

932
00:55:37,575 --> 00:55:39,444
You didn't do anything.

933
00:55:39,445 --> 00:55:41,844
You didn't do anything that
requires you to be responsible.

934
00:55:41,845 --> 00:55:43,044
I know that.

935
00:55:43,345 --> 00:55:47,683
But still. I have a chance to
bring a baby into this world.

936
00:55:47,684 --> 00:55:49,854
You have a very beautiful,
generous heart.

937
00:55:50,555 --> 00:55:53,655
But still. Why must you do it?

938
00:55:54,425 --> 00:55:57,764
Grandma. If Mary's
grandma was against it,

939
00:55:57,765 --> 00:55:59,393
Jesus wouldn't have been born.

940
00:55:59,394 --> 00:56:02,404
You're not virgin Mary. Will
you give birth to Jesus?

941
00:56:02,405 --> 00:56:04,064
That's my religious name too.

942
00:56:04,774 --> 00:56:06,434
You gave that name to me.

943
00:56:07,374 --> 00:56:09,504
Goodness. Oh, no.

944
00:56:10,004 --> 00:56:11,274
Oh, no.

945
00:56:19,354 --> 00:56:20,684
- Gosh.
- We'll be okay.

946
00:56:36,164 --> 00:56:37,464
Must you have this baby?

947
00:56:43,245 --> 00:56:44,615
I'm sorry.

948
00:56:49,885 --> 00:56:53,854
I know that my decision right
now is very unrealistic.

949
00:56:55,684 --> 00:56:58,354
Just ask anyone on the street.

950
00:56:59,394 --> 00:57:00,894
They will say I'm crazy.

951
00:57:02,865 --> 00:57:03,925
Right.

952
00:57:05,265 --> 00:57:07,195
To be honest, it's not
easy for me either.

953
00:57:08,964 --> 00:57:11,305
Even my family can't understand me.

954
00:57:12,504 --> 00:57:15,044
I won't ask you to
understand my decision.

955
00:57:23,644 --> 00:57:26,455
I'm sorry for making
a selfish decision.

956
00:57:30,684 --> 00:57:32,793
But I don't have the
right to stop you...

957
00:57:32,794 --> 00:57:34,595
From making that decision.

958
00:57:36,095 --> 00:57:37,265
I'll just...

959
00:57:38,664 --> 00:57:41,705
I'll just help you
make a wise decision.

960
00:57:46,334 --> 00:57:47,405
Kang jae.

961
00:57:58,414 --> 00:57:59,515
Woo ri.

962
00:58:00,655 --> 00:58:01,785
It's okay.

963
00:58:03,084 --> 00:58:04,425
I'm sorry.

964
00:58:06,695 --> 00:58:07,695
Yes!

965
00:58:19,305 --> 00:58:21,305
- Hello?
- Ms. oh?

966
00:58:21,874 --> 00:58:23,144
This is Raphael.

967
00:58:23,675 --> 00:58:25,274
Hello.

968
00:58:27,245 --> 00:58:28,643
What's this about?

969
00:58:28,644 --> 00:58:30,745
The hospital said you
didn't get the procedure.

970
00:58:30,885 --> 00:58:32,254
I was wondering what happened.

971
00:58:32,655 --> 00:58:34,515
If there's a problem, I'll help too.

972
00:58:34,854 --> 00:58:36,425
There's no problem.

973
00:58:37,024 --> 00:58:40,595
Actually, there was something
I need to tell you in person.

974
00:58:42,195 --> 00:58:44,893
Are you free tomorrow morning?

975
00:58:44,894 --> 00:58:46,464
I'll go to your hospital.

976
00:58:46,765 --> 00:58:50,734
Sure. But what's this about?

977
00:58:51,604 --> 00:58:53,934
I'll tell you in person.

978
00:59:06,714 --> 00:59:07,913
You're certain, right?

979
00:59:07,914 --> 00:59:09,725
Yes!

980
00:59:09,925 --> 00:59:11,523
She said she would have the baby.

981
00:59:11,524 --> 00:59:13,094
I had a feeling she would...

982
00:59:13,095 --> 00:59:14,924
When she left without
getting the procedure.

983
00:59:14,925 --> 00:59:17,425
There's always a way out!

984
00:59:17,624 --> 00:59:19,894
You were right about everything.

985
00:59:19,964 --> 00:59:22,104
- We must be positive.
- We must be positive.

986
00:59:33,475 --> 00:59:34,845
It was perfect until now.

987
00:59:35,814 --> 00:59:37,544
I forgot about this problem.

988
00:59:39,015 --> 00:59:41,384
Mom. What do I do?

989
00:59:41,385 --> 00:59:45,024
We can't mess up our grand
plan because of a bug.

990
00:59:46,055 --> 00:59:47,655
Gosh. There's a bug!

991
01:00:06,214 --> 01:00:07,475
Hey, you're here.

992
01:00:08,115 --> 01:00:11,414
If that couple is the parent, the
baby will be happy for sure.

993
01:00:12,055 --> 01:00:15,483
But we should discuss this
thoroughly with the couple.

994
01:00:15,484 --> 01:00:17,424
It won't be as easy as you might think.

995
01:00:17,425 --> 01:00:19,155
We'll have to draw up
legal documents too.

996
01:00:19,655 --> 01:00:21,225
So...

997
01:00:21,725 --> 01:00:24,425
We should talk to them first.

998
01:00:25,135 --> 01:00:27,394
If you don't agree with them,
you can change your mind.

999
01:00:28,964 --> 01:00:30,765
- Kang jae.
- Yes?

1000
01:00:31,575 --> 01:00:34,035
I'm so relieved to have you by my side.

1001
01:00:45,515 --> 01:00:46,854
Hello.

1002
01:00:47,414 --> 01:00:50,024
Thank you for coming to our hospital.

1003
01:00:56,325 --> 01:00:57,425
No man chul.

1004
01:01:03,805 --> 01:01:04,905
No man chul!

1005
01:01:06,104 --> 01:01:07,135
No man chul!

1006
01:01:56,425 --> 01:02:00,455
Gosh. It turned out Raphael
used to be quite the party boy.

1007
01:02:00,524 --> 01:02:03,725
I want this baby to grow
up in the perfect family.

1008
01:02:03,894 --> 01:02:05,635
Of course. I agree.

1009
01:02:05,695 --> 01:02:08,063
The wife desperately
wants to have a baby.

1010
01:02:08,064 --> 01:02:09,864
And I thought she would
be a great mother.

1011
01:02:09,865 --> 01:02:12,273
You know, the CEO is a total player.

1012
01:02:12,274 --> 01:02:14,374
What do I do? Would I be able
to raise this baby well?

1013
01:02:14,504 --> 01:02:16,773
You want us to raise the baby.

1014
01:02:16,774 --> 01:02:18,873
You and I are on the same boat now.

1015
01:02:18,874 --> 01:02:21,683
Raphael? Can you look
into him, Kang jae?

1016
01:02:21,684 --> 01:02:23,845
I saw something fishy with my own eyes.

1017
01:02:24,044 --> 01:02:25,414
We've met before. Right?
