1
00:00:49,934 --> 00:00:51,904
Pregnancy and motherhood...

2
00:00:51,903 --> 00:00:55,403
Play a big part in a woman's life.

3
00:00:55,604 --> 00:00:58,944
Definitely. Giving birth
is a massive undertaking.

4
00:00:58,943 --> 00:01:01,243
Some women struggle to return
to work after giving birth,

5
00:01:01,244 --> 00:01:03,084
and some people end up
quitting their jobs.

6
00:01:03,083 --> 00:01:04,243
It's a social issue.

7
00:01:04,244 --> 00:01:06,214
Right. They talk about
it often on the news.

8
00:01:06,214 --> 00:01:09,054
There's a novel about it.
What was the title?

9
00:01:09,783 --> 00:01:12,093
I don't want to lose
control of my life.

10
00:01:14,724 --> 00:01:17,464
Woo ri, does this mean
you've changed your mind?

11
00:01:17,964 --> 00:01:21,404
I want to prove to myself that
life can still be the same...

12
00:01:21,403 --> 00:01:23,503
Even after going through
pregnancy and giving birth.

13
00:01:25,903 --> 00:01:29,073
Even married couples are hesitant
to have kids these days, you know.

14
00:01:29,503 --> 00:01:33,143
Having a baby is much harder
than you think. A baby is...

15
00:01:33,143 --> 00:01:35,983
No. I'm not going to
call it a baby anymore.

16
00:01:39,153 --> 00:01:40,983
Yes. Let's call it "mallet".

17
00:01:40,983 --> 00:01:43,083
"Mallet"? Will that be
the baby bump nickname?

18
00:01:43,084 --> 00:01:46,024
No, let's just call it like that.
There's no reason behind it.

19
00:01:46,024 --> 00:01:48,564
I'll call it "mallet" because I
don't want to call it a baby.

20
00:01:50,694 --> 00:01:52,094
I've made up my mind.

21
00:01:53,093 --> 00:01:55,763
I'm heading out to meet that couple.

22
00:02:06,414 --> 00:02:07,474
No man chul.

23
00:02:09,944 --> 00:02:11,014
No man chul!

24
00:02:19,954 --> 00:02:21,264
What are you two doing right now?

25
00:02:39,514 --> 00:02:41,614
Woo ri, that must've given
you quite the scare.

26
00:02:41,614 --> 00:02:44,144
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine.

27
00:02:44,913 --> 00:02:46,913
You still need to interview me, right?

28
00:02:46,913 --> 00:02:49,823
Well, would you like to
go see a doctor first?

29
00:02:49,954 --> 00:02:51,824
The witness interview can
wait until tomorrow.

30
00:02:51,994 --> 00:02:54,664
Kang jae, I'll go see my doctor.

31
00:02:54,663 --> 00:02:55,793
Okay, woo ri.

32
00:02:56,123 --> 00:02:57,663
I can't leave while
they inspect the scene.

33
00:02:57,663 --> 00:02:59,993
Right. I'll just go alone.

34
00:03:00,964 --> 00:03:02,504
I'll take her to the doctor.

35
00:03:02,503 --> 00:03:04,703
No, it's okay. I can go by myself.

36
00:03:04,704 --> 00:03:07,004
I'll come with you. We
can leave now, right?

37
00:03:07,003 --> 00:03:10,273
Sure. Then please come to the
precinct with your wife tomorrow.

38
00:03:11,244 --> 00:03:12,814
Sure, I'll help in every way I can.

39
00:03:13,313 --> 00:03:14,943
Help them tidy up.

40
00:03:14,943 --> 00:03:16,783
And try to calm the patients down.

41
00:03:16,984 --> 00:03:18,054
Okay.

42
00:03:23,153 --> 00:03:25,153
Ms. Lee. Your meeting is over, right?

43
00:03:25,323 --> 00:03:26,593
- Yes.
- This way, please.

44
00:03:28,294 --> 00:03:30,394
Kang jae, you were the
one who found him.

45
00:03:30,623 --> 00:03:32,063
Did you notice anything?

46
00:03:32,364 --> 00:03:34,364
The aorta was cut with a scalpel.

47
00:03:34,364 --> 00:03:36,004
He bled out and died within 30 seconds.

48
00:03:36,334 --> 00:03:37,974
It's exactly the same
as chairman Kim's mo.

49
00:03:37,973 --> 00:03:40,273
Chairman Kim isn't the only one who
stabs his targets in the neck.

50
00:03:40,403 --> 00:03:42,203
Besides, there are scalpels
everywhere in the hospital.

51
00:03:42,373 --> 00:03:44,103
Investigate objectively without bias.

52
00:03:44,103 --> 00:03:46,473
Consider all possibilities
and comb through everything.

53
00:03:47,744 --> 00:03:51,114
The hard drive for
security cameras is gone.

54
00:03:51,153 --> 00:03:52,153
What?

55
00:03:52,154 --> 00:03:54,884
The forensics team hasn't
found anything yet.

56
00:03:54,883 --> 00:03:56,023
This won't be an easy case.

57
00:03:56,024 --> 00:03:59,254
Goodness. It must be someone who
knows the hospital inside out.

58
00:03:59,693 --> 00:04:03,423
First, let's find out who had
hostile relationships with him.

59
00:04:03,924 --> 00:04:07,194
Hey, detective Kang. Tell
forensics to wrap it up.

60
00:04:07,193 --> 00:04:10,403
Do you remember seeing anyone
suspicious at the scene today?

61
00:04:14,704 --> 00:04:18,444
Hello, thank you for visiting...

62
00:04:18,813 --> 00:04:20,643
You must've been so scared.

63
00:04:21,484 --> 00:04:23,784
Gosh, my heart is still pounding.

64
00:04:26,713 --> 00:04:29,453
Yes, it was scary.

65
00:04:30,054 --> 00:04:32,794
But the thing is, I came here
to talk to you about something.

66
00:04:33,023 --> 00:04:36,923
Right. What happened yesterday?
Is everything okay?

67
00:04:38,193 --> 00:04:42,163
I never thought I'd say this,

68
00:04:43,404 --> 00:04:46,434
but I decided to keep mallet.

69
00:04:46,503 --> 00:04:49,843
Sorry? Keep what?

70
00:04:51,373 --> 00:04:54,413
Oh, sorry. The baby. I'm
going to keep the baby.

71
00:04:54,414 --> 00:04:56,814
What? Why?

72
00:04:56,813 --> 00:04:58,753
Sorry? What do you mean, why?

73
00:04:59,354 --> 00:05:02,084
Oh, don't get me wrong.

74
00:05:02,623 --> 00:05:04,353
It's such a big decision for you.

75
00:05:04,654 --> 00:05:06,194
Why did you suddenly
make that decision?

76
00:05:08,463 --> 00:05:11,493
There's no special reason.

77
00:05:12,594 --> 00:05:16,104
I'm just so grateful that I
was brought into this world.

78
00:05:17,404 --> 00:05:18,474
What?

79
00:05:19,734 --> 00:05:23,844
Oh, I'm catholic. Every
life is precious, you know.

80
00:05:24,643 --> 00:05:27,143
Right, I see.

81
00:05:30,443 --> 00:05:32,853
Do you not want the baby?

82
00:05:33,054 --> 00:05:34,384
I heard you couldn't make another...

83
00:05:34,383 --> 00:05:36,983
I do. I really want the baby.

84
00:05:37,424 --> 00:05:41,294
I just didn't think that you'd
decide to keep the baby.

85
00:05:41,994 --> 00:05:44,524
But you're working at the moment.
If you suddenly get pregnant...

86
00:05:45,494 --> 00:05:47,904
The drama will end in three
months' time anyway,

87
00:05:47,904 --> 00:05:50,104
so I'm just going to stay home
and take it easy after that.

88
00:05:51,164 --> 00:05:53,574
I wanted to write a drama on my own,

89
00:05:53,804 --> 00:05:55,074
so this works out.

90
00:05:55,643 --> 00:05:57,443
I'll give it a shot this time.

91
00:05:57,744 --> 00:05:59,114
Oh, I see.

92
00:05:59,713 --> 00:06:02,683
I'll bill you for my medical
and other expenses.

93
00:06:03,044 --> 00:06:04,654
That will be enough.

94
00:06:05,213 --> 00:06:07,553
I don't need the money I
was offered the other day.

95
00:06:07,924 --> 00:06:09,284
Don't worry about it.

96
00:06:09,284 --> 00:06:10,324
What?

97
00:06:10,753 --> 00:06:12,823
Money? Did she offer you money?

98
00:06:14,023 --> 00:06:15,063
Yes.

99
00:06:15,924 --> 00:06:17,094
Goodness.

100
00:06:19,094 --> 00:06:21,334
She can be really crude at times.

101
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:24,533
I apologize on her behalf.

102
00:06:24,534 --> 00:06:25,734
It's okay.

103
00:06:26,203 --> 00:06:27,503
I understand how desperate
she must've felt.

104
00:06:28,474 --> 00:06:31,204
If you need anything, just call me.

105
00:06:31,744 --> 00:06:34,044
This must've been a very
difficult decision for you.

106
00:06:34,044 --> 00:06:36,384
I don't know how to thank you.

107
00:06:37,213 --> 00:06:39,153
You don't need to thank me.

108
00:06:40,013 --> 00:06:42,023
I made this decision for my own sake.

109
00:06:48,724 --> 00:06:50,564
The test results look good.

110
00:06:50,563 --> 00:06:52,133
You've been sleeping well, right?

111
00:06:52,133 --> 00:06:54,263
- Yes.
- Do you get morning sickness?

112
00:06:54,434 --> 00:06:56,134
No, not yet.

113
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:00,173
I'm glad...

114
00:07:00,174 --> 00:07:03,174
That both you and the baby are healthy.

115
00:07:03,244 --> 00:07:05,044
Yes, me too.

116
00:07:06,813 --> 00:07:09,143
I feel so frazzled today.

117
00:07:10,713 --> 00:07:14,783
Actually, there was something...

118
00:07:14,784 --> 00:07:16,584
I wanted to ask you and
your wife in person.

119
00:07:16,924 --> 00:07:18,154
What is it?

120
00:07:19,753 --> 00:07:22,123
I grew up without a father.

121
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:25,933
Of course, I'm so grateful
to my mom and grandmother,

122
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:31,733
but I want this baby to grow
up in the perfect family.

123
00:07:31,974 --> 00:07:33,434
Having everything it needs...

124
00:07:33,434 --> 00:07:35,144
And receiving lots of
love from mom and dad.

125
00:07:35,273 --> 00:07:37,073
I want the baby to be
happier than anybody else.

126
00:07:37,773 --> 00:07:41,383
I made this decision because I trust
that you and your wife can do that.

127
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:45,313
Right? You will do that, right?

128
00:07:45,414 --> 00:07:47,114
Well, that's...

129
00:07:47,984 --> 00:07:49,784
I told you that I wanted a divorce.

130
00:07:49,823 --> 00:07:52,793
Well, I don't want a divorce.

131
00:07:57,724 --> 00:08:01,434
When you told me you'd decided
to do this, it didn't feel real.

132
00:08:01,804 --> 00:08:05,504
It's only hitting me now.

133
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:08,703
I feel the weight of
responsibility on my shoulders.

134
00:08:08,904 --> 00:08:11,674
The perfect family for the baby.

135
00:08:11,914 --> 00:08:14,744
Yes, of course. Sure thing!

136
00:08:17,313 --> 00:08:18,853
Wow, yes!

137
00:08:19,614 --> 00:08:22,624
So about the baby, she
decided to keep it.

138
00:08:24,554 --> 00:08:27,394
Good. That's great.

139
00:08:27,794 --> 00:08:29,724
I told you. Money solves all problems.

140
00:08:29,994 --> 00:08:33,364
But the two million dollars... she
won't ask for all of it, right?

141
00:08:33,364 --> 00:08:35,864
- Let's knock off a little.
- We should, right?

142
00:08:35,864 --> 00:08:38,074
How much will you knock off
for your own happiness?

143
00:08:38,174 --> 00:08:41,234
Hey, did you talk to her?
The more, the better.

144
00:08:42,874 --> 00:08:45,174
I scrapped the whole thing...

145
00:08:45,473 --> 00:08:47,573
And made it zero. Happy now?

146
00:08:47,573 --> 00:08:49,943
You... well done!

147
00:08:51,213 --> 00:08:52,683
Be embarrassed of yourself.

148
00:08:52,853 --> 00:08:54,823
You see, money doesn't
solve everything.

149
00:08:55,184 --> 00:08:57,024
She's offended that she
was offered money.

150
00:08:57,024 --> 00:08:59,294
She made the decision because she
believes every life is precious.

151
00:08:59,453 --> 00:09:00,993
I bet you can't wrap
your head around it.

152
00:09:00,993 --> 00:09:03,093
She doesn't want the money?

153
00:09:03,424 --> 00:09:05,694
Forget it, then. Why
would you criticize me?

154
00:09:05,693 --> 00:09:08,263
- Goodness.
- Hey, stop.

155
00:09:12,174 --> 00:09:14,074
Once word about the
stabbing death spreads,

156
00:09:14,073 --> 00:09:15,543
the hospital will go out of business.

157
00:09:16,603 --> 00:09:17,943
Keep the media out!

158
00:09:17,943 --> 00:09:19,743
This morning, a murder took place...

159
00:09:19,743 --> 00:09:21,643
At a large medical
foundation in gangnam...

160
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:23,444
That is famous for plastic
surgery procedures.

161
00:09:23,443 --> 00:09:25,883
The victim, no, is a man in his 20s.

162
00:09:25,884 --> 00:09:28,424
He was found stabbed to death
in an elevator at the hospital.

163
00:09:28,424 --> 00:09:30,784
So, no man chul is dead.

164
00:09:30,784 --> 00:09:32,724
It is said that he
worked at the hospital.

165
00:09:32,723 --> 00:09:34,093
He died at the scene...

166
00:09:34,093 --> 00:09:36,363
- Immediately after being stabbed.
- Mom.

167
00:09:36,363 --> 00:09:37,793
Did you kill him?

168
00:09:37,794 --> 00:09:39,494
What am I, professor x?

169
00:09:39,493 --> 00:09:41,833
How could I kill someone
sitting in my wheelchair?

170
00:09:42,404 --> 00:09:44,164
Did you hire someone to do it?

171
00:09:44,904 --> 00:09:48,034
The police will investigate all
employees of the foundation...

172
00:09:48,034 --> 00:09:50,044
As well as those
connected to the victim.

173
00:09:51,203 --> 00:09:54,113
You know, those who devote
their lives to their children.

174
00:09:54,843 --> 00:09:56,313
I always thought they were so pathetic.

175
00:09:57,843 --> 00:09:59,713
"They must have nothing
else going for them."

176
00:10:00,654 --> 00:10:04,084
"That's why they want to ride
their children's coattails."

177
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:05,453
I always thought that.

178
00:10:08,264 --> 00:10:09,564
But you see,

179
00:10:11,764 --> 00:10:15,134
ever since this happened
to my leg because of you,

180
00:10:16,363 --> 00:10:18,573
your success has been my sole focus...

181
00:10:19,374 --> 00:10:20,934
And my sole devotion.

182
00:10:22,044 --> 00:10:23,904
If I can make you successful,

183
00:10:24,674 --> 00:10:26,214
I don't care who dies,

184
00:10:26,613 --> 00:10:28,043
even if that's me.

185
00:10:29,784 --> 00:10:31,144
I really don't care.

186
00:10:34,054 --> 00:10:35,184
So?

187
00:10:35,453 --> 00:10:36,683
Did you kill him?

188
00:10:38,453 --> 00:10:40,393
If I get caught, I'll be
the one getting arrested.

189
00:10:40,493 --> 00:10:41,723
You'll be fine, my princess.

190
00:10:41,723 --> 00:10:44,393
- Mom!
- I didn't do it!

191
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:46,364
I did think I should kill
him if he got in the way,

192
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:47,733
but it wasn't me.

193
00:10:50,304 --> 00:10:52,204
Right? It wasn't you, right?

194
00:10:52,203 --> 00:10:54,033
There are times when the
universe looks out for you.

195
00:10:54,943 --> 00:10:56,043
What?

196
00:10:56,174 --> 00:10:57,544
You couldn't get pregnant,

197
00:10:57,544 --> 00:11:00,614
but a stranger shows up pregnant
and says she'll have the baby.

198
00:11:00,914 --> 00:11:03,014
There was a jerk whom you wanted gone,

199
00:11:03,014 --> 00:11:04,244
and he dropped dead.

200
00:11:04,384 --> 00:11:05,554
You see, it means...

201
00:11:06,983 --> 00:11:10,753
The universe is focusing
its energy on you.

202
00:11:16,294 --> 00:11:18,094
I'm home.

203
00:11:18,693 --> 00:11:20,393
Did you meet the couple?
What did they say?

204
00:11:21,294 --> 00:11:22,864
They're very grateful.

205
00:11:22,863 --> 00:11:25,433
How come you look so flustered?
Did something happen?

206
00:11:26,304 --> 00:11:28,674
No, it was just a long day. That's all.

207
00:11:29,103 --> 00:11:30,343
I should get some rest.

208
00:11:30,343 --> 00:11:31,503
Woo ri.

209
00:11:31,674 --> 00:11:33,614
I thought about it all day.

210
00:11:34,073 --> 00:11:37,043
Giving your baby away won't
be as easy as it sounds.

211
00:11:39,184 --> 00:11:41,254
Mom, stop calling it a baby.

212
00:11:41,254 --> 00:11:42,484
It's mallet.

213
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:44,453
I won't change my mind.

214
00:11:44,754 --> 00:11:47,494
That couple really wants mallet.

215
00:11:47,493 --> 00:11:49,663
And they're well-off, so
mallet will be happy.

216
00:11:49,664 --> 00:11:52,094
- We have nothing to worry about.
- Well, the thing is...

217
00:11:54,264 --> 00:11:56,134
Who is it? Just answer it.

218
00:11:56,363 --> 00:11:58,903
This is about my daughter's life.
Who cares about a phone call?

219
00:11:59,473 --> 00:12:02,043
Woo ri, I understand why
you made such a decision,

220
00:12:02,443 --> 00:12:04,843
but the reality is very
different from what you think.

221
00:12:06,743 --> 00:12:08,743
Hey! Either answer the call
or turn off your phone.

222
00:12:14,613 --> 00:12:15,753
Are you a stalker?

223
00:12:15,754 --> 00:12:18,454
I didn't pick up because I couldn't.
Must you keep calling me?

224
00:12:18,453 --> 00:12:19,723
Are you free later?

225
00:12:20,424 --> 00:12:22,294
I want to talk to you in person.

226
00:12:22,524 --> 00:12:25,134
- I'm busy.
- Come on, eun ran.

227
00:12:25,493 --> 00:12:27,393
I can't even eat...

228
00:12:27,394 --> 00:12:29,504
Or sleep.

229
00:12:29,504 --> 00:12:31,334
You see, I've lived like
that my whole life.

230
00:12:31,904 --> 00:12:33,734
I told you that my kid is
going through something.

231
00:12:34,274 --> 00:12:35,574
I'll tell you once
things get sorted out.

232
00:12:36,144 --> 00:12:37,404
Wait patiently.

233
00:12:37,904 --> 00:12:39,674
I'll call you, so stop calling me.

234
00:12:40,473 --> 00:12:41,883
Wait, eun ran!

235
00:12:46,453 --> 00:12:47,583
Seriously...

236
00:12:48,113 --> 00:12:51,323
Does she not see how
much I care about her?

237
00:12:54,394 --> 00:12:55,564
Gosh, why...

238
00:13:00,434 --> 00:13:01,804
Eun ran!

239
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:04,703
Ms. yu.

240
00:13:04,863 --> 00:13:08,203
You say you have meetings, but all
you do is get facial treatments.

241
00:13:08,674 --> 00:13:10,374
When will you work on the script?

242
00:13:10,374 --> 00:13:12,044
The director will yell at us.

243
00:13:16,144 --> 00:13:17,414
She does this all the time.

244
00:13:32,093 --> 00:13:33,993
Hey, I told you that you
should get it done too.

245
00:13:42,943 --> 00:13:44,943
With that handsome face,
what do you expect?

246
00:13:44,943 --> 00:13:46,143
I knew it.

247
00:13:46,514 --> 00:13:48,044
He has a heck of a nickname.

248
00:13:49,684 --> 00:13:51,444
What is his nickname?

249
00:13:51,443 --> 00:13:52,583
Actress hunter.

250
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:55,083
He only dates actresses,
one after another.

251
00:13:55,554 --> 00:13:56,924
But he's married.

252
00:13:57,624 --> 00:13:59,594
As if he cares.

253
00:13:59,593 --> 00:14:01,353
He just does whatever he wants.

254
00:14:02,093 --> 00:14:05,693
I heard lots of rumors about him.

255
00:14:07,233 --> 00:14:08,333
What kind of rumors?

256
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:10,003
There were articles about it.
Look it up.

257
00:14:46,804 --> 00:14:48,404
How about another drink at the hotel?

258
00:14:49,804 --> 00:14:51,274
I'm...

259
00:14:55,813 --> 00:14:56,983
I'll pass.

260
00:14:56,983 --> 00:14:58,143
Come on.

261
00:14:58,144 --> 00:15:00,854
We came all the way here.
Let's have some fun.

262
00:15:05,254 --> 00:15:09,294
How about we meet again here tomorrow?

263
00:15:14,634 --> 00:15:16,364
Babe!

264
00:15:17,764 --> 00:15:19,134
You look great today.

265
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:39,193
Woo ri.

266
00:15:41,054 --> 00:15:42,624
Hey, woo ri.

267
00:15:42,794 --> 00:15:45,264
My gosh. Why are you
working so hard today?

268
00:15:45,693 --> 00:15:48,763
Don't do more than you get paid to do.

269
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:49,903
Okay.

270
00:15:50,764 --> 00:15:52,174
Gosh, I'm exhausted.

271
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:56,203
Were any of you personally close to Mr.
No man chul?

272
00:15:58,404 --> 00:15:59,614
No one?

273
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:01,883
Sorry, excuse me.

274
00:16:03,113 --> 00:16:04,283
Detective Lee.

275
00:16:06,054 --> 00:16:08,484
Are you interviewing
my employees again?

276
00:16:09,024 --> 00:16:10,154
Yes.

277
00:16:10,654 --> 00:16:14,224
We have to investigate until the
perp is caught. Please cooperate.

278
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:16,293
Clearly, we are cooperating. However...

279
00:16:17,723 --> 00:16:20,133
Must you do this in
front of the patients?

280
00:16:20,294 --> 00:16:21,634
This is a hospital, you see.

281
00:16:23,703 --> 00:16:25,403
Ma ri, could you take them...

282
00:16:26,203 --> 00:16:27,433
Take them to the meeting room.

283
00:16:28,203 --> 00:16:29,303
Sure.

284
00:16:29,473 --> 00:16:30,643
Let's go to the meeting room.

285
00:16:35,713 --> 00:16:37,243
Is the investigation going well?

286
00:16:37,983 --> 00:16:39,153
Well...

287
00:16:39,353 --> 00:16:40,513
It's not easy.

288
00:16:41,154 --> 00:16:42,554
You know, the chairman's son.

289
00:16:43,624 --> 00:16:44,954
He's got an attitude.

290
00:16:46,323 --> 00:16:47,553
Raphael?

291
00:16:48,294 --> 00:16:50,824
Kang jae, what do you think of him?

292
00:16:51,193 --> 00:16:54,163
Doesn't he look awfully calm
considering his employee died?

293
00:16:54,164 --> 00:16:56,304
You should look into him.

294
00:16:56,363 --> 00:16:58,203
I'm already on it. Don't worry.

295
00:16:58,874 --> 00:17:00,834
Look at you, talking like a detective.

296
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:02,743
No, that guy...

297
00:17:06,674 --> 00:17:07,914
I think he's a philanderer.

298
00:17:09,114 --> 00:17:10,314
People call him "actress hunter".

299
00:17:10,513 --> 00:17:12,753
What? That's what you
want me to look into?

300
00:17:13,283 --> 00:17:15,013
That's his personal life.

301
00:17:15,013 --> 00:17:17,253
I saw something fishy with my own eyes.

302
00:17:17,324 --> 00:17:19,254
I can't send mallet
to someone like that.

303
00:17:19,253 --> 00:17:21,153
That's not why I made the decision.

304
00:17:21,453 --> 00:17:22,623
"Mallet"?

305
00:17:23,263 --> 00:17:24,963
I've decided to call the
baby like that from now on.

306
00:17:25,993 --> 00:17:27,093
Kang jae.

307
00:17:27,094 --> 00:17:29,804
Can you look into him, Kang jae?

308
00:17:30,033 --> 00:17:32,373
I heard he caused a
dui accident once...

309
00:17:32,374 --> 00:17:34,474
And even threw a drug party.

310
00:17:34,473 --> 00:17:36,243
Can you please find out...

311
00:17:36,243 --> 00:17:37,703
If he has a criminal record? Please?

312
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:40,513
Just because I'm a cop, it doesn't
mean I can do stuff like that.

313
00:17:40,644 --> 00:17:42,014
If I'm caught, I'll get fired.

314
00:17:42,213 --> 00:17:43,943
Then what should I do?

315
00:17:44,614 --> 00:17:46,814
I can't send mallet to a
dysfunctional family.

316
00:17:47,354 --> 00:17:49,754
The wife desperately
wants to have a baby.

317
00:17:49,753 --> 00:17:51,453
And I thought she would
be a great mother.

318
00:17:58,124 --> 00:17:59,364
Woo ri.

319
00:17:59,394 --> 00:18:01,894
I said you'd run into problems
you had never even thought of.

320
00:18:02,404 --> 00:18:04,264
You'll run into more unexpected issues.

321
00:18:05,674 --> 00:18:06,734
I suggest you rethink...

322
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:08,943
No, I can't.

323
00:18:09,574 --> 00:18:11,804
I told mom that I'd make
this work no matter what.

324
00:18:12,114 --> 00:18:15,384
I told her I was sending
mallet to the perfect home.

325
00:18:18,283 --> 00:18:19,513
I'll find out.

326
00:18:20,253 --> 00:18:23,353
I must find out if there's
something wrong with the husband.

327
00:18:39,574 --> 00:18:41,404
Hello, sir.

328
00:18:41,604 --> 00:18:43,574
I was just wondering...

329
00:18:43,574 --> 00:18:46,674
If I'd be able to see
you and your wife...

330
00:18:46,674 --> 00:18:50,114
I mean, I'd like to speak with
you and Ms. Lee ma ri in person.

331
00:18:52,713 --> 00:18:54,183
Both of us?

332
00:18:54,184 --> 00:18:55,724
That's right.

333
00:18:55,723 --> 00:18:59,023
I'd like to discuss a few
things regarding the baby.

334
00:18:59,193 --> 00:19:00,323
I see.

335
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:02,363
Well...

336
00:19:02,364 --> 00:19:05,164
But I'm not sure if Ms. Lee can join us.
She's very busy.

337
00:19:05,463 --> 00:19:06,663
What?

338
00:19:07,064 --> 00:19:10,304
This is about the baby. She's too busy?

339
00:19:10,303 --> 00:19:12,333
Well, no. We should meet.

340
00:19:14,074 --> 00:19:15,234
But...

341
00:19:15,233 --> 00:19:16,803
Can't you discuss it with me?

342
00:19:18,503 --> 00:19:20,773
Is there a reason I shouldn't
meet with your wife?

343
00:19:20,773 --> 00:19:21,873
No.

344
00:19:22,614 --> 00:19:25,044
It's not... it's not that.

345
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:27,314
You can meet her, of course.

346
00:19:27,753 --> 00:19:31,023
Then I'll check her schedule
and get back to you.

347
00:19:31,523 --> 00:19:32,593
- Wait.
- Talk soon.

348
00:19:32,924 --> 00:19:34,054
Hello?

349
00:19:37,693 --> 00:19:39,163
He hung up? What the...

350
00:19:46,404 --> 00:19:47,434
He hung up on me?

351
00:19:47,434 --> 00:19:48,704
Is he out of his mind?

352
00:19:48,703 --> 00:19:50,903
I'm asking to meet up because
of the baby, and he's too busy?

353
00:19:58,753 --> 00:20:01,053
I had to take this call. I'm sorry.

354
00:20:01,914 --> 00:20:03,184
It's okay.

355
00:20:04,523 --> 00:20:06,953
Since there are a lot of eyes watching,

356
00:20:07,693 --> 00:20:09,323
please understand having
to meet like this.

357
00:20:09,324 --> 00:20:10,594
I understand.

358
00:20:10,664 --> 00:20:11,664
But still,

359
00:20:11,864 --> 00:20:15,394
I'm just happy that we
can meet like this.

360
00:20:23,674 --> 00:20:24,674
Hey!

361
00:20:29,644 --> 00:20:31,084
Why did you come?

362
00:20:31,084 --> 00:20:33,114
Why is fate so cruel?

363
00:20:33,914 --> 00:20:35,354
Let me talk to my daughter.

364
00:20:35,354 --> 00:20:37,584
Let me tell her that I'm her father.

365
00:20:37,654 --> 00:20:39,524
This is so hard on me.

366
00:20:39,523 --> 00:20:41,123
It's difficult for woo ri as well.

367
00:20:41,394 --> 00:20:42,694
Stop making a fuss.

368
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:45,834
Did something happen to woo ri?

369
00:20:46,864 --> 00:20:49,604
I met her, but she didn't look so good.

370
00:20:49,733 --> 00:20:51,833
Meet her? Why?

371
00:20:51,934 --> 00:20:53,604
I told you to wait.

372
00:20:53,604 --> 00:20:55,804
Stop shouting at me.

373
00:20:56,344 --> 00:20:57,844
I work with her.

374
00:20:58,574 --> 00:21:00,314
I met her at the writer's office.

375
00:21:00,314 --> 00:21:02,114
You didn't tell her you're
her father, did you?

376
00:21:02,114 --> 00:21:03,844
I didn't.

377
00:21:04,243 --> 00:21:08,313
But she's so beautiful.

378
00:21:08,483 --> 00:21:09,683
She is.

379
00:21:10,124 --> 00:21:13,594
She's the most beautiful, the
kindest, and the smartest.

380
00:21:13,594 --> 00:21:15,054
Gosh.

381
00:21:17,094 --> 00:21:18,994
- Choi sung il!
- Choi sung il?

382
00:21:21,094 --> 00:21:24,364
Mr. choi sung il?

383
00:21:24,904 --> 00:21:25,974
What?

384
00:21:26,404 --> 00:21:30,074
What brings you here?

385
00:21:30,144 --> 00:21:32,244
- Well...
- Well...

386
00:21:32,814 --> 00:21:34,074
Oh...

387
00:21:34,314 --> 00:21:37,514
The other day at the hospital event.

388
00:21:38,043 --> 00:21:39,153
Oh eun ran!

389
00:21:39,513 --> 00:21:41,383
Do you know each other?

390
00:21:41,384 --> 00:21:43,724
Well...

391
00:21:43,723 --> 00:21:45,593
- You're back.
- What?

392
00:21:46,793 --> 00:21:49,323
Did you like my pork cutlet?
You crave it, don't you?

393
00:21:49,324 --> 00:21:50,964
Yes.

394
00:21:50,963 --> 00:21:53,233
Have you been here before?

395
00:21:53,334 --> 00:21:56,634
Well, that is...

396
00:21:57,064 --> 00:21:59,304
Actually,

397
00:22:00,104 --> 00:22:02,774
eun ran and I...

398
00:22:03,074 --> 00:22:06,344
Were classmates. From
middle school, aren't we?

399
00:22:06,644 --> 00:22:09,484
What? You didn't know that until now?

400
00:22:09,814 --> 00:22:13,754
His face changed a little, that's why.

401
00:22:14,154 --> 00:22:15,784
So, that rumor about plastic
surgery and faking your age...

402
00:22:15,783 --> 00:22:16,953
Gosh, no.

403
00:22:17,723 --> 00:22:20,893
What a relationship that is!
Take a seat.

404
00:22:20,894 --> 00:22:23,524
You didn't eat, did you? Shall
we have dinner together?

405
00:22:23,594 --> 00:22:25,124
- Dinner all together?
- Yes!

406
00:22:25,124 --> 00:22:26,364
- Seriously?
- Yes!

407
00:22:26,364 --> 00:22:28,064
Then let me treat you.

408
00:22:28,064 --> 00:22:30,604
I'll take you to a nice
restaurant in town.

409
00:22:30,604 --> 00:22:32,704
- Yes.
- Don't you need to go now?

410
00:22:32,703 --> 00:22:35,173
- You said you were busy.
- Me? Busy?

411
00:22:35,174 --> 00:22:37,104
You wanted to meet next
time since you are busy.

412
00:22:37,104 --> 00:22:38,604
- Right?
- What about dinner?

413
00:22:38,604 --> 00:22:40,414
Next time.

414
00:22:40,814 --> 00:22:42,114
- Let's go.
- Okay.

415
00:22:42,943 --> 00:22:44,083
Ms. oh,

416
00:22:45,114 --> 00:22:48,214
see you again.

417
00:23:08,003 --> 00:23:09,743
Hey, let's go.

418
00:23:09,743 --> 00:23:11,143
- Come quick.
- Wait...

419
00:23:11,144 --> 00:23:13,944
- You're so busy, you need to go.
- Wait, I should be there...

420
00:23:13,943 --> 00:23:16,143
- What about dinner?
- I should...

421
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:18,044
- No, come quick.
- Wait, wait.

422
00:23:18,043 --> 00:23:20,813
- You need to stop this.
- Eun ran, we'll get hurt.

423
00:23:20,983 --> 00:23:22,983
This is not the right time. No.

424
00:23:23,223 --> 00:23:25,423
- You should go and don't come back.
- Wait, seriously...

425
00:23:25,424 --> 00:23:28,654
No! Just leave.

426
00:23:46,743 --> 00:23:48,543
I thought about it all night.

427
00:23:49,943 --> 00:23:51,013
Kang jae,

428
00:23:51,713 --> 00:23:53,953
what if I decide that I can't...

429
00:23:54,053 --> 00:23:56,783
Give up mallet to Raphael's couple,

430
00:23:56,783 --> 00:23:58,453
after careful consideration?

431
00:24:00,354 --> 00:24:02,564
I couldn't sleep thinking
about that all night.

432
00:24:03,293 --> 00:24:04,863
Do you think I could raise it well?

433
00:24:08,434 --> 00:24:10,564
Nothing's decided yet.

434
00:24:11,263 --> 00:24:12,903
So, don't think about it too much.

435
00:24:22,783 --> 00:24:26,083
Gosh, do you not have more on...

436
00:24:26,084 --> 00:24:27,954
No man chul's surroundings
after our last meeting?

437
00:24:28,483 --> 00:24:31,323
I don't care how
trivial, just report it.

438
00:24:31,453 --> 00:24:32,493
Don't you have any?

439
00:24:34,324 --> 00:24:36,464
Doesn't he have any girls or something?

440
00:24:38,664 --> 00:24:40,634
See? He has no manners.

441
00:24:40,693 --> 00:24:42,263
That's why you don't
even have a girlfriend.

442
00:24:45,604 --> 00:24:47,774
We need to go! Wildcat is out.

443
00:24:48,104 --> 00:24:49,144
Let's go.

444
00:24:58,043 --> 00:24:59,783
We need to go. What are you doing?

445
00:25:00,753 --> 00:25:03,853
I need to change the
baby's diaper, first.

446
00:25:03,983 --> 00:25:05,223
Lee Kang jae!

447
00:25:05,483 --> 00:25:06,593
What?

448
00:25:06,693 --> 00:25:08,493
Don't you have anything to report?

449
00:25:08,493 --> 00:25:09,993
Why are you spacing out like that?

450
00:25:10,993 --> 00:25:11,993
I'm sorry.

451
00:25:13,894 --> 00:25:15,034
I have nothing to report.

452
00:25:17,503 --> 00:25:19,073
This is annoying for me too.

453
00:25:19,203 --> 00:25:21,333
The police officers are at
the hospital all the time.

454
00:25:21,334 --> 00:25:22,944
That's why you need to be careful.

455
00:25:22,943 --> 00:25:26,673
Don't leave any traces
of you meeting man chul.

456
00:25:26,674 --> 00:25:28,074
I know.

457
00:25:28,213 --> 00:25:30,983
I only contacted him through a
messenger, so I won't get caught.

458
00:25:31,783 --> 00:25:34,683
And I even deleted all that.
Hang up, will you?

459
00:25:58,674 --> 00:26:01,414
We already know that you were in
a relationship with no man chul.

460
00:26:01,743 --> 00:26:03,313
That's not true.

461
00:26:03,713 --> 00:26:06,883
He just followed me around. We
didn't have a relationship.

462
00:26:07,283 --> 00:26:09,653
In Sweden, this is considered
a greeting, that's all.

463
00:26:12,553 --> 00:26:14,693
If you throw out such a thing,
the police will be suspicious.

464
00:26:15,963 --> 00:26:17,193
Put it back.

465
00:26:21,134 --> 00:26:23,064
The police is suspicious?

466
00:26:26,503 --> 00:26:29,873
I've been interviewed many times,
and they didn't know I knew him.

467
00:26:31,943 --> 00:26:33,773
You're the only one who knows
about this, aren't you?

468
00:26:35,814 --> 00:26:36,984
For now.

469
00:26:37,914 --> 00:26:39,954
Aren't you, Ms. oh woo ri's fiance?

470
00:26:41,283 --> 00:26:42,983
Ms. oh woo ri has the baby...

471
00:26:42,983 --> 00:26:45,953
She wouldn't want to send the
baby to a murder suspect.

472
00:26:46,924 --> 00:26:48,754
So if something goes
wrong on my side...

473
00:26:48,924 --> 00:26:52,764
You might end up raising the baby.

474
00:26:54,033 --> 00:26:56,263
That's not a nice thought, is it?

475
00:26:56,463 --> 00:26:57,533
Ms. ma ri,

476
00:26:58,533 --> 00:27:00,173
I've been investigating for days.

477
00:27:00,174 --> 00:27:01,874
Your call history, messages,
and your e-mails, everything.

478
00:27:01,874 --> 00:27:04,304
I even checked the black box videos.

479
00:27:04,703 --> 00:27:06,613
I didn't report it because
there were no charges.

480
00:27:08,614 --> 00:27:10,844
I guess you and I must
be on the same side.

481
00:27:12,283 --> 00:27:13,313
Excuse me?

482
00:27:13,314 --> 00:27:15,554
You want us to raise the baby.

483
00:27:15,553 --> 00:27:17,683
I'm so desperate as well.

484
00:27:18,584 --> 00:27:20,754
I think you need to help us a lot.

485
00:27:23,023 --> 00:27:26,133
Make sure you hide the things that
my husband shouldn't find out.

486
00:27:41,473 --> 00:27:44,843
Mom, do you know what just happened?

487
00:27:45,213 --> 00:27:47,753
You wouldn't believe it.
This is incredible.

488
00:27:48,053 --> 00:27:50,553
I think the universe is on our side.

489
00:27:51,184 --> 00:27:54,194
I met this police officer, and
you won't know who he is...

490
00:27:56,124 --> 00:27:57,324
Wait, my necklace.

491
00:27:58,664 --> 00:28:00,394
Nothing, just hang up.

492
00:28:07,233 --> 00:28:09,403
Wait!

493
00:28:09,743 --> 00:28:10,773
Stop.

494
00:28:11,273 --> 00:28:12,613
Detective Lee Kang jae.

495
00:28:14,443 --> 00:28:16,043
I think you need to help me.

496
00:28:20,513 --> 00:28:23,353
Are you sure this is for us?

497
00:28:23,354 --> 00:28:26,824
- Yes.
- I mean, then who sent it?

498
00:28:26,953 --> 00:28:28,993
Hello, everyone.

499
00:28:28,993 --> 00:28:31,593
It arrived. It looks so luxurious.

500
00:28:32,594 --> 00:28:36,264
I wanted you to work in a
comfortable environment.

501
00:28:36,263 --> 00:28:38,503
So I sent all of this.

502
00:28:40,074 --> 00:28:42,234
Was it too much?

503
00:28:42,604 --> 00:28:46,014
But this is nothing for
me if it's for the baby.

504
00:28:46,144 --> 00:28:47,644
I would do more if I could.

505
00:28:48,414 --> 00:28:51,384
Whatever you do, I'd like for you
to run it by me before you do it.

506
00:28:51,614 --> 00:28:53,684
Right.

507
00:28:53,684 --> 00:28:57,154
I will talk to you first
from now on. Okay.

508
00:28:57,424 --> 00:28:58,454
Well...

509
00:28:59,424 --> 00:29:00,694
Well...

510
00:29:02,424 --> 00:29:05,724
I actually had something...

511
00:29:06,064 --> 00:29:08,464
I wanted to tell you.

512
00:29:08,463 --> 00:29:10,463
What is it? Tell me.

513
00:29:11,564 --> 00:29:14,434
Are you close with choi mi ae?

514
00:29:14,503 --> 00:29:17,773
No, we are just acquaintances.

515
00:29:18,703 --> 00:29:20,313
Just acquaintances...

516
00:29:22,043 --> 00:29:24,113
- Well...
- Raphael?

517
00:29:24,983 --> 00:29:26,013
What?

518
00:29:26,614 --> 00:29:28,254
Hello, da bin.

519
00:29:28,253 --> 00:29:31,123
Gosh, you. It's me, ye rin.

520
00:29:31,483 --> 00:29:33,793
- Right, ye rin.
- How have you been?

521
00:29:33,924 --> 00:29:35,754
It's been so long.

522
00:29:36,263 --> 00:29:38,923
I'm having a business meeting here.
Let's talk later.

523
00:29:38,924 --> 00:29:41,134
All right.

524
00:29:41,134 --> 00:29:42,564
- Call me.
- Yes.

525
00:29:52,074 --> 00:29:54,444
- Sir.
- Yes?

526
00:29:55,374 --> 00:29:56,984
Do you know a lot of women?

527
00:29:57,384 --> 00:30:00,454
No, well, just a few friends...

528
00:30:01,614 --> 00:30:04,654
What were you asking earlier?
What about choi mi ae?

529
00:30:04,783 --> 00:30:05,853
Nothing.

530
00:30:07,624 --> 00:30:08,994
I'm sorry. Just a second.

531
00:30:42,523 --> 00:30:44,423
Ms. oh, shall we go now?

532
00:30:45,594 --> 00:30:47,864
What's going on? Are you okay?

533
00:30:49,733 --> 00:30:50,803
Yes.

534
00:30:50,963 --> 00:30:52,333
I just slipped.

535
00:30:52,434 --> 00:30:53,774
What? Are you all right?

536
00:30:54,773 --> 00:30:55,803
Yes, I'm okay.

537
00:30:57,773 --> 00:30:59,003
I don't know why I slipped.

538
00:31:11,023 --> 00:31:12,253
Do you think that makes sense?

539
00:31:12,253 --> 00:31:14,293
Am I your errand boy or something?

540
00:31:14,293 --> 00:31:17,423
What can I do? The necklace
has my initials on it.

541
00:31:17,664 --> 00:31:19,294
Do you want me to be interviewed?

542
00:31:19,693 --> 00:31:21,693
Why don't you help me out a bit?

543
00:31:34,074 --> 00:31:35,574
Good job everyone.

544
00:31:37,344 --> 00:31:39,114
Who's this?

545
00:31:39,243 --> 00:31:40,383
Why are you here?

546
00:31:40,983 --> 00:31:43,423
I just wanted to take a look again.

547
00:31:44,084 --> 00:31:45,754
- What brings you here?
- I came to see...

548
00:31:45,753 --> 00:31:47,423
If I missed anything.

549
00:31:48,424 --> 00:31:50,824
- Did you find anything?
- No, I didn't.

550
00:31:50,824 --> 00:31:52,064
I couldn't find anything.

551
00:32:27,364 --> 00:32:28,664
You see, I have my own situation.

552
00:32:28,763 --> 00:32:31,133
So I don't want to let anyone know yet.

553
00:32:33,533 --> 00:32:35,033
Why is this embarrassing?

554
00:32:36,203 --> 00:32:37,673
Weren't you sincere about it?

555
00:32:37,844 --> 00:32:40,844
Is this something that
we're not proud of?

556
00:32:41,973 --> 00:32:43,613
Please, understand.

557
00:32:54,824 --> 00:32:56,564
Ms. oh, what are you doing here?

558
00:33:01,263 --> 00:33:02,493
Hello.

559
00:33:03,233 --> 00:33:05,633
I'm here to have a drink.

560
00:33:05,963 --> 00:33:07,103
Alone?

561
00:33:07,174 --> 00:33:09,174
Yes, by myself, of course.

562
00:33:17,243 --> 00:33:18,413
Sir.

563
00:33:18,614 --> 00:33:21,254
What's going on between you and Ms.
Choi mi ae?

564
00:33:21,713 --> 00:33:23,953
What do you mean?

565
00:33:24,124 --> 00:33:25,584
You shouldn't be this way.

566
00:33:25,584 --> 00:33:27,494
Excuse me? What do you mean?

567
00:33:27,493 --> 00:33:29,763
I think I have a right
to tell you this.

568
00:33:30,223 --> 00:33:32,763
If you continue to act like
this, I'm going to reconsider.

569
00:33:32,894 --> 00:33:34,594
How can I trust you to have a baby...

570
00:33:36,803 --> 00:33:37,863
Gosh.

571
00:33:39,064 --> 00:33:40,634
Oh gosh.

572
00:33:41,604 --> 00:33:43,804
I think there's a misunderstanding.

573
00:33:43,803 --> 00:33:45,743
We're not like that...

574
00:33:45,743 --> 00:33:47,143
- This is...
- Auntie!

575
00:33:48,614 --> 00:33:49,944
Soo hyun, you're here.

576
00:33:50,814 --> 00:33:54,254
Say, hello. This is Raphael.

577
00:33:55,414 --> 00:33:56,754
Hello, nice to meet you.

578
00:33:57,184 --> 00:33:58,354
Soo hyun, say hello.

579
00:33:59,753 --> 00:34:01,123
You must be shy.

580
00:34:01,293 --> 00:34:03,423
You even brought a gift for him.

581
00:34:03,523 --> 00:34:04,593
Go ahead, give it to him.

582
00:34:07,164 --> 00:34:09,234
Here, thank you.

583
00:34:11,134 --> 00:34:13,704
She wanted to give you her
favorite stuffed animal.

584
00:34:14,673 --> 00:34:16,273
Thank you so much.

585
00:34:16,504 --> 00:34:18,644
Thanks to you, we met
some good doctors.

586
00:34:18,644 --> 00:34:20,744
And we were able to get through.

587
00:34:21,374 --> 00:34:24,044
Is it okay for me to have this?

588
00:34:24,184 --> 00:34:25,284
Yes.

589
00:34:34,323 --> 00:34:35,453
But,

590
00:34:35,894 --> 00:34:37,694
I didn't do much.

591
00:34:37,923 --> 00:34:42,133
Honestly, I said that this
meeting even was too much.

592
00:34:42,263 --> 00:34:44,303
This is all for soo hyun.

593
00:34:49,874 --> 00:34:51,044
Soo hyun,

594
00:34:51,274 --> 00:34:52,474
thank you for the gift.

595
00:34:53,573 --> 00:34:57,143
I also suffered from the
same disease as you before.

596
00:34:57,283 --> 00:34:59,143
And I'm all better now.

597
00:34:59,243 --> 00:35:00,913
See? I'm all healthy.

598
00:35:01,354 --> 00:35:03,784
You will get better too.

599
00:35:04,053 --> 00:35:07,093
So, listen to what your
doctor tells you...

600
00:35:07,354 --> 00:35:10,164
And get your treatment
bravely, all right?

601
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:11,564
Yes, I will.

602
00:35:17,863 --> 00:35:19,163
Well...

603
00:35:19,164 --> 00:35:20,634
I have something urgent to attend to,

604
00:35:20,633 --> 00:35:21,873
so I'll get going.

605
00:35:21,874 --> 00:35:23,444
Goodbye.

606
00:35:25,444 --> 00:35:26,644
Go, soo hyun!

607
00:35:27,944 --> 00:35:29,444
Wait, Ms. oh.

608
00:35:29,883 --> 00:35:30,943
Let's go together.

609
00:35:31,243 --> 00:35:33,213
What's wrong. It's fine.

610
00:35:47,394 --> 00:35:50,334
Sir, I think I'll get off now.

611
00:35:50,334 --> 00:35:51,634
Wait.

612
00:35:52,263 --> 00:35:54,403
Here? You can't.

613
00:35:54,403 --> 00:35:56,743
How can you go from here?
Let's talk a little.

614
00:35:56,843 --> 00:35:58,243
The weather's nice today.

615
00:35:59,814 --> 00:36:00,914
Right.

616
00:36:10,984 --> 00:36:13,724
I've looked you up online for two days.

617
00:36:15,254 --> 00:36:16,324
You did?

618
00:36:16,923 --> 00:36:18,293
There are a lot of things
about me, aren't there?

619
00:36:18,294 --> 00:36:19,294
Yes.

620
00:36:19,934 --> 00:36:21,734
There were a lot of articles,

621
00:36:21,734 --> 00:36:24,604
photos, and rumors...

622
00:36:25,934 --> 00:36:27,634
Yes, I partied a lot.

623
00:36:28,303 --> 00:36:29,873
Nobody hates having fun, do they?

624
00:36:29,874 --> 00:36:31,744
Right, it seems that way.

625
00:36:32,673 --> 00:36:34,573
But a lot of it is exaggerated.

626
00:36:34,743 --> 00:36:36,613
I wasn't that bad.

627
00:36:40,513 --> 00:36:41,653
Do you want to see this?

628
00:36:47,153 --> 00:36:49,093
This is my mother. Isn't she pretty?

629
00:36:52,423 --> 00:36:54,933
But she passed away early
when I was in middle school.

630
00:36:56,363 --> 00:37:00,433
I think I started to act
out ever since she died.

631
00:37:00,734 --> 00:37:04,044
You know those kids who do
things they're told not to.

632
00:37:07,173 --> 00:37:09,213
I was like that even
after I became an adult.

633
00:37:09,444 --> 00:37:11,944
And then one day, they told
me I had stomach cancer.

634
00:37:15,214 --> 00:37:16,654
The funny thing is...

635
00:37:16,653 --> 00:37:18,753
That my mother died from
stomach cancer as well.

636
00:37:18,754 --> 00:37:19,994
And I had the same disease.

637
00:37:21,593 --> 00:37:22,793
When the doctor told me...

638
00:37:23,323 --> 00:37:25,863
I had stage three stomach cancer,

639
00:37:26,363 --> 00:37:28,563
it felt like my mother...

640
00:37:29,164 --> 00:37:31,634
Was telling me that I
shouldn't live like that...

641
00:37:33,104 --> 00:37:34,474
From above.

642
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:38,644
I think my mom is so great,

643
00:37:39,303 --> 00:37:44,113
telling me such a thing so that
her son would live properly.

644
00:37:45,144 --> 00:37:46,684
Isn't she such a great mom?

645
00:37:53,294 --> 00:37:54,494
Ms. oh,

646
00:37:55,653 --> 00:37:58,693
I understand that you don't
want to send the baby...

647
00:37:58,694 --> 00:37:59,724
To a weird person.

648
00:38:00,533 --> 00:38:01,763
But...

649
00:38:02,993 --> 00:38:04,463
I'm not that kind of person.

650
00:38:05,033 --> 00:38:06,603
I may have been once,

651
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:08,374
but I'm not that person anymore.

652
00:38:11,173 --> 00:38:12,803
I'm sorry I questioned you.

653
00:38:14,843 --> 00:38:18,843
Wasn't that a reasonable
suspicion to have?

654
00:38:19,513 --> 00:38:21,283
I was so worried...

655
00:38:21,283 --> 00:38:23,323
That mallet would have an unhappy life.

656
00:38:23,953 --> 00:38:25,153
Who? Mallet?

657
00:38:25,653 --> 00:38:26,753
Pardon?

658
00:38:28,254 --> 00:38:31,294
- I decided to call the baby that.
- Right.

659
00:38:32,164 --> 00:38:35,794
I was out of my mind
because I was so worried.

660
00:38:36,533 --> 00:38:38,903
I followed you.

661
00:38:41,633 --> 00:38:42,833
Sir,

662
00:38:43,243 --> 00:38:45,643
you don't have any problems...

663
00:38:45,644 --> 00:38:48,244
Between you and Ms. ma ri, right?

664
00:38:51,084 --> 00:38:54,154
There's nothing going on between us.

665
00:39:10,363 --> 00:39:12,403
Please sit. Continue with your work.

666
00:39:15,303 --> 00:39:16,503
Where's Ms. Lee?

667
00:39:16,703 --> 00:39:18,903
She went out for work.

668
00:39:18,973 --> 00:39:20,413
Should I call her?

669
00:39:21,214 --> 00:39:22,874
- No, I'll do it.
- Yes, sir.

670
00:39:43,964 --> 00:39:45,604
Did you find my necklace?

671
00:39:46,673 --> 00:39:47,903
I threw it on the tray.

672
00:39:49,874 --> 00:39:50,904
Is this it?

673
00:39:50,903 --> 00:39:52,443
This is it. Thank you so much.

674
00:39:53,914 --> 00:39:55,144
What's wrong?

675
00:39:55,673 --> 00:39:57,343
I'm going to keep it while the
investigation is going on.

676
00:39:59,084 --> 00:40:00,714
Aren't we on the same side?

677
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:04,954
I'm still thinking...

678
00:40:05,723 --> 00:40:06,893
Whether or not I should join you.

679
00:40:25,874 --> 00:40:27,114
Honey.

680
00:40:29,444 --> 00:40:30,484
Tomorrow?

681
00:40:31,343 --> 00:40:34,753
Oh, really? No, we must go.

682
00:40:36,184 --> 00:40:38,454
Tomorrow, 2pm, at the hospital?

683
00:40:39,524 --> 00:40:40,594
Okay.

684
00:40:41,624 --> 00:40:43,094
Thank you.

685
00:40:46,863 --> 00:40:47,933
Perfect.

686
00:40:51,033 --> 00:40:52,303
You're going to the hospital tomorrow?

687
00:40:52,363 --> 00:40:53,373
Yes.

688
00:40:54,504 --> 00:40:55,674
You too?

689
00:40:58,504 --> 00:40:59,604
Darn it.

690
00:41:04,644 --> 00:41:06,514
Woo ri!

691
00:41:06,814 --> 00:41:09,084
Thank you so much.

692
00:41:09,084 --> 00:41:11,584
I don't know how to thank you.

693
00:41:11,584 --> 00:41:12,854
Not at all.

694
00:41:12,854 --> 00:41:14,594
Are you here alone?

695
00:41:14,593 --> 00:41:16,793
Since it's your first ultrasound,

696
00:41:16,794 --> 00:41:20,094
my husband and father-in-law
are all here.

697
00:41:20,194 --> 00:41:21,234
Are you alone?

698
00:41:21,234 --> 00:41:23,704
No, they're parking the car.

699
00:41:24,033 --> 00:41:26,873
Hello. How are you?

700
00:41:28,033 --> 00:41:30,173
Thank you so much. You're
doing the right thing.

701
00:41:30,343 --> 00:41:31,973
Get your hands off her.

702
00:41:31,973 --> 00:41:34,273
It's good to see you like this.

703
00:41:34,343 --> 00:41:36,513
We might grow on each
other if we keep this up.

704
00:41:37,714 --> 00:41:39,514
We won't be meeting again.

705
00:41:40,254 --> 00:41:42,954
You must be glad to have an heir
to carry on the family tradition.

706
00:41:43,113 --> 00:41:44,623
You just have to die now.

707
00:41:44,624 --> 00:41:46,684
- What's wrong with her?
- Let me introduce myself.

708
00:41:46,684 --> 00:41:49,354
I'm Raphael, CEO of diamond cosmetics.

709
00:41:51,524 --> 00:41:53,294
I'm the owner of the sperm.

710
00:41:53,863 --> 00:41:55,893
He means he's the father.

711
00:41:56,394 --> 00:41:58,564
Okay. And I'm woo ri's mom.

712
00:41:58,564 --> 00:42:00,934
Thank you for making
the tough decision.

713
00:42:00,934 --> 00:42:03,574
Call me if there's
anything you need from me.

714
00:42:03,944 --> 00:42:06,444
I think it best we meet
as little as possible.

715
00:42:06,914 --> 00:42:09,844
- Let's register.
- Okay. Sit somewhere and wait.

716
00:42:11,944 --> 00:42:14,314
Woo ri, ladies.

717
00:42:15,354 --> 00:42:18,154
What shall we name the
baby when it's born?

718
00:42:18,283 --> 00:42:20,723
Will it be a boy or a girl?

719
00:42:20,723 --> 00:42:23,223
I hope it's a girl that looks like me.

720
00:42:23,723 --> 00:42:25,463
How could it look like you?

721
00:42:26,064 --> 00:42:27,964
It could look like me.

722
00:42:28,164 --> 00:42:31,664
Wouldn't a boy that resembles
Raphael be so cute too?

723
00:42:32,064 --> 00:42:33,064
Oh woo ri?

724
00:42:33,065 --> 00:42:34,425
- Yes?
- Yes!

725
00:42:34,434 --> 00:42:35,574
It's her right here.

726
00:42:37,504 --> 00:42:38,804
Hello, doctor.

727
00:42:38,803 --> 00:42:40,613
I'm the grandmother.

728
00:42:40,613 --> 00:42:44,083
Oh, the grandmother of
the baby she's carrying?

729
00:42:44,243 --> 00:42:46,143
In that case, I'm the
great-grandmother.

730
00:42:46,144 --> 00:42:48,784
I called the hospital director.

731
00:42:48,854 --> 00:42:50,054
Isn't there a bigger room?

732
00:42:50,053 --> 00:42:52,283
This is the largest ultrasound room.

733
00:42:52,484 --> 00:42:55,854
There are too many people.
A few of you must leave.

734
00:42:55,854 --> 00:42:57,164
You wait outside.

735
00:42:57,363 --> 00:42:58,423
You should.

736
00:42:58,423 --> 00:43:00,263
Can you not point your finger?

737
00:43:00,294 --> 00:43:01,894
- Hey.
- Detective Lee.

738
00:43:01,894 --> 00:43:03,764
Did you not say hello
to my father-in-law?

739
00:43:03,763 --> 00:43:04,933
You're an officer?

740
00:43:05,064 --> 00:43:07,704
Say your hellos outside. I
can't do anything like this.

741
00:43:07,703 --> 00:43:08,903
Who will leave?

742
00:43:09,073 --> 00:43:10,573
I... I can't leave.

743
00:43:10,573 --> 00:43:12,403
- I'm her fiance.
- I'm the grandfather.

744
00:43:12,403 --> 00:43:14,113
- I'm the mom.
- We're her family.

745
00:43:14,113 --> 00:43:16,373
- We can't leave.
- We must be here.

746
00:43:16,374 --> 00:43:18,014
Quiet!

747
00:43:20,153 --> 00:43:22,413
- Oh woo ri!
- Yes? That's me.

748
00:43:23,354 --> 00:43:26,124
- Who's the baby's father?
- I am.

749
00:43:27,254 --> 00:43:30,494
Other than these two, the
rest of you can leave.

750
00:43:30,723 --> 00:43:31,793
Okay?

751
00:43:32,363 --> 00:43:34,163
- No.
- Call the director!

752
00:43:34,164 --> 00:43:36,864
- I called him!
- You don't have to worry.

753
00:43:36,863 --> 00:43:38,533
- This is my heir!
- We're family!

754
00:43:38,533 --> 00:43:40,433
Republic of Korea!

755
00:43:42,774 --> 00:43:45,144
I can't do anything if
you won't cooperate!

756
00:43:45,703 --> 00:43:47,373
- Let's go, then.
- Okay.

757
00:43:47,374 --> 00:43:50,114
- We must leave?
- You started all this.

758
00:43:52,343 --> 00:43:54,553
Let's begin. The gel is cold.

759
00:43:54,754 --> 00:43:55,814
Okay.

760
00:43:57,383 --> 00:43:59,083
Are you okay, Ms. oh?

761
00:43:59,223 --> 00:44:00,493
Yes.

762
00:44:02,854 --> 00:44:04,824
You can call me by my name.

763
00:44:05,294 --> 00:44:07,164
Don't call me Ms. oh.

764
00:44:07,164 --> 00:44:08,794
I'm just an assistant writer.

765
00:44:08,934 --> 00:44:11,704
No. You write stuff and
that makes you a writer.

766
00:44:11,834 --> 00:44:15,534
Since when did you want to be a writer?

767
00:44:18,004 --> 00:44:19,974
Since I was in middle school.

768
00:44:21,644 --> 00:44:23,584
I wanted to be a writer,

769
00:44:23,783 --> 00:44:26,213
so I studied literature in university.

770
00:44:26,544 --> 00:44:29,984
The more I learned, the more
daunting my dream became.

771
00:44:30,584 --> 00:44:33,654
I considered trying
to become a teacher,

772
00:44:35,024 --> 00:44:37,194
but on my pre-graduation trip...

773
00:44:37,964 --> 00:44:39,594
I dream of...

774
00:44:40,664 --> 00:44:42,994
Becoming a drama scriptwriter.

775
00:44:44,604 --> 00:44:46,904
But I feel too overwhelmed to start.

776
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:53,443
It's the first time I voiced
what I always thought.

777
00:44:54,073 --> 00:44:56,073
I was too timid to even talk about it.

778
00:44:56,414 --> 00:44:59,284
Why do you need the courage
to say something you want?

779
00:44:59,984 --> 00:45:02,414
How can you achieve your dream
if you can't say what it is?

780
00:45:04,323 --> 00:45:05,523
Say it to me.

781
00:45:06,624 --> 00:45:09,124
My dream is to become
a drama screenwriter.

782
00:45:10,923 --> 00:45:12,623
My dream is to become
a drama screenwriter.

783
00:45:12,624 --> 00:45:15,564
That's it. You should say
it aloud so it comes true.

784
00:45:17,533 --> 00:45:20,933
My dream is to become
a drama screenwriter.

785
00:45:25,803 --> 00:45:27,943
My dream is to become
a drama screenwriter!

786
00:45:27,944 --> 00:45:29,944
That's it!

787
00:45:30,613 --> 00:45:32,213
- Ms. writer.
- Yes?

788
00:45:33,513 --> 00:45:35,453
- Ms. oh the writer!
- Yes?

789
00:45:36,314 --> 00:45:38,854
Writer oh woo ri!

790
00:45:38,854 --> 00:45:39,954
Yes?

791
00:45:58,544 --> 00:46:01,914
There was something I'd
never done in my life.

792
00:46:02,644 --> 00:46:06,344
I found the courage to do it
on my pre-graduation trip.

793
00:46:08,254 --> 00:46:11,854
That's when I started to
try to work as a writer.

794
00:46:12,453 --> 00:46:13,623
I see.

795
00:46:17,694 --> 00:46:20,094
To the person who gave me the courage,

796
00:46:20,964 --> 00:46:23,134
I'm thankful, even now.

797
00:46:25,434 --> 00:46:26,764
Look at the monitor.

798
00:46:28,173 --> 00:46:30,843
It's too soon to hear a heartbeat.

799
00:46:31,303 --> 00:46:34,143
What you see here is the baby.

800
00:46:34,774 --> 00:46:36,874
It's the size of a gummy bear.

801
00:46:39,914 --> 00:46:42,984
It's so tiny.

802
00:46:44,383 --> 00:46:47,553
Hello, gummy bear.

803
00:46:52,823 --> 00:46:55,163
How many times must I tell you?

804
00:46:55,164 --> 00:46:56,634
It's fine.

805
00:46:58,564 --> 00:46:59,604
Okay.

806
00:46:59,934 --> 00:47:02,634
Doesn't it feel weird knowing
they're in there alone?

807
00:47:03,403 --> 00:47:05,073
I feel strange too.

808
00:47:07,774 --> 00:47:09,244
I did a lot of thinking,

809
00:47:10,044 --> 00:47:11,244
and I changed my mind.

810
00:47:13,144 --> 00:47:14,314
I'll report it.

811
00:47:15,414 --> 00:47:16,454
What?

812
00:47:19,423 --> 00:47:20,753
Are you crazy?

813
00:47:21,593 --> 00:47:23,023
You'll raise someone else's baby?

814
00:47:24,294 --> 00:47:25,294
Ma ri!

815
00:47:25,823 --> 00:47:27,293
Yes, father?

816
00:47:28,164 --> 00:47:30,264
Chairman Lee's wife called.

817
00:47:30,263 --> 00:47:31,533
Is there more to be done?

818
00:47:31,533 --> 00:47:34,933
I got her another nose
job done last week.

819
00:47:35,104 --> 00:47:38,944
The baby seems to be
so healthy and cute.

820
00:47:39,073 --> 00:47:41,543
The mother's healthy too.

821
00:47:41,544 --> 00:47:43,514
Isn't that just great?

822
00:47:43,513 --> 00:47:44,843
Watch your footing on the steps.

823
00:47:44,843 --> 00:47:46,543
There are steps. Be careful.

824
00:47:47,914 --> 00:47:49,484
That's it. Take your time.

825
00:47:49,883 --> 00:47:52,153
We're almost there.

826
00:47:54,093 --> 00:47:55,423
She's my fiancee.

827
00:47:55,794 --> 00:47:56,994
She has my baby.

828
00:48:00,794 --> 00:48:02,634
What are you two doing?

829
00:48:03,334 --> 00:48:05,104
They're just steps. I can manage.

830
00:48:12,544 --> 00:48:15,474
Oh, dear. What's this now?

831
00:48:15,473 --> 00:48:18,613
I went against your order and
looked into no man chul.

832
00:48:19,414 --> 00:48:21,484
No man chul's mistress...

833
00:48:21,814 --> 00:48:23,514
Is a team leader at a
medical foundation,

834
00:48:24,484 --> 00:48:26,154
and the wife of a
cosmetics company CEO.

835
00:48:26,153 --> 00:48:27,193
What?

836
00:48:30,694 --> 00:48:32,064
Why are you bringing me this now?

837
00:48:32,323 --> 00:48:35,993
I apologize. I didn't report it.

838
00:48:35,993 --> 00:48:37,233
Are you out of your mind?

839
00:48:39,664 --> 00:48:41,234
Lee ma ri's clean.

840
00:48:41,374 --> 00:48:43,234
But a detective has a hunch.

841
00:48:44,073 --> 00:48:46,503
It was clearly chairman Kim,
but it looks like an affair...

842
00:48:50,613 --> 00:48:53,483
I apologize. I made the wrong call.

843
00:48:53,584 --> 00:48:55,384
I want a written account from you.

844
00:48:56,283 --> 00:48:59,023
The rest to the meeting room.
We'll start over.

845
00:49:03,223 --> 00:49:04,263
What is it?

846
00:49:06,024 --> 00:49:07,064
Here.

847
00:49:09,334 --> 00:49:10,704
Divorce papers?

848
00:49:12,403 --> 00:49:14,273
Why did you call me to the hospital?

849
00:49:14,504 --> 00:49:16,134
Hadn't you changed your mind?

850
00:49:17,444 --> 00:49:20,144
Didn't you hear oh woo ri say we
can't have the baby if we split?

851
00:49:20,144 --> 00:49:21,214
Look inside.

852
00:49:28,684 --> 00:49:31,584
It's the size of a gummy bear.

853
00:49:33,484 --> 00:49:35,354
Seeing it made me think.

854
00:49:35,923 --> 00:49:39,523
I still can't forgive
you for what you did.

855
00:49:39,863 --> 00:49:42,063
But for the baby's sake...

856
00:49:43,633 --> 00:49:47,403
Thank you! Thank you, darling!

857
00:49:53,004 --> 00:49:55,574
How does it feel to be a mom?

858
00:49:56,973 --> 00:49:58,213
A mom?

859
00:49:59,743 --> 00:50:00,983
Why?

860
00:50:02,184 --> 00:50:05,554
What is it? Are you that emotional?

861
00:50:06,254 --> 00:50:09,224
There will be many more
things to be emotional about.

862
00:50:09,923 --> 00:50:11,323
What should I do?

863
00:50:12,423 --> 00:50:13,463
About what?

864
00:50:15,164 --> 00:50:16,964
It wasn't a mallet.

865
00:50:18,263 --> 00:50:19,433
What do you mean?

866
00:50:21,374 --> 00:50:23,504
It's a baby, not a mallet.

867
00:50:26,073 --> 00:50:28,713
It's not an object I can give away.

868
00:50:29,214 --> 00:50:32,084
I feel stupid for thinking that way.

869
00:50:34,453 --> 00:50:35,753
To be honest,

870
00:50:36,053 --> 00:50:38,353
I wasn't in my right mind
for the past few days.

871
00:50:39,323 --> 00:50:43,023
To see if it was right to
send it to a good home,

872
00:50:43,323 --> 00:50:45,493
I did all sorts of things.

873
00:50:47,434 --> 00:50:50,864
I feel this way because of something
the size of a fingernail.

874
00:50:52,664 --> 00:50:54,904
I can't imagine how I'll feel...

875
00:50:54,903 --> 00:50:57,503
After I give birth after nine months.

876
00:51:01,214 --> 00:51:02,814
You're right.

877
00:51:03,444 --> 00:51:04,614
You were right...

878
00:51:05,814 --> 00:51:10,624
About how I'd feel about
giving the baby away.

879
00:51:11,423 --> 00:51:12,583
I really...

880
00:51:13,754 --> 00:51:16,024
Didn't think it would be this hard.

881
00:51:20,394 --> 00:51:21,734
The truth is,

882
00:51:23,234 --> 00:51:25,164
and I haven't told anyone,

883
00:51:27,303 --> 00:51:30,433
but when I look at this
photo, I get so scared.

884
00:51:34,843 --> 00:51:35,973
It's okay.

885
00:51:36,144 --> 00:51:38,444
It'll be okay, woo ri.

886
00:51:40,013 --> 00:51:41,813
You made this choice,

887
00:51:42,684 --> 00:51:44,624
and whatever other choices you make,

888
00:51:45,423 --> 00:51:47,923
I will support you now.

889
00:51:49,624 --> 00:51:51,724
That's what your grandma did for me.

890
00:51:52,964 --> 00:51:54,164
Yes.

891
00:51:54,564 --> 00:51:55,934
I'll do it for you too.

892
00:51:57,294 --> 00:52:00,164
I really don't know, mom.

893
00:52:02,504 --> 00:52:07,044
It doesn't mean I found
the courage to raise it.

894
00:52:07,914 --> 00:52:09,874
I'm just so scared.

895
00:52:10,343 --> 00:52:12,913
I just don't know anything.

896
00:52:15,383 --> 00:52:17,013
It's okay, woo ri.

897
00:52:18,423 --> 00:52:20,153
I don't know anything either.

898
00:52:20,754 --> 00:52:22,994
When eun ran had you,

899
00:52:22,993 --> 00:52:24,963
and now that you have this baby,

900
00:52:25,263 --> 00:52:28,163
I didn't know then, and I
still don't know what to do.

901
00:52:28,633 --> 00:52:29,963
Let's just...

902
00:52:30,133 --> 00:52:33,163
Solve one piece of homework
that we're given at a time.

903
00:52:33,664 --> 00:52:36,634
No one knows if our
answer is right or wrong.

904
00:52:37,444 --> 00:52:41,074
Let's just do our best to solve it.

905
00:52:54,823 --> 00:52:57,193
You can't cover the sky with one hand.

906
00:52:59,394 --> 00:53:00,424
As a father,

907
00:53:01,464 --> 00:53:03,164
you must protect your family.

908
00:53:04,664 --> 00:53:05,804
The truth no longer...

909
00:53:10,803 --> 00:53:11,943
No longer what?

910
00:53:12,774 --> 00:53:13,904
What is it now?

911
00:53:13,903 --> 00:53:15,673
What's the matter with him these days?

912
00:53:16,513 --> 00:53:18,083
Why is he talking nonsense?

913
00:53:19,684 --> 00:53:20,784
The truth...

914
00:53:21,584 --> 00:53:23,054
Cut!

915
00:53:24,823 --> 00:53:26,353
Are you all right?

916
00:53:26,354 --> 00:53:27,954
You must do another take.

917
00:53:28,223 --> 00:53:31,493
Use the clip we just took
and wrap up for the day.

918
00:53:31,823 --> 00:53:33,563
I must be somewhere.

919
00:53:33,723 --> 00:53:36,033
We have to shoot today's quota.

920
00:53:36,633 --> 00:53:38,703
You're doing great. I'll buy you wine.

921
00:53:39,803 --> 00:53:41,633
Sung il!

922
00:53:43,274 --> 00:53:45,004
Will someone go after him?

923
00:53:47,004 --> 00:53:49,174
You can't cover the sky with one hand.

924
00:53:49,814 --> 00:53:51,514
I must tell my daughter that.

925
00:53:51,584 --> 00:53:52,884
You can't.

926
00:53:52,883 --> 00:53:54,853
She's too worked up.

927
00:53:54,854 --> 00:53:56,014
She's struggling.

928
00:53:56,013 --> 00:53:57,723
Why is she struggling?

929
00:53:57,723 --> 00:53:59,153
Tell me that at least.

930
00:53:59,153 --> 00:54:01,693
I might end up dying first.

931
00:54:02,493 --> 00:54:03,723
Woo ri.

932
00:54:03,723 --> 00:54:05,093
I'm your father.

933
00:54:05,464 --> 00:54:06,894
I must tell her now.

934
00:54:07,024 --> 00:54:08,364
Eun ran.

935
00:54:08,363 --> 00:54:10,633
It's not recycling day today.

936
00:54:10,834 --> 00:54:13,234
- Why is this out here?
- Hide.

937
00:54:13,303 --> 00:54:14,773
Hide, quick.

938
00:54:15,234 --> 00:54:16,574
There's something more valuable.

939
00:54:16,573 --> 00:54:17,673
Eun ran?

940
00:54:18,673 --> 00:54:22,273
- More valuable than revenge.
- Wasn't she just here?

941
00:54:22,814 --> 00:54:24,784
Oh? "Mask of desire" is on.

942
00:54:24,783 --> 00:54:26,143
I missed yesterday's episode.

943
00:54:28,513 --> 00:54:29,713
Duk chil.

944
00:54:29,714 --> 00:54:31,424
You're overly excited.

945
00:54:31,423 --> 00:54:32,523
Here.

946
00:54:32,953 --> 00:54:34,493
Look into my eyes.

947
00:54:34,723 --> 00:54:35,993
Take a deep breath in.

948
00:54:36,124 --> 00:54:38,224
Breathe in, breathe out.

949
00:54:38,223 --> 00:54:39,763
Breathe in, breathe out.

950
00:54:39,763 --> 00:54:41,033
That's it.

951
00:54:41,533 --> 00:54:42,663
Good.

952
00:54:43,263 --> 00:54:44,863
Why are you so pretty today?

953
00:54:45,564 --> 00:54:46,764
What?

954
00:54:46,903 --> 00:54:47,973
You...

955
00:54:48,104 --> 00:54:49,504
How old are you now?

956
00:54:51,144 --> 00:54:52,744
We're the same age.

957
00:54:52,903 --> 00:54:54,073
Oh, right.

958
00:54:55,874 --> 00:54:57,074
But you're still...

959
00:54:59,684 --> 00:55:00,884
The young eun ran...

960
00:55:01,453 --> 00:55:03,083
I knew.

961
00:55:04,923 --> 00:55:06,083
Duk chil.

962
00:55:07,553 --> 00:55:08,823
How come...

963
00:55:09,723 --> 00:55:11,123
You look the same?

964
00:55:12,564 --> 00:55:14,124
It's unbelievable.

965
00:55:15,694 --> 00:55:17,534
Oh, no. What are they doing?

966
00:55:17,664 --> 00:55:20,104
Shouldn't they not be doing that?

967
00:55:23,673 --> 00:55:24,873
Eun ran!

968
00:55:24,973 --> 00:55:27,773
Eun ran! Choi sung il's kissing!

969
00:55:45,593 --> 00:55:47,363
The CEO and his wife asked to meet?

970
00:55:48,033 --> 00:55:49,163
Yes.

971
00:55:49,593 --> 00:55:51,703
It was always chaotic when we met.

972
00:55:52,004 --> 00:55:54,134
We'll have to stay in touch,

973
00:55:54,573 --> 00:55:57,943
and I think it would be
nice to meet them formally.

974
00:55:58,144 --> 00:55:59,844
The CEO.

975
00:56:00,144 --> 00:56:01,714
His real name is Kim bok rae.

976
00:56:02,414 --> 00:56:04,844
- Did you know that?
- What? No, I didn't.

977
00:56:09,653 --> 00:56:10,883
No, I knew.

978
00:56:11,823 --> 00:56:13,723
We agreed not to lie.

979
00:56:14,593 --> 00:56:15,793
What?

980
00:56:16,694 --> 00:56:19,464
There's something I didn't tell you.

981
00:56:20,164 --> 00:56:21,364
What is it?

982
00:56:21,464 --> 00:56:22,664
Well...

983
00:56:22,763 --> 00:56:24,963
Remember when I told you about...

984
00:56:25,564 --> 00:56:28,734
The guy I shared my first
kiss with by the east sea...

985
00:56:28,734 --> 00:56:31,244
On my pre-graduation trip?

986
00:56:41,613 --> 00:56:43,983
Is that guy this Kim bok rae?

987
00:56:44,854 --> 00:56:46,884
Yes, it's him.

988
00:56:47,993 --> 00:56:50,123
I was really shocked to find out.

989
00:56:51,294 --> 00:56:52,494
My gosh.

990
00:56:53,394 --> 00:56:56,494
No wonder I felt uneasy
whenever he was around.

991
00:56:56,633 --> 00:56:58,263
Sorry for not telling you.

992
00:56:58,263 --> 00:56:59,603
No, don't be.

993
00:56:59,604 --> 00:57:01,134
Why should you apologize?

994
00:57:02,303 --> 00:57:03,473
What...

995
00:57:03,973 --> 00:57:05,103
Did he say?

996
00:57:05,203 --> 00:57:06,543
He doesn't recognize me.

997
00:57:06,803 --> 00:57:08,473
That was a few years back,

998
00:57:08,473 --> 00:57:09,913
and it was a fleeting thing.

999
00:57:10,613 --> 00:57:11,943
It happens.

1000
00:57:13,883 --> 00:57:15,113
Kang jae.

1001
00:57:15,584 --> 00:57:17,154
You're not angry, are you?

1002
00:57:17,383 --> 00:57:18,753
Why would I be?

1003
00:57:19,124 --> 00:57:20,524
Not at all.

1004
00:57:21,524 --> 00:57:22,754
I feel fine.

1005
00:57:23,823 --> 00:57:25,723
Yes. I feel fine.

1006
00:57:26,464 --> 00:57:27,664
I feel fine.

1007
00:57:29,694 --> 00:57:31,664
Woo ri and that detective.

1008
00:57:32,564 --> 00:57:35,104
Her fiance. Are we
meeting just those two?

1009
00:57:35,234 --> 00:57:37,774
Yes. I thought we should meet properly.

1010
00:57:39,044 --> 00:57:40,574
I'm not sure about the detective,

1011
00:57:41,444 --> 00:57:43,274
but we'll see woo ri often.

1012
00:57:44,274 --> 00:57:45,844
- Ma ri.
- Yes?

1013
00:57:46,013 --> 00:57:48,053
Don't call her woo ri.

1014
00:57:49,414 --> 00:57:50,884
Call her Ms. oh.

1015
00:57:52,024 --> 00:57:54,454
The drama crew calls her by her name.

1016
00:57:54,854 --> 00:57:56,294
She's just an assistant writer.

1017
00:57:56,694 --> 00:57:59,264
Still, we should call her Ms. oh.

1018
00:58:00,593 --> 00:58:01,893
Okay.

1019
00:58:01,894 --> 00:58:03,264
Ms. oh.

1020
00:58:06,234 --> 00:58:07,334
Good.

1021
00:58:08,073 --> 00:58:09,233
Ms. oh.

1022
00:58:12,774 --> 00:58:14,044
Writer oh woo ri!

1023
00:58:14,044 --> 00:58:15,244
Yes?

1024
00:58:15,843 --> 00:58:18,413
Writer oh woo ri!

1025
00:58:19,544 --> 00:58:20,744
Yes?

1026
00:58:28,453 --> 00:58:29,623
Shoot!

1027
00:58:30,854 --> 00:58:32,364
What is it?

1028
00:58:34,734 --> 00:58:36,294
What's wrong with you?

1029
00:58:42,533 --> 00:58:43,673
Sir.

1030
00:58:44,033 --> 00:58:46,403
Were you at a beach by the east sea?

1031
00:58:47,973 --> 00:58:49,113
What?

1032
00:58:50,513 --> 00:58:51,883
We met, didn't we?

1033
00:59:31,354 --> 00:59:33,224
Don't open the email!

1034
00:59:33,323 --> 00:59:34,523
There was a letter.

1035
00:59:34,524 --> 00:59:36,854
I didn't know you wanted to
get to know me so badly.

1036
00:59:37,453 --> 00:59:38,663
Let's get divorced.

1037
00:59:38,694 --> 00:59:40,794
What if she doesn't give you the baby?

1038
00:59:41,024 --> 00:59:42,234
I'll protect you.

1039
00:59:42,394 --> 00:59:43,794
I can't tell woo ri.

1040
00:59:43,794 --> 00:59:46,264
How shocked would she be to
know choi sung il's her dad?

1041
00:59:46,464 --> 00:59:48,334
Can we chat?

1042
00:59:49,104 --> 00:59:50,374
You're leaving? Just like that?

1043
00:59:50,374 --> 00:59:52,144
- Is it Raphael?
- Yes.

1044
00:59:52,243 --> 00:59:54,743
Would it be easy to date a woman
carrying another man's baby?

1045
00:59:54,914 --> 00:59:56,314
I don't mind at all.

1046
00:59:56,444 --> 00:59:57,744
Let's...

1047
00:59:57,914 --> 00:59:59,214
Sleep together.
