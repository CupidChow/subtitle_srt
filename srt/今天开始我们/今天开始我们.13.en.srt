00:00:05,406 --> 00:00:07,265
(Episode 13)

2
00:00:08,594 --> 00:00:09,854
- Date me! - Date me, please!

3
00:00:14,263 --> 00:00:15,563
- Here... - Hey.

4
00:00:15,564 --> 00:00:17,792
Put that ring away. I brought one too.

5
00:00:17,793 --> 00:00:19,133
Should I take it out now?

6
00:00:19,134 --> 00:00:20,903
We were talking. Must you barge in like this?

7
00:00:20,963 --> 00:00:22,533
Have some manners.

8
00:00:22,534 --> 00:00:25,072
Did you really have to drag her out in the middle of eating?

9
00:00:25,073 --> 00:00:26,204
Gosh, stop!

10
00:00:26,674 --> 00:00:29,012
What are you two doing right now?

11
00:00:29,013 --> 00:00:31,043
What's happening in the middle of dinner?

12
00:00:31,414 --> 00:00:34,284
Kang Jae, why did you run out in the middle of dinner?

13
00:00:34,344 --> 00:00:35,914
He said he wanted to talk to Woo Ri.

14
00:00:36,284 --> 00:00:37,752
Raphael, you should've waited.

15
00:00:37,753 --> 00:00:39,684
What were you thinking, following them out?

16
00:00:40,124 --> 00:00:42,022
Mom, Grandma.

17
00:00:42,023 --> 00:00:43,352
No, stop.

18
00:00:43,353 --> 00:00:45,124
Calm down. It's okay.

19
00:00:45,523 --> 00:00:48,094
This is all a sign that great things are ahead of us.

20
00:00:49,594 --> 00:00:51,603
Mother, Eun Ran.

21
00:00:52,363 --> 00:00:53,603
That's enough.

22
00:00:56,234 --> 00:00:58,103
Raphael, Detective Lee.

23
00:00:58,844 --> 00:01:00,143
Drop it, okay?

24
00:01:00,973 --> 00:01:03,574
Yes. Sorry for causing a commotion.

25
00:01:07,044 --> 00:01:08,613
You're the father of the baby.

26
00:01:08,753 --> 00:01:12,023
We'll make the right decision for the sake of the baby.

27
00:01:12,454 --> 00:01:14,283
You truly love my granddaughter, right?

28
00:01:14,284 --> 00:01:16,523
Of course. Even in the past, I always loved her.

29
00:01:17,023 --> 00:01:20,294
I'm even more sure of it now that we've spent some time apart.

30
00:01:20,764 --> 00:01:22,362
My feelings for her have never once changed.

31
00:01:22,363 --> 00:01:24,464
Okay, good. I'm on your side.

32
00:01:24,764 --> 00:01:26,703
I'll give you all the support you need.

33
00:01:26,704 --> 00:01:29,874
Thank you. Seeing how much you trust me...

34
00:01:30,534 --> 00:01:31,873
makes me feel so supported.

35
00:01:31,874 --> 00:01:34,243
Let's make sure that our team wins no matter what.

36
00:01:34,943 --> 00:01:36,243
- Okay? - Yes.

37
00:01:36,514 --> 00:01:38,073
With your coaching and guidance,

38
00:01:38,074 --> 00:01:39,913
I'll be sure to win.

39
00:01:40,583 --> 00:01:41,853
I trust that you'll win.

40
00:01:42,253 --> 00:01:43,883
How about a cheer to lift our spirits?

41
00:01:44,013 --> 00:01:45,553
In 1, 2, 3.

42
00:01:45,554 --> 00:01:46,653
- We got this! - We got this!

43
00:01:46,654 --> 00:01:48,154
(Seo Gwi Nyeo's Pork Cutlet)

44
00:01:49,193 --> 00:01:51,822
Mom, Grandma! Get back inside already.

45
00:01:51,823 --> 00:01:53,024
Okay, I'm coming.

46
00:01:55,633 --> 00:01:56,763
- You got this! - Thank you.

47
00:01:57,864 --> 00:01:59,364
(Seo Gwi Nyeo's Pork Cutlet)

48
00:01:59,834 --> 00:02:01,434
- Mom, seriously! - I'm going back inside.

49
00:02:05,904 --> 00:02:08,744
Woo Ri, congratulations on becoming the main writer of the drama.

50
00:02:10,573 --> 00:02:11,784
Congratulations.

51
00:02:32,763 --> 00:02:35,003
Which man should Ji Dok Sa choose?

52
00:02:35,103 --> 00:02:36,834
Chun Sa Da? Na Beom In?

53
00:02:38,003 --> 00:02:39,774
Who should she choose?

54
00:02:43,244 --> 00:02:44,443
The beginning of that dilemma.

55
00:02:48,043 --> 00:02:49,184
The very first scene!

56
00:02:57,793 --> 00:02:58,823
Hey, Kang Jae.

57
00:02:59,263 --> 00:03:01,524
I stopped by hoping we could have a quick chat.

58
00:03:02,763 --> 00:03:03,864
Are you busy right now?

59
00:03:04,464 --> 00:03:05,703
Do you want a cup of tea?

60
00:03:06,203 --> 00:03:08,064
No, I'll be leaving in a minute.

61
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:13,344
Well... Woo Ri.

62
00:03:14,203 --> 00:03:15,513
I'm sorry about yesterday.

63
00:03:16,374 --> 00:03:18,413
For showing up for the dinner without even telling you.

64
00:03:18,844 --> 00:03:20,814
No, it's fine.

65
00:03:22,714 --> 00:03:23,883
Woo Ri.

66
00:03:24,353 --> 00:03:26,853
I did a lot of thinking while spending some time apart from you.

67
00:03:27,983 --> 00:03:30,223
You know, the things you said to me when you broke up with me.

68
00:03:31,423 --> 00:03:32,864
Looking back now,

69
00:03:33,263 --> 00:03:36,394
I realize that you didn't really mean those words.

70
00:03:38,663 --> 00:03:40,934
You just didn't want to put that burden on me.

71
00:03:43,103 --> 00:03:44,304
Kang Jae.

72
00:03:44,503 --> 00:03:47,804
At the time, I thought you were better off without me.

73
00:03:49,114 --> 00:03:50,673
And I've realized that I was wrong.

74
00:03:54,584 --> 00:03:55,714
I want to...

75
00:03:57,683 --> 00:03:59,123
start over with you.

76
00:04:03,194 --> 00:04:04,993
But I'm...

77
00:04:06,063 --> 00:04:07,394
- The thing is... - Hey.

78
00:04:07,563 --> 00:04:09,594
I don't expect you to give me your answer right now.

79
00:04:10,733 --> 00:04:12,663
Think about it and let me know.

80
00:04:15,873 --> 00:04:17,433
Congratulations on becoming the main writer.

81
00:04:18,743 --> 00:04:21,173
Finally, you're one step closer to making your dream come true.

82
00:04:22,214 --> 00:04:23,313
Bye, I'm off.

83
00:04:49,103 --> 00:04:51,034
Raphael, what brings you by?

84
00:04:51,603 --> 00:04:52,904
Did you not run into anyone you know?

85
00:04:53,673 --> 00:04:55,344
What? Who?

86
00:04:58,913 --> 00:05:00,042
You must be busy.

87
00:05:00,043 --> 00:05:01,784
Don't offer me coffee. I'm good.

88
00:05:02,214 --> 00:05:03,754
Oh, okay.

89
00:05:06,454 --> 00:05:08,254
I thought long and hard...

90
00:05:08,654 --> 00:05:10,654
and went to the dinner last night because I wanted to talk,

91
00:05:11,324 --> 00:05:13,263
but I never got to say what I wanted to say...

92
00:05:13,264 --> 00:05:14,563
and ended up causing trouble.

93
00:05:15,394 --> 00:05:16,533
I'm sorry.

94
00:05:16,534 --> 00:05:18,063
No, don't be.

95
00:05:19,264 --> 00:05:21,004
I'm sorry, Woo Ri.

96
00:05:21,873 --> 00:05:24,103
I was rushing to get married.

97
00:05:24,334 --> 00:05:26,144
Because of that, we broke up.

98
00:05:26,803 --> 00:05:28,144
For that, I apologize.

99
00:05:28,743 --> 00:05:30,843
I'll never ignore your opinion...

100
00:05:30,844 --> 00:05:33,584
and push ahead with what I want to do.

101
00:05:34,144 --> 00:05:35,683
I've pledged myself to it.

102
00:05:36,613 --> 00:05:37,784
So...

103
00:05:41,524 --> 00:05:42,694
let's get back together.

104
00:05:44,454 --> 00:05:47,123
- Well, that's... - Right, I get it.

105
00:05:47,394 --> 00:05:49,733
I won't rush you.

106
00:05:50,034 --> 00:05:51,562
I'll give you plenty of time to think...

107
00:05:51,563 --> 00:05:53,063
and wait until you decide.

108
00:06:03,074 --> 00:06:04,473
You haven't had lunch yet, right?

109
00:06:04,944 --> 00:06:07,644
I know the face you make when you're hungry.

110
00:06:10,183 --> 00:06:11,384
What?

111
00:06:28,778 --> 00:06:29,978
Ms. Yu.

112
00:06:31,278 --> 00:06:32,848
Ms. Yu, are you all right?

113
00:06:33,148 --> 00:06:34,189
Hey.

114
00:06:34,989 --> 00:06:36,318
Why are you here?

115
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:38,319
Aren't you busy? You have to work on the script.

116
00:06:40,059 --> 00:06:41,189
I know, I should.

117
00:06:42,829 --> 00:06:44,259
But I feel stuck.

118
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:47,329
Hey. I can't type right now, but I can still talk.

119
00:06:47,728 --> 00:06:49,569
Which part? Where are you stuck?

120
00:06:49,799 --> 00:06:51,097
The part where Chun Sa Da and Na Beom In...

121
00:06:51,098 --> 00:06:53,569
are trying to impress Ji Dok Sa.

122
00:06:53,739 --> 00:06:55,478
I'm having trouble coming up with the details.

123
00:06:55,778 --> 00:06:58,579
Hey, you can just hash it out based on your experience.

124
00:06:59,478 --> 00:07:00,647
Based on my experience?

125
00:07:00,648 --> 00:07:04,148
What's the difference between Kang Jae and Raphael?

126
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:07,949
- The difference? - Kang Jae is...

127
00:07:08,348 --> 00:07:09,558
always there for you.

128
00:07:09,559 --> 00:07:12,658
He's the loyal, faithful type who is always sweet to you.

129
00:07:12,829 --> 00:07:14,088
Use him as a model for Chun Sa Da.

130
00:07:14,158 --> 00:07:15,929
On the other hand, Raphael is very charming.

131
00:07:16,598 --> 00:07:19,027
And he knows exactly what the ladies want.

132
00:07:19,028 --> 00:07:21,429
Use him as a model for Na Beom In. Then you're set!

133
00:07:21,799 --> 00:07:23,069
How easy is that?

134
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:26,138
I get the idea.

135
00:07:26,139 --> 00:07:27,968
Now, you're good, right? Then go work on the script.

136
00:07:30,278 --> 00:07:31,538
Ms. Yu.

137
00:07:33,949 --> 00:07:35,918
I can't focus because I have too much on my mind.

138
00:07:37,518 --> 00:07:38,718
Why? What's wrong?

139
00:07:39,218 --> 00:07:41,348
Is it because of Raphael? What's going on?

140
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,559
He took care of the reason we broke up.

141
00:07:45,528 --> 00:07:46,829
He wants to start over.

142
00:07:47,358 --> 00:07:50,758
Good. Just get back together with him. What's the problem?

143
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:54,629
The problem is that Kang Jae also took care of the reason we broke up,

144
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:56,698
and he wants to start over.

145
00:07:56,699 --> 00:07:59,238
What the fudge...

146
00:07:59,239 --> 00:08:01,268
Hey, what is this?

147
00:08:01,569 --> 00:08:03,739
Hey, this is like those crazy soap operas, but in real life.

148
00:08:04,679 --> 00:08:08,449
So you're torn because you can't choose?

149
00:08:09,549 --> 00:08:11,578
No, never mind.

150
00:08:11,579 --> 00:08:13,848
There's a thing called priority, you know?

151
00:08:14,149 --> 00:08:15,789
I'll focus on finishing the script first.

152
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:17,918
I'll think about this problem later.

153
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,857
Hey, those two men must be devastated right now.

154
00:08:20,858 --> 00:08:23,429
This is about your future. You can't prioritize work over this.

155
00:08:23,799 --> 00:08:25,159
You must decide as soon as possible...

156
00:08:25,468 --> 00:08:27,429
Ms. Yu, are you all right?

157
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:30,098
Decide soon,

158
00:08:30,769 --> 00:08:32,909
or things will get even worse.

159
00:08:49,189 --> 00:08:51,358
Kang Jae is always there for you.

160
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:54,789
He's the loyal, faithful type who is always sweet to you.

161
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:56,699
Use him as a model for Chun Sa Da.

162
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:02,338
The things Kang Jae did for me when we were together...

163
00:09:32,769 --> 00:09:35,939
Eun Ran, I told you to check the temperature of the oil.

164
00:09:36,468 --> 00:09:39,039
This will burn the batter while leaving the meat undercooked.

165
00:09:39,409 --> 00:09:41,039
I'm trying to make cheese cutlets.

166
00:09:41,669 --> 00:09:43,878
Our customers won't like that.

167
00:09:44,108 --> 00:09:46,649
Now that it has a new owner, the menu should change too.

168
00:09:47,449 --> 00:09:50,819
Mom, how about I start a karaoke lounge here?

169
00:09:50,919 --> 00:09:52,587
A karaoke lounge run by a singing instructor.

170
00:09:52,588 --> 00:09:54,449
What do you think? Isn't it a good idea?

171
00:09:54,549 --> 00:09:55,789
Hey, seriously!

172
00:09:55,858 --> 00:09:58,058
Hey, Eun Ran. Mother!

173
00:09:58,059 --> 00:10:00,458
Actor Choi! Come on in.

174
00:10:00,789 --> 00:10:02,127
You said you wanted to talk to me.

175
00:10:02,128 --> 00:10:04,757
That's right. It's about Woo Ri and the father of the baby.

176
00:10:04,758 --> 00:10:06,899
Let's help them so they can work things out.

177
00:10:07,128 --> 00:10:09,967
Mom, they broke up.

178
00:10:09,968 --> 00:10:12,269
She should get back together with Kang Jae.

179
00:10:12,638 --> 00:10:15,207
Well, that's something she should decide.

180
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:17,678
I don't think we can meddle in her decision.

181
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:19,347
Come on, Actor Choi. What's gotten into you?

182
00:10:19,348 --> 00:10:21,477
Her future depends on this decision,

183
00:10:21,478 --> 00:10:23,048
so we must make sure she makes a wise choice.

184
00:10:23,049 --> 00:10:25,148
I've only met Detective Lee a few times,

185
00:10:25,149 --> 00:10:27,288
so I barely had a chance to speak with him.

186
00:10:27,289 --> 00:10:29,688
But I've met Raphael a bunch of times.

187
00:10:29,689 --> 00:10:31,257
He's a really good guy.

188
00:10:31,258 --> 00:10:34,087
Right? So you're taking our side, aren't you?

189
00:10:34,088 --> 00:10:35,758
That I'm not sure about.

190
00:10:36,329 --> 00:10:39,169
Hey, you said you were starting some kind of detective movie.

191
00:10:39,429 --> 00:10:41,128
That's right. The filming will begin soon.

192
00:10:41,199 --> 00:10:44,097
Perfect. Kang Jae is a homicide detective, you know.

193
00:10:44,098 --> 00:10:46,008
You can interview him and his colleagues.

194
00:10:46,169 --> 00:10:47,237
It'll be very helpful.

195
00:10:47,238 --> 00:10:49,977
- I'll let him know. - I'd really appreciate that.

196
00:10:49,978 --> 00:10:52,078
You see, Kang Jae is such a wonderful guy.

197
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,208
Such a faithful, patient man is hard to come by these days.

198
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:56,579
That's why he and Woo Ri make such a perfect couple.

199
00:10:56,718 --> 00:11:00,348
Raphael isn't right for her. You understand, right?

200
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:06,059
Well, I'm busy. I have to go.

201
00:11:07,628 --> 00:11:09,929
Wait, Actor Choi!

202
00:11:16,269 --> 00:11:17,299
Gosh.

203
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:30,949
On the other hand, Raphael is very charming.

204
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:34,248
And he knows exactly what the ladies want.

205
00:11:34,949 --> 00:11:36,659
Use him as a model for Na Beom In.

206
00:11:38,789 --> 00:11:40,958
The things that Raphael and I did together.

207
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:45,998
My gosh, I thought...

208
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:15,429
Okay. Detective Lee, I want to get to know you better...

209
00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:17,858
so Woo Ri can open up to me.

210
00:12:18,829 --> 00:12:21,269
I think she's still uncomfortable around me.

211
00:12:21,368 --> 00:12:23,098
She still calls me "Mr. Choi".

212
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:25,138
She never calls me Dad.

213
00:12:27,569 --> 00:12:31,779
Well, it takes her a while to open up to people.

214
00:12:32,508 --> 00:12:34,549
But once she does, you're in her life forever. So don't worry.

215
00:12:35,348 --> 00:12:38,748
I'll help you so you and Woo Ri can get closer soon.

216
00:12:38,819 --> 00:12:39,919
Don't you worry!

217
00:12:40,988 --> 00:12:44,418
Detective Lee, I know that I can totally count on you.

218
00:12:44,419 --> 00:12:47,088
Maybe I should help you too, so you and Woo Ri...

219
00:12:47,628 --> 00:12:49,457
can get back together.

220
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:50,658
I'd love that.

221
00:12:50,659 --> 00:12:53,698
Oh, my. Have you been working out?

222
00:12:53,699 --> 00:12:55,868
- Just a little. - Nice. Look at this.

223

(Diamond)

224
00:13:04,539 --> 00:13:05,708
I can make you...

225
00:13:06,108 --> 00:13:07,409
the chairwoman of the Diamond Medical Foundation.

226
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:11,049
What do you mean?

227
00:13:11,819 --> 00:13:14,148
My initial plan was to make the hospital mine...

228
00:13:14,149 --> 00:13:15,919
and take the position myself once Kim Duk Bae died,

229
00:13:16,988 --> 00:13:18,388
but my plan has been ruined.

230
00:13:19,289 --> 00:13:21,659
Everyone knows that I'm Chairman Kim now,

231
00:13:21,929 --> 00:13:23,529
so I need a puppet.

232
00:13:26,429 --> 00:13:27,699
And I like you.

233
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:29,467
Me?

234
00:13:29,468 --> 00:13:32,607
You wanted to con them into giving you a building,

235
00:13:32,608 --> 00:13:33,939
but it's all been ruined.

236
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:36,778
A random woman got pregnant and stole your husband from you.

237
00:13:36,779 --> 00:13:38,108
You must be fuming mad.

238
00:13:41,378 --> 00:13:42,718
You know everything.

239
00:13:46,319 --> 00:13:48,319
But how are we going to take the hospital from them?

Father? Why are you dressed like that?

251
00:14:24,218 --> 00:14:25,388
You're here.

252
00:14:27,529 --> 00:14:29,429
I wanted to see you before I left.

253
00:14:29,929 --> 00:14:32,428
Where are you going? Are you off to the gym?

254
00:14:32,429 --> 00:14:34,399
I'm friends with the monk in Mount Jiri, you know.

255
00:14:35,169 --> 00:14:37,899
I'll help out at the temple and stay there for the time being.

256
00:14:42,978 --> 00:14:45,179
This is all I need to live.

257
00:14:45,779 --> 00:14:48,348
I don't know why I was trying to clench onto all those things.

258
00:14:50,378 --> 00:14:52,987
What is this about? What has gotten into you?

259
00:14:52,988 --> 00:14:55,588
I did not want to surrender to the monster called poverty,

260
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:58,319
so I fought all my life...

261
00:15:00,029 --> 00:15:01,588
only to realize that I was a monster.

262
00:15:03,559 --> 00:15:04,699
Bok Rae.

263
00:15:05,899 --> 00:15:07,597
I told you to only use your English name, Raphael,

264
00:15:07,598 --> 00:15:09,868
so people in Gangnam wouldn't look down on you.

265
00:15:11,838 --> 00:15:14,208
You see, it's all useless.

266
00:15:16,179 --> 00:15:17,539
Seriously, what's with you?

267
00:15:18,409 --> 00:15:20,078
Did getting kidnapped and almost dying...

268
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:21,978
teach you how futile life really is?

269
00:15:23,049 --> 00:15:26,519
I know you'll come back soon, so don't overreact.

270
00:15:28,618 --> 00:15:32,659
And I really wanted to be the one telling you this.

271
00:15:35,388 --> 00:15:38,728
Ms. Im. I mean, Hyun Sook.

272
00:15:43,838 --> 00:15:45,169
She's your sister.

273
00:15:47,838 --> 00:15:49,939
- What? - Your mother had her...

274
00:15:51,079 --> 00:15:54,179
before she married me.

275
00:15:54,549 --> 00:15:56,247
When she married me,

276
00:15:56,248 --> 00:15:59,049
I abandoned her.

277
00:15:59,949 --> 00:16:01,819
I did such horrible things.

278
00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:06,429
I come from nothing.

279
00:16:08,789 --> 00:16:11,299
To build this huge hospital in Gangnam,

280
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:15,498
I practically did everything except for murder.

281
00:16:17,338 --> 00:16:18,998
In that process, she became a criminal...

282
00:16:20,169 --> 00:16:22,468
and killed people to get back at me.

283
00:16:23,508 --> 00:16:25,439
I wouldn't care if she were only after me,

284
00:16:27,108 --> 00:16:30,179
but I even put you and your child's mother in danger.

285
00:16:33,019 --> 00:16:36,858
My sins became a knife pointed at me.

286
00:16:44,198 --> 00:16:48,168
Do not forgive me, ever.

287
00:17:09,118 --> 00:17:11,088
Oh, Raphael.

288
00:17:12,858 --> 00:17:14,087
Are you done for the day?

289
00:17:14,088 --> 00:17:16,959
Yes. Why didn't you call me?

290
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:20,168
I didn't want to interrupt you while working, so I just waited here.

291
00:17:20,398 --> 00:17:23,269
I see. Did something happen?

292
00:17:23,938 --> 00:17:27,509
No, I just wanted to see you.

293
00:17:28,309 --> 00:17:31,338
When I see you, I get to see Bok Dol too.

294
00:17:31,878 --> 00:17:34,549
I wanted to see my family.

295
00:17:35,408 --> 00:17:37,579
I see.

296
00:17:39,588 --> 00:17:41,489
My father left today.

297
00:17:42,989 --> 00:17:45,289
He feels that he's lived his life wrong.

298
00:17:45,658 --> 00:17:47,529
I couldn't even stop him...

299
00:17:47,729 --> 00:17:49,529
because everything he said was right.

300
00:17:51,428 --> 00:17:52,628
Raphael.

301
00:17:55,428 --> 00:17:56,898
I told myself once again...

302
00:17:58,398 --> 00:18:01,408
that I will make sure my family is always happier than anyone else.

303
00:18:01,938 --> 00:18:04,979
You and our child, Bok Dol...

304
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:06,309
Woo Ri!

305
00:18:07,309 --> 00:18:08,948
What? Kang Jae.

306
00:18:11,418 --> 00:18:14,688
Sorry, but we're talking right now.

307
00:18:15,588 --> 00:18:17,019
Can we talk too?

308
00:18:17,358 --> 00:18:21,428
Woo Ri, your father came to see me. We had a long conversation.

309
00:18:21,989 --> 00:18:23,698
I know you the best.

310
00:18:24,029 --> 00:18:26,799
- I can help you... - Hold on. Wait.

311
00:18:27,329 --> 00:18:28,868
This is awfully rude.

312
00:18:28,969 --> 00:18:31,638
Woo Ri, come here.

313
00:18:31,799 --> 00:18:33,108
- What? - Hey.

314
00:18:33,908 --> 00:18:35,338
Woo Ri, come here.

315
00:18:35,979 --> 00:18:37,378
No. Come here, Woo Ri.

316
00:18:38,138 --> 00:18:39,748
Let go. You too.

317
00:18:39,749 --> 00:18:41,309
I can't. Hey, you let go of her hand.

318
00:18:41,408 --> 00:18:42,947
You're hurting Woo Ri. Let go at once.

319
00:18:42,948 --> 00:18:45,019
- Hold on. - Hey!

320
00:18:45,378 --> 00:18:47,417
Let go, both of you. What are you doing?

321
00:18:47,418 --> 00:18:48,988
- Are you playing tug-of-war? - You're hurting her. Let go.

322
00:18:48,989 --> 00:18:50,518
She's telling you to let go.

323
00:18:50,519 --> 00:18:51,917
You let go.

324
00:18:51,918 --> 00:18:54,927
- Stop pulling. - It hurts!

325
00:18:54,928 --> 00:18:56,798
I'll count to three. You'd better let go.

326
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:58,329
Or I'll get really angry.

327
00:18:58,428 --> 00:19:01,469
One, two, three!

328
00:19:02,499 --> 00:19:04,299
- No! - Hey, Woo Ri!

329
00:19:08,908 --> 00:19:11,579
- Are you all right? - What are you two doing?

330
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:13,878
Hey, Woo Ri.

331
00:19:18,749 --> 00:19:21,019
Woo Ri, tell us now.

332
00:19:21,489 --> 00:19:22,549
You'll choose me, right?

333
00:19:24,188 --> 00:19:27,158
It's me, right? Please say so.

334
00:19:36,898 --> 00:19:38,039
Stop it!

335
00:19:41,769 --> 00:19:43,239
Between the both of you...

336
00:19:44,908 --> 00:19:46,108
Between the both of you...

337
00:19:48,148 --> 00:19:49,848
I don't like both of you equally!

338
00:20:05,358 --> 00:20:07,198
I'm home.

339
00:20:07,329 --> 00:20:08,428
Good, you're home.

340
00:20:13,438 --> 00:20:15,138
- What's going on? - Woo Ri.

341
00:20:15,469 --> 00:20:18,638
I'm suffering between your mom and your grandmother.

342
00:20:18,979 --> 00:20:20,348
This is exhausting.

343
00:20:20,709 --> 00:20:22,448
- What? Why? - Well...

344
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:24,647
Say something! Whatever.

345
00:20:24,648 --> 00:20:27,018
Since she's here in person, why don't you ask her directly?

346
00:20:27,019 --> 00:20:28,718
- Go ahead, ask her. - Gosh.

347
00:20:28,719 --> 00:20:31,118
Actor Choi, why are you being this way? Relax.

348
00:20:31,388 --> 00:20:32,417
What is it?

349
00:20:32,418 --> 00:20:34,687
Your mom is on Kang Jae's side,

350
00:20:34,688 --> 00:20:36,498
and your grandmother is on Raphael's side.

351
00:20:36,499 --> 00:20:38,258
And they want me to choose a side.

352
00:20:38,259 --> 00:20:40,798
But what good would it do for me to choose a side?

353
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:42,897
It's your opinion that matters the most.

354
00:20:42,898 --> 00:20:44,499
Why are you all heated up?

355
00:20:44,598 --> 00:20:46,907
I'm not heated up.

356
00:20:46,908 --> 00:20:49,509
But you keep on telling me what to do.

357
00:20:49,608 --> 00:20:52,108
Woo Ri, since you're here. Tell us your decision.

358
00:20:52,638 --> 00:20:54,209
Woo Ri, who is it?

359
00:20:54,408 --> 00:20:56,378
Is it Raphael or Kang Jae?

360
00:21:02,519 --> 00:21:03,687
- I... - Yes?

361
00:21:03,688 --> 00:21:04,719
Yes?

362
00:21:04,989 --> 00:21:07,158
Between Kang Jae and Raphael...

363
00:21:07,358 --> 00:21:08,888
- Yes? - Yes?

364
00:21:11,698 --> 00:21:13,128
I like them both equally.

365
00:21:13,769 --> 00:21:14,868
- Gosh. - Gosh.

366
00:21:15,769 --> 00:21:16,868
Gosh.

367
00:21:19,438 --> 00:21:21,938
That's why I can't tell you.

368
00:21:23,709 --> 00:21:25,378
What do I do?

369
00:21:28,148 --> 00:21:29,279
This is a difficult matter...

370
00:21:30,049 --> 00:21:31,878
for us.

371
00:21:33,249 --> 00:21:35,049
But it's a difficult matter for Woo Ri as well.

372
00:21:37,588 --> 00:21:40,428
Right. Let's think about this matter slowly.

373
00:21:43,628 --> 00:21:45,358
Right. That's right.

374
00:21:45,658 --> 00:21:47,897
This is not something for you to decide hastily.

375
00:21:47,898 --> 00:21:50,098
We are talking about my granddaughter's life.

376
00:21:50,769 --> 00:21:54,408
I'll be on your side whatever decision you make.

377
00:21:55,239 --> 00:21:56,739
Thank you, Grandma.

378
00:21:57,108 --> 00:22:00,448
Let me give you a hug.

379
00:22:09,188 --> 00:22:11,118
But... A decision...

380
00:22:15,875 --> 00:22:18,514
Gosh, this is more difficult than it looks.

381
00:22:18,784 --> 00:22:20,784
Mother did this every day?

382
00:22:21,254 --> 00:22:22,583
That's what I'm saying.

383
00:22:22,584 --> 00:22:24,054
This doesn't even make that much profit either.

384
00:22:24,455 --> 00:22:25,983
The moment you wake up, you start the business.

385
00:22:25,984 --> 00:22:27,694
Then after lunch and dinner,

386
00:22:27,695 --> 00:22:29,253
you close up and fall asleep.

387
00:22:29,254 --> 00:22:30,994
You're a slave, a slave to pork cutlets.

388
00:22:31,824 --> 00:22:33,034
Really, this...

389
00:22:33,395 --> 00:22:35,334
This must have been difficult for Mother.

390
00:22:35,494 --> 00:22:37,034
Maybe she's not as tactful.

391
00:22:37,705 --> 00:22:39,705
By the way, I'm thinking about changing the business to karaoke.

392
00:22:41,435 --> 00:22:44,444
Wait, but this is not the right spot for karaoke.

393
00:22:44,445 --> 00:22:47,374
All you need to do is change the mic covers at karaoke.

394
00:22:47,375 --> 00:22:48,615
There is no work involved in it.

395
00:22:49,685 --> 00:22:51,214
That is correct.

396
00:22:51,215 --> 00:22:53,283
But Mother worked on this her whole life...

397
00:22:53,284 --> 00:22:55,313
under the name "Seo Gwi Nyeo".

398
00:22:55,314 --> 00:22:57,125
- And changing it like that... - Welcome.

399
00:22:57,224 --> 00:22:58,554
Hello.

400
00:22:59,625 --> 00:23:00,895
Are you pregnant?

401
00:23:00,955 --> 00:23:02,355
My daughter is pregnant as well.

402
00:23:02,494 --> 00:23:03,625
How far are you in your pregnancy?

403
00:23:04,165 --> 00:23:05,794
I'm due next month.

404
00:23:06,435 --> 00:23:08,563
I'd like a Seo Gwi Nyeo pork cutlet, please.

405
00:23:08,564 --> 00:23:10,405
- Yes, please wait. - Excuse me.

406
00:23:10,905 --> 00:23:12,503
Did the owner change?

407
00:23:12,504 --> 00:23:14,875
No, I'm the daughter. Please wait.

408
00:23:20,145 --> 00:23:21,474
I'm back.

409
00:23:21,915 --> 00:23:24,484
Ms. Seo, hello.

410
00:23:24,845 --> 00:23:26,754
Oh, hello.

411
00:23:27,355 --> 00:23:28,684
Ms. Seo,

412
00:23:28,685 --> 00:23:30,424
you may not remember me.

413
00:23:30,425 --> 00:23:32,024
It's been a while since I came here.

414
00:23:34,195 --> 00:23:35,395
Right. Who are you again?

415
00:23:36,395 --> 00:23:39,635
I graduated Bukgajwa Girls' Middle School 15 years ago.

416
00:23:40,665 --> 00:23:42,464
I used to come and eat your pork cutlet...

417
00:23:42,465 --> 00:23:44,234
at least once a week.

418
00:23:46,605 --> 00:23:49,604
Didn't you wear glasses back then?

419
00:23:49,605 --> 00:23:50,945
A round pair.

420
00:23:51,244 --> 00:23:52,474
Yes, that's right.

421
00:23:52,574 --> 00:23:54,344
Do you remember me now?

422
00:23:54,345 --> 00:23:55,473
Yes, I do.

423
00:23:55,474 --> 00:23:57,685
You still have that face.

424
00:24:03,925 --> 00:24:05,054
Why?

425
00:24:05,724 --> 00:24:06,895
What's wrong?

426
00:24:07,294 --> 00:24:08,395
It's nothing.

427
00:24:09,095 --> 00:24:10,595
I'm pregnant,

428
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:14,865
and I came because I craved this pork cutlet.

429
00:24:15,965 --> 00:24:18,564
It was like only yesterday, having pork cutlets here.

430
00:24:19,705 --> 00:24:21,905
But now that I am pregnant and have become a mother,

431
00:24:25,905 --> 00:24:27,314
it feels like time passes so fast.

432
00:24:31,215 --> 00:24:33,254
Thank you, Ms. Seo.

433
00:24:34,514 --> 00:24:36,215
What are you grateful for?

434
00:24:36,885 --> 00:24:39,554
For having this place still open.

435
00:24:40,195 --> 00:24:41,524
Thank you so much.

436
00:24:42,425 --> 00:24:45,124
Among all the food I ate during my pregnancy,

437
00:24:45,125 --> 00:24:46,635
this pork cutlet is the best.

438
00:24:49,165 --> 00:24:50,764
It still tastes the same.

439
00:24:51,435 --> 00:24:52,665
It's so delicious.

440
00:24:53,034 --> 00:24:54,804
I should thank you more.

441
00:25:01,014 --> 00:25:02,274
Help yourself.

442
00:25:03,814 --> 00:25:05,115
What is it?

443
00:25:05,484 --> 00:25:06,754
Tell me.

444
00:25:07,355 --> 00:25:08,615
What's keeping you?

445
00:25:20,135 --> 00:25:21,794
I know...

446
00:25:22,895 --> 00:25:24,064
that you like me slightly.

447
00:25:26,135 --> 00:25:28,135
What are you talking about?

448
00:25:29,135 --> 00:25:31,205
Are you a narcissist or something?

449
00:25:31,304 --> 00:25:35,115
I know that you like me as your senior detective.

450
00:25:36,484 --> 00:25:37,744
What is it?

451
00:25:38,744 --> 00:25:41,014
What's with the mood? What do you want to talk about?

452
00:25:42,514 --> 00:25:43,984
Na Hee,

453
00:25:44,655 --> 00:25:45,824
there's something big,

454
00:25:46,455 --> 00:25:47,824
and you're the only person I can tell it to.

455
00:25:49,095 --> 00:25:51,294
Something big? What is it?

456
00:25:53,895 --> 00:25:55,064
You know...

457
00:25:56,405 --> 00:25:57,764
our captain.

458
00:26:09,274 --> 00:26:11,345
Gosh, the timing.

459
00:26:12,185 --> 00:26:13,415
Let's talk after you answer the phone.

460
00:26:15,155 --> 00:26:16,784
Yes? What is it, Raphael?

461
00:26:29,494 --> 00:26:30,764
Did you bring the file?

462
00:26:32,334 --> 00:26:33,473
Yes.

463
00:26:33,474 --> 00:26:34,935
This is a list of all the secret funds.

464
00:26:36,304 --> 00:26:38,304
Let my Mom go before I hand this over.

465
00:26:40,615 --> 00:26:41,774
You'll be in trouble...

466
00:26:43,084 --> 00:26:45,845
if you play games with me.

467
00:26:46,514 --> 00:26:48,514
I'm a scary person.

468
00:26:48,915 --> 00:26:50,524
You said you wanted to work with me.

469
00:26:50,885 --> 00:26:53,054
If you don't trust me, how can we work together?

470
00:26:54,155 --> 00:26:56,564
Do you think it's right for my mom to be tied up like that for months?

471
00:26:56,895 --> 00:26:58,095
I'm...

472
00:26:58,764 --> 00:27:00,234
fine.

473
00:27:01,095 --> 00:27:03,233
I think I'm getting used to this.

474
00:27:03,234 --> 00:27:05,763
- I'm able to sleep well... - Can't you trust me?

475
00:27:05,764 --> 00:27:07,434
Then you shouldn't ask me to do things for you.

476
00:27:07,435 --> 00:27:09,074
I did everything that you wanted.

477
00:27:11,605 --> 00:27:12,645
Let go of my mom.

478
00:27:13,445 --> 00:27:15,074
Let go of my mom.

479
00:27:18,484 --> 00:27:20,685
That is so sad.

480
00:27:21,615 --> 00:27:22,784
Here.

481
00:27:27,724 --> 00:27:30,395
- Mom, are you okay? - Get me out of these.

482
00:27:32,125 --> 00:27:33,635
Slowly. It hurts.

483
00:27:35,534 --> 00:27:36,905
You suffered so much.

484
00:27:37,435 --> 00:27:39,263
I'll release you.

485
00:27:39,264 --> 00:27:41,034
Don't pull, Ma Ri.

486
00:27:42,635 --> 00:27:44,074
(New storage device is connected.)

487
00:27:53,254 --> 00:27:54,313
Ma Ri, you!

488
00:27:54,314 --> 00:27:55,514
Stop! Don't move!

489
00:27:56,415 --> 00:27:58,524
Drop the knife. Drop it!

490
00:27:59,794 --> 00:28:00,993
Put your hands over your head.

491
00:28:00,994 --> 00:28:02,155
Drop it.

492
00:28:03,665 --> 00:28:04,925
Drop it.

493
00:28:08,195 --> 00:28:09,395
Get her.

494
00:28:12,834 --> 00:28:14,604
You're under arrest for violating the narcotics control act,

495
00:28:14,605 --> 00:28:16,175
the Medical Service Exception Act,

496
00:28:16,744 --> 00:28:17,773
and for the murder of...

497
00:28:17,774 --> 00:28:19,205
Shin Mi Young, No Man Chul, Lee Jong Gu,

498
00:28:20,145 --> 00:28:21,314
and...

499
00:28:26,185 --> 00:28:28,215
Sergeant Kim Jun Hyuk.

500
00:29:02,777 --> 00:29:03,947
I heard...

501
00:29:05,477 --> 00:29:06,787
that you were my sister.

502
00:29:07,717 --> 00:29:08,916
My sister.

503
00:29:10,116 --> 00:29:11,457
Don't be ridiculous.

504
00:29:11,886 --> 00:29:14,026
I should have stabbed Kim Duk Bae...

505
00:29:14,027 --> 00:29:15,626
and killed everyone with my hands.

506
00:29:15,787 --> 00:29:17,697
Even you and your baby.

507
00:29:20,126 --> 00:29:21,767
I know that my dad was wrong.

508
00:29:23,467 --> 00:29:26,267
But I'm sure you had other choices that you could've made.

509
00:29:28,707 --> 00:29:30,076
What do you know about me?

510
00:29:31,507 --> 00:29:33,547
This was the easiest for me.

511
00:29:34,477 --> 00:29:35,947
Being this way.

512
00:30:10,346 --> 00:30:13,846
What are you saying? You should really stop.

513
00:30:15,517 --> 00:30:18,217
Lee Ma Ri can only say the same thing.

514
00:30:19,957 --> 00:30:23,227
"I'll do better, please give me another chance".

515
00:30:24,797 --> 00:30:26,596
That's all she can say.

516
00:30:32,596 --> 00:30:34,537
I'm tired of being Lee Ma Ri.

517
00:30:40,376 --> 00:30:42,007
I'm not Lee Ma Ri.

518
00:30:43,846 --> 00:30:45,176
My name is...

519
00:30:47,487 --> 00:30:48,947
Lee Mal Ja.

520
00:30:51,757 --> 00:30:53,017
What is this?

521
00:30:54,586 --> 00:30:56,797
Is this another plan of yours?

522
00:30:57,457 --> 00:30:58,856
I mean it.

523
00:31:00,297 --> 00:31:02,727
Yes, I approached you for your money.

524
00:31:04,136 --> 00:31:06,437
I conned you into marriage saying that I was pregnant,

525
00:31:07,737 --> 00:31:10,277
and I stuck by because I wanted to take something from you.

526
00:31:10,676 --> 00:31:12,277
That's who I am.

527
00:31:15,977 --> 00:31:18,276
- You... - My mom is not in Europe...

528
00:31:18,277 --> 00:31:20,287
but lives here with me.

529
00:31:22,017 --> 00:31:23,416
My mom...

530
00:31:25,057 --> 00:31:26,757
was a convicted fraud.

531
00:31:29,457 --> 00:31:31,856
And because we kept on lying like that...

532
00:31:33,826 --> 00:31:35,326
Somehow...

533
00:31:36,866 --> 00:31:39,366
Chairman Kim had my mom holding her hostage.

534
00:31:41,437 --> 00:31:42,737
What?

535
00:32:03,656 --> 00:32:06,426
- Let's go. - Mr. Choi. What's this article?

536
00:32:06,797 --> 00:32:08,066
Are you appearing in a detective movie?

537
00:32:08,166 --> 00:32:10,026
The article's out already?

538
00:32:10,027 --> 00:32:12,065
I was going to tell you first.

539
00:32:12,066 --> 00:32:14,165
You know how we're behind with our shooting.

540
00:32:14,166 --> 00:32:16,037
You can't appear in other movies.

541
00:32:17,406 --> 00:32:19,477
It's decided that both schedules will be taken care of.

542
00:32:19,537 --> 00:32:20,875
Mr. Kim!

543
00:32:20,876 --> 00:32:22,947
You can't. You just can't.

544
00:32:26,447 --> 00:32:29,386
- Mr. Kim! - Even if Mr. Kim comes, you can't.

545
00:32:32,856 --> 00:32:34,227
That's embarrassing.

546
00:32:34,386 --> 00:32:36,687
Can't you be in both the drama and the movie?

547
00:32:37,027 --> 00:32:39,396
Of course, you can.

548
00:32:39,557 --> 00:32:42,727
They only need to compromise.

549
00:32:42,866 --> 00:32:45,396
But they are fighting for their pride.

550
00:32:45,467 --> 00:32:48,466
- Darn it. - Gosh, be gentle.

551
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:50,277
You're going to ruin the meat.

552
00:32:54,846 --> 00:32:57,345
Are you okay? What's wrong?

553
00:32:57,346 --> 00:32:59,976
This isn't good. It should turn together.

554
00:32:59,977 --> 00:33:01,315
- Can't you turn your arm? - No.

555
00:33:01,316 --> 00:33:03,186
My head can but the rest won't.

556
00:33:03,187 --> 00:33:05,257
- I'm home. - You're home.

557
00:33:06,057 --> 00:33:08,425
- Can you call 911? - What?

558
00:33:08,426 --> 00:33:11,396
- My arm should turn like this. - It's weird.

559
00:33:11,497 --> 00:33:12,527
But this one won't.

560
00:33:12,856 --> 00:33:15,697
Gosh, your arm must be dislocated.

561
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:18,737
But I have a shooting tomorrow.

562
00:33:20,836 --> 00:33:23,906
Ms. Oh, can you change the script so that Chun Sa Da dies, right?

563
00:33:24,237 --> 00:33:26,537
If you change this one thing from last time, he dies.

564
00:33:26,676 --> 00:33:29,307
Get rid of him and have Ji Dok Sa and Na Beom In's confrontation.

565
00:33:29,846 --> 00:33:32,076
- Well... - What do you mean?

566
00:33:32,277 --> 00:33:33,747
Why are you firing me?

567
00:33:33,916 --> 00:33:35,315
Why should Chun Sa Da die?

568
00:33:35,316 --> 00:33:37,716
You complicated our schedule with overlapping appearances.

569
00:33:37,717 --> 00:33:38,956
And now, you have a dislocated arm.

570
00:33:38,957 --> 00:33:42,425
We can no longer tolerate power trips from actors.

571
00:33:42,426 --> 00:33:45,255
You can just go with the arm injured.

572
00:33:45,256 --> 00:33:47,396
And besides, you can't just kill people off like that.

573
00:33:47,397 --> 00:33:49,726
You might murder everyone out of habit.

574
00:33:49,727 --> 00:33:52,196
Mr. Choi. I'm trying to be considerate here.

575
00:33:52,337 --> 00:33:55,766
Shall I sue you for disrupting our schedule? Shall I?

576
00:33:55,767 --> 00:33:58,606
Sue me. I'll sue back. For murder.

577
00:33:58,607 --> 00:34:00,405
I'll send you to the central district prosecutor's office...

578
00:34:00,406 --> 00:34:02,176
for murder.

579
00:34:02,247 --> 00:34:05,276
Ms. Oh, bring a new storyline where Chun Sa Da dies.

580
00:34:05,576 --> 00:34:08,615
Ms. Oh, let's just go with the injured arm.

581
00:34:08,616 --> 00:34:10,386
- I love you. Okay? - Well...

582
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:13,417
What's all this about?

583
00:34:13,826 --> 00:34:15,957
Then, do you have to throw away everything you've done so far?

584
00:34:17,057 --> 00:34:18,057
Yes.

585
00:34:18,957 --> 00:34:20,826
I need to write it again in two days.

586
00:34:21,966 --> 00:34:23,667
I need to work like crazy.

587
00:34:24,636 --> 00:34:29,006
I need to write Chun Sa Da's death, which we haven't thought of before.

588
00:34:30,307 --> 00:34:31,576
There's nothing we can do.

589
00:34:32,276 --> 00:34:33,877
Start on it right away.

590
00:34:34,707 --> 00:34:36,247
I feel bad for you.

591
00:34:41,187 --> 00:34:42,417
(End of Episode 120.)

592
00:34:53,777 --> 00:34:56,978
Let's go. Why are you dawdling?

593
00:35:00,877 --> 00:35:02,178
Mal Ja.

594
00:35:11,687 --> 00:35:13,127
You aren't answering my calls.

595
00:35:13,857 --> 00:35:15,257
Are you running away like this?

596
00:35:16,127 --> 00:35:17,868
I went in for questioning at the police station.

597
00:35:19,198 --> 00:35:21,897
They told me there was no charge for colluding with Chairman Kim.

598
00:35:22,098 --> 00:35:23,437
And for deceiving you,

599
00:35:25,868 --> 00:35:27,206
you need to sue me for that.

600
00:35:27,207 --> 00:35:28,607
You can sue me if you want to.

601
00:35:31,147 --> 00:35:32,277
I'm not going to.

602
00:35:34,118 --> 00:35:35,518
I'm sorry.

603
00:35:37,948 --> 00:35:41,687
I've done so much wrong that I can't even ask you to forgive me.

604
00:35:43,587 --> 00:35:44,957
You've done something big.

605
00:35:45,828 --> 00:35:47,228
You saved me...

606
00:35:48,297 --> 00:35:49,658
and my dad.

607
00:35:50,158 --> 00:35:52,498
I think I should thank you for that.

608
00:35:56,498 --> 00:35:59,337
This is so complicated.

609
00:36:00,678 --> 00:36:02,877
It's absurd, and it angers me.

610
00:36:05,277 --> 00:36:06,547
I feel grateful as well.

611
00:36:09,777 --> 00:36:11,748
But something I don't get...

612
00:36:11,948 --> 00:36:13,857
is that you lied about studying abroad.

613
00:36:14,288 --> 00:36:16,558
But why are you so good at your job?

614
00:36:23,397 --> 00:36:24,527
Here, take this.

615
00:36:25,228 --> 00:36:26,667
Consider this your alimony.

616
00:36:35,207 --> 00:36:37,007
I approached you for money,

617
00:36:38,448 --> 00:36:40,748
and I'm leaving with it.

618
00:36:43,147 --> 00:36:44,647
I've done everything I need to.

619
00:36:46,218 --> 00:36:47,457
Goodbye.

620
00:36:47,658 --> 00:36:49,518
Bye Lee Ma Ri.

621
00:36:54,627 --> 00:36:55,698
Mal Ja.

622
00:36:57,167 --> 00:36:58,268
Goodbye.

623
00:37:02,038 --> 00:37:03,268
Thank you,

624
00:37:04,368 --> 00:37:05,808
Mr. Kim Bok Rae.

625
00:37:25,187 --> 00:37:26,487
Everyone.

626
00:37:26,928 --> 00:37:29,456
We've solved Chairman Kim's case.

627
00:37:29,457 --> 00:37:31,497
- So, let's go home. - Yes, sir.

628
00:37:31,498 --> 00:37:35,566
- Let's enjoy a life with evenings. - Yes, sir.

629
00:37:35,567 --> 00:37:37,307
Let's go home. Turn it off.

630
00:37:37,308 --> 00:37:38,468
- Bye. - Bye.

631
00:37:38,538 --> 00:37:40,307
- You shouldn't have been caught. - Good job.

632
00:37:40,308 --> 00:37:41,437
You're done for now.

633
00:37:45,207 --> 00:37:46,877
What do you mean Captain Park?

634
00:37:47,618 --> 00:37:49,118
Aren't we on the same team?

635
00:37:50,687 --> 00:37:52,788
I won't die alone.

636
00:37:58,420 --> 00:37:59,491
If I let go of you,

637
00:38:00,531 --> 00:38:02,390
don't you ever come back.

638
00:38:03,861 --> 00:38:04,901
Wait.

639
00:38:06,830 --> 00:38:08,770
Send me the million dollars that you promised right away.

640
00:38:09,770 --> 00:38:12,140
Then, I'll set you free.

641
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:32,591
Yes. We caught her.

642
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,460
Would that bring Jun Hyuk back?

643
00:38:38,531 --> 00:38:40,370
I found out about Jun Hyuk...

644
00:38:41,471 --> 00:38:44,170
I found out you helped his wife from her.

645
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,741
I haven't spent a dime that I got from Chairman Kim.

646
00:38:49,471 --> 00:38:51,741
I spent it all on buying his family an apartment unit.

647
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,381
Otherwise,

648
00:38:54,551 --> 00:38:56,681
I'll be ashamed of seeing him later on.

649
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:02,091
Kang Jae,

650
00:39:03,890 --> 00:39:05,091
let go of me.

651
00:39:06,821 --> 00:39:08,631
I won't come back ever.

652
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,060
This is my last request.

653
00:39:13,971 --> 00:39:15,071
Captain.

654
00:39:17,270 --> 00:39:20,070
The just society that you want will never come true...

655
00:39:20,071 --> 00:39:21,241
working as the police.

656
00:39:21,770 --> 00:39:23,710
The small salary, a bad father...

657
00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:26,511
And nothing we do eradicates crime.

658
00:39:27,011 --> 00:39:29,080
We just get hurt or killed on the job.

659
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:31,480
Our best bet...

660
00:39:31,721 --> 00:39:34,321
is to find a way to coexist with crime.

661
00:39:35,390 --> 00:39:37,019
When you become my age,

662
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:38,960
you'll get what I mean.

663
00:39:40,730 --> 00:39:41,960
Kang Jae.

664
00:39:47,401 --> 00:39:49,201
Until the day I retire,

665
00:39:53,810 --> 00:39:55,071
I don't want to get it.

666
00:40:02,951 --> 00:40:04,080
Hey.

667
00:40:23,443 --> 00:40:24,653
Woo Ri.

668
00:40:26,313 --> 00:40:27,423
Woo Ri.

669
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:37,932
Not today.

670
00:40:38,593 --> 00:40:40,233
I don't have the energy to fight.

671
00:40:41,733 --> 00:40:43,431
That's not why I'm here.

672
00:40:43,432 --> 00:40:45,133
I got to see you, and that's enough.

673
00:40:47,642 --> 00:40:49,443
I'll go home, then.

674
00:41:11,332 --> 00:41:12,662
Am I getting old?

675
00:41:14,463 --> 00:41:17,133
I thought dating was the biggest problem in the world.

676
00:41:19,932 --> 00:41:22,273
But there are way bigger problems in life.

677
00:41:24,512 --> 00:41:26,472
You've been through a lot yourself.

678
00:41:29,883 --> 00:41:31,613
Your life wasn't exactly easy either.

679
00:41:57,512 --> 00:41:59,112
You know how to drink.

680
00:41:59,113 --> 00:42:00,942
Beer isn't exactly liquor.

681
00:42:00,943 --> 00:42:02,443
I can drink this forever.

682
00:42:03,782 --> 00:42:04,852
What?

683
00:42:05,952 --> 00:42:07,852
Are you a lightweight?

684
00:42:16,662 --> 00:42:18,932
Are you all right? You look drunk.

685
00:42:23,003 --> 00:42:25,302
Where was I?

686
00:42:27,202 --> 00:42:29,173
Mother and Grandmother both.

687
00:42:30,202 --> 00:42:32,073
They thought of me like a son.

688
00:42:34,412 --> 00:42:38,551
I even know where they keep their screwdriver.

689
00:42:38,552 --> 00:42:39,753
I even...

690
00:42:41,352 --> 00:42:43,052
spent a few nights there.

691
00:42:43,952 --> 00:42:45,523
I lived with them.

692
00:42:46,753 --> 00:42:47,923
You haven't, have you?

693
00:42:48,722 --> 00:42:49,963
I haven't.

694
00:42:54,332 --> 00:42:56,063
Come on.

695
00:42:56,503 --> 00:42:58,773
You had enough. Stop drinking.

696
00:43:02,372 --> 00:43:03,972
You can't even hold it.

697
00:43:23,492 --> 00:43:25,462
- You're so heavy. - I am...

698
00:43:25,463 --> 00:43:27,331
Oh Woo Ri's...

699
00:43:27,332 --> 00:43:29,301
Be quiet.

700
00:43:29,302 --> 00:43:31,202
Shut your mouth before I ditch you.

701
00:43:31,332 --> 00:43:34,302
Her first kiss... That was with me.

702
00:43:36,273 --> 00:43:38,043
I was her first kiss.

703
00:43:38,912 --> 00:43:40,412
You crossed the line.

704
00:43:42,242 --> 00:43:43,412
Darn it.

705
00:43:47,153 --> 00:43:48,952
He brought it upon himself.

706
00:43:50,122 --> 00:43:51,423
Whatever.

707
00:43:52,153 --> 00:43:53,253
You know,

708
00:43:54,063 --> 00:43:57,023
the best person I met in my life...

709
00:43:58,832 --> 00:43:59,892
is Woo Ri.

710
00:44:00,463 --> 00:44:02,302
Even if she won't choose me.

711
00:44:04,532 --> 00:44:06,972
the best person in the world has my baby.

712
00:44:11,573 --> 00:44:12,972
I am...

713
00:44:13,543 --> 00:44:16,242
grateful enough for that connection.

714
00:44:21,923 --> 00:44:23,182
Taxi!

715
00:44:24,423 --> 00:44:25,492
Shoot.

716
00:44:25,753 --> 00:44:26,952
This is madness.

717
00:44:35,169 --> 00:44:36,910
Oh, gosh.

718
00:44:37,609 --> 00:44:39,379
No, Sa Da.

719
00:44:41,450 --> 00:44:44,180
If there were a forever,

720
00:44:45,879 --> 00:44:47,020
at...

721
00:44:48,649 --> 00:44:49,919
the end,

722
00:44:49,989 --> 00:44:51,620
That's it. Keep it going.

723
00:44:53,959 --> 00:44:55,089
let's...

724
00:44:57,430 --> 00:44:59,129
meet...

725
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:02,950
again.

726
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:05,788
No, wait.

727
00:45:05,789 --> 00:45:07,618
You can't die!

728
00:45:07,619 --> 00:45:10,119
- Cut. Okay! - Bravo!

729
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:11,559
That's a wrap!

730
00:45:12,530 --> 00:45:14,599
- Awesome! - Well done.

731
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:17,269
Was that okay? Are you sure?

732
00:45:17,369 --> 00:45:18,769
It wasn't just okay.

733
00:45:18,869 --> 00:45:20,499
It was your best shot ever.

734
00:45:20,670 --> 00:45:22,740
That was Choi Sung Il's final scene.

735
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:26,139
He did a great job up to the very end,

736
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:28,010
so let's give him some props!

737
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:30,880
- Thank you! - Good job!

738
00:45:31,249 --> 00:45:32,380
Well done!

739
00:45:37,050 --> 00:45:39,320
Goodness. What are you all doing here?

740
00:45:41,289 --> 00:45:44,030
We're here as fans to celebrate your last shoot.

741
00:45:45,030 --> 00:45:46,430
Thank you.

742
00:45:46,789 --> 00:45:49,959
I laughed and cried with you for a few months.

743
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:52,669
I'm sad your character died,

744
00:45:52,670 --> 00:45:55,539
but I can say for sure he was the best in the drama.

745
00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:58,309
- You were great. - Thanks.

746
00:45:58,670 --> 00:45:59,808
Well done.

747
00:45:59,809 --> 00:46:02,808
I'll help you with the detective movie. Trust me.

748
00:46:02,809 --> 00:46:05,150
Thanks. Thank you, everyone.

749
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:08,220
It could've been an embarrassing exit for me,

750
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:11,519
but our writer, Ms. Oh, sorted that all out.

751
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:14,990
You killed off my character,

752
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:18,430
but you saved me.

753
00:46:19,659 --> 00:46:20,759
Thanks, Woo Ri.

754
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:23,299
You said you'd act whatever I wrote,

755
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:26,229
and your trust in me helped me create a great scene.

756
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:28,970
I should thank you, Dad.

757
00:46:39,409 --> 00:46:40,650
What did you just say?

758
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:46,519
Dad.

759
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:49,619
Father?

760
00:46:50,590 --> 00:46:51,760
Dad?

761
00:46:53,229 --> 00:46:54,700
Woo Ri!

762
00:46:57,670 --> 00:46:59,430
I feel like a dad now.

763
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:01,670
My gosh...

764
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:14,849
I'm so happy.

765
00:47:31,999 --> 00:47:35,070
(The late Lee and Hahm)

766
00:48:05,470 --> 00:48:06,769
Thanks for coming with me.

767
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:08,498
You're welcome.

768
00:48:08,499 --> 00:48:11,610
It was good to see them again.

769
00:48:12,510 --> 00:48:14,379
It's not a special day.

770
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:15,709
Why did you want to come here?

771
00:48:19,010 --> 00:48:20,180
It is a special day.

772
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:22,050
What?

773
00:48:23,519 --> 00:48:24,849
It's the anniversary of the first time...

774
00:48:25,519 --> 00:48:27,189
my dad took me to a baseball game.

775
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:30,189
It's the day...

776
00:48:30,930 --> 00:48:32,490
I first called him dad.

777
00:48:38,369 --> 00:48:39,470
Woo Ri.

778
00:48:41,099 --> 00:48:42,539
My dad was my stepdad.

779
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:45,139
My mom had remarried,

780
00:48:46,139 --> 00:48:47,340
and I...

781
00:48:47,979 --> 00:48:50,539
called him "mister" because "dad" felt weird.

782
00:48:52,809 --> 00:48:55,150
But he waited until I opened up.

783
00:48:57,349 --> 00:48:58,550
I was ten or so.

784
00:49:00,519 --> 00:49:02,659
He took me to a baseball game for the first time.

785
00:49:04,930 --> 00:49:06,260
I think it was a miracle.

786
00:49:07,829 --> 00:49:09,700
He caught a foul ball.

787
00:49:11,329 --> 00:49:14,340
I got overly excited and yelled...

788
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:17,639
and called him dad.

789
00:49:20,539 --> 00:49:22,610
Ever since then on this day...

790
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:29,320
Dad called me, and we had our own dinner date.

791
00:49:38,375 --> 00:49:40,176
My biological father's still alive.

792
00:49:40,415 --> 00:49:41,446
What?

793
00:49:42,145 --> 00:49:44,455
Your dad's alive?

794
00:49:45,056 --> 00:49:46,116
No.

795
00:49:47,185 --> 00:49:48,786
My dad's dead.

796
00:49:51,156 --> 00:49:55,065
The man who reeked of alcohol and beat my mom is alive,

797
00:49:55,995 --> 00:49:58,696
but the cool dad who made me what I am is dead.

798
00:50:01,906 --> 00:50:03,636
This is my one and only dad.

799
00:50:10,105 --> 00:50:11,975
That's why I'm confident...

800
00:50:12,576 --> 00:50:14,645
I can raise your baby as my own.

801
00:50:16,415 --> 00:50:18,256
I wondered about it for a long time,

802
00:50:20,315 --> 00:50:21,955
but now I'm convinced.

803
00:50:23,455 --> 00:50:25,196
Because to me, family...

804
00:50:27,156 --> 00:50:28,466
Family, to me...

805
00:50:29,795 --> 00:50:31,096
isn't about blood...

806
00:50:33,665 --> 00:50:35,236
but the time spent together.

807
00:50:45,645 --> 00:50:47,115
You're back.

808
00:50:47,116 --> 00:50:48,985
- Yes. - I'm about to head off.

809
00:50:48,986 --> 00:50:51,084
- Okay, bye. - Take care.

810
00:50:51,085 --> 00:50:52,556
- Wait. - Yes?

811
00:50:53,185 --> 00:50:54,216
Dad.

812
00:50:54,926 --> 00:50:55,926
What is it?

813
00:50:57,486 --> 00:50:59,826
- Thank you. - Just out of the blue?

814
00:51:01,495 --> 00:51:02,866
For what?

815
00:51:03,225 --> 00:51:04,835
For everything.

816
00:51:05,435 --> 00:51:07,466
Are you just being silly?

817
00:51:07,736 --> 00:51:11,635
Kang Jae said that being related doesn't...

818
00:51:11,636 --> 00:51:14,806
automatically make you family, that you must work at it.

819
00:51:15,576 --> 00:51:19,346
Thank you for putting in the effort to make up for lost time.

820
00:51:20,946 --> 00:51:23,415
You tried hard to befriend me,

821
00:51:23,446 --> 00:51:25,656
you're good to Grandma,

822
00:51:25,786 --> 00:51:27,455
and you help Mom at work.

823
00:51:28,156 --> 00:51:29,685
Thanks for everything.

824
00:51:30,756 --> 00:51:34,366
You shouldn't have to thank family for that.

825
00:51:35,565 --> 00:51:36,926
Plus,

826
00:51:37,125 --> 00:51:40,065
I help your mom because I like her.

827
00:51:41,766 --> 00:51:45,036
I know. I hope you two can work it out.

828
00:51:46,036 --> 00:51:47,475
You really do?

829
00:51:49,506 --> 00:51:52,715
I hit on your mom and got rejected.

830
00:51:52,716 --> 00:51:54,446
Did you really?

831
00:51:54,946 --> 00:51:57,485
I didn't know. I'm rooting for you.

832
00:51:57,486 --> 00:51:59,455
Hearing you say that...

833
00:52:00,486 --> 00:52:01,786
makes me feel good.

834
00:52:02,926 --> 00:52:05,695
I'm feeling brave enough to propose to her again.

835
00:52:05,696 --> 00:52:06,895
You'll propose?

836
00:52:07,295 --> 00:52:09,624
I'm all for it, totally.

837
00:52:09,625 --> 00:52:10,826
Let me help.

838
00:52:11,466 --> 00:52:14,036
Yes, Dad. I got it.

839
00:52:14,605 --> 00:52:18,434
I actually asked Mom in passing.

840
00:52:18,435 --> 00:52:20,435
Yes, go for that kind of proposal.

841
00:52:21,245 --> 00:52:23,305
Sure, I can do that.

842
00:52:23,306 --> 00:52:25,116
Grandma said she'd help.

843
00:52:25,315 --> 00:52:26,375
Okay.

844
00:52:27,346 --> 00:52:29,486
I'm rooting for you, Dad.

845
00:52:32,656 --> 00:52:34,756
He's going to propose.

846
00:52:38,395 --> 00:52:39,455
Wait.

847
00:52:41,096 --> 00:52:44,326
I got proposed to twice.

848
00:52:49,935 --> 00:52:52,306
Will you marry me?

849
00:52:54,975 --> 00:52:57,576
Will you marry me?

850
00:53:13,455 --> 00:53:15,465
You didn't even give me a warning.

851
00:53:15,466 --> 00:53:17,295
We were in the neighbourhood.

852
00:53:17,466 --> 00:53:19,766
Take your time. We're not hungry yet.

853
00:53:20,696 --> 00:53:22,565
- Okay. - Ms. Oh.

854
00:53:22,966 --> 00:53:23,966
My goodness.

855
00:53:24,475 --> 00:53:27,235
- Welcome. How are you? - Hello.

856
00:53:27,236 --> 00:53:28,604
Why the sudden visit?

857
00:53:28,605 --> 00:53:32,474
Singing class is no fun without you.

858
00:53:32,475 --> 00:53:34,076
We came to see you.

859
00:53:34,745 --> 00:53:36,786
Take a seat. Sit over here.

860
00:53:38,955 --> 00:53:41,286
- Goodness. Hello. - Hello.

861
00:53:41,556 --> 00:53:44,055
Sorry... Hello. Mom's not in right now.

862
00:53:44,056 --> 00:53:46,954
We're not here to see her.

863
00:53:46,955 --> 00:53:48,825
What? Sit down first.

864
00:53:48,826 --> 00:53:50,124
Do you want pork cutlet?

865
00:53:50,125 --> 00:53:51,466
No. Just do your thing.

866
00:53:53,736 --> 00:53:54,736
What's going on?

867
00:53:58,475 --> 00:54:00,236
What? Those two came in together?

868
00:54:01,036 --> 00:54:02,775
- Hello. - Hi.

869
00:54:02,975 --> 00:54:04,875
You should turn on the TV.

870
00:54:05,176 --> 00:54:06,245
What?

871
00:54:07,576 --> 00:54:11,286
- I'm my daughter's father, - Oh? Sung Il's on.

872
00:54:11,786 --> 00:54:15,156
but I'm not my daughter's mom's husband.

873
00:54:15,955 --> 00:54:17,855
But now,

874
00:54:18,196 --> 00:54:22,625
I want to be both a good father and a good husband.

875
00:54:23,326 --> 00:54:26,435
So today, to my daughter's mother,

876
00:54:28,036 --> 00:54:29,906
I wish to propose.

877
00:54:34,306 --> 00:54:36,045
- What? - Are you serious?

878
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:39,375
Eun Ran.

879
00:54:41,045 --> 00:54:43,216
We met 30 years ago already.

880
00:54:44,286 --> 00:54:45,886
We were in middle school then,

881
00:54:46,915 --> 00:54:49,286
and now we're middle-aged.

882
00:54:51,295 --> 00:54:55,165
But to me, you still look like you're 16.

883
00:54:57,895 --> 00:55:00,895
Because throughout those 30 years.

884
00:55:01,466 --> 00:55:03,866
I went on loving you.

885
00:55:08,205 --> 00:55:09,306
Eun Ran.

886
00:55:11,475 --> 00:55:13,245
Will you marry me?

887
00:55:16,516 --> 00:55:19,486
Oh, my goodness.

888
00:55:22,556 --> 00:55:24,124
It's him.

889
00:55:24,125 --> 00:55:26,395
- Wow. - My gosh.

890
00:55:36,966 --> 00:55:38,736
As Woo Ri's dad,

891
00:55:40,306 --> 00:55:43,306
and as Eun Ran's husband,

892
00:55:45,116 --> 00:55:46,475
I want to live a good life.

893
00:55:47,375 --> 00:55:48,545
Will you let me?

894
00:56:04,395 --> 00:56:07,835
Everyone else is dressed up, and I look a mess.

895
00:56:08,065 --> 00:56:09,466
This isn't right.

896
00:56:11,636 --> 00:56:12,675
Is it not?

897
00:56:12,676 --> 00:56:16,475
Then do you want to get changed?

898
00:56:16,705 --> 00:56:18,144
It's already done.

899
00:56:18,145 --> 00:56:20,045
Oh, you're right.

900
00:56:20,815 --> 00:56:23,486
Shall I do this another day?

901
00:56:28,225 --> 00:56:30,955
- Well done. - Congratulations.

902
00:56:31,355 --> 00:56:34,596
Just a moment. I'll keep this ring,

903
00:56:35,196 --> 00:56:38,736
but before I say yes to him, I must state a condition.

904
00:56:39,395 --> 00:56:42,766
A condition? Okay, what is it? I'll do anything.

905
00:56:42,966 --> 00:56:44,466
- Not you. - Okay.

906
00:56:47,335 --> 00:56:49,545
- Woo Ri. - Yes?

907
00:56:50,105 --> 00:56:52,645
You must go first. Make up your mind.

908
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:54,645
Me? Why?

909
00:56:54,946 --> 00:56:56,386
Pick one or the other.

910
00:56:58,355 --> 00:57:01,486
Woo Ri. Once you make up your mind,

911
00:57:01,656 --> 00:57:04,926
I'll accept this proposal.

912
00:57:06,426 --> 00:57:07,895
Duk Chil, are you okay with that?

913
00:57:08,096 --> 00:57:10,295
What? Yes, of course, I am.

914
00:57:19,605 --> 00:57:23,406
Actually, I already made up my mind.

915
00:57:24,915 --> 00:57:26,975
You did? Who is it?

916
00:57:32,116 --> 00:57:33,286
I've...

917
00:57:41,525 --> 00:57:42,895
decided...

918
00:58:40,556 --> 00:58:43,326
(Woori the Virgin)

919
00:58:43,426 --> 00:58:45,394
Are you ready to marry now?

920
00:58:45,395 --> 00:58:47,255
Whatever happens to me,

921
00:58:47,256 --> 00:58:49,866
he's always there, by my side.

922
00:58:49,966 --> 00:58:51,394
We won't have to meet anymore.

923
00:58:51,395 --> 00:58:52,865
I'll see her, as her kid's dad.

924
00:58:52,866 --> 00:58:56,005
- I'll see her, as a church friend. - Gosh.

925
00:58:56,006 --> 00:58:59,205
Woo Ri. I thought I'd regret it if I didn't tell you.

926
00:58:59,736 --> 00:59:02,005
- The groom's not here. - He was arrested.

927
00:59:02,006 --> 00:59:04,175
What are you saying? I'll go and get him.

928
00:59:04,176 --> 00:59:05,774
The bride can't leave.

929
00:59:05,775 --> 00:59:08,346
Then what? I should get him. He's my husband.

930
00:59:08,645 --> 00:59:10,716
I found my husband.
