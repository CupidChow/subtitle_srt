1
00:00:05,102 --> 00:00:06,803
You can't be with this man!

2
00:00:13,143 --> 00:00:15,442
Hey, let this hand go and we'll talk it out.

3
00:00:15,573 --> 00:00:17,042
What's with you all of a sudden?

4
00:00:17,842 --> 00:00:20,743
Kang Jae, why are you being like this?

5
00:00:21,542 --> 00:00:22,613
Woo Ri.

6
00:00:23,853 --> 00:00:25,383
Let's talk outside.

7
00:00:27,052 --> 00:00:28,082
No, don't.

8
00:00:32,393 --> 00:00:33,592
I'll be back in a moment.

9
00:00:35,662 --> 00:00:36,692
Let's go.

10
00:00:37,963 --> 00:00:40,462
I think Kim Bok Rae is a criminal. You're in danger.

11
00:00:40,563 --> 00:00:42,571
What are you talking about? Explain so I can understand.

12
00:00:42,572 --> 00:00:44,402
I heard someone at Diamond was Chairman Kim,

13
00:00:44,403 --> 00:00:45,602
so I've been investigating.

14
00:00:45,903 --> 00:00:47,742
I think Kim Bok Rae is Chairman Kim.

15
00:00:50,912 --> 00:00:52,682
- Do you have evidence? - Yes.

16
00:00:55,483 --> 00:00:57,082
Well, the thing is...

17
00:00:58,653 --> 00:01:01,022
I had evidence, but it's gone now.

18
00:01:01,123 --> 00:01:02,153
What?

19
00:01:05,293 --> 00:01:06,363
Kang Jae.

20
00:01:07,822 --> 00:01:09,832
How did you find me here?

21
00:01:10,162 --> 00:01:11,832
I didn't tell anyone I was here.

22
00:01:12,733 --> 00:01:15,302
Did you track my location by any chance?

23
00:01:18,403 --> 00:01:20,502
A murder took place at the hospital,

24
00:01:20,503 --> 00:01:22,972
so I understand that the police could suspect him.

25
00:01:23,313 --> 00:01:27,483
But you shouldn't let your feelings interfere in your investigation.

26
00:01:29,153 --> 00:01:31,082
I hope stuff like this doesn't happen again.

27
00:01:31,923 --> 00:01:33,153
I'm going back inside.

28
00:01:41,763 --> 00:01:42,932
Darn it.

29
00:01:44,092 --> 00:01:47,562
I apologize on Kang Jae's behalf.

30
00:01:48,372 --> 00:01:49,573
Why would you apologize?

31
00:01:50,772 --> 00:01:53,072
But why did he have to barge in at such an important moment?

32
00:01:53,073 --> 00:01:56,143
I mean, I was in the middle of singing the song...

33
00:01:57,372 --> 00:02:00,212
Well, maybe that's a good thing.

34
00:02:00,342 --> 00:02:03,312
I was cringing so badly that I wanted to disappear...

35
00:02:05,423 --> 00:02:07,722
- Why would I be mad? It's nothing. - You're not upset, right?

36
00:02:07,723 --> 00:02:10,823
Of course, I'm not upset. I was just kidding.

37
00:02:10,893 --> 00:02:12,193
Go on in.

38
00:02:13,462 --> 00:02:16,263
I shall go in, then.

39
00:02:17,363 --> 00:02:18,763
Thank you.

40
00:02:25,643 --> 00:02:28,673
I know you're there. Come out.

41
00:02:36,513 --> 00:02:39,552
What? Did you think I wouldn't know?

42
00:02:39,682 --> 00:02:41,122
Let me just say one thing.

43
00:02:41,483 --> 00:02:42,552
You'd better listen carefully.

44
00:02:44,423 --> 00:02:46,163
If anything bad happens to Woo Ri,

45
00:02:47,492 --> 00:02:48,633
I will...

46
00:02:49,492 --> 00:02:53,203
follow you to the end of the world and chew you to pieces.

47
00:02:55,502 --> 00:02:57,502
Why are you saying Won Bin's line from "The Man From Nowhere"?

48
00:02:57,703 --> 00:02:59,242
And why are you dropping the honorifics?

49
00:03:00,372 --> 00:03:02,073
Let me ask you something.

50
00:03:04,613 --> 00:03:06,512
Did you peg me as the prime suspect...

51
00:03:06,513 --> 00:03:09,252
based on your objective judgement as a police detective?

52
00:03:10,853 --> 00:03:12,782
Or are you...

53
00:03:13,923 --> 00:03:15,752
reacting emotionally as Woo Ri's ex-boyfriend?

54
00:03:21,393 --> 00:03:22,832
If you...

55
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:25,932
react emotionally and accuse me one more time,

56
00:03:26,562 --> 00:03:28,233
I won't sit back quietly.

57
00:03:33,272 --> 00:03:34,772
You won't sit back quietly?

58
00:03:42,853 --> 00:03:44,353
I'm watching you.

59
00:03:58,392 --> 00:04:00,762
Yes, sir. I'll be off, then.

60
00:04:05,942 --> 00:04:08,812
You've been suspended for a week. Get some rest.

61
00:04:09,012 --> 00:04:10,442
I'll keep on investigating.

62
00:04:10,572 --> 00:04:14,043
Did I not warn you that this would happen if you messed with Diamond?

63
00:04:14,283 --> 00:04:16,051
I said the higher-ups were vying for a chance...

64
00:04:16,052 --> 00:04:18,381
to teach you a lesson because of the chairman of Diamond.

65
00:04:18,382 --> 00:04:20,952
"Detectives look at nothing but evidence."

66
00:04:22,023 --> 00:04:23,321
You taught me that.

67
00:04:23,322 --> 00:04:26,023
You made a move when you didn't have sufficient evidence!

68
00:04:26,093 --> 00:04:28,191
I swear, when I first opened Raphael's safe,

69
00:04:28,192 --> 00:04:30,392
I saw No Man Chul's necklace.

70
00:04:31,033 --> 00:04:32,662
Chairman Kim is right in front of us.

71
00:04:32,663 --> 00:04:34,832
He broke into Woo Ri's home, for goodness' sake! We must get him.

72
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:36,773
Okay, we will catch him.

73
00:04:37,002 --> 00:04:39,842
But it's just for a week. Rest up and cool off.

74
00:04:39,843 --> 00:04:42,112
Taking a break helps you see things that you couldn't see before.

75
00:04:42,113 --> 00:04:43,941
Then you can regain your balance.

76
00:04:43,942 --> 00:04:45,412
Nothing will happen.

77
00:04:45,413 --> 00:04:47,142
No one will die.

78
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:49,982
How do you know?

79
00:04:49,983 --> 00:04:52,182
Are you the only one with intuition? I have it too, you see.

80
00:04:52,822 --> 00:04:56,122
Chairman Kim can't make a move knowing we're closing in on him.

81
00:04:56,252 --> 00:04:58,423
I don't care. I can't just stay home and rest.

82
00:04:58,822 --> 00:05:00,592
I'll keep on investigating on my own.

83
00:05:00,593 --> 00:05:02,932
You deserve another beating. You fool!

84
00:05:03,192 --> 00:05:05,762
Hey, you can't investigate anything during a suspension.

85
00:05:05,903 --> 00:05:08,833
You're not a cop during your one-week suspension. Do nothing!

86
00:05:13,903 --> 00:05:15,613
You have a new message.

87
00:05:45,572 --> 00:05:48,742
He took the necklace.

88
00:05:53,312 --> 00:05:54,413
Darn it!

89
00:06:02,692 --> 00:06:03,752
Yes.

90
00:06:05,322 --> 00:06:06,923
I saw it with my own two eyes.

91
00:06:07,992 --> 00:06:09,363
I can't just sit back and do nothing.

92
00:06:12,802 --> 00:06:15,473
Sir, it's been finalized as you had suggested.

93
00:06:15,802 --> 00:06:17,603
- Here, let me sign off on it. - Sure.

94
00:06:33,783 --> 00:06:34,822
Yes.

95
00:06:35,322 --> 00:06:36,353
What?

96
00:07:24,473 --> 00:07:26,572
You can't investigate anything during a suspension.

97
00:07:26,773 --> 00:07:29,413
You're not a cop during your one-week suspension. Do nothing!

98
00:07:38,483 --> 00:07:40,983
Oh, my! How could it taste so good?

99
00:07:41,622 --> 00:07:43,093
It's so good that I'm getting goosebumps.

100
00:07:43,192 --> 00:07:44,992
I'm a huge fan of yours, Chef Seo Gwi Nyeo.

101
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:47,422
- So you're a fan of MSG. - Pardon me?

102
00:07:47,423 --> 00:07:49,733
Be quiet, will you?

103
00:07:50,363 --> 00:07:54,033
Raphael. How could you get here so quickly?

104
00:07:55,033 --> 00:07:58,132
Oh, I happened to be in the area to take care of something.

105
00:07:59,442 --> 00:08:03,072
If you're ever in the area, feel free to come by for some food.

106
00:08:03,713 --> 00:08:06,381
My gosh. It's been so long since I last had a home-cooked meal.

107
00:08:06,382 --> 00:08:08,112
I'd actually eat here every day if I could.

108
00:08:08,113 --> 00:08:09,752
You can come by every day.

109
00:08:10,613 --> 00:08:11,683
Actually,

110
00:08:12,053 --> 00:08:13,421
it's getting late. Why don't you sleep here...

111
00:08:13,422 --> 00:08:15,183
and have breakfast with us in the morning?

112
00:08:15,723 --> 00:08:17,223
Mom, please.

113
00:08:17,553 --> 00:08:21,093
I'd love to, but that's...

114
00:08:21,563 --> 00:08:24,092
The thing is, my pipes burst yesterday,

115
00:08:24,093 --> 00:08:26,463
so I have to stay at a hotel for a few days.

116
00:08:26,703 --> 00:08:29,672
Why would you stay at a hotel? Just sleep here.

117
00:08:30,733 --> 00:08:33,041
My goodness. I can't cause you such inconvenience.

118
00:08:33,042 --> 00:08:34,343
Where would he even sleep?

119
00:08:35,172 --> 00:08:37,343
I'll sleep on the couch.

120
00:08:37,573 --> 00:08:40,641
Seeing someone enjoy my food so much...

121
00:08:40,642 --> 00:08:42,182
makes me so happy.

122
00:08:42,183 --> 00:08:45,553
Breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Have all three meals with us.

123
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:50,323
I'd love to, but... My gosh.

124
00:08:50,892 --> 00:08:52,662
I'll sleep on the couch.

125
00:08:52,723 --> 00:08:53,962
Wait, so you'll sleep here?

126
00:08:53,963 --> 00:08:56,262
I mean, if I were to sleep here.

127
00:08:56,563 --> 00:08:58,193
But I know that it'll make you uncomfortable.

128
00:08:58,292 --> 00:09:00,803
No, it's not about us. You'll be uncomfortable.

129
00:09:01,463 --> 00:09:03,573
No, I won't be. I'm totally fine with it.

130
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:06,402
- Is this right? - I want to do this.

131
00:09:06,473 --> 00:09:09,012
I'm comfortable with this. End of discussion!

132
00:09:09,142 --> 00:09:11,572
You're comfortable? Mom, are you not going to remove your makeup?

133
00:09:11,573 --> 00:09:13,912
And why did you suddenly change into this outfit before bed?

134
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:15,881
Am I not even allowed to wear what I want?

135
00:09:15,882 --> 00:09:18,382
- Woo Ri, you should get changed. - I'll get changed later.

136
00:09:18,613 --> 00:09:20,052
This is wrong.

137
00:09:20,053 --> 00:09:22,553
I'm sure he's uncomfortable too. He won't come out of the room.

138
00:09:22,752 --> 00:09:25,662
- Are you watching TV? - Yes! Come join us.

139
00:09:25,723 --> 00:09:27,922
Oh, Grandma. You got changed.

140
00:09:28,323 --> 00:09:30,362
But why are you dressed as if you're going out?

141
00:09:30,363 --> 00:09:33,502
No, I'm wearing my comfy clothes.

142
00:09:35,002 --> 00:09:36,103
Oh, really?

143
00:09:49,353 --> 00:09:50,512
Yes!

144
00:09:54,723 --> 00:09:56,652
Raphael, aren't you uncomfortable?

145
00:09:57,323 --> 00:09:58,492
No.

146
00:09:59,992 --> 00:10:01,223
I feel...

147
00:10:02,022 --> 00:10:03,662
so at home here.

148
00:10:04,963 --> 00:10:07,032
- Okay. Good night, then. - Good night.

149
00:10:36,433 --> 00:10:37,833
No. I can't wait any longer.

150
00:10:38,162 --> 00:10:40,702
- He'll come out. Just wait. - My gosh, Mom!

151
00:10:40,703 --> 00:10:43,132
Who takes a shower for an hour?

152
00:10:43,272 --> 00:10:44,732
What on earth is he doing?

153
00:10:44,733 --> 00:10:45,803
I can't hold it anymore.

154
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:48,541
You can use the toilet in the outhouse.

155
00:10:48,542 --> 00:10:51,073
I have to wash up and go to work. I'm late.

156
00:10:51,542 --> 00:10:52,683
I wonder if he's okay.

157
00:10:55,443 --> 00:10:57,082
- He's singing. - He's singing?

158
00:10:57,083 --> 00:10:58,183
What?

159
00:10:59,727 --> 00:11:01,827
How could you sing... Hey!

160
00:11:02,597 --> 00:11:03,668
Hold on. Hey!

161
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:16,447
Thank you for the ride.

162
00:11:16,977 --> 00:11:18,717
I hope you're not running late because of me.

163
00:11:19,248 --> 00:11:21,687
I calculated my route in advance so I wouldn't be late.

164
00:11:23,487 --> 00:11:24,987
But you took a shower for an hour?

165
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:26,486
What? What did you say?

166
00:11:26,487 --> 00:11:27,987
What? Oh, it's nothing.

167
00:11:31,197 --> 00:11:33,967
I'm so excited about the next three days.

168
00:11:36,097 --> 00:11:37,197
Right.

169
00:11:38,567 --> 00:11:40,307
Go on in. You'll be late.

170
00:11:40,308 --> 00:11:42,907
I planned the route so you'd arrive right on time.

171
00:11:42,908 --> 00:11:44,507
Hurry up and go on in.

172
00:11:44,508 --> 00:11:45,577
- Bye. - Have a good day.

173
00:11:51,317 --> 00:11:53,048
- What was that? - My gosh, Ms. Yu!

174
00:11:53,248 --> 00:11:54,517
What was that about?

175
00:11:54,518 --> 00:11:55,917
A morning date?

176
00:11:55,918 --> 00:11:57,417
Must you do this to me knowing I'm single?

177
00:11:57,418 --> 00:11:58,817
No, he's doing some repairs...

178
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:03,726
Hello.

179
00:12:03,727 --> 00:12:05,697
Hi, Detective Lee. It's been a while.

180
00:12:08,168 --> 00:12:09,367
Let's talk.

181
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:13,107
- Sure. - Okay, I'll leave you to it then.

182
00:12:19,678 --> 00:12:22,048
Did Raphael sleep at your place last night?

183
00:12:23,977 --> 00:12:25,316
You're tailing me now?

184
00:12:25,317 --> 00:12:26,518
I'm investigating the case.

185
00:12:27,317 --> 00:12:29,288
Kim Bok Rae is the prime suspect in the case.

186
00:12:30,187 --> 00:12:32,427
You, your mother, and even your grandma could be put in danger.

187
00:12:32,428 --> 00:12:35,187
His place needs repairs, so he's staying with us for a few days.

188
00:12:35,898 --> 00:12:37,197
Also,

189
00:12:37,558 --> 00:12:38,998
there's no way I wouldn't know.

190
00:12:39,298 --> 00:12:40,298
What?

191
00:12:40,299 --> 00:12:41,866
Had he been the culprit,

192
00:12:41,867 --> 00:12:44,567
I would've known right away when that man grabbed me that day.

193
00:12:45,538 --> 00:12:46,967
I know for a fact that it wasn't him.

194
00:12:47,168 --> 00:12:48,237
It was someone else.

195
00:12:49,678 --> 00:12:51,778
So make sure you catch the real culprit soon.

196
00:12:52,038 --> 00:12:53,178
It's making me anxious.

197
00:12:54,447 --> 00:12:55,548
But...

198
00:12:56,918 --> 00:12:58,217
I can assure you that it's not him.

199
00:13:02,018 --> 00:13:03,317
I have to work.

200
00:13:11,857 --> 00:13:13,627
- Thank you! - Thank you!

201
00:13:13,628 --> 00:13:16,037
- Thank you. - No problem. Get home safely.

202
00:13:16,038 --> 00:13:18,768
- Thank you. - Of course. You did great.

203
00:13:19,168 --> 00:13:20,367
Ms. Oh Eun Ran?

204
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:23,308
Yes? How may I help you?

205
00:13:23,977 --> 00:13:26,008
We're from "Trot Jinsunmi".

206
00:13:28,778 --> 00:13:31,017
Oh, hello. What is this about?

207
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:32,278
It's about the show, of course.

208
00:13:32,317 --> 00:13:34,517
We're looking for participants for the third season of the show.

209
00:13:34,518 --> 00:13:36,816
We were told we'd find a hidden gem here.

210
00:13:36,817 --> 00:13:37,957
We're here to cast you.

211
00:13:38,158 --> 00:13:39,288
You can join the show, right?

212
00:13:39,528 --> 00:13:42,187
You're offering me a spot on "Trot Jinsunmi"?

213
00:13:44,528 --> 00:13:45,768
- You're back. - Hey.

214
00:13:45,998 --> 00:13:48,927
What's going on? Why did you tell us not to have dinner and wait for you?

215
00:13:48,928 --> 00:13:50,797
I picked up some fresh sashimi for all of us.

216
00:13:50,798 --> 00:13:52,168
We have something to celebrate.

217
00:13:52,268 --> 00:13:54,537
What? What is it?

218
00:13:54,538 --> 00:13:56,178
I'm participating in "Trot Jinsunmi".

219
00:13:56,337 --> 00:13:58,638
The main writer and director came to cast me for the show.

220
00:13:58,778 --> 00:14:00,308
"Trot Jinsunmi"?

221
00:14:00,607 --> 00:14:03,017
My gosh! Am I dreaming right now?

222
00:14:03,018 --> 00:14:04,917
You'll participate in "Trot Jinsunmi"?

223
00:14:04,918 --> 00:14:07,346
That's amazing, Mom! Congratulations!

224
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:08,686
Calm down.

225
00:14:08,687 --> 00:14:10,586
They just invited me to participate in the preliminaries.

226
00:14:10,587 --> 00:14:13,528
Of course, they came to cast you because you're talented.

227
00:14:13,658 --> 00:14:16,097
Even just participating in that show will make you famous.

228
00:14:16,528 --> 00:14:19,467
If you make it to the top three, it's game over!

229
00:14:19,697 --> 00:14:21,826
That's true. Who says I can't win?

230
00:14:21,827 --> 00:14:24,398
Exactly, Mom! I have a good feeling about this.

231
00:14:25,467 --> 00:14:26,937
You can do it!

232
00:14:29,737 --> 00:14:32,707
I'm sorry. This must be a hassle for you,

233
00:14:32,778 --> 00:14:34,576
but I just love your food so much.

234
00:14:34,577 --> 00:14:38,117
I couldn't resist, so here I am again.

235
00:14:38,778 --> 00:14:40,548
Mother, I love your food too.

236
00:14:40,717 --> 00:14:43,657
How about I stay here for a few days once Raphael leaves?

237
00:14:43,658 --> 00:14:45,487
Hey, this isn't a hotel.

238
00:14:46,087 --> 00:14:47,227
Right.

239
00:14:47,288 --> 00:14:49,696
Then I'll drop by often for food. Is that okay, Mother?

240
00:14:49,697 --> 00:14:52,398
Of course. Like I said, you're always welcome here.

241
00:14:52,597 --> 00:14:54,596
Seeing you eat together at the same table makes me so happy...

242
00:14:54,597 --> 00:14:56,138
that I don't even have to eat.

243
00:14:56,168 --> 00:14:57,966
Mom, you had a lot of sashimi.

244
00:14:57,967 --> 00:14:59,037
Hey.

245
00:14:59,038 --> 00:15:00,367
It was a figure of speech.

246
00:15:02,437 --> 00:15:03,737
Right, Raphael.

247
00:15:03,837 --> 00:15:06,577
Did you not have a nightmare in that room by any chance?

248
00:15:06,678 --> 00:15:08,778
- No. - Did you hear a baby cry at night?

249
00:15:10,518 --> 00:15:11,678
No. Why do you ask?

250
00:15:11,918 --> 00:15:14,587
I heard a baby died in that room during the Korean War.

251
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:16,987
Hey, what are you talking about?

252
00:15:17,058 --> 00:15:18,087
Come on.

253
00:15:19,928 --> 00:15:21,028
The Korean War?

254
00:15:25,058 --> 00:15:27,727
Hold on. How old is this house, then?

255
00:15:50,788 --> 00:15:51,957
Goodness.

256
00:16:01,367 --> 00:16:02,638
Can I come in for a moment?

257
00:16:04,597 --> 00:16:05,697
Sure.

258
00:16:08,737 --> 00:16:10,138
What's wrong?

259
00:16:10,577 --> 00:16:11,678
At first,

260
00:16:11,937 --> 00:16:13,447
I thought I misheard it,

261
00:16:14,778 --> 00:16:16,117
but I keep hearing...

262
00:16:17,317 --> 00:16:18,918
a baby crying.

263
00:16:20,518 --> 00:16:21,686
What?

264
00:16:21,687 --> 00:16:24,018
You know, what she said earlier. Is it really true?

265
00:16:24,217 --> 00:16:26,058
There's a baby outside...

266
00:16:28,928 --> 00:16:31,398
No. Of course, it's not true.

267
00:16:31,528 --> 00:16:33,866
That's just some cat crying in the woods.

268
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:35,268
No, it's not!

269
00:16:35,367 --> 00:16:36,937
Cats go, "Meow".

270
00:16:37,038 --> 00:16:40,337
I swear, there's a baby crying outside.

271
00:16:40,438 --> 00:16:42,067
Don't you have cats in your neighbourhood?

272
00:16:42,238 --> 00:16:44,008
Cats cry like that when they're in heat.

273
00:16:49,617 --> 00:16:51,417
You're right. My goodness.

274
00:16:53,087 --> 00:16:54,087
Oh, well...

275
00:16:54,088 --> 00:16:55,518
You're reading this too?

276
00:16:56,288 --> 00:16:57,357
This book.

277
00:16:58,518 --> 00:16:59,657
Yes.

278
00:16:59,927 --> 00:17:01,327
It's my third time reading it.

279
00:17:01,427 --> 00:17:02,597
Really?

280
00:17:02,698 --> 00:17:04,258
Are you reading it because I recommended it?

281
00:17:04,897 --> 00:17:06,097
Nice. I'm glad.

282
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:10,567
To tell you the truth, I was always a fan of the author.

283
00:17:10,897 --> 00:17:13,468
I even considered going to the author's meet-and-greet.

284
00:17:14,337 --> 00:17:16,438
But then, I saw you reading it too.

285
00:17:23,317 --> 00:17:24,377
Well...

286
00:17:24,417 --> 00:17:27,048
Aren't you uncomfortable here?

287
00:17:27,488 --> 00:17:29,688
No, not at all. I love it here.

288
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:33,228
In fact, we should talk more.

289
00:17:33,488 --> 00:17:34,788
But we haven't had a chance to do that.

290
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:39,327
Oh, what do you say when you're calling the baby?

291
00:17:39,667 --> 00:17:41,667
I call the baby "Gummy Bear".

292
00:17:41,768 --> 00:17:44,998
It was as small as a gummy bear when you did your first ultrasound.

293
00:17:46,538 --> 00:17:49,008
It's probably a little bigger than that now.

294
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:53,708
How about we come up with a foetus nickname together?

295
00:17:54,147 --> 00:17:55,347
A foetus nickname?

296
00:17:57,278 --> 00:17:58,377
Sure.

297
00:17:59,718 --> 00:18:01,347
What would be good?

298
00:18:03,317 --> 00:18:04,988
Your Korean name is Kim Bok Rae, right?

299
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:12,258
You knew?

300
00:18:13,627 --> 00:18:15,698
Yes, I heard.

301
00:18:16,567 --> 00:18:17,667
Oh, dear.

302
00:18:18,238 --> 00:18:20,938
I want people to think I grew up abroad, so I rarely use that name.

303
00:18:22,907 --> 00:18:24,677
How about Bok Dol?

304
00:18:25,877 --> 00:18:27,478
You sure are a writer.

305
00:18:27,877 --> 00:18:29,008
Bok Dol!

306
00:18:29,107 --> 00:18:31,048
It just rolls off the tongue. Bok Dol.

307
00:18:32,048 --> 00:18:33,218
Hey, Bok Dol.

308
00:18:33,847 --> 00:18:35,788
From now on, I'll call you Bok Dol.

309
00:18:36,857 --> 00:18:37,988
Kim Bok...

310
00:18:39,728 --> 00:18:41,887
Kim Bok Rae's baby, Bok Dol.

311
00:18:42,798 --> 00:18:43,958
Bok Dol.

312
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:48,028
I wonder what Bok Dol will look like.

313
00:18:50,968 --> 00:18:52,097
Woo Ri.

314
00:18:53,268 --> 00:18:54,667
Show me your childhood photos.

315
00:18:58,938 --> 00:19:01,278
Should I show you or not?

316
00:19:01,478 --> 00:19:05,077
I went through a phase where I did and wore hideous things.

317
00:19:05,218 --> 00:19:07,517
Who cares? That's fine.

318
00:19:07,518 --> 00:19:08,988
I want to see them.

319
00:19:09,758 --> 00:19:11,258
What were you like as a kid?

320
00:19:13,587 --> 00:19:14,788
Me? I was cute.

321
00:19:14,927 --> 00:19:15,988
What?

322
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:19,897
- Come again? You were cute? - I sure was.

323
00:19:34,278 --> 00:19:35,948
I keep doing this out of habit.

324
00:19:40,417 --> 00:19:42,688
Aren't you going to have dinner?

325
00:19:46,788 --> 00:19:48,157
Hey, Lee Mal Ja!

326
00:19:49,357 --> 00:19:51,258
Are you really not going to talk to me?

327
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:57,038
What did we ever have?

328
00:19:58,337 --> 00:20:01,637
We couldn't even earn enough money for a proper house...

329
00:20:02,038 --> 00:20:03,676
when we worked hard selling drinks...

330
00:20:03,677 --> 00:20:04,777
by the stinky seaside all our lives.

331
00:20:04,778 --> 00:20:06,107
But you!

332
00:20:06,347 --> 00:20:08,778
You fell for a guy who used girls to make money.

333
00:20:12,248 --> 00:20:16,157
All I could do for you as a mother...

334
00:20:16,758 --> 00:20:20,387
was to sit in a wheelchair.

335
00:20:21,058 --> 00:20:24,797
That's why. Since you listened to me,

336
00:20:24,798 --> 00:20:28,167
you were able to become a CEO's wife...

337
00:20:28,498 --> 00:20:30,397
and have people call you madam.

338
00:20:31,298 --> 00:20:32,938
Aren't I right?

339
00:20:33,837 --> 00:20:35,167
I got divorced.

340
00:20:36,637 --> 00:20:38,406
You know how to speak.

341
00:20:38,407 --> 00:20:40,278
Because I listened to you,

342
00:20:40,778 --> 00:20:42,377
her grandmother...

343
00:20:44,048 --> 00:20:45,548
almost died.

344
00:20:55,228 --> 00:20:56,327
Gosh.

345
00:20:57,127 --> 00:21:00,827
Gosh. I thought I forgot everything about her.

346
00:21:03,298 --> 00:21:07,208
My heart hurts whenever I see her.

347
00:21:09,637 --> 00:21:12,438
Seriously, why is she still with a guy like that?

348
00:21:14,948 --> 00:21:16,008
Kang Jae.

349
00:21:17,048 --> 00:21:18,778
You really need to date someone else.

350
00:21:19,417 --> 00:21:20,948
That way, you can forget about her soon.

351
00:21:23,788 --> 00:21:26,258
I really can't trust anyone.

352
00:21:27,258 --> 00:21:29,427
But thank you for believing me.

353
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:32,998
Kang Jae.

354
00:21:34,728 --> 00:21:35,927
Look at me.

355
00:21:37,637 --> 00:21:39,038
Yes, why?

356
00:21:39,708 --> 00:21:41,337
Consider me as well.

357
00:21:41,637 --> 00:21:43,337
I am, aren't I?

358
00:21:46,008 --> 00:21:47,147
Forget it.

359
00:21:48,978 --> 00:21:50,117
Give me your car keys.

360
00:21:51,478 --> 00:21:52,647
Hey.

361
00:22:16,727 --> 00:22:18,757
Mother, this is a misunderstanding.

362
00:22:18,758 --> 00:22:20,457
Is this why you came to my house?

363
00:22:20,627 --> 00:22:22,926
- Well... - Mom.

364
00:22:22,927 --> 00:22:24,626
Can you do such a thing where grown-ups live?

365
00:22:24,627 --> 00:22:27,067
No, Mother. Really, that's not it.

366
00:22:27,068 --> 00:22:29,067
We were talking about our school days...

367
00:22:29,068 --> 00:22:31,136
- and lost track of time. - I don't want to hear it.

368
00:22:31,137 --> 00:22:32,837
My daughter was never this way.

369
00:22:32,838 --> 00:22:34,607
Mom, that's not it.

370
00:22:34,608 --> 00:22:36,946
What's going on? You slept together?

371
00:22:36,947 --> 00:22:39,077
No. It's a misunderstanding.

372
00:22:39,078 --> 00:22:40,577
It's not a misunderstanding.

373
00:22:40,578 --> 00:22:42,417
I saw it with my two eyes.

374
00:22:42,917 --> 00:22:44,988
If it's spilled milk, there's nothing you can do about it.

375
00:22:45,288 --> 00:22:47,217
Raphael, we need to set a date soon.

376
00:22:47,358 --> 00:22:49,788
Let's set a date soon and get you married.

377
00:22:49,957 --> 00:22:51,427
Mom, are you out of your mind?

378
00:22:55,627 --> 00:22:58,197
Woo Ri, I told you.

379
00:22:58,367 --> 00:23:01,598
You and him, I don't think it's the right match.

380
00:23:02,397 --> 00:23:05,206
It hurts me that you're saying this about the person I like.

381
00:23:05,207 --> 00:23:06,906
I'm telling you from experience.

382
00:23:06,907 --> 00:23:08,976
That feeling won't last long.

383
00:23:08,977 --> 00:23:11,508
It's just a short fling.

384
00:23:11,608 --> 00:23:14,017
He wouldn't have had an interest in you...

385
00:23:14,018 --> 00:23:15,377
if it weren't for the baby.

386
00:23:16,177 --> 00:23:17,517
He's a different kind of person.

387
00:23:17,518 --> 00:23:20,058
He's not your match. I don't think it'll work out for you.

388
00:23:20,387 --> 00:23:22,987
You'll only get hurt when that happens.

389
00:23:22,988 --> 00:23:24,687
I'm worried about that.

390
00:23:26,427 --> 00:23:28,357
- Thank you. - Thank you.

391
00:23:28,358 --> 00:23:29,926
- Bye. - Thank you.

392
00:23:29,927 --> 00:23:31,126
Bye.

393
00:23:37,937 --> 00:23:41,207
I thought I was good at reading the air.

394
00:23:41,608 --> 00:23:44,508
But I guess I missed something. I'm sorry.

395
00:23:46,008 --> 00:23:48,676
I tried hard not to show my feelings...

396
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:49,947
for Woo Ri.

397
00:23:50,018 --> 00:23:51,088
I know.

398
00:23:51,217 --> 00:23:54,818
Thinking about it, I guess I know exactly why you are this way.

399
00:23:56,358 --> 00:23:59,587
Woo Ri is your precious daughter...

400
00:23:59,588 --> 00:24:01,397
and dating a divorcee like me.

401
00:24:01,627 --> 00:24:03,098
You must be quite upset.

402
00:24:04,227 --> 00:24:06,667
And I'm the reason why she is pregnant.

403
00:24:07,897 --> 00:24:11,068
And that's why she broke up with her boyfriend.

404
00:24:12,667 --> 00:24:14,107
You know it too well.

405
00:24:14,108 --> 00:24:16,907
Yes, I do.

406
00:24:17,977 --> 00:24:20,117
But there's a reason I asked her out.

407
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:22,977
Reason?

408
00:24:24,617 --> 00:24:26,518
The situation is difficult right now.

409
00:24:27,088 --> 00:24:29,117
But I'm confident that I can make her happy.

410
00:24:30,457 --> 00:24:33,927
I was never this confident in my life.

411
00:24:35,558 --> 00:24:37,896
Since my feelings for Woo Ri are firm,

412
00:24:37,897 --> 00:24:39,627
I'm confident that I can stay on track.

413
00:24:39,897 --> 00:24:43,108
I'm more confident than anyone in the world.

414
00:24:45,738 --> 00:24:46,838
Please trust me.

415
00:24:47,937 --> 00:24:51,677
Are you confident that you will never hurt my daughter?

416
00:24:54,348 --> 00:24:55,348
Yes, I am.

417
00:24:56,248 --> 00:24:59,348
I will prove myself with actions than words.

418
00:25:07,897 --> 00:25:08,998
Ms. Oh Woo Ri?

419
00:25:22,407 --> 00:25:23,677
Come on.

420
00:25:28,617 --> 00:25:29,647
Dad,

421
00:25:29,917 --> 00:25:32,417
you should've informed me earlier. What's all this?

422
00:25:32,687 --> 00:25:35,657
Let's have dinner together. Let's eat since you are here.

423
00:25:35,988 --> 00:25:38,687
- Help yourself. - Thank you.

424
00:25:41,227 --> 00:25:43,528
Since you're here. Let me say this quickly.

425
00:25:44,367 --> 00:25:47,367
I'd like for you to make your decision soon.

426
00:25:47,867 --> 00:25:51,067
Gosh, Dad. Don't do this. Don't.

427
00:25:51,068 --> 00:25:52,437
No, but I must.

428
00:25:52,568 --> 00:25:55,338
The faster you get married,

429
00:25:55,738 --> 00:25:58,278
the better it is for the baby.

430
00:25:59,548 --> 00:26:01,518
He says I'm being hasty.

431
00:26:01,647 --> 00:26:05,147
But some live happily after getting married in a month.

432
00:26:06,088 --> 00:26:07,117
Ms. Oh.

433
00:26:08,417 --> 00:26:11,288
Are you not considering marriage, by any chance?

434
00:26:15,697 --> 00:26:17,226
No, it's not that.

435
00:26:17,227 --> 00:26:18,627
That's fine then.

436
00:26:20,038 --> 00:26:23,768
And one other thing that I'm concerned about is...

437
00:26:25,738 --> 00:26:27,976
your work in the entertainment business.

438
00:26:27,977 --> 00:26:29,238
It must be hard.

439
00:26:30,508 --> 00:26:33,107
I enjoy doing it, so I don't find it difficult.

440
00:26:33,108 --> 00:26:34,778
Right.

441
00:26:37,147 --> 00:26:40,258
I think you should slowly start to end things at work...

442
00:26:40,558 --> 00:26:42,058
and focus on the baby now.

443
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:45,887
And when you get married you shouldn't work.

444
00:26:46,897 --> 00:26:49,656
Both couples work when you need the money.

445
00:26:49,657 --> 00:26:52,397
- But you don't have to with us. - You should really stop.

446
00:26:53,268 --> 00:26:55,598
Woo Ri, you must be uncomfortable. Let's go.

447
00:26:56,498 --> 00:26:59,568
Why would we when he's treating us to nice food?

448
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:08,548
I'll keep in mind the things you are saying.

449
00:27:09,318 --> 00:27:11,787
However, what you think...

450
00:27:11,788 --> 00:27:13,988
and what I think may be different.

451
00:27:14,617 --> 00:27:16,517
I'll consider it carefully...

452
00:27:16,518 --> 00:27:18,727
and make the final decision myself.

453
00:27:33,437 --> 00:27:35,677
My dad's a bit insisting.

454
00:27:36,377 --> 00:27:38,748
Just let go of the things you don't want to hear.

455
00:27:39,877 --> 00:27:42,377
He's just worried, that's all.

456
00:27:43,288 --> 00:27:47,588
And I do understand why he wants us to hurry up with the marriage.

457
00:27:51,187 --> 00:27:52,328
But...

458
00:27:55,727 --> 00:27:59,298
I want to do this at my pace and not others.

459
00:28:00,867 --> 00:28:01,897
Of course.

460
00:28:02,137 --> 00:28:04,667
You should think carefully and make up your mind.

461
00:28:05,238 --> 00:28:08,137
And thank you for understanding my dad.

462
00:28:13,818 --> 00:28:15,617
It's Grandmother.

463
00:28:17,187 --> 00:28:18,348
Yes, Grandmother?

464
00:28:20,488 --> 00:28:22,257
- Pardon? - What is it?

465
00:28:22,258 --> 00:28:23,687
I had dinner already.

466
00:28:23,758 --> 00:28:27,557
Then you should've called. I waited.

467
00:28:27,558 --> 00:28:28,627
Right.

468
00:28:29,328 --> 00:28:32,568
I'm sorry. I should've called.

469
00:28:33,568 --> 00:28:35,598
No, we're nearby. We'll be home soon.

470
00:28:36,238 --> 00:28:37,768
All right then.

471
00:28:42,538 --> 00:28:45,976
I didn't know we should've called.

472
00:28:45,977 --> 00:28:48,147
Why? What did she say?

473
00:28:48,548 --> 00:28:51,716
She said I needed to call ahead if I'm eating out.

474
00:28:51,717 --> 00:28:54,187
What? You didn't call her?

475
00:28:54,957 --> 00:28:57,058
- No, I didn't. - I called.

476
00:28:57,187 --> 00:29:01,028
I have lived alone since middle school,

477
00:29:01,298 --> 00:29:02,798
so I didn't know I had to.

478
00:29:03,427 --> 00:29:04,598
What do I do?

479
00:29:06,098 --> 00:29:08,568
It's okay.

480
00:29:12,367 --> 00:29:14,238
I just got scolded by Grandmother.

481
00:29:15,407 --> 00:29:17,677
- But why do I feel good? - What?

482
00:29:18,147 --> 00:29:20,617
This must be what family is like.

483
00:29:24,488 --> 00:29:27,417
Gosh, I have to go back tomorrow.

484
00:29:27,957 --> 00:29:29,818
Time really flies.

485
00:29:31,288 --> 00:29:34,598
I'd like to stay a few more days. But if I do that,

486
00:29:34,998 --> 00:29:36,827
it would be an inconvenience, wouldn't it?

487
00:29:36,828 --> 00:29:38,426
- Yes, it would. - Right.

488
00:29:38,427 --> 00:29:39,998
Wait, what? What did you say?

489
00:29:40,867 --> 00:29:42,397
I'm sorry. I'm only joking.

490
00:29:44,038 --> 00:29:47,838
Shall we walk holding hands until the end of the street there?

491
00:29:52,108 --> 00:29:53,177
Yes.

492
00:29:58,887 --> 00:30:00,818
I had a great time. Thanks to you, Grandmother.

493
00:30:01,318 --> 00:30:02,387
That's great.

494
00:30:02,457 --> 00:30:04,758
Come anytime like it's your home.

495
00:30:06,528 --> 00:30:07,627
Raphael,

496
00:30:07,727 --> 00:30:09,627
you can't go to the TV station since you need to go to work, right?

497
00:30:11,367 --> 00:30:12,998
Can I go there as well?

498
00:30:13,667 --> 00:30:15,967
You can if you want to. Nobody's stopping you.

499
00:30:19,538 --> 00:30:21,078
I already took a day off today.

500
00:30:21,677 --> 00:30:23,207
Let's go.

501
00:30:29,578 --> 00:30:30,748
Gosh.

502
00:30:31,447 --> 00:30:33,017
What is this?

503
00:30:33,018 --> 00:30:34,156
This isn't me.

504
00:30:36,117 --> 00:30:37,387
Seoung Il.

505
00:30:37,588 --> 00:30:38,887
What is this?

506
00:30:39,457 --> 00:30:42,328
I had it ready to serve everyone comfortably.

507
00:30:43,058 --> 00:30:44,797
Wouldn't people think that Jang Yoon Jeong is in it...

508
00:30:44,798 --> 00:30:46,837
if we ride in this?

509
00:30:46,838 --> 00:30:48,637
Eun Ran is better at singing.

510
00:30:48,867 --> 00:30:50,407
Eun Ran,

511
00:30:50,707 --> 00:30:53,437
you look really beautiful today.

512
00:30:55,038 --> 00:30:57,048
Don't be nervous. Just do it with energy.

513
00:30:57,248 --> 00:30:58,607
I'm not nervous.

514
00:30:58,608 --> 00:31:00,348
I'll just be myself.

515
00:31:00,617 --> 00:31:02,047
You're being so particular.

516
00:31:02,048 --> 00:31:03,887
Aren't you too relaxed?

517
00:31:04,288 --> 00:31:05,946
Didn't I tell you to only take a calming pill?

518
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:07,558
Gosh, Mom.

519
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:09,717
Who else is coming?

520
00:31:10,858 --> 00:31:12,088
Right, your boyfriend.

521
00:31:12,328 --> 00:31:15,328
Seoung Il, they broke up. Didn't you know?

522
00:31:16,558 --> 00:31:17,727
What?

523
00:31:17,998 --> 00:31:19,828
I didn't know.

524
00:31:19,927 --> 00:31:21,038
When?

525
00:31:21,397 --> 00:31:23,667
It's a bit hectic. I need to focus.

526
00:31:26,768 --> 00:31:28,137
Right. Let's go.

527
00:31:28,808 --> 00:31:29,937
Let's go!

528
00:31:30,808 --> 00:31:33,078
Gosh, you didn't need to go this far.

529
00:31:33,278 --> 00:31:35,018
This is too much.

530
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:41,518
Hello.

531
00:31:41,917 --> 00:31:44,887
I'm Oh Eun Ran. Participant 142.

532
00:31:47,397 --> 00:31:49,197
Let's hear you sing then.

533
00:31:49,397 --> 00:31:50,397
Yes.

534
00:32:17,627 --> 00:32:22,758
I don't know yet

535
00:32:23,828 --> 00:32:27,637
What the eyes that met are saying

536
00:32:29,838 --> 00:32:32,936
I don't know

537
00:32:32,937 --> 00:32:35,578
I really don't know

538
00:32:36,278 --> 00:32:41,017
My heart just beats

539
00:32:41,018 --> 00:32:42,616
Oh,

540
00:32:43,917 --> 00:32:48,117
It must have been love

541
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:54,058
I don't know yet

542
00:32:54,998 --> 00:32:58,998
What the whispering gaze is saying

543
00:33:00,967 --> 00:33:04,067
I don't know

544
00:33:04,068 --> 00:33:06,738
I really don't know

545
00:33:07,508 --> 00:33:12,206
My heart just beats

546
00:33:12,207 --> 00:33:18,818
Oh, it must have been love

547
00:33:19,717 --> 00:33:24,828
Sitting by the window when the sun sets

548
00:33:25,788 --> 00:33:31,997
I am picturing you

549
00:33:31,998 --> 00:33:35,166
Telling me that you love me

550
00:33:35,167 --> 00:33:37,907
Telling me you like me

551
00:33:38,137 --> 00:33:43,807
Tell me just like that

552
00:33:44,678 --> 00:33:49,747
I will become a beautiful star like a tear drop

553
00:33:50,948 --> 00:33:56,517
In your heart

554
00:34:25,637 --> 00:34:27,538
Oh Eun Ran, you're number one.

555
00:34:29,438 --> 00:34:30,677
Well done.

556
00:34:31,777 --> 00:34:32,878
You have passed.

557
00:34:38,217 --> 00:34:39,378
Thank you.

558
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:40,588
Thank you so much.

559
00:34:43,717 --> 00:34:44,918
Mom.

560
00:34:45,588 --> 00:34:47,058
- Good job, Mom. - Well done.

561
00:34:48,188 --> 00:34:50,227
Well done.

562
00:34:50,228 --> 00:34:51,327
Good job.

563
00:34:55,768 --> 00:34:58,467
Oh my gosh.

564
00:35:06,277 --> 00:35:08,377
You really improved in singing.

565
00:35:08,378 --> 00:35:10,546
- I had goosebumps. - Really?

566
00:35:10,547 --> 00:35:12,947
Mom, that was the best performance.

567
00:35:13,047 --> 00:35:15,487
I was so engaged in the emotions.

568
00:35:16,148 --> 00:35:18,117
- Where did Duk Chil go? - I'm not sure.

569
00:35:20,713 --> 00:35:21,873
Ma Ri.

570
00:35:23,333 --> 00:35:25,344
What is it? Is it urgent?

571
00:35:25,973 --> 00:35:27,873
If we don't execute it now, there could be big setbacks.

572
00:35:28,344 --> 00:35:29,643
That's why I came.

573
00:35:30,014 --> 00:35:31,114
Right.

574
00:35:37,583 --> 00:35:39,924
Do you think I would have made you smile like that...

575
00:35:40,993 --> 00:35:43,323
if I was raised in a happy household?

576
00:35:43,324 --> 00:35:44,623
Excuse me?

577
00:35:47,194 --> 00:35:48,433
No, nothing.

578
00:36:03,683 --> 00:36:04,713
Bye.

579
00:36:04,714 --> 00:36:05,983
- Good job. - Bye.

580
00:36:05,984 --> 00:36:08,812
Mr. Kang. Ms. Lee. Good job today.

581
00:36:08,813 --> 00:36:10,284
And thank you.

582
00:36:10,884 --> 00:36:13,023
Seoung Il, if you are grateful,

583
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:15,223
let's work on the variety show...

584
00:36:15,453 --> 00:36:17,392
I told you about once more.

585
00:36:17,393 --> 00:36:19,464
All right.

586
00:36:20,993 --> 00:36:22,162
How was she today?

587
00:36:22,163 --> 00:36:24,463
She seemed to be a bit nervous.

588
00:36:24,464 --> 00:36:25,663
Seoung Il.

589
00:36:25,933 --> 00:36:27,174
Can I be honest?

590
00:36:28,203 --> 00:36:29,973
I passed her because of you.

591
00:36:31,273 --> 00:36:33,973
She's charming and has character.

592
00:36:34,174 --> 00:36:35,443
But with her singing skills,

593
00:36:35,444 --> 00:36:36,743
it'll be difficult in the main round.

594
00:36:37,143 --> 00:36:39,683
You know that there are so many skilled singers.

595
00:36:42,554 --> 00:36:43,683
Right.

596
00:36:45,083 --> 00:36:46,284
Okay.

597
00:36:46,953 --> 00:36:48,094
Mr. Kang.

598
00:36:48,194 --> 00:36:50,693
I'll try my best...

599
00:36:50,694 --> 00:36:53,223
to go on that variety show that you're planning.

600
00:36:53,734 --> 00:36:55,563
Let's have her go on the main round.

601
00:36:55,933 --> 00:36:57,103
She should go to the main round.

602
00:36:57,850 --> 00:37:00,550
You promised. There's no turning back.

603
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:03,350
You passed the first round.

604
00:37:03,551 --> 00:37:06,290
Now you need to pass the second round and go to the main round.

605
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:07,990
I want to leave when everyone's cheering.

606
00:37:07,991 --> 00:37:11,531
Right. I'll clap for you like this when you go on to the main round.

607
00:37:12,361 --> 00:37:13,701
Duk Chil.

608
00:37:13,830 --> 00:37:15,301
What is it?

609
00:37:15,701 --> 00:37:17,100
You're really trying so hard.

610
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:20,270
For Mom and for Woo Ri.

611
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:21,810
And for me.

612
00:37:24,341 --> 00:37:25,511
Gosh.

613
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,151
I promised.

614
00:37:28,410 --> 00:37:30,210
I said I'd do better...

615
00:37:31,151 --> 00:37:32,551
for all those times I've missed out on.

616
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:47,471
- Gosh. - I almost fell for it.

617
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:54,440
Mom, are you all right?

618
00:37:55,410 --> 00:37:57,580
I really liked your performance today.

619
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:59,511
Why do you want to stop here?

620
00:38:00,951 --> 00:38:02,080
Woo Ri.

621
00:38:02,350 --> 00:38:05,350
Would you like me to be successful as a singer?

622
00:38:07,051 --> 00:38:08,390
I would.

623
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:12,790
What if I can't become anything after trying to reach my dreams?

624
00:38:15,761 --> 00:38:16,889
Mom.

625
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:18,901
I really like it when you sing.

626
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:21,171
You look the happiest when you do.

627
00:38:21,971 --> 00:38:24,240
Don't think of other things...

628
00:38:24,241 --> 00:38:25,841
and just do what you want to.

629
00:38:31,241 --> 00:38:33,281
Mom. Well...

630
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:36,480
You seem a bit more relaxed around Raphael.

631
00:38:37,151 --> 00:38:39,151
You took him to the TV station and all.

632
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:43,250
He seemed like a better person than what I worried about.

633
00:38:43,761 --> 00:38:45,491
I want to take a look at him for a while.

634
00:38:47,431 --> 00:38:48,631
I...

635
00:38:48,890 --> 00:38:51,401
was summoned by his father.

636
00:38:52,801 --> 00:38:55,230
He wanted us to get married soon.

637
00:38:55,631 --> 00:38:57,241
Grandma seems to want the same.

638
00:38:58,841 --> 00:39:01,709
I understand their positions...

639
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:04,480
You'll regret it if you decide based on what they say.

640
00:39:05,381 --> 00:39:07,409
You need to make your own decisions.

641
00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:09,651
Don't worry about it and do what you want.

642
00:39:11,281 --> 00:39:14,390
It's only been a short while since we got close.

643
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:16,520
And marriage seems like it's in the far future.

644
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:21,131
I want to do this my way and at my pace.

645
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:23,560
I don't want to be pushed into things.

646
00:39:24,861 --> 00:39:26,229
But fortunately,

647
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:29,201
he thinks the same way as I, and he respects my thoughts.

648
00:39:29,301 --> 00:39:30,401
Good.

649
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:34,070
You shouldn't get married in haste because of the baby.

650
00:39:34,071 --> 00:39:35,570
You should take your time and make that decision...

651
00:39:35,571 --> 00:39:37,580
when you're ready, so you won't regret it later.

652
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:40,080
- Okay? - Okay.

653
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:43,821
Mom, how about a drink together?

654
00:39:44,321 --> 00:39:45,451
Shall we?

655
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,120
Cheers.

656
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,710
Do you know how other regular families are?

657
00:40:18,181 --> 00:40:20,921
It's been a while since you talked to me.

658
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:24,290
If we were like everyone else,

659
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:27,660
I would have been happy with Raphael.

660
00:40:28,991 --> 00:40:30,931
Happy?

661
00:40:37,031 --> 00:40:38,071
I...

662
00:40:58,221 --> 00:40:59,361
Mom!

663
00:41:07,801 --> 00:41:09,770
When your good-for-nothing dad died,

664
00:41:15,770 --> 00:41:18,940
I thought several times about ending my life too.

665
00:41:21,281 --> 00:41:22,850
But you kept me alive.

666
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:26,721
When our gas was cut off,

667
00:41:26,850 --> 00:41:29,321
we boiled water, put it in a bottle, and hugged it at night.

668
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:32,720
I did everything I could,

669
00:41:32,721 --> 00:41:34,591
so people wouldn't think you were poor.

670
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:37,330
Gosh.

671
00:41:39,131 --> 00:41:40,201
Goodness.

672
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:47,341
You made me keep going despite everything.

673
00:41:47,841 --> 00:41:48,870
You did.

674
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:55,011
I was in a wheelchair for three years to help you.

675
00:41:56,710 --> 00:41:59,980
But you won't forgive me, right?

676
00:42:01,591 --> 00:42:04,761
You won't work with me anymore, right?

677
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:06,790
Thought so.

678
00:42:09,830 --> 00:42:11,560
That's the end of us, right?

679
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:14,631
It's over, isn't it?

680
00:42:18,071 --> 00:42:19,571
I really hate you!

681
00:42:22,741 --> 00:42:23,841
What?

682
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:28,350
You conned your own daughter.

683
00:42:29,210 --> 00:42:31,580
And now that I caught you, you want us to be over?

684
00:42:31,921 --> 00:42:34,050
You won't even talk to me!

685
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:37,921
Yes! I won't work with you anymore!

686
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:41,660
I'm going to stop conning people now!

687
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:45,500
And that means it's over between us?

688
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:48,330
There won't be a reason for us to see each other?

689
00:42:48,931 --> 00:42:50,670
We're all each other has in this world!

690
00:42:50,671 --> 00:42:52,600
How could we cut off ties?

691
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:58,310
Mom, I'm your family.

692
00:43:00,281 --> 00:43:01,611
Familial bonds...

693
00:43:03,181 --> 00:43:05,350
can't be broken until death.

694
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:13,491
Seriously.

695
00:43:15,431 --> 00:43:18,131
You have no place to go. Why did you pack your stuff?

696
00:44:29,131 --> 00:44:30,500
I hear in people's last moments,

697
00:44:31,341 --> 00:44:34,071
the happiest memories they have flash before their eyes.

698
00:44:36,370 --> 00:44:38,881
Personally, the three days I spent at your mother's house...

699
00:44:39,111 --> 00:44:40,480
are my happiest moments for now.

700
00:44:49,421 --> 00:44:50,491
Bok Dol.

701
00:44:51,991 --> 00:44:55,960
Daddy wants to make a happy family.

702
00:44:57,631 --> 00:44:59,361
I thought a lot about it,

703
00:45:00,401 --> 00:45:01,870
and now, I'm finally ready.

704
00:45:04,370 --> 00:45:07,640
I didn't know I would feel certain this fast.

705
00:45:20,821 --> 00:45:23,151
Gosh. Why isn't there anything?

706
00:45:24,421 --> 00:45:26,221
What was the necklace in the safe?

707
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:29,631
Did I fall into the trap to frame Kim Bok Rae?

708
00:45:36,330 --> 00:45:38,071
What? Hold on.

709
00:46:26,350 --> 00:46:28,849
It's the left foot. Right foot in front of the left foot.

710
00:46:28,850 --> 00:46:31,090
In 1, 2, 3. 1.

711
00:46:31,091 --> 00:46:33,619
Jump. Left foot. Left side.

712
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:34,631
There you go.

713
00:46:35,131 --> 00:46:37,361
- One. Jump. - What's he doing now?

714
00:46:37,431 --> 00:46:40,361
- Left arm. Left foot. Left side. - That...

715
00:46:46,370 --> 00:46:48,040
Hey, Na Hee. What is it?

716
00:46:49,770 --> 00:46:51,939
I told you I would keep digging when you got benched.

717
00:46:51,940 --> 00:46:53,040
This is it.

718
00:46:53,611 --> 00:46:56,051
If he secretly gave new faces to the criminals,

719
00:46:56,281 --> 00:46:58,181
a doctor must have done the surgery.

720
00:46:58,321 --> 00:47:00,320
Lee Jong Gu, No Man Chul, and Shin Mi Young.

721
00:47:00,321 --> 00:47:01,890
They all gambled at the same parlour.

722
00:47:06,921 --> 00:47:08,630
Gosh. I lost everything.

723
00:47:08,631 --> 00:47:10,690
Isn't he a doctor at Diamond Medical Foundation?

724
00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:14,631
Lee Jong Gu. Yes, he's a doctor.

725
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:17,571
I heard people with good jobs loved places like this.

726
00:47:18,140 --> 00:47:20,769
Hey, you'll win some tomorrow. Dr. Lee is going home. Say bye.

727
00:47:20,770 --> 00:47:21,940
- Bye. - Bye.

728
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:27,781
If he has the list we're looking for, it's over.

729
00:47:28,850 --> 00:47:30,011
You want to go there now?

730
00:47:30,921 --> 00:47:32,980
We don't have a warrant. You can't barge in there.

731
00:47:33,421 --> 00:47:35,249
If we report this to the higher-ups and follow the protocol,

732
00:47:35,250 --> 00:47:36,451
we can't catch Chairman Kim.

733
00:47:37,591 --> 00:47:38,920
Kang Jae! Hold on!

734
00:47:38,921 --> 00:47:42,091
Right here. I can give you double eyelids here.

735
00:47:42,230 --> 00:47:45,460
As for the fat under your eyes, I can reposition it.

736
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:49,201
And I can finish with a facelift.

737
00:47:49,770 --> 00:47:50,801
Okay.

738
00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:53,599
Gosh.

739
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:56,110
- Who's Lee Jong Gu? - Pardon?

740
00:47:56,111 --> 00:47:58,110
My sister sleeps with her eyes open!

741
00:47:58,111 --> 00:48:00,341
- I want to see the doctor! - Excuse me.

742
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:01,951
You can't do this here.

743
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:05,850
- Where's the doctor? Doctor! - I'm Lee Jong Gu.

744
00:48:06,181 --> 00:48:07,479
- Hey. - What's this about?

745
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:08,689
- Are you Lee Jong Gu? - Yes.

746
00:48:08,690 --> 00:48:10,120
What are you going to do about my sister's eyes?

747
00:48:10,491 --> 00:48:12,189
- Your sister? - She sleeps with her eyes open.

748
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:29,841
I just want to talk to you. You can't go in there now!

749
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:35,980
Nice.

750
00:48:44,921 --> 00:48:46,890
Detective Lee Kang Jae.

751
00:48:47,091 --> 00:48:48,631
What's up with his face?

752
00:48:51,330 --> 00:48:53,159
I told them to report to me if you showed up here.

753
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:55,600
Well, are you here to get your quote today?

754
00:48:55,931 --> 00:48:57,030
He's a detective?

755
00:48:57,031 --> 00:49:00,740
Yes. Well, I wanted to look handsome.

756
00:49:00,741 --> 00:49:03,440
Detective Lee, I can't let this slide anymore.

757
00:49:04,210 --> 00:49:06,181
Bring me a warrant and do your job properly.

758
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:08,210
Then I'll help you with everything.

759
00:49:23,690 --> 00:49:24,801
Hello?

760
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:27,301
Yes, this is him.

761
00:49:27,830 --> 00:49:29,370
I know who Chairman Kim is.

762
00:49:30,531 --> 00:49:31,600
Detective,

763
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:33,971
can you help me?

764
00:49:40,688 --> 00:49:41,717
What is this?

765
00:49:42,318 --> 00:49:43,787
What? Where is he?

766
00:49:45,887 --> 00:49:47,657
Lee Jong Gu!

767
00:49:51,997 --> 00:49:53,168
Lee Jong Gu!

768
00:49:55,398 --> 00:49:56,568
Kang Jae!

769
00:49:56,668 --> 00:49:57,807
Right here!

770
00:50:21,628 --> 00:50:22,958
Where are we going?

771
00:50:24,827 --> 00:50:25,898
Here you go.

772
00:50:26,811 --> 00:50:28,137
- Gosh! - Here.

773
00:50:32,967 --> 00:50:35,407
You wanted to see me today for this?

774
00:50:35,838 --> 00:50:37,307
You said you wanted her autograph.

775
00:50:37,438 --> 00:50:38,577
I like her book too.

776
00:50:39,508 --> 00:50:41,317
- Please wait in line for us. - Gosh.

777
00:50:41,318 --> 00:50:43,048
- Excuse me for a moment. - Okay.

778
00:51:32,197 --> 00:51:33,398
Me?

779
00:51:33,427 --> 00:51:35,197
Gosh, no. I'm good with just watching.

780
00:51:38,967 --> 00:51:40,438
- You're so cool! - Nice!

781
00:51:52,117 --> 00:51:53,818
I told him not to do stuff like this.

782
00:52:39,168 --> 00:52:40,467
Am I dreaming?

783
00:52:52,077 --> 00:52:54,418
Will you marry me?

784
00:53:00,517 --> 00:53:01,717
No.

785
00:53:02,117 --> 00:53:03,958
What... What?

786
00:53:07,287 --> 00:53:09,657
- Oh, no. - She said no!

787
00:53:10,097 --> 00:53:11,497
- I feel so bad. - This is awful.

788
00:53:14,168 --> 00:53:15,696
Hey, block this area!

789
00:53:15,697 --> 00:53:18,137
I told you to seal this area first!

790
00:53:21,008 --> 00:53:22,008
Lee Jong Gu is the doctor...

791
00:53:22,009 --> 00:53:23,807
who did plastic surgery for the criminals?

792
00:53:24,747 --> 00:53:26,608
As soon as you approached him, he turned up dead?

793
00:53:27,577 --> 00:53:29,747
You didn't find the murder weapon at the scene?

794
00:53:30,247 --> 00:53:31,347
No.

795
00:53:32,188 --> 00:53:34,858
But the stab wound on the neck matches Chairman Kim's MO.

796
00:53:36,217 --> 00:53:37,517
Before Lee Jong Gu died,

797
00:53:37,717 --> 00:53:40,157
he asked for my help and said he knew who Chairman Kim was.

798
00:53:40,387 --> 00:53:42,057
I'm sure Chairman Kim killed him.

799
00:53:44,827 --> 00:53:47,867
Someone from Diamond was murdered again. Gosh.

800
00:53:49,398 --> 00:53:50,867
Hey, something isn't right here.

801
00:53:52,907 --> 00:53:54,637
Where's Na Hee?

802
00:54:25,568 --> 00:54:26,907
Gosh.

803
00:54:31,778 --> 00:54:33,008
Captain!

804
00:54:33,577 --> 00:54:35,548
The security camera at the entrance caught someone we all know.

805
00:54:40,548 --> 00:54:41,758
Look at this.

806
00:55:06,608 --> 00:55:08,918
I thought a lot about it,

807
00:55:09,878 --> 00:55:12,287
and I put a lot of effort into it. But I failed.

808
00:55:15,188 --> 00:55:17,017
I don't know, Raphael.

809
00:55:18,688 --> 00:55:20,858
I thought we had the same pace.

810
00:55:23,497 --> 00:55:27,168
I rarely felt this sure of something in my life.

811
00:55:28,938 --> 00:55:32,338
It's been only a month since we talked about our feelings.

812
00:55:32,508 --> 00:55:34,136
Is it possible you brought up marriage...

813
00:55:34,137 --> 00:55:36,838
for another reason, not because you felt sure of us?

814
00:55:38,447 --> 00:55:40,577
What other reason could there be?

815
00:55:40,847 --> 00:55:42,878
I'm thinking about Bok Dol the most.

816
00:55:47,217 --> 00:55:49,017
So that's what this was to you too.

817
00:55:50,717 --> 00:55:51,858
Pardon?

818
00:55:52,088 --> 00:55:53,327
It's about the baby, isn't it?

819
00:55:53,927 --> 00:55:55,357
You proposed to me for the baby's sake,

820
00:55:55,358 --> 00:55:56,827
not because of your feelings for me.

821
00:55:58,668 --> 00:55:59,867
What...

822
00:56:00,097 --> 00:56:01,838
We're having a baby.

823
00:56:02,068 --> 00:56:03,567
Why is that weird?

824
00:56:03,568 --> 00:56:05,906
I like you for who you are,

825
00:56:05,907 --> 00:56:08,107
not because you're the baby's father.

826
00:56:08,108 --> 00:56:10,437
I like you for who you are too.

827
00:56:10,438 --> 00:56:12,708
I'm not forcing myself to like you for the baby's sake.

828
00:56:18,287 --> 00:56:21,517
I didn't know my proposal would upset you.

829
00:56:23,458 --> 00:56:25,627
No. There was nothing wrong with your proposal.

830
00:56:25,628 --> 00:56:28,927
I just think that it's not normal to think about marriage now.

831
00:56:40,508 --> 00:56:41,576
Woo Ri.

832
00:56:41,577 --> 00:56:43,508
What's so bad about marriage?

833
00:56:44,008 --> 00:56:46,278
You can't say that if you really care about the baby.

834
00:56:47,307 --> 00:56:48,576
I'm going to marry...

835
00:56:48,577 --> 00:56:51,386
the man I'll spend the rest of my life with.

836
00:56:51,387 --> 00:56:54,148
I will never get married for a different reason.

837
00:56:54,247 --> 00:56:55,617
And that's what's best for the baby.

838
00:56:55,758 --> 00:56:57,556
Marrying me, the father of the baby,

839
00:56:57,557 --> 00:56:59,327
is what's good for the baby.

840
00:57:00,458 --> 00:57:02,227
Woo Ri. You're telling me...

841
00:57:02,228 --> 00:57:04,097
your feelings are more important than the baby's happiness.

842
00:57:04,528 --> 00:57:06,196
That's way too selfish.

843
00:57:06,197 --> 00:57:08,938
No. That's what's best for the baby, not me!

844
00:57:27,517 --> 00:57:30,217
Is marrying for the sake of giving the baby a father good for the baby?

845
00:57:33,327 --> 00:57:34,657
How could you say that to me?

846
00:57:34,827 --> 00:57:36,128
I'm the baby's father.

847
00:57:36,958 --> 00:57:39,167
My mother and my grandmother...

848
00:57:39,168 --> 00:57:41,338
raised me well without husbands.

849
00:57:42,267 --> 00:57:44,398
Is not having a father bad for the baby?

850
00:57:44,938 --> 00:57:46,207
So...

851
00:57:46,208 --> 00:57:48,906
if I force myself to get married, lying to myself about my feelings,

852
00:57:48,907 --> 00:57:50,507
will that make the baby happy?

853
00:57:50,508 --> 00:57:51,648
Woo Ri!

854
00:58:00,688 --> 00:58:02,088
I can raise this baby well...

855
00:58:02,458 --> 00:58:04,418
even if I have to do it by myself.

856
00:58:55,537 --> 00:58:57,437
I felt lost before.

857
00:58:57,438 --> 00:58:59,177
But now, I know I can do everything.

858
00:58:59,247 --> 00:59:02,147
I want to undo what happened, but I don't know how.

859
00:59:02,148 --> 00:59:03,447
You're all I need.

860
00:59:03,577 --> 00:59:05,246
I hope you know that I mean it.

861
00:59:05,247 --> 00:59:06,588
- Date me! - Date me, please!

862
00:59:07,217 --> 00:59:08,588
The police did what to you?

863
00:59:09,188 --> 00:59:10,418
Hey, we caught Chairman Kim!

864
00:59:10,657 --> 00:59:11,826
It's over now.

865
00:59:11,827 --> 00:59:14,087
Fleeing right now is a serious offence!

866
00:59:14,088 --> 00:59:15,696
The chairman didn't run away.

867
00:59:15,697 --> 00:59:17,258
It's the perpetrator who was at my house.

868
00:59:17,497 --> 00:59:18,866
I followed the perpetrator.

869
00:59:18,867 --> 00:59:20,568
He must be Chairman Kim!

870
00:59:21,528 --> 00:59:22,699
Get out of the car!
