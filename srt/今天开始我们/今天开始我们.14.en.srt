1
00:00:05,836 --> 00:00:07,235
Woo Ri.

2
00:00:08,576 --> 00:00:11,205
You must go first. Make up your mind.

3
00:00:11,406 --> 00:00:12,476
Well...

4
00:00:14,815 --> 00:00:18,086
Actually, I already made up my mind.

5
00:00:19,656 --> 00:00:21,955
You did? Who is it?

6
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:24,156
I've...

7
00:00:27,495 --> 00:00:28,926
decided...

8
00:00:32,065 --> 00:00:34,265
I'll tell him tomorrow.

9
00:00:34,396 --> 00:00:35,705
- Gosh. - Gosh.

10
00:00:36,635 --> 00:00:39,876
It's your day today. I can't steal your thunder.

11
00:00:40,805 --> 00:00:42,545
Mom. Dad. Congratulations on your engagement!

12
00:00:47,915 --> 00:00:49,245
Enjoy the food.

13
00:00:52,986 --> 00:00:54,555
It will all end tomorrow.

14
00:00:55,025 --> 00:00:57,285
- Enjoy the food. - I won't have to see you again.

15
00:00:57,286 --> 00:00:58,725
You were sort of growing on me.

16
00:00:58,726 --> 00:01:00,426
I thought you would be thrilled not to see me.

17
00:01:00,596 --> 00:01:01,794
Once she announces her decision tomorrow,

18
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:04,194
let's accept her decision like gentlemen.

19
00:01:04,195 --> 00:01:06,536
You took the words out of my mouth.

20
00:01:07,295 --> 00:01:09,134
Don't be pathetic or clingy.

21
00:01:09,135 --> 00:01:11,005
I hope you will be a mature guy on your last day with her.

22
00:01:11,006 --> 00:01:12,536
Or you'll make Woo Ri feel uncomfortable.

23
00:01:12,706 --> 00:01:15,206
Last day? I'll keep seeing her because I'm the baby's father.

24
00:01:16,445 --> 00:01:18,875
I'll also keep seeing her because we go to the same church.

25
00:01:18,876 --> 00:01:20,616
Gosh. Church.

26
00:01:22,045 --> 00:01:24,684
Hey, you guys. Did you eat a lot?

27
00:01:24,685 --> 00:01:26,685
Gosh. The food was delicious.

28
00:01:26,885 --> 00:01:29,486
Your food is the tastiest.

29
00:01:29,555 --> 00:01:30,824
I'm so stuffed.

30
00:01:30,825 --> 00:01:33,154
All right. You should take some food before you leave.

31
00:01:33,155 --> 00:01:34,694
- Yes, ma'am. - Okay.

32
00:01:34,695 --> 00:01:35,695
Great.

33
00:01:37,295 --> 00:01:39,066
- Hey. - I didn't know.

34
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:40,794
All right. Let's enjoy our meal.

35
00:01:40,795 --> 00:01:42,735
- Mom. This is so good. - Mother.

36
00:01:42,736 --> 00:01:44,736
Mother, have some shrimp.

37
00:01:45,005 --> 00:01:46,374
- Have some shrimps. - Okay.

38
00:01:46,375 --> 00:01:48,805
Let's have the shrimps and octopus. Let's eat a lot!

39
00:01:50,345 --> 00:01:52,546
- Woo Ri, have some octopus. - This one?

40
00:01:55,886 --> 00:01:57,046
Are you that happy?

41
00:01:57,785 --> 00:02:01,086
Woo Ri, what about you? Did you make up your mind?

42
00:02:01,356 --> 00:02:03,426
Are you finally ready to get married?

43
00:02:04,785 --> 00:02:05,796
Yes.

44
00:02:06,326 --> 00:02:09,494
Which one is it? I'm dying out of curiosity.

45
00:02:09,495 --> 00:02:11,735
Can you just tell me?

46
00:02:11,736 --> 00:02:13,696
He will be the first one to know.

47
00:02:13,836 --> 00:02:15,636
I haven't told anyone yet.

48
00:02:16,405 --> 00:02:18,205
We have to wait until tomorrow then.

49
00:02:18,206 --> 00:02:20,535
I can't wait to find out!

50
00:02:24,446 --> 00:02:27,676
By the way, did I eat too much?

51
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:29,615
Why does my stomach hurt?

52
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:31,714
Your stomach shouldn't hurt when you're pregnant.

53
00:02:31,715 --> 00:02:33,314
- Bring some digestive pills. - Okay.

54
00:02:33,315 --> 00:02:35,125
No. I'll take it myself.

55
00:02:35,525 --> 00:02:38,055
Go to the hospital if the pain persists. Okay?

56
00:02:39,696 --> 00:02:42,365
Gosh. Today was a milestone for us.

57
00:02:42,366 --> 00:02:44,396
I'll get a good night's sleep today.

58
00:02:45,095 --> 00:02:46,766
I know I'll sleep soundly tonight.

59
00:02:47,266 --> 00:02:49,266
Hey, put on the ring.

60
00:02:49,505 --> 00:02:50,736
- Should I? - Yes.

61
00:02:51,405 --> 00:02:54,005
- It's beautiful. - How beautiful. Put that on.

62
00:02:59,176 --> 00:03:00,374
Hello?

63
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:02,516
Good morning, Woo Ri.

64
00:03:02,745 --> 00:03:03,946
What time should we meet today?

65
00:03:04,185 --> 00:03:06,016
Should I go to your studio?

66
00:03:06,456 --> 00:03:07,516
I...

67
00:03:08,755 --> 00:03:11,355
I'm getting a call.

68
00:03:11,356 --> 00:03:12,826
I'll call you.

69
00:03:17,065 --> 00:03:18,125
Hey.

70
00:03:18,696 --> 00:03:20,865
Woo Ri. Are you at work?

71
00:03:20,866 --> 00:03:22,706
I'm on my way to work now.

72
00:03:22,965 --> 00:03:25,504
I see. Today is my day off.

73
00:03:25,505 --> 00:03:28,274
I'm free all day. Call me anytime.

74
00:03:28,275 --> 00:03:31,646
- Okay? - Okay. I'll call you.

75
00:03:33,475 --> 00:03:35,016
You have appendicitis.

76
00:03:35,345 --> 00:03:36,586
Appendicitis?

77
00:03:37,516 --> 00:03:39,684
I was fine yesterday.

78
00:03:39,685 --> 00:03:41,684
Every patient shows different symptoms.

79
00:03:41,685 --> 00:03:43,725
Some people don't know until their appendix ruptures.

80
00:03:44,386 --> 00:03:46,195
Luckily, your case isn't serious.

81
00:03:46,196 --> 00:03:47,755
We can perform the surgery with the laparoscope.

82
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:52,164
But I'm...

83
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:55,635
pregnant. Will that be safe for the baby?

84
00:03:55,636 --> 00:03:56,935
I'm aware of that.

85
00:03:56,936 --> 00:03:59,805
I know you're worried, but you need this surgery fast.

86
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:01,735
You'll be at a higher risk if it turns into peritonitis.

87
00:04:02,806 --> 00:04:04,645
As for the antibiotics and pain medication,

88
00:04:04,646 --> 00:04:06,875
we'll do our best to ensure your baby is safe.

89
00:04:06,876 --> 00:04:10,414
But could this put my baby at risk?

90
00:04:10,415 --> 00:04:13,284
The pain medication might affect the baby's breathing.

91
00:04:13,285 --> 00:04:16,056
But it's a rare case. You don't have to worry.

92
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:21,724
Woo Ri. Are you all right?

93
00:04:21,725 --> 00:04:24,265
Yes. Why are you all here?

94
00:04:24,266 --> 00:04:26,965
We were your emergency contact. So we could get here fast.

95
00:04:29,306 --> 00:04:30,566
Mom.

96
00:04:31,706 --> 00:04:34,605
I haven't been able to register for the surgery yet.

97
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:36,545
It's okay. Let's get the surgery done.

98
00:04:38,275 --> 00:04:40,816
What is it? Is there a problem, Woo Ri?

99
00:04:41,246 --> 00:04:42,585
Pregnant women...

100
00:04:42,586 --> 00:04:44,545
try not to take cold medicine unless it's really necessary.

101
00:04:44,686 --> 00:04:47,355
So of course, she doesn't feel safe going into surgery like this.

102
00:04:50,025 --> 00:04:51,784
Don't worry too much.

103
00:04:51,785 --> 00:04:54,295
The doctor said it was a simple procedure. You'll be okay.

104
00:04:57,196 --> 00:04:59,165
We'll start the anaesthesia.

105
00:04:59,735 --> 00:05:03,465
Doctor, I'm pregnant.

106
00:05:04,266 --> 00:05:06,105
Yes, I'm aware. Don't worry.

107
00:05:08,306 --> 00:05:12,045
My baby will be safe, right?

108
00:05:12,816 --> 00:05:14,115
My baby...

109
00:05:27,556 --> 00:05:29,266
Woo Ri. How are you?

110
00:05:30,665 --> 00:05:32,066
You were brave.

111
00:05:32,936 --> 00:05:34,066
How's my baby?

112
00:05:34,235 --> 00:05:36,405
Don't worry. The baby is perfectly fine.

113
00:05:38,165 --> 00:05:39,506
This way.

114
00:05:42,246 --> 00:05:44,576
Ms. Oh, the surgery went well.

115
00:05:44,706 --> 00:05:47,275
The surgery was simple because you came to the hospital early.

116
00:05:47,675 --> 00:05:50,914
Doctor, my baby is okay. Right?

117
00:05:50,915 --> 00:05:52,315
Yes. The baby is perfectly fine.

118
00:05:52,316 --> 00:05:54,785
You said you didn't want to take the pain medication.

119
00:05:55,425 --> 00:05:57,485
The pain will start once the anaesthesia wears off.

120
00:05:57,626 --> 00:06:00,055
There's a very low chance of affecting the baby.

121
00:06:00,056 --> 00:06:01,756
So don't endure the pain. And get the medication if it hurts.

122
00:06:02,365 --> 00:06:03,794
Don't worry.

123
00:06:03,795 --> 00:06:06,095
It was a simple procedure, and it went well.

124
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:08,605
We'll observe her, and if her post-op looks good,

125
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:10,105
she'll get discharged even tomorrow.

126
00:06:11,235 --> 00:06:13,735
- Okay. Thank you, doctor. - Thank you.

127
00:06:19,345 --> 00:06:22,785
- Gosh. Be careful. - Let's be careful.

128
00:06:25,246 --> 00:06:27,654
Ms. Oh, let us know if it hurts too much.

129
00:06:27,655 --> 00:06:28,955
We can give you medication for that.

130
00:06:28,956 --> 00:06:30,155
I'm okay.

131
00:06:30,826 --> 00:06:33,024
Are you sure walking around like this...

132
00:06:33,025 --> 00:06:35,295
instead of lying down is better for her recovery?

133
00:06:35,496 --> 00:06:37,365
Moving around is good for her bowels.

134
00:06:37,766 --> 00:06:39,665
But it will be tough without the pain medication.

135
00:06:40,465 --> 00:06:41,795
I'm fine.

136
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:43,805
Woo Ri.

137
00:06:43,806 --> 00:06:45,305
If it's too tough on you, you should just get the pain meds.

138
00:06:45,306 --> 00:06:46,576
She said it was fine.

139
00:06:47,975 --> 00:06:49,245
Yes, Woo Ri.

140
00:06:49,246 --> 00:06:52,246
If you're in constant pain, it might not be good for the baby.

141
00:06:55,985 --> 00:06:57,215
Right.

142
00:06:58,686 --> 00:06:59,915
- Yes. - Please.

143
00:07:01,155 --> 00:07:02,425
It hurts.

144
00:07:03,725 --> 00:07:04,956
It hurts so much.

145
00:07:05,626 --> 00:07:08,256
Can you give me the pain meds? It hurts!

146
00:07:08,525 --> 00:07:09,794
Stay in your room.

147
00:07:09,795 --> 00:07:11,265
I'll get you the pain meds.

148
00:07:11,266 --> 00:07:13,496
It hurts so much. I want the pain meds.

149
00:07:14,235 --> 00:07:16,664
And if she passes gas, let me know right away.

150
00:07:16,665 --> 00:07:18,206
- Okay. - Okay.

151
00:07:21,675 --> 00:07:22,905
What is it?

152
00:07:24,946 --> 00:07:27,016
Okay. I got it.

153
00:07:27,345 --> 00:07:28,785
Kang Jae. Raphael.

154
00:07:28,816 --> 00:07:30,914
She's grateful that you're here. But you should go.

155
00:07:30,915 --> 00:07:32,956
- She has to pass gas. - Okay.

156
00:07:37,655 --> 00:07:38,826
Let's go inside.

157
00:07:41,556 --> 00:07:42,996
Woo Ri, are you all right?

158
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:45,294
The pain must have subsided.

159
00:07:45,295 --> 00:07:47,034
I brought your laptop but didn't know what else to grab.

160
00:07:47,035 --> 00:07:48,534
So I got everything from your desk.

161
00:07:48,535 --> 00:07:50,465
Thank you, Mom.

162
00:07:50,766 --> 00:07:53,275
Mom. Grandma. You should go home now.

163
00:07:54,376 --> 00:07:56,845
Mom, you haven't had dinner, right?

164
00:07:57,246 --> 00:07:59,275
You didn't have lunch, did you?

165
00:08:00,675 --> 00:08:04,016
Go home already. I'll be on my laptop.

166
00:08:12,796 --> 00:08:16,796
("Mask of Desire")

167
00:08:16,926 --> 00:08:20,696
(Pregnancy Journal)

168
00:08:37,615 --> 00:08:39,186
(Sunday)

169
00:08:39,485 --> 00:08:42,255
(Thank you for a great day. I hope we'll both sleep well.)

170
00:08:50,796 --> 00:08:52,465
(Why am I upset?)

171
00:08:52,595 --> 00:08:55,166
(And I made up with him.)

172
00:08:55,395 --> 00:08:58,265
(For the first time in my life...)

173
00:09:04,446 --> 00:09:08,175
(October 19, Saturday: Mallet. I met you for the first time today.)

174
00:09:08,176 --> 00:09:09,286
(This is you!)

175
00:09:14,885 --> 00:09:17,624
(I can't still believe that I'm a mom now!)

176
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:19,055
(But I turned him down because he wanted to marry me for you.)

177
00:09:19,056 --> 00:09:20,494
(I'll make sure you're happy.)

178
00:09:20,495 --> 00:09:23,125
(I'll try harder for you. Thank you, Bok Dol.)

179
00:09:57,725 --> 00:09:59,196
When did you two get here?

180
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:02,265
Just now.

181
00:10:03,235 --> 00:10:04,905
I was in the neighbourhood, so I dropped by.

182
00:10:04,906 --> 00:10:07,135
I see. What time is it?

183
00:10:09,946 --> 00:10:13,015
I'm all right. You two should go home.

184
00:10:13,245 --> 00:10:14,745
Let us stay a bit longer.

185
00:10:18,546 --> 00:10:20,255
But what were you two doing?

186
00:10:33,696 --> 00:10:35,066
By the way,

187
00:10:35,806 --> 00:10:37,666
stop holding my hands.

188
00:10:46,645 --> 00:10:47,946
That just now...

189
00:10:48,985 --> 00:10:50,715
That was it, right?

190
00:10:52,855 --> 00:10:53,885
Yes.

191
00:10:54,056 --> 00:10:55,355
She's good now then.

192
00:10:55,686 --> 00:10:57,325
Hold on.

193
00:10:57,326 --> 00:10:59,595
Where are the nurse and the doctor? Hold on a second.

194
00:11:00,526 --> 00:11:02,196
Excuse me!

195
00:11:03,865 --> 00:11:06,734
Woo Ri just passed gas!

196
00:11:06,735 --> 00:11:08,765
Gosh. Don't be so loud in the hospital.

197
00:11:08,836 --> 00:11:09,865
Excuse me.

198
00:11:10,105 --> 00:11:12,975
Woo Ri just passed gas! Okay?

199
00:11:18,005 --> 00:11:19,315
Thank you.

200
00:11:19,316 --> 00:11:21,245
I probably took up a lot of your time.

201
00:11:21,576 --> 00:11:23,445
Call me if there's anything you need.

202
00:11:23,446 --> 00:11:24,585
Rest up, Woo Ri.

203
00:11:24,586 --> 00:11:25,786
I'll get going.

204
00:11:26,015 --> 00:11:27,115
Let me get that for you.

205
00:11:30,556 --> 00:11:31,855
- Bye. - Bye.

206
00:11:31,885 --> 00:11:33,155
- Bye. - Okay.

207
00:11:33,156 --> 00:11:34,395
- Get some rest. - Bye.

208
00:11:41,365 --> 00:11:43,666
- Good work. - You too.

209
00:11:44,965 --> 00:11:46,975
- Bye. - Bye.

210
00:11:51,776 --> 00:11:53,046
- Sweet dreams. - Rest up.

211
00:11:54,076 --> 00:11:55,276
- Mom. - Yes?

212
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:57,015
- Grandma. - What?

213
00:12:02,485 --> 00:12:04,826
When the anaesthesia wore off, it hurt so much.

214
00:12:05,826 --> 00:12:09,326
I had never felt that much pain in my life, but I held it in.

215
00:12:11,595 --> 00:12:13,135
You guys also had to...

216
00:12:13,536 --> 00:12:15,865
endure this kind of pain because of me, right?

217
00:12:17,865 --> 00:12:20,036
I take medicine as soon as it hurts. I can't tolerate pain.

218
00:12:20,176 --> 00:12:21,975
Right. As you should.

219
00:12:22,206 --> 00:12:25,144
Woo Ri, you should take medicine right away and get shots too.

220
00:12:25,145 --> 00:12:26,615
- Right. Let's go. - Yes.

221
00:12:31,715 --> 00:12:32,855
Okay.

222
00:12:36,855 --> 00:12:38,156
You're going to work?

223
00:12:38,286 --> 00:12:39,526
You can't even take a day off?

224
00:12:39,595 --> 00:12:41,224
I have some time to finish my script.

225
00:12:41,225 --> 00:12:42,696
I'm not going to work.

226
00:12:42,865 --> 00:12:45,365
Then where are you going? You're still recovering.

227
00:12:45,566 --> 00:12:46,895
I'm all recovered now.

228
00:12:48,865 --> 00:12:50,565
There was something I had to do.

229
00:12:50,566 --> 00:12:52,235
And I couldn't do that because of the surgery.

230
00:12:52,475 --> 00:12:53,906
He must be waiting.

231
00:12:54,105 --> 00:12:56,806
What is this about? Is this urgent?

232
00:12:57,176 --> 00:12:58,276
Wait.

233
00:12:58,806 --> 00:13:00,276
Are you going to finally choose between them?

234
00:13:01,645 --> 00:13:03,485
Really? Is that it?

235
00:13:06,355 --> 00:13:07,556
I'm off now.

236
00:13:54,836 --> 00:13:57,265
(Ten months later)

237
00:13:57,406 --> 00:14:00,235
(Seo Gwi Nyeo's Pork Cutlet Renewal It will always taste the same!)

238
00:14:05,076 --> 00:14:06,545
(Closed today)

239
00:14:06,546 --> 00:14:07,845
(Seo Gwi Nyeo's Pork Cutlet)

240
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:11,315
I'm so busy!

241
00:14:11,316 --> 00:14:12,685
(Thank you for making it this far!)

242
00:14:12,686 --> 00:14:14,014
Doesn't it look like her 100th birthday?

243
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:15,925
Come on. It's obvious this is a party for her 100th day.

244
00:14:15,926 --> 00:14:18,325
- What about baekseolgi? - It's coming. So it'll be here.

245
00:14:18,326 --> 00:14:20,025
It was supposed to be here over an hour ago.

246
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:21,755
What's taking them so long?

247
00:14:23,595 --> 00:14:26,536
I told you to make japchae at the end. It will get soggy.

248
00:14:26,895 --> 00:14:29,406
The guests should arrive soon. What are we missing?

249
00:14:29,505 --> 00:14:32,165
Exactly. I told you we should just have it at a venue.

250
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:33,504
This is her 100th day.

251
00:14:33,505 --> 00:14:35,276
My great-granddaughter's 100th day.

252
00:14:35,536 --> 00:14:37,675
People don't celebrate the 100th day anymore.

253
00:14:37,676 --> 00:14:39,214
Not after everything we went through.

254
00:14:39,215 --> 00:14:40,915
Come on. Cut it out.

255
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:42,485
Are you going to fight on a day like today?

256
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:45,286
Mom, go and get changed.

257
00:14:45,446 --> 00:14:48,316
A white shirt and jeans. This is the dress code today.

258
00:14:48,556 --> 00:14:49,556
Like me.

259
00:14:49,557 --> 00:14:52,526
It feels weird to wear jeans. Do I look okay?

260
00:14:52,796 --> 00:14:54,354
Grandma, you look amazing.

261
00:14:54,355 --> 00:14:56,066
You're like a senior model.

262
00:14:56,296 --> 00:14:57,724
By the way, I'm not sure...

263
00:14:57,725 --> 00:14:59,735
if we should take a family picture on a hectic day like this.

264
00:14:59,995 --> 00:15:01,394
We won't have a chance for all of us to get together...

265
00:15:01,395 --> 00:15:03,535
unless we have an occasion like this.

266
00:15:03,536 --> 00:15:05,805
We all took pictures together at my wedding.

267
00:15:05,806 --> 00:15:07,874
My daughter wasn't born then.

268
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:09,905
Your wedding is coming up soon. We can take one at your wedding.

269
00:15:09,906 --> 00:15:11,405
I should be the star that day.

270
00:15:11,406 --> 00:15:13,075
My daughter, Ri Woo, is the star today.

271
00:15:13,076 --> 00:15:14,815
I'll put my daughter right in the middle.

272
00:15:14,816 --> 00:15:16,446
And all of us can take pictures together.

273
00:15:16,515 --> 00:15:17,614
Okay.

274
00:15:17,615 --> 00:15:20,316
I'll go and put on a nice outfit for my granddaughter.

275
00:15:22,786 --> 00:15:25,426
Maybe, I should have fried pork cutlets. It's been a while.

276
00:15:25,526 --> 00:15:28,254
Grandma, we have so much food.

277
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:29,395
This will be enough.

278
00:15:29,566 --> 00:15:32,594
I'm kind of sad that I don't get to fry pork cutlets these days.

279
00:15:32,595 --> 00:15:34,234
Mom is doing a great job, though.

280
00:15:34,235 --> 00:15:36,964
- And you make videos now. - Gosh.

281
00:15:36,965 --> 00:15:38,635
That's for fun.

282
00:15:38,936 --> 00:15:40,576
Grandma. That's for fun?

283
00:15:40,735 --> 00:15:42,135
Your subscribers...

284
00:15:42,505 --> 00:15:43,605
Goodness.

285
00:15:43,745 --> 00:15:45,245
Oh, no. What should I do?

286
00:15:45,306 --> 00:15:47,975
- Oh, no. Grandma. What do we do? - Look at this.

287
00:15:48,515 --> 00:15:49,884
I can wipe it off.

288
00:15:49,885 --> 00:15:51,545
No. It can't stain.

289
00:15:51,546 --> 00:15:53,056
A white shirt is the dress code.

290
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:55,685
Then should I put on another white shirt?

291
00:15:55,686 --> 00:15:56,925
I have a white blouse.

292
00:15:56,926 --> 00:15:58,325
Yes. Please hurry.

293
00:15:58,326 --> 00:15:59,595
- Okay. I'll go and change. - Oh, no.

294
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:01,895
You're home, Seoung Il.

295
00:16:01,995 --> 00:16:03,095
Yes.

296
00:16:03,595 --> 00:16:06,066
Where is she going?

297
00:16:06,595 --> 00:16:07,765
- Dad. - Yes?

298
00:16:08,135 --> 00:16:10,336
- What are you wearing? - What do you mean?

299
00:16:10,706 --> 00:16:12,135
I'm wearing blue and white.

300
00:16:13,036 --> 00:16:14,634
Dad, you drive me crazy sometimes.

301
00:16:14,635 --> 00:16:15,734
It's the other way around.

302
00:16:15,735 --> 00:16:17,906
A white shirt and jeans. Isn't that an obvious pairing?

303
00:16:18,676 --> 00:16:20,374
I see.

304
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:22,685
Why did I think I should wear white pants?

305
00:16:22,686 --> 00:16:26,056
This is awful. It's my daughter's first picture.

306
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:28,254
Gosh, why are you so worried?

307
00:16:28,255 --> 00:16:30,384
I live here. I can go and change fast.

308
00:16:30,385 --> 00:16:32,595
I have a lot of clothes too. All right.

309
00:16:33,225 --> 00:16:35,526
Gosh. Honey, why do you look so gorgeous?

310
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:37,926
- Mom. - What? You startled me.

311
00:16:38,796 --> 00:16:40,694
Mom, this isn't right.

312
00:16:40,695 --> 00:16:42,536
I'm wearing a white shirt and denim.

313
00:16:42,806 --> 00:16:44,434
I can't see the shirt or the denim.

314
00:16:44,435 --> 00:16:46,775
- I can only see your bare skin! - What are you talking about?

315
00:16:46,776 --> 00:16:49,134
Woo Ri. You should respect her style.

316
00:16:49,135 --> 00:16:50,945
Not everyone at her age...

317
00:16:51,145 --> 00:16:53,046
can look this sexy.

318
00:16:53,476 --> 00:16:56,015
You can wear that when it's just the two of you.

319
00:16:56,016 --> 00:16:58,114
Mom, please wear something more elegant today.

320
00:16:58,115 --> 00:16:59,315
Please? I'm begging you.

321
00:16:59,316 --> 00:17:01,085
- Dad, you should go change too. - Okay.

322
00:17:01,086 --> 00:17:03,255
Honey, let's give what Woo Ri wants today.

323
00:17:03,256 --> 00:17:04,726
I'll go and put on a new outfit. Okay.

324
00:17:06,226 --> 00:17:07,955
Gosh. I can't do this a second time.

325
00:17:08,526 --> 00:17:10,796
By the way, where's your husband-to-be?

326
00:17:10,895 --> 00:17:12,864
Shouldn't he be here now and help you?

327
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:14,336
He should have been here a long time ago.

328
00:17:16,806 --> 00:17:17,965
I'm here!

329
00:17:17,966 --> 00:17:19,674
Gosh, Mother.

330
00:17:19,675 --> 00:17:22,205
You are stunning as always.

331
00:17:22,405 --> 00:17:23,775
- Mom, hurry. - Okay.

332
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:25,374
You can admire me some other time.

333
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:27,144
- Woo Ri said no. I'll go change. - What?

334
00:17:27,145 --> 00:17:28,715
- Why? - Okay. Go and get changed.

335
00:17:28,716 --> 00:17:30,316
She looks amazing. Why...

336
00:17:31,645 --> 00:17:33,455
What is it?

337
00:17:33,915 --> 00:17:35,455
I followed the dress code.

338
00:17:35,816 --> 00:17:37,155
Blue and white.

339
00:17:37,756 --> 00:17:39,154
You got the colours right.

340
00:17:39,155 --> 00:17:41,026
But you don't look modest.

341
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:43,065
A white shirt and jeans. This is the outfit.

342
00:17:43,066 --> 00:17:44,525
- No. Hear me out. - What?

343
00:17:44,526 --> 00:17:48,295
Today is Ri Woo's first official appearance.

344
00:17:48,296 --> 00:17:51,505
So I wanted to look very formal and classy.

345
00:17:51,506 --> 00:17:54,035
No. I understand that. But you won't blend in.

346
00:17:54,036 --> 00:17:55,435
You'll stand out by yourself.

347
00:17:57,405 --> 00:17:58,576
- Was it too much? - Yes.

348
00:17:59,576 --> 00:18:01,076
Okay. Here.

349
00:18:01,316 --> 00:18:03,086
What if I take off the jacket? Just the shirt.

350
00:18:03,145 --> 00:18:04,685
Let's unbutton that too.

351
00:18:05,746 --> 00:18:07,215
Gosh. This is a bit better.

352
00:18:07,216 --> 00:18:08,555
- That's better. - All right.

353
00:18:08,556 --> 00:18:10,454
- Woo Ri. How do I look? Perfect? - Like this?

354
00:18:10,455 --> 00:18:12,355
Dad, you changed really fast.

355
00:18:12,826 --> 00:18:15,695
I should have gotten dressed up like him.

356
00:18:16,266 --> 00:18:18,065
Dad, your outfit is cooler.

357
00:18:18,066 --> 00:18:19,296
You look modest. It's the best!

358
00:18:19,466 --> 00:18:21,266
- That looks better. - Gosh.

359
00:18:21,796 --> 00:18:23,865
- Okay. There. - Hey.

360
00:18:25,435 --> 00:18:26,575
Don't even start.

361
00:18:26,576 --> 00:18:28,736
I barely passed with this outfit.

362
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:31,144
I mean, this is worst than the time...

363
00:18:31,145 --> 00:18:33,614
I was getting fitted for my movie. She's pickier too.

364
00:18:33,615 --> 00:18:35,715
- Gosh. All right. - Right.

365
00:18:35,716 --> 00:18:37,115
And...

366
00:18:37,273 --> 00:18:39,412
you're joining a new movie, right? I read the article.

367
00:18:39,513 --> 00:18:40,842
Gosh. Well,

368
00:18:41,072 --> 00:18:43,182
I used to be the Korean DiCaprio in the dramas.

369
00:18:43,183 --> 00:18:46,551
But now, I've become a real DiCaprio in the movies too.

370
00:18:46,552 --> 00:18:47,552
Or something like that.

371
00:18:50,223 --> 00:18:51,483
- You know, - Yes?

372
00:18:51,882 --> 00:18:53,591
I want you to endorse plastic surgery...

373
00:18:53,592 --> 00:18:54,652
for the Diamond Medical Foundation.

374
00:18:54,753 --> 00:18:57,062
You might turn it down if you get even more successful.

375
00:18:59,023 --> 00:19:00,492
- Well, - I'm serious.

376
00:19:00,493 --> 00:19:03,362
it's great to get this kind of offer from you.

377
00:19:03,602 --> 00:19:06,003
- But here's what crossed my mind. - Do tell.

378
00:19:06,733 --> 00:19:08,773
I'm the most sought-after star now.

379
00:19:09,173 --> 00:19:12,272
What would I gain from openly telling the public...

380
00:19:12,273 --> 00:19:14,111
that I got plastic surgery done?

381
00:19:14,112 --> 00:19:15,443
I've been thinking about that.

382
00:19:16,582 --> 00:19:18,512
I'll give you a huge signing bonus. Okay?

383
00:19:18,513 --> 00:19:19,911
I'm afraid that you really won't do it...

384
00:19:19,912 --> 00:19:21,752
- Woo Ri. - once you get even more famous.

385
00:19:21,753 --> 00:19:25,422
I heard that the photographer you hired couldn't come today.

386
00:19:25,423 --> 00:19:27,892
Oh, Dad. My morning was so hectic because of that.

387
00:19:28,493 --> 00:19:30,061
But I was able to get a replacement at the last minute.

388
00:19:30,062 --> 00:19:32,121
- Really? - Yes. That's a relief.

389
00:19:32,122 --> 00:19:33,293
- Hey, there he is. - Okay.

390
00:19:34,793 --> 00:19:36,233
Hello.

391
00:19:36,533 --> 00:19:38,862
Hello. Gosh. Am I late?

392
00:19:39,033 --> 00:19:41,071
No. You're on time, but the last one here.

393
00:19:41,072 --> 00:19:42,602
- Please hurry. - Yes.

394
00:19:43,503 --> 00:19:45,571
- Here? - No, over there.

395
00:19:45,572 --> 00:19:46,973
I got it.

396
00:19:48,612 --> 00:19:49,612
- Dad. - Yes.

397
00:19:49,613 --> 00:19:52,482
- Can you go and check on Mom? - Okay. Check on Mom.

398
00:19:52,483 --> 00:19:54,012
Don't let her wear her stage costume.

399
00:19:54,013 --> 00:19:55,682
It has to be something pure and natural.

400
00:19:55,683 --> 00:19:57,581
- Something pure and natural. - Yes.

401
00:19:57,582 --> 00:19:59,922
Pure and natural. Let's go.

402
00:19:59,923 --> 00:20:00,992
- Let's go. - Okay, let's go.

403
00:20:00,993 --> 00:20:02,763
- I'm counting on you. - Okay.

404
00:20:04,062 --> 00:20:07,332
Gosh, Raphael. You're all dressed up for today.

405
00:20:07,463 --> 00:20:09,433
Gosh, Detective Lee.

406
00:20:10,233 --> 00:20:13,102
I came over-dressed and feel embarrassed.

407
00:20:13,572 --> 00:20:15,702
Bok Rae, you always overdo things.

408
00:20:15,703 --> 00:20:17,802
Relax a bit.

409
00:20:18,102 --> 00:20:19,102
Hey.

410
00:20:21,443 --> 00:20:22,713
It's Raphael.

411
00:20:22,983 --> 00:20:26,082
Everyone on the baseball team calls me Bok Rae because of you.

412
00:20:26,483 --> 00:20:29,983
Bok Rae suits you better than Raphael.

413
00:20:30,953 --> 00:20:34,193
Right, I can't make it to the match this time.

414
00:20:34,423 --> 00:20:35,523
Why?

415
00:20:35,592 --> 00:20:37,822
I'm a detective, remember?

416
00:20:38,062 --> 00:20:42,462
You'll hurt yourself if you work too much since you got promoted.

417
00:20:42,463 --> 00:20:44,101
Besides, if you don't go, why would I? It's no fun.

418
00:20:44,102 --> 00:20:47,632
You always chat when you meet. Are you two best friends?

419
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:49,601
- I don't like him. - I don't like him.

420
00:20:49,602 --> 00:20:51,401
- I had enough of him. - Don't be so ridiculous.

421
00:20:51,402 --> 00:20:52,742
- I had enough of him. - Seriously.

422
00:20:52,743 --> 00:20:54,772
Stop with the love fight.

423
00:20:54,773 --> 00:20:56,071
And check the angle on the camera.

424
00:20:56,072 --> 00:20:57,983
- Quick, stand there and open it. - Yes.

425
00:20:58,013 --> 00:20:59,983
Let's see.

426
00:21:02,412 --> 00:21:03,483
Good.

427
00:21:04,122 --> 00:21:07,522
- Yes, we'll all stand there. - Here?

428
00:21:07,523 --> 00:21:08,993
Let's see. Take a look.

429
00:21:09,092 --> 00:21:10,522
How's this angle?

430
00:21:10,523 --> 00:21:12,661
- Yes, that looks good. - You like it?

431
00:21:12,662 --> 00:21:14,192
It's good because the model is good.

432
00:21:14,193 --> 00:21:15,463
- Get out of the way. - How do I look?

433
00:21:16,362 --> 00:21:19,732
Our main star should look good. Our daughter Oh Ri Woo.

434
00:21:19,733 --> 00:21:22,841
Here is our star! Ta-Da!

435
00:21:22,842 --> 00:21:25,042
Ri Woo. My daughter Ri Woo.

436
00:21:25,043 --> 00:21:28,472
You look so pretty today. Or are you just pretty?

437
00:21:28,473 --> 00:21:31,141
I made today a holiday at work for Ri Woo.

438
00:21:31,142 --> 00:21:32,812
It's okay, your daddy made it happen.

439
00:21:33,213 --> 00:21:35,782
Gosh, you're so good at talking with the baby.

440
00:21:35,783 --> 00:21:36,952
She can't even talk.

441
00:21:36,953 --> 00:21:39,622
- What did you say? - Ta-Da! Woo Ri, how's this?

442
00:21:39,852 --> 00:21:42,252
- Mom, you look so beautiful. - Do you like it?

443
00:21:42,253 --> 00:21:44,462
Finally, your mom passed, right?

444
00:21:44,463 --> 00:21:45,821
Now,

445
00:21:45,822 --> 00:21:49,361
we'll take turns and say something to Ri Woo.

446
00:21:49,362 --> 00:21:50,861
Why are you hosting all of a sudden?

447
00:21:50,862 --> 00:21:52,871
I mean, I want her to think...

448
00:21:52,872 --> 00:21:55,401
that her grandfather was good-looking later on in her life.

449
00:21:55,402 --> 00:21:56,543
That's all I want.

450
00:21:57,473 --> 00:21:58,772
Now, Grandma.

451
00:21:58,773 --> 00:22:01,772
I mean Great-grandma. Let's start.

452
00:22:01,773 --> 00:22:07,283
Ri Woo, thank you for coming to us after a lot of hardship.

453
00:22:07,382 --> 00:22:11,252
Be healthy and grow up well.

454
00:22:11,253 --> 00:22:13,993
Yes, grow up well.

455
00:22:14,622 --> 00:22:17,293
Now, my lovely wife, the Grandma.

456
00:22:17,423 --> 00:22:18,763
Hi, Ri Woo.

457
00:22:18,892 --> 00:22:21,963
I have a strong feeling that you will become an idol star.

458
00:22:22,763 --> 00:22:26,033
Fulfill our family dream for us.

459
00:22:26,162 --> 00:22:28,002
Pick up a microphone on your first birthday.

460
00:22:28,003 --> 00:22:29,372
- Bye. - Yes.

461
00:22:29,642 --> 00:22:32,071
- Now, the loving Dad. - Hey, you're next.

462
00:22:32,072 --> 00:22:33,473
What? Wait...

463
00:22:36,112 --> 00:22:38,783
- You're running out of time. - Dear Ri Woo.

464
00:22:40,047 --> 00:22:41,945
The 100 days I had with you...

465
00:22:41,946 --> 00:22:44,246
are nothing comparable...

466
00:22:44,916 --> 00:22:46,746
to the 34 years I lived alone.

467
00:22:47,587 --> 00:22:51,156
Let's live a happy life...

468
00:22:51,486 --> 00:22:53,186
together.

469
00:22:53,787 --> 00:22:54,986
I love you.

470
00:22:56,287 --> 00:22:57,526
That was touching.

471
00:22:57,527 --> 00:23:00,026
The feeling a father has for his daughter.

472
00:23:00,027 --> 00:23:02,627
You know it so well. I was thrown off.

473
00:23:03,137 --> 00:23:04,736
I love you, my daughter.

474
00:23:05,567 --> 00:23:07,166
- Yes, I do. - Love you, too.

475
00:23:07,637 --> 00:23:08,866
Dear Ri Woo.

476
00:23:08,867 --> 00:23:10,206
Me?

477
00:23:11,206 --> 00:23:13,176
Ri Woo,

478
00:23:13,906 --> 00:23:15,505
I think it was the other way around,

479
00:23:15,506 --> 00:23:17,146
and you gave birth to me.

480
00:23:17,377 --> 00:23:20,817
You let me live a whole new life.

481
00:23:21,216 --> 00:23:23,686
Thank you, Ri Woo. I love you.

482
00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:25,756
- I love you. - I love you.

483
00:23:26,387 --> 00:23:28,386
Gosh, that was such a good time.

484
00:23:28,387 --> 00:23:29,856
Now, for the real thing.

485
00:23:29,857 --> 00:23:32,956
Right. Why don't you say a word?

486
00:23:33,327 --> 00:23:36,126
Ri Woo, happy 100 days!

487
00:23:36,127 --> 00:23:37,195
I'm...

488
00:23:37,196 --> 00:23:38,766
- Gosh, Ri Woo must be sleepy. - This isn't going to work.

489
00:23:38,767 --> 00:23:40,606
- She slept well. Why is she whiny? - It's okay, Ri Woo.

490
00:23:40,607 --> 00:23:42,336
- She's crying too much. - Let's take the picture...

491
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:43,735
- before she gets worse. - Let's do that.

492
00:23:43,736 --> 00:23:47,146
- Let's take the picture. - Let's go.

493
00:23:47,906 --> 00:23:49,175
- Here. - Stand here.

494
00:23:49,176 --> 00:23:50,546
- Woo Ri. The baby. - Kang Jae.

495
00:23:50,547 --> 00:23:52,817
- Wait. My jacket. - Yes.

496
00:23:53,387 --> 00:23:55,787
- Here we go. - Let's take a nice picture.

497
00:23:55,986 --> 00:23:59,086
- Look over there. - Here we go.

498
00:23:59,087 --> 00:24:00,485
- Look. - We're taking the picture.

499
00:24:00,486 --> 00:24:02,326
- Get in here. - It's ready.

500
00:24:02,327 --> 00:24:03,926
- Get ready. - Look over there.

501
00:24:04,327 --> 00:24:06,696
- One, two, three. - Cheese.

502
00:24:12,067 --> 00:24:13,107
Woo Ri.

503
00:24:17,077 --> 00:24:18,176
Kang Jae.

504
00:24:19,777 --> 00:24:21,006
Kang Jae.

505
00:24:23,916 --> 00:24:25,476
What if...

506
00:24:25,916 --> 00:24:29,087
What if I didn't get pregnant,

507
00:24:31,456 --> 00:24:35,186
we would have gotten married when you proposed, right?

508
00:24:37,797 --> 00:24:40,766
Then, I wouldn't have known how important you were to me...

509
00:24:40,767 --> 00:24:42,426
for the rest of my life.

510
00:24:44,837 --> 00:24:46,297
But now that...

511
00:24:47,436 --> 00:24:49,807
we have gone through so much that...

512
00:24:50,037 --> 00:24:53,676
I can see clearly who you are.

513
00:24:56,047 --> 00:24:57,946
You are someone...

514
00:24:58,777 --> 00:25:00,817
who would stand by me...

515
00:25:01,916 --> 00:25:04,857
whatever happens to me.

516
00:25:07,627 --> 00:25:11,256
With you, I think I can do anything...

517
00:25:12,726 --> 00:25:15,896
even when I become my Mom's age and my Grandma's age.

518
00:25:19,537 --> 00:25:22,506
- Woo Ri. - Kang Jae, you are my spring.

519
00:25:23,637 --> 00:25:25,806
We had a passionate summer,

520
00:25:25,807 --> 00:25:27,776
a rich fall,

521
00:25:27,777 --> 00:25:29,746
and a fierce winter.

522
00:25:30,847 --> 00:25:34,186
But spring is a new start that always comes back...

523
00:25:34,746 --> 00:25:36,216
after waiting through all this.

524
00:25:58,736 --> 00:26:00,406
My warm spring.

525
00:26:02,777 --> 00:26:03,847
Will you...

526
00:26:05,976 --> 00:26:07,347
marry me?

527
00:26:45,375 --> 00:26:47,276
- Do you like it? - Yes.

528
00:26:48,345 --> 00:26:50,446
Yes. It's just as I thought it would be.

529
00:26:51,675 --> 00:26:54,686
Now that 100th-day celebration is done,

530
00:26:55,716 --> 00:26:57,115
we have our wedding left.

531
00:26:58,516 --> 00:27:01,355
You went through so much preparing for it by yourself.

532
00:27:01,726 --> 00:27:03,256
No.

533
00:27:03,595 --> 00:27:05,525
You were busy writing scripts.

534
00:27:05,526 --> 00:27:07,394
- Woo Ri. - Yes, Dad.

535
00:27:07,395 --> 00:27:09,325
I thought about it carefully.

536
00:27:09,565 --> 00:27:11,895
But can I use your room once you move out?

537
00:27:12,296 --> 00:27:14,965
Yes, sure.

538
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:20,144
When you move out, I'll renovate it into a cool study.

539
00:27:20,145 --> 00:27:22,105
- Sure. - I told you, no.

540
00:27:22,845 --> 00:27:24,545
Where would she sleep when she comes over?

541
00:27:24,546 --> 00:27:26,615
There needs to be a room for her to visit more often.

542
00:27:27,686 --> 00:27:30,185
Woo Ri, you need to come over at least once a day.

543
00:27:30,186 --> 00:27:32,314
That's why I told you to get a house ten minutes away.

544
00:27:32,315 --> 00:27:36,186
Yes. Of course, Mom.

545
00:27:36,956 --> 00:27:38,955
Father, come over to our house often.

546
00:27:38,956 --> 00:27:40,124
You can read your scripts there.

547
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:43,965
Kang Jae, I know you're just being polite.

548
00:27:43,966 --> 00:27:45,835
But thank you for offering.

549
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:47,706
Gosh.

550
00:27:48,335 --> 00:27:49,835
- You have a phone call. - Right.

551
00:27:53,306 --> 00:27:54,575
Yes, director.

552
00:27:56,006 --> 00:27:57,046
Tomorrow?

553
00:27:57,476 --> 00:27:59,675
- Here we go. - There, there.

554
00:28:00,915 --> 00:28:02,445
I'm sorry, Raphael.

555
00:28:02,446 --> 00:28:03,486
She's my daughter.

556
00:28:03,615 --> 00:28:05,286
I'm happy to babysit anytime.

557
00:28:05,855 --> 00:28:08,526
Ri Woo, let's stay with Daddy today.

558
00:28:09,226 --> 00:28:12,526
Then, she'll stay with me until the wedding, right?

559
00:28:13,026 --> 00:28:14,196
I'm so happy.

560
00:28:14,325 --> 00:28:16,795
Please take care of her. I need to go now.

561
00:28:16,796 --> 00:28:17,895
You should go.

562
00:28:18,696 --> 00:28:20,665
- Get going. - Okay.

563
00:28:22,766 --> 00:28:25,536
Min Chae has to leave for the US tomorrow.

564
00:28:25,776 --> 00:28:28,145
That's why we asked you to meet us in such a short time.

565
00:28:28,875 --> 00:28:30,645
I'm always happy to do so.

566
00:28:32,046 --> 00:28:33,516
I enjoyed reading the script.

567
00:28:33,845 --> 00:28:35,986
- Thank you. - Thank you.

568
00:28:36,145 --> 00:28:38,854
Ms. Oh put a lot of effort into it.

569
00:28:38,855 --> 00:28:40,855
We could see that in the script.

570
00:28:41,756 --> 00:28:43,085
Everything's good...

571
00:28:43,496 --> 00:28:46,766
but isn't the main character a bit annoying?

572
00:28:48,165 --> 00:28:50,536
Such characters are not in fashion these days, are they?

573
00:28:50,966 --> 00:28:53,935
How about a cooler character, with a girl crush?

574
00:28:53,936 --> 00:28:55,064
Min Chae also thinks that way.

575
00:28:55,065 --> 00:28:57,135
Is that how you saw it?

576
00:28:58,175 --> 00:29:00,405
Well, Ms. Oh,

577
00:29:00,575 --> 00:29:02,905
can you make changes to the character's personality?

578
00:29:03,046 --> 00:29:06,475
I think it's best that we see a revised version.

579
00:29:06,476 --> 00:29:08,315
Are you okay with time, Ms. Oh?

580
00:29:10,315 --> 00:29:11,355
Ms. Oh?

581
00:29:12,516 --> 00:29:14,885
Revising is not a big deal.

582
00:29:15,056 --> 00:29:17,395
I don't think the direction is right.

583
00:29:17,895 --> 00:29:19,095
Being cool is good.

584
00:29:19,196 --> 00:29:20,895
You'll feel a sense of vicarious satisfaction.

585
00:29:21,625 --> 00:29:25,635
But this drama should be something that you can relate to.

586
00:29:26,496 --> 00:29:29,306
The character's way of speech and actions...

587
00:29:29,766 --> 00:29:30,976
are some things you can relate to.

588
00:29:32,405 --> 00:29:34,775
It's a proud feeling when the character makes...

589
00:29:34,776 --> 00:29:35,845
the right decision in the end.

590
00:29:37,075 --> 00:29:38,615
That's the drama people should watch.

591
00:29:41,716 --> 00:29:45,256
Does that mean you can't make the revisions?

592
00:29:45,516 --> 00:29:48,355
Then, you can't work with us.

593
00:29:50,155 --> 00:29:51,395
Ms. Oh.

594
00:29:51,625 --> 00:29:53,595
You only need to make small changes.

595
00:29:54,726 --> 00:29:56,196
She'll make the changes.

596
00:29:57,665 --> 00:29:59,564
I can make all the revisions you want.

597
00:29:59,565 --> 00:30:02,905
But this drama does not have a character like that.

598
00:30:03,506 --> 00:30:04,675
Ms. Oh.

599
00:30:17,789 --> 00:30:18,947
I...

600
00:30:21,247 --> 00:30:22,487
I'll do it.

601
00:30:23,217 --> 00:30:24,656
- Excuse me? - Min Chae.

602
00:30:24,657 --> 00:30:25,816
Well,

603
00:30:26,217 --> 00:30:27,526
I have more faith in the script...

604
00:30:28,026 --> 00:30:29,427
now that I've met with Ms. Oh.

605
00:30:34,126 --> 00:30:35,227
Why don't we try this?

606
00:30:47,606 --> 00:30:49,846
- This is great. - Good work!

607
00:30:50,177 --> 00:30:51,346
Ri Woo, look.

608
00:30:51,477 --> 00:30:53,217
Say hello to Grandpa.

609
00:30:53,346 --> 00:30:55,186
Say hello. Try it.

610
00:30:55,187 --> 00:30:58,017
Stop making the baby say things she can't and be quiet.

611
00:30:59,417 --> 00:31:02,426
I want to see Ri Woo's face and not yours.

612
00:31:02,427 --> 00:31:03,555
Get her in the frame.

613
00:31:03,556 --> 00:31:06,257
I thought you turned into a hermit being in the mountains.

614
00:31:06,397 --> 00:31:07,825
But you're still the same.

615
00:31:07,826 --> 00:31:10,636
That's why I don't want to be tangled up in the secular world.

616
00:31:11,667 --> 00:31:12,836
Dad.

617
00:31:13,507 --> 00:31:15,336
How long are you going to stay there?

618
00:31:15,366 --> 00:31:16,366
Aren't you coming back?

619
00:31:16,367 --> 00:31:18,776
Why would I leave when everything good is here?

620
00:31:19,007 --> 00:31:20,177
You...

621
00:31:21,177 --> 00:31:26,315
need to think of what really matters as you live your life.

622
00:31:26,316 --> 00:31:29,687
Of course, what else can I say?

623
00:31:46,967 --> 00:31:48,135
Mom.

624
00:31:48,136 --> 00:31:49,366
Yes.

625
00:31:50,606 --> 00:31:51,737
That's what happened.

626
00:31:52,237 --> 00:31:54,407
Mom! Congratulations!

627
00:31:54,747 --> 00:31:56,106
Goodness.

628
00:31:56,846 --> 00:31:59,516
Woo Ri, how do you feel about having a younger sibling?

629
00:31:59,517 --> 00:32:00,747
Well,

630
00:32:01,346 --> 00:32:03,717
my younger sibling is younger than my daughter.

631
00:32:05,157 --> 00:32:06,516
That's true.

632
00:32:06,517 --> 00:32:09,757
Once a good thing happens, more good things are on the way.

633
00:32:10,457 --> 00:32:12,226
I can't believe we have such good news...

634
00:32:12,227 --> 00:32:14,296
the day before your wedding.

635
00:32:14,727 --> 00:32:16,066
Thank you.

636
00:32:16,497 --> 00:32:19,237
You should take good care of yourself now.

637
00:32:20,036 --> 00:32:21,706
But what do we do?

638
00:32:21,707 --> 00:32:24,306
We open our fifth branch of Seo Gwi Nyeo's Pork Cutlet.

639
00:32:24,606 --> 00:32:25,706
Gosh.

640
00:32:25,707 --> 00:32:28,147
Being a CEO of the franchise is great,

641
00:32:28,576 --> 00:32:31,546
but please be a good mother to our child as well.

642
00:32:31,677 --> 00:32:33,846
We just started picking up the momentum.

643
00:32:35,546 --> 00:32:36,686
Eun Ran,

644
00:32:36,687 --> 00:32:39,516
why don't you sleep with me? You, too, Woo Ri.

645
00:32:39,517 --> 00:32:40,727
I'd like that.

646
00:32:44,056 --> 00:32:45,427
Do you need anything?

647
00:32:45,727 --> 00:32:47,366
No, goodnight.

648
00:32:48,326 --> 00:32:49,397
Okay.

649
00:32:51,136 --> 00:32:53,736
Can't I sleep with you over there?

650
00:32:53,737 --> 00:32:55,306
- No. - No.

651
00:32:56,536 --> 00:32:57,606
Darn it.

652
00:32:59,536 --> 00:33:00,776
Goodnight everyone.

653
00:33:05,076 --> 00:33:07,447
I feel so lonely.

654
00:33:10,046 --> 00:33:11,687
This is our last night together.

655
00:33:12,987 --> 00:33:16,056
I can come and sleep over from time to time.

656
00:33:16,657 --> 00:33:19,727
But it'll be the last time before becoming a married woman.

657
00:33:21,397 --> 00:33:22,626
That's true.

658
00:33:23,596 --> 00:33:25,636
We had you...

659
00:33:26,866 --> 00:33:28,536
and raised you here.

660
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:31,076
Now, we're sending you off like this.

661
00:33:32,237 --> 00:33:33,436
No.

662
00:33:33,437 --> 00:33:36,147
You can't say anything sentimental. Nothing that will make you cry.

663
00:33:38,017 --> 00:33:40,217
I feel like I'm going to cry already.

664
00:33:40,846 --> 00:33:42,845
Your eyes will swell if you cry.

665
00:33:42,846 --> 00:33:44,187
You need to look pretty for your wedding.

666
00:33:44,716 --> 00:33:47,286
This won't work. Mom, let's sleep. Turn off the lights.

667
00:33:48,627 --> 00:33:49,826
All right.

668
00:33:51,357 --> 00:33:53,896
What's that? Why aren't the lights off in the living room?

669
00:33:53,897 --> 00:33:55,696
Gosh, your dad.

670
00:33:56,527 --> 00:33:59,036
- I'll go turn it off. - Stay put.

671
00:33:59,167 --> 00:34:01,707
You're getting married, and I'm pregnant.

672
00:34:08,107 --> 00:34:11,247
Do you feel better making your old mom do things for you?

673
00:34:11,647 --> 00:34:12,777
All right.

674
00:35:38,937 --> 00:35:40,166
Thank you.

675
00:35:40,167 --> 00:35:41,607
Wait.

676
00:35:42,006 --> 00:35:43,366
Where's the groom?

677
00:35:43,607 --> 00:35:44,937
He went to get the bouquet.

678
00:35:46,136 --> 00:35:47,805
Why would the groom pick that up?

679
00:35:47,806 --> 00:35:49,707
He says it's the last surprise event that he can do for her.

680
00:35:50,616 --> 00:35:52,575
There isn't anyone like Kang Jae.

681
00:35:52,576 --> 00:35:53,917
He's so devoted.

682
00:35:54,486 --> 00:35:55,986
That's all good...

683
00:35:56,946 --> 00:35:58,457
but he can't be late.

684
00:36:00,556 --> 00:36:02,256
Why isn't this thing answering?

685
00:36:02,986 --> 00:36:04,627
This is driving me crazy.

686
00:36:06,056 --> 00:36:07,196
Wait.

687
00:36:45,437 --> 00:36:48,136
Yes. That's how you do it!

688
00:36:48,306 --> 00:36:49,506
Yes.

689
00:36:50,267 --> 00:36:51,377
Right.

690
00:36:54,309 --> 00:36:56,378
- Dad, hand me my clothes. - What?

691
00:36:56,679 --> 00:36:58,449
- Here. - What's wrong?

692
00:36:59,079 --> 00:37:00,849
I need to go get Kang Jae.

693
00:37:00,949 --> 00:37:02,777
What? Where is he?

694
00:37:02,778 --> 00:37:04,047
He got arrested.

695
00:37:04,048 --> 00:37:06,288
What do you mean by that?

696
00:37:06,289 --> 00:37:07,458
Why would a detective get arrested?

697
00:37:07,459 --> 00:37:08,817
I don't know. He smashed up a parking lot...

698
00:37:08,818 --> 00:37:10,019
trying to get here quickly.

699
00:37:10,289 --> 00:37:12,289
I called a taxi, so I'll get him quickly.

700
00:37:12,389 --> 00:37:13,828
But still.

701
00:37:13,829 --> 00:37:15,559
You can't go. Someone else should.

702
00:37:15,659 --> 00:37:17,027
You're the bride.

703
00:37:17,028 --> 00:37:19,468
What can I do? He's my husband. I should go.

704
00:37:20,461 --> 00:37:21,790
- I'll be back. - But still...

705
00:37:21,791 --> 00:37:23,290
- Woo Ri. - Gosh.

706
00:37:23,291 --> 00:37:24,691
Where are you rushing off to?

707
00:37:24,791 --> 00:37:25,890
Are you going to the bathroom?

708
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:32,700
Yes. I'm outside.

709
00:37:33,901 --> 00:37:36,771
What? The road closed down? Why?

710
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:50,651
Gosh.

711
00:38:02,731 --> 00:38:07,441
(Love the Environment Marathon Race)

712
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,520
(Taxi Cancelled)

713
00:38:29,521 --> 00:38:31,131
What's this? This can't happen.

714
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:45,610
Mr. Bus Driver!

715
00:38:45,611 --> 00:38:46,941
Wait for me.

716
00:38:47,481 --> 00:38:50,480
Does this bus go to Sangmun Police Station?

717
00:38:50,481 --> 00:38:51,481
Yes.

718
00:38:51,482 --> 00:38:52,751
How long will it take to get there?

719
00:38:53,381 --> 00:38:54,520
It'll take about an hour.

720
00:38:54,521 --> 00:38:57,490
No, that can't be. I'll be late for my wedding.

721
00:38:57,950 --> 00:38:59,550
Can't you go straight to the police station?

722
00:38:59,691 --> 00:39:00,990
Of course not.

723
00:39:01,061 --> 00:39:02,621
A bus isn't a taxi.

724
00:39:03,461 --> 00:39:04,961
- Right. - Miss.

725
00:39:05,061 --> 00:39:07,359
We're all busy. Stop slowing us down.

726
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,300
Are you getting on or not?

727
00:39:10,001 --> 00:39:11,670
Everyone,

728
00:39:11,671 --> 00:39:14,371
I'm getting married in an hour.

729
00:39:14,470 --> 00:39:16,771
I had so many mishaps.

730
00:39:16,901 --> 00:39:19,839
You wouldn't believe the things I went through to get to this point.

731
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,109
So, what?

732
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:22,239
We're all busy as well.

733
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,910
- Exactly. - Gosh.

734
00:39:23,981 --> 00:39:25,250
- I'm late. - Come on.

735
00:39:25,251 --> 00:39:27,080
- I need to go grocery shopping. - What's wrong with her.

736
00:39:27,081 --> 00:39:28,251
I...

737
00:39:28,481 --> 00:39:30,320
didn't believe in premarital intimacy...

738
00:39:30,450 --> 00:39:33,021
but got pregnant by accident through artificial insemination.

739
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,421
What?

740
00:39:35,961 --> 00:39:37,021
Pregnant?

741
00:39:38,961 --> 00:39:40,260
Kang Jae!

742
00:39:41,831 --> 00:39:43,770
Woo Ri!

743
00:39:43,771 --> 00:39:45,470
Kang Jae, are you all right?

744
00:39:46,401 --> 00:39:49,340
So your wedding is actually today? Why didn't you tell us?

745
00:39:50,671 --> 00:39:53,110
Found you, my husband.

746
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:57,040
- They're coming out. - Run!

747
00:39:57,041 --> 00:39:59,151
- Hurry! - Over here!

748
00:40:05,251 --> 00:40:07,421
- This is my husband. - Hello.

749
00:40:10,430 --> 00:40:13,830
So? Is he the father of the baby?

750
00:40:13,831 --> 00:40:15,400
Gosh, no.

751
00:40:15,401 --> 00:40:18,000
No? Then what happened after that?

752
00:40:18,001 --> 00:40:19,469
That's...

753
00:40:19,470 --> 00:40:20,840
Excuse me for a moment.

754
00:40:24,271 --> 00:40:27,481
- Hi, Mom. - We're trapped here right now.

755
00:40:27,581 --> 00:40:29,040
We can't even move the car. What do we do?

756
00:40:29,041 --> 00:40:30,910
What? That's...

757
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:35,120
Everyone. You all want to know what happened after that, right?

758
00:40:35,121 --> 00:40:37,489
- Yes! - Yes, tell us!

759
00:40:37,490 --> 00:40:38,550
Okay.

760
00:40:39,351 --> 00:40:41,360
Mom, we have to go that way.

761
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:43,890
- We have to go. Hurry. - My goodness.

762
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:51,000
Is something wrong?

763
00:40:51,001 --> 00:40:53,570
Choi Seoung Il! My gosh, I'm a fan!

764
00:40:53,671 --> 00:40:56,770
- I can't believe this! - Oh, you mean your mother is a fan?

765
00:40:56,771 --> 00:40:59,069
No, me! I'm following you on social media.

766
00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:01,980
- I loved "Daddy Cop"! - My gosh!

767
00:41:01,981 --> 00:41:05,280
I see that all my young fans are here.

768
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:08,050
- Go, Choi Seoung Il! - Come on.

769
00:41:10,521 --> 00:41:12,791
- You got this! - Go, Seoung Il!

770
00:41:16,490 --> 00:41:17,760
You made it.

771
00:41:19,061 --> 00:41:20,500
I don't see the bride.

772
00:41:20,501 --> 00:41:24,131
I know. She'll be a little... A tad late.

773
00:41:24,501 --> 00:41:26,871
Even her wedding is so eventful.

774
00:41:27,570 --> 00:41:30,140
Go on in. The ceremony will begin soon.

775
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:34,680
Excuse me.

776
00:41:36,041 --> 00:41:38,110
- Police. - Okay, what's the matter?

777
00:41:38,381 --> 00:41:40,651
- What's with your hair? - There's nothing wrong with it.

778
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:42,121
I'll have to check your ID.

779
00:41:42,421 --> 00:41:44,251
- I don't have one on me... - Wait!

780
00:41:45,490 --> 00:41:46,691
Whereabouts are they?

781
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:48,890
They're almost here.

782
00:41:49,021 --> 00:41:51,430
- They're coming, right? - Yes, of course.

783
00:41:52,331 --> 00:41:53,430
- All right. - See you inside.

784
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:58,231
Why aren't they here yet? They really should be here by now.

785
00:41:59,331 --> 00:42:00,331
Oh, hello.

786
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:03,910
Please, you need to stop biting your nails.

787
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:06,171
Hi, sweetie.

788
00:42:10,610 --> 00:42:12,250
- Come on! - My goodness.

789
00:42:12,251 --> 00:42:14,851
Gosh, I'm exhausted.

790
00:42:15,121 --> 00:42:17,351
Oh, boy. What is this mess?

791
00:42:17,791 --> 00:42:19,589
Mom, it's here. It's that bus.

792
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:21,759
- Hurry! - Hurry up!

793
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,290
There they are.

794
00:42:23,291 --> 00:42:25,461
- Mom, Grandma, Dad! - Grandma, hurry!

795
00:42:25,561 --> 00:42:27,859
- What? My gosh. - Woo Ri!

796
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:29,929
- Hurry, quick. - Come, this way!

797
00:42:29,930 --> 00:42:32,630
- What's going on? - How did you find this bus?

798
00:42:32,631 --> 00:42:35,171
- Hurry. - Over here. Careful, Grandma.

799
00:42:35,441 --> 00:42:37,410
- Hop on. Ladies first. - Be careful.

800
00:42:38,441 --> 00:42:41,441
- What's going on? - How come they aren't here yet?

801
00:42:42,811 --> 00:42:44,380
Hello, ladies and gentlemen.

802
00:42:44,381 --> 00:42:47,980
The groom, bride, and her family...

803
00:42:47,981 --> 00:42:50,351
are on their way here now.

804
00:42:50,691 --> 00:42:52,291
- They still haven't arrived yet? - They're on their way,

805
00:42:52,921 --> 00:42:57,160
but they'll be a little late due to unforeseeable circumstances.

806
00:42:57,390 --> 00:43:00,291
- Goodness. - This is not good.

807
00:43:02,461 --> 00:43:06,030
The bride was quick to get pregnant but is late to her own wedding.

808
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:19,050
Well, please be patient and wait just a little longer.

809
00:43:22,851 --> 00:43:26,351
Ri Woo, I hope you grow up to be an eloquent speaker.

810
00:43:27,791 --> 00:43:31,160
That's why I decided to marry this man right here.

811
00:43:32,590 --> 00:43:35,700
Oh, my. That's quite a love story.

812
00:43:35,930 --> 00:43:37,130
Congratulations on getting hitched.

813
00:43:37,131 --> 00:43:39,300
- Congratulations. - Thank you.

814
00:43:39,631 --> 00:43:43,371
My gosh, your parents must be incredibly happy for you.

815
00:43:43,771 --> 00:43:46,541
We are happy, but we're late for her wedding.

816
00:43:47,610 --> 00:43:50,110
We're here. We've arrived.

817
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:56,819
- Careful. - Best of luck!

818
00:43:56,820 --> 00:43:59,690
- Good luck! - You got this!

819
00:43:59,691 --> 00:44:01,460
- You got this! - We hope all goes well!

820
00:44:01,461 --> 00:44:03,390
- Go! - You got this!

821
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:07,030
- Go for it! - Best of luck!

822
00:44:07,530 --> 00:44:10,260
Let's go! Oh, boy.

823
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:11,969
(The Wedding of Lee Kang Jae and Oh Woo Ri)

824
00:44:11,970 --> 00:44:14,139
- Hurry. We're here! - We're here!

825
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:15,441
- Here! - We're here.

826
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:17,340
The bride and groom are here too.

827
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:20,909
Oh, nice. They're here.

828
00:44:20,910 --> 00:44:22,880
- You made it! - Congratulations.

829
00:44:22,881 --> 00:44:24,250
- They're here at last. - Oh, my.

830
00:44:24,251 --> 00:44:25,381
Ladies and gentlemen.

831
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:28,521
They're a little late, but they didn't take too long.

832
00:44:28,881 --> 00:44:33,390
Let us begin the ceremony we've all been waiting for.

833
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:39,159
- The groom! - Looking handsome!

834
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:40,800
- Oh, my. - Congratulations!

835
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:44,200
- He's one good-looking groom! - You look dashing!

836
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:19,330
- Congratulations! - The bride looks stunning!

837
00:45:19,331 --> 00:45:20,970
- Oh, my! - Woo Ri!

838
00:45:27,610 --> 00:45:28,640
What a beautiful bride!

839
00:47:27,901 --> 00:47:29,131
Ri Woo.

840
00:47:30,331 --> 00:47:31,970
Your mom looks so beautiful today.

841
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:37,401
I've never seen her looking so stunning.

842
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:04,799
I'll take Ri Woo so you can eat comfortably.

843
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,570
No, it's okay.

844
00:48:06,671 --> 00:48:09,671
She was with her mom for ten months. I still have a long way to go.

845
00:48:09,771 --> 00:48:13,041
Anyway, I have to say I really love having dinner with you here.

846
00:48:13,441 --> 00:48:15,610
It's always been my dream since I was little.

847
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:17,751
Having dinner with the entire family.

848
00:48:17,881 --> 00:48:20,851
You can come and have dinner with us anytime, Ri Woo's daddy.

849
00:48:20,981 --> 00:48:24,320
Mother, you call him "Ri Woo's daddy" now.

850
00:48:24,820 --> 00:48:26,351
I call him Raphael.

851
00:48:27,351 --> 00:48:29,760
I mean, we can't call him our son-in-law.

852
00:48:30,291 --> 00:48:33,090
It's complicated, isn't it?

853
00:48:33,930 --> 00:48:35,300
I think of him as my grandson...

854
00:48:35,601 --> 00:48:38,030
because he's the father of my great-granddaughter.

855
00:48:39,271 --> 00:48:42,140
Then it gets even more complicated because that makes him my son.

856
00:48:42,901 --> 00:48:43,941
Son?

857
00:48:45,711 --> 00:48:48,041
I like that. Son.

858
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:53,381
Father.

859
00:48:55,050 --> 00:48:56,081
Mother.

860
00:48:57,550 --> 00:48:58,590
Grandma.

861
00:49:00,050 --> 00:49:02,561
- So I have a son now? - Yes, you do.

862
00:49:04,930 --> 00:49:08,061
Okay. As of today, we are...

863
00:49:32,450 --> 00:49:35,691
Hello, we have a reservation under Lee Kang Jae.

864
00:49:36,191 --> 00:49:37,890
Just a moment, please.

865
00:50:05,791 --> 00:50:06,890
Well...

866
00:50:09,061 --> 00:50:10,421
Should we turn off the lights?

867
00:50:10,890 --> 00:50:12,461
Oh, right.

868
00:50:12,860 --> 00:50:15,360
- Yes, shall we? - Okay.

869
00:50:23,541 --> 00:50:25,671
Wait, Woo Ri. Hold on.

870
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:27,671
- What? - What is this?

871
00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:29,941
- Oh, wait. - I'm sorry.

872
00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:32,180
- Hold on. - My gosh, hang on.

873
00:50:38,651 --> 00:50:40,820
Yes. Hi, Raphael.

874
00:50:41,121 --> 00:50:42,220
Woo Ri.

875
00:50:43,291 --> 00:50:47,831
I kept debating whether or not to call you.

876
00:50:48,401 --> 00:50:50,501
Okay, what's the matter?

877
00:50:50,660 --> 00:50:53,331
I know you got married today and that you're at the hotel now,

878
00:50:54,700 --> 00:50:56,401
so I wasn't sure whether I should tell you this.

879
00:50:57,001 --> 00:50:58,541
I was really torn.

880
00:50:58,910 --> 00:51:00,941
Okay. What's the matter?

881
00:51:04,010 --> 00:51:08,021
I just thought I'd regret it a lot if I didn't tell you.

882
00:51:08,151 --> 00:51:10,751
What's going on? What is it that you need to tell me?

883
00:51:10,921 --> 00:51:12,021
Well...

884
00:51:12,590 --> 00:51:13,851
Woo Ri.

885
00:51:14,021 --> 00:51:15,421
Yes, go ahead.

886
00:51:18,651 --> 00:51:20,251
Ri Woo is very sick.

887
00:51:24,101 --> 00:51:25,502
- What?

888
00:51:33,196 --> 00:51:34,766
Ri Woo!

889
00:51:35,397 --> 00:51:36,696
Ri Woo, are you all right?

890
00:51:38,167 --> 00:51:39,536
What's wrong with her?

891
00:51:39,636 --> 00:51:41,007
She's short of breath with a high fever.

892
00:51:41,436 --> 00:51:43,536
Thank goodness her father brought her here early enough.

893
00:51:43,735 --> 00:51:46,476
We just have to run some tests, so don't worry.

894
00:51:46,835 --> 00:51:48,275
Please bring her to the treatment room.

895
00:51:50,806 --> 00:51:52,515
Gosh, my baby.

896
00:51:52,516 --> 00:51:54,215
Mommy is here.

897
00:51:55,985 --> 00:51:57,186
Hey, Kang Jae.

898
00:51:57,886 --> 00:51:58,985
I'm really sorry.

899
00:52:00,969 --> 00:52:02,299
No, I'm glad you called us.

900
00:52:03,502 --> 00:52:06,011
(Emergency Treatment Room)

901
00:52:14,179 --> 00:52:15,250
Is she asleep?

902
00:52:15,909 --> 00:52:17,150
She's fast asleep now.

903
00:52:25,190 --> 00:52:27,219
She really looks like an angel when she's asleep.

904
00:52:28,389 --> 00:52:30,089
She looks like an angel even when she's awake.

905
00:52:30,860 --> 00:52:32,100
That's true.

906
00:52:35,469 --> 00:52:36,630
Woo Ri.

907
00:52:38,069 --> 00:52:39,270
I'm really sorry.

908
00:52:39,739 --> 00:52:43,469
I thought long and hard about whether or not to call you.

909
00:52:43,810 --> 00:52:46,279
No, I'm so glad you called me.

910
00:52:46,940 --> 00:52:49,409
If I didn't find out until tomorrow...

911
00:52:49,949 --> 00:52:51,380
I don't even want to think about it.

912
00:52:51,719 --> 00:52:53,119
Thank you for calling me.

913
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:57,219
We promised we wouldn't keep secrets when it comes to Ri Woo.

914
00:52:59,219 --> 00:53:00,420
That's right.

915
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:04,130
Let's share everything, good and bad.

916
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:08,869
We recently had Ri Woo's 100th-day celebration.

917
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:11,999
The 100th day after a child's birth...

918
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,339
is exactly a year after the child's conception.

919
00:53:15,770 --> 00:53:16,909
I must say,

920
00:53:18,009 --> 00:53:20,210
so many things have happened to us in the past year.

921
00:53:21,850 --> 00:53:23,049
I know.

922
00:53:23,449 --> 00:53:26,080
It feels like only yesterday that I found out I was pregnant with her.

923
00:53:26,650 --> 00:53:28,150
I can't believe it's already been a year.

924
00:54:01,049 --> 00:54:02,989
I called her "Gummy Bear".

925
00:54:04,089 --> 00:54:07,290
The day I first met Ri Woo still feels like a dream.

926
00:55:01,549 --> 00:55:02,810
The two of us...

927
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:05,679
managed to make this work.

928
00:55:11,889 --> 00:55:14,489
And I'm glad I could do it with you.

929
00:55:17,529 --> 00:55:20,630
Continue to help me out a lot, Ri Woo's mom.

930
00:55:23,170 --> 00:55:25,839
Help me out too, Ri Woo's dad.

931
00:55:42,690 --> 00:55:45,119
Thank goodness Ri Woo is okay now.

932
00:55:45,989 --> 00:55:47,659
Right, my daughter.

933
00:55:54,299 --> 00:55:56,369
You seem a little more at ease now.

934
00:55:58,139 --> 00:56:00,100
It must've been so stressful, honey.

935
00:56:00,770 --> 00:56:02,170
Thanks, Kang Jae.

936
00:56:02,810 --> 00:56:04,540
- And I'm sorry. - What?

937
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:07,909
Nothing's easy in my books.

938
00:56:08,779 --> 00:56:09,809
What do you mean?

939
00:56:09,810 --> 00:56:11,250
You know what I mean.

940
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:13,150
I was late for my own wedding,

941
00:56:13,319 --> 00:56:14,819
and our first night together was an epic fail.

942
00:56:15,690 --> 00:56:17,250
An epic fail?

943
00:56:18,089 --> 00:56:19,560
It did fail.

944
00:56:20,389 --> 00:56:22,559
To tell you the truth, I was more excited about that...

945
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:24,560
than the wedding ceremony.

946
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:28,600
Woo Ri.

947
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:30,469
Yes?

948
00:56:31,270 --> 00:56:32,440
We did not fail.

949
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:36,770
I said, we didn't fail!

950
00:56:37,909 --> 00:56:39,040
Woo Ri!

951
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:41,850
Failure is the path to success!

952
00:58:11,670 --> 00:58:14,739
Oh, I'm suddenly curious about something.

953
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:17,170
What? What is it?

954
00:58:19,409 --> 00:58:21,009
What was the title of your drama again?

955
00:58:23,009 --> 00:58:24,279
"From Today, We Are".

956
00:58:26,020 --> 00:58:28,250
Does it have a happy ending?

957
00:58:30,489 --> 00:58:31,920
Not sure. Why do you ask?

958
00:58:34,889 --> 00:58:36,560
Because we did.

959
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:39,730
I'm so happy right now.

960
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:43,630
Will it make the viewers as happy as I am?

961
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:48,710
We shall see.
